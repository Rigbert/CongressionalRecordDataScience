Speaker, the U.S. trade deficit continues its relentless spiral upwards. More red ink. More outsourced jobs. More foreign imports. Nothing seems capable of slowing it down, neither the misguided Bush administration policy of forcing down the value of the dollar on global markets, nor a half-hearted, ineffective and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to increase U.S. exports. America wants results, not rhetoric.  According to recent reports, the current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of the trade deficit, reached $193 billion just in the first quarter of this year. Every year the red ink gets deeper. This represents 5.7 percent of our gross domestic product. It is a heavy ball and chain on the economic growth in our country, and it is becoming heavier. The trade deficit in goods in the first quarter surpassed $200 billion, and it dwarfed surpluses in services and income payments.  Although you won't hear it from the economists on the coasts, the gargantuan deficit in goods is a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy in parts of the country such as I represent. We need action in Washington to stop the loss of jobs due to the trade deficit hemorrhage and unfair foreign competition, including the remaining closed markets of the world in first world nations like Japan.  The trade deficit, Mr. Speaker, reveals two fundamental weaknesses in our national economic policy. First is our unforgivable utter dependence on imported petroleum, the primary category of trade deficit. American consumers end up paying twice for the government's failure to declare energy independence, first when they fill up, and second, when their own economy is undermined by the global oil giants working in tandem with the repressive kingdoms of the Middle East and other places.  One would think that our government would have heard the warnings long enough and often enough to take action against our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and I mean real action, like energy independence within a decade.  The President talked about it in his State of the Union speech, but he has not followed up with action. In fact, in his administration we are importing a billion more barrels of petroleum annually from other countries. So we should not be surprised, maybe, considering the President and Vice President are both oil men at heart.  The other weakness revealed by the current account deficit is our failure todevelop a trade policy that makes as its priority the competitiveness of American jobs and American businesses. The government, rather, has pursued a policy that sends manufacturing jobs overseas to third world places like China, which represents a growing share of this red ink. Talk to tool and dye makers in Ohio, those who somehow have survived. Talk to workers in the auto industry or the auto parts sector; they must wonder whether it is the official policy of the United States Government to throw them to the wolves.  Where, they ask, is the policy for making the United States economy competitive here at home in each of the categories where we have lost the edge?  Together, the trade deficit with China from petroleum and from automotive products account for 95 percent of the total, and somebody's got to pay. In order to finance the deficit, Americans are borrowing and selling assets to the tune of approximately $600 billion a year. Anything in your town been put on the chopping block yet? Debt service amounts to approximately $2,000 a year for every working American. We are truly indebted.  Sooner or later somebody has to pay that bill, and the American people know who that somebody is. The Chinese government alone holds enough foreign reserves to purchase about 5 percent of the shares of all publicly traded U.S. companies. The U.S. trade deficit is the main source of that Chinese wealth. Dr. Peter Morici of the University of Maryland has written about the impact of our trade policy on economic growth. He notes that every dollar spent on imports that is not matched by a dollar of exports reduces domestic demand here at home and employment and shifts workers into activities where productivity is lower.  Productivity is at least 50 percent higher in industries that export and compete with imports, and reducing the trade deficit and moving workers into these industries would increase our gross domestic product. If the administration and Congress showed the fortitude to cut the trade deficit, and we're not talking about a balanced trade account, just cutting the deficit by half, the gross domestic product would increase by an estimated $250 billion, or more than $1,700 for every working American. That comes to 1 percent a year due to this halving of the deficit rather than the loss of 1 percent of economic growth every year due to this continuing failed trade policy, which has been in place for at least two decades.  If we could just cut the deficit in half, workers wages could once again keep pace with inflation, families would no longer fall further behind with each passing month, and we would have better jobs, better paying wages and better benefits.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately we will not see that economic growth until our government deals with this trade deficit and stops the hemorrhage. That would require political courage. I would sure like to see some of it here in this town.U.S. Records $193 Billion First Quarter Current Account Deficit Taxing                               U.S. Growth                           (By Peter Morici)       Today, the Commerce Department reported the first quarter      current account deficit was $192.6 billion, up from $187.9      billion in the fourth quarter.       The deficit was 5.7 percent of GDP. The consensus forecast      was $203 billion, and my published forecast was 195.8.       The current account is the broadest measure of the U.S.      trade balance. In addition to trade in goods and services, it      includes income received from U.S. investments abroad less      payments to foreigners on their investments in the United      States.       In the first quarter, the United States had a $24.1 billion      surplus on trade in services and a $10.4 billion surplus on      income payments. This was hardly enough to offset the massive      $200.9 billion deficit on trade in goods.       The huge deficit on trade in goods is caused by a      combination of an overvalued dollar against the Chinese yuan,      a dysfunctional national energy policy that increases U.S.      dependence on foreign oil, and the competitive woes of the      three domestic automakers. Together, the trade deficit with      China and on petroleum and automotive products account for      about 95 percent of the deficit on trade in goods and      services.       To finance the current account deficit, Americans are      borrowing and selling assets at a pace of about $600 billion      a year. U.S. foreign debt exceeds $6 trillion, and the debt      service comes to about $2,000 a year for every working      American.       A significant share of these funds was loaned to Americans      by foreign governments. China and other governments loaned      Americans more than 4.3 percent of GDP.       The current account deficit imposes a significant tax on      GDP growth by moving workers from export and import-competing      industries to other sectors of the economy. This reduces      labor productivity, research and development (R) spending,      and important investments in human capital. In 2007 the trade      deficit is slicing about $250 billion off GDP, and longer      term, it reduces potential annual GDP growth to 3 percent      from 4 percent.                         Financing the Deficit       The current account deficit must be financed by a capital      account surplus, either by foreigners investing in the U.S.      economy or loaning Americans money. Some analysts argue that      the deficit reflects U.S. economic strength, because      foreigners find many promising investments here. The details      of U.S. financing belie this argument.       In the first quarter, U.S. investments abroad were $420.8      billion, while foreigners invested $623.6 billion in the      United States. Of that latter total, only $23.5 billion or      less. than 4 percent was direct investment in U.S. productive      assets. The remaining capital inflows were foreign purchases      of Treasury securities, corporate bonds, bank accounts,      currency, and other paper assets. Essentially, Americans      borrowed $600 billion to consume 5.7 percent more than they      produced.       Foreign governments loaned Americans $147.8 billion or 4.3      percent of GDP. That well exceeded net household borrowing to      finance homes, cars, gasoline, and other consumer goods. The      Chinese and other governments are essentially bankrolling      U.S. consumers, who in turn are mortgaging their children's      income.       The cumulative effects of this borrowing are frightening.      The total external debt now exceeds $6 trillion. The debt      service at 5 percent interest, amounts to $2000 for each      working American.       The Chinese government alone holds enough U.S. and other      foreign reserves to purchase about five percent of the shares      of all publicly trade U.S. companies. The U.S. trade deficit      is the primary driver behind this phenomenon.                    Consequences for Economic Growth       High and rising trade deficits tax economic growth.      Specifically, each dollar spent on imports that is not      matched by a dollar of exports reduces domestic demand and      employment, and shifts workers into activities where      productivity is lower.       Productivity is at least 50 percent higher in industries      that export and compete with imports, and reducing the trade      deficit and moving workers into these industries would      increase GDP.       Were the trade deficit cut in half, GDP would increase by      about $250 billion or more than $1,700 for every working      American. Workers' wages would not be lagging inflation, and      ordinary working Americans would more easily find jobs paying      higher wages and offering decent benefits.       Manufacturers are particularly hard hit by this subsidized      competition. Through recession and recovery, the      manufacturing sector has lost 3.2 million jobs since 2000.      Following the pattern of past economic recoveries, the      manufacturing sector should have regained about 2 million of      those jobs, especially given the very strong productivity      growth accomplished in durable goods and throughout      manufacturing.       Longer-term, persistent U.S. trade deficits are a      substantial drag on growth. U.S. import-competing and export      industries spend three-times the national average on      industrial R, and encourage more investments in skills and      education than other sectors of the economy. By shifting      employment away from trade-competing industries, the trade      deficit reduces U.S. investments in new methods and products,      and skilled labor.       Cutting the trade deficit in half would boost U.S. GDP      growth by one percentage point a year, and the trade deficits      of the last two decades have reduced U.S. growth by one      percentage point a year.       Lost growth is cumulative. Thanks to the record trade      deficits accumulated over the last 10 years, the U.S. economy      is about $1.5 trillion smaller. This comes to about $10,000      per worker.       Had the Administration and the Congress acted responsibly      to reduce the deficit, American workers would be much better      off, tax revenues would be much larger, and the Federal      deficit could be eliminated without cutting spending.       The damage grows larger each month, as the Bush      administration dallies and ignores the corrosive consequences      of the trade deficit.                          ____________________
