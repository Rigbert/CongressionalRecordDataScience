Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, and I will submit today's column in The Wall Street Journal written by Dr. David A. Shaywitz, an endocrinologist in stem cell research at Harvard, for the Record. I would call to the attention of my colleagues this column and particularly a couple of lines that he wrote today. I must say that I am one that will be voting for both bills today, the cord bill as well as the Castle/DeGette bill; but as you compare these two bills, let me note a couple of things that this noted researcher says.  He says: ``Presently, only the few lines established prior to the date,'' this is in reference to the President's initial plan back in 2001, ``are eligible for government support, a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on researchers in this emerging field.'' It further says, it relates to the cord bill, in essence: ``It seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or bloodcells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood.''  Mr. Speaker, there are few families that I know that have not been impacted by a myriad of these diseases. We need help. We need to find a cure, and that is why we need to support both pieces of legislation this afternoon.                          The Stem Cell Debate                         (By David A. Shaywitz)       Perhaps themost underrated achievement of the modern      conservative movement has been a renewed appreciation for the      danger of ``junk science''--unsubstantiated scientific      research that is exploited for political gain. How sad, then,      that in the ongoing debate over stem cell research, many      conservatives have chosen to abandon their well-founded      skepticism and to embrace dubious but convenient data for the      sake of advancing their cause.       The latest tempest has emerged from remarkably modest      congressional legislation, proposed by Republican Michael      Castle and Democrat Diana DeGette and scheduled for a vote      today, which would permit federal funds to be used on human      embryonic stem cell lines derived after Aug. 9, 2001.      Presently, only the few lines established prior to this date      are eligible for government support, a prohibition that has      had a crippling effect on research in this emerging field.       Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop      into any adult cell type. If this process of specialization      could be achieved in the lab, scientists might be able to      create replacement pancreas cells for diabetics, or neurons      for patient with Parkinson's Disease; these treatments are      likely many years away.       For some opponents of embryonic stem cell science, the      argument is fundamentally one of faith: The human embryo      should be held as sacrosanct, and not used for the pursuit of      any ends, regardless of how nobly intended. The trouble for      such dogmatic critics of embryonic stem cell research is that      most Americans hold a less extreme position; given a choice      between discarding frozen, excess embryos from in vitro      fertilization clinics or allowing the cells to be used for      medical research--specifically, the generation of new      embryonic stem cell lines--most of us would choose the      second. Consequently, conservative stem cell opponents have      now begun to argue in earnest that embryonic stem cell      research is not just morally wrong, but also unnecessary, an      argument that relies on suspect science and appears motivated      by even more questionable principles.       First, the science: Opponents of the Castle-DeGette      legislation assert that embryonic stem cells are unnecessary      because adult stem cells, as well as umbilical cord blood      stem cells, will perform at least as well as embryonic stem      cells, and have already demonstrated their therapeutic value.      This argument appears very popular, and has been articulated      by almost every member of Congress who has spoken out against      the new stem cell bill.       To be sure, one of the great successes of modern medicine      has been the use of adult blood stem cells to treat patients      with leukemia. The trouble is generalizing from this: There      are very strong data suggesting that while blood stem cells      are good at making new blood cells, they are not able to turn      into other types of cells, such as pancreas or brain. The      limited data purported to demonstrate the contrary are      preliminary, inconclusive, unsubstantiated, or all three.      Thus, it seems extremely unlikely that adult bloodcells--or      blood cells from the umbilical cord--will be therapeutically      useful as a source of anything else by blood.       Moreover, while stem cells seem to exist for some cell      types in the body--the blood and the intestines, for      example--many adult tissues such as the pancreas, may not      have stem cells at all. Thus, relying on adult stem cells to      generate replacement insulin-producing cells for patients      with diabetes is probably an exercise in futility.       For true believers, of course, these scientific facts      should be beside the point; if human embryonic stem cell      research is morally, fundamentally, wrong, then it should be      wrong, period, regardless of the consequences to medical      research. If conservatives believe their own rhetoric, they      should vigorously critique embryonic stem cell research on      its own grounds, and not rely upon an appeal to utilitarian      principles.       Instead, there has been a concerted effort to establish      adult stem cells as a palatable alternative to embryonic stem      cells. In the process, conservatives seem to have left their      usual concern for junk science at the laboratory door, citing      in their defense preliminary studies and questionable data      that they would surely--and appropriately--have ridiculed      were it not supporting their current point of view. In fact,      there is little credible evidence to suggest adult stem cells      have the same therapeutic potential as embryonic stem cells.      Conservatives often speak of the need to abide by difficult      principle; acknowledging the limitations of adult stem cell      research would seem like a good place to start.       Human embryonic stem cell research represents one of the      most important scientific frontiers, and also one of the most      controversial: Our national debate on it deserves to be      informed by our loftiest ethical aspirations--but also      grounded in our most rigorous scientific standards.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to the time on all sides?
