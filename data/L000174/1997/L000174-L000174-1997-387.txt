I wish also to compliment my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for his help in doing this. I also wish to compliment Senators who paid attention to his very, very strong statement at the end of this debate on behalf of Judge Garland. I think that the Senator from Utah and I are committed to trying to move, in a bipartisan fashion, to get these judges here. I hope all Senators will join us in doing that. The Federal judiciary should not be held hostage to partisan, petty, or ideological constraints that really reflect only a minority of views.  The Federal judiciary is really a blessing in our democracy in the fact that it is so independent. Our Federal judiciary is the envy of all the rest of the world. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I are committed to keeping it that way. We will work together to keep it that way. I thank him for his help on this nomination.
