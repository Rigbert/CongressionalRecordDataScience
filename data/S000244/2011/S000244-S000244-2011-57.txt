Chair, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone in this Chamber that America is the greatest country the world has ever known. America has the most innovative people and continues to be a lure to others seeking greater opportunities and a better and brighter life in the largest and most spectacular economy in the world.  I'm sure many of us know the story of something else that was considered to be the largest and most spectacular thing the world has ever seen. It was considered to be UNSINKABLE. While there has been a lot of talk about America's ``Sputnik moment,'' I think we should be as focused on the possibility of facing America's TITANIC moment, today being the 99th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic.  It may be a coincidence that we are debating America's future on this anniversary However, we must keep this disaster in mind as we debate America's fiscal future, Mr. Chair, because unsinkable ships do sink! If we do not pass Chairman Ryan's budget then America will continue down a path that will sink the most vibrant economy that has served as a beacon for people looking for a brighter future.                          ____________________
