 President, I listened to the distinguished Democratic leader and find that I agree with much of what he said. This may not be a perfect bill, but clearly there are positive and negative features to the bill.  I worked a year ago, and through an individual's help, was able to run the numbers with respect to a prescription drug plan and tried to make them come in within $400 billion and found it to be extraordinarily difficult. In my view, the most positive feature of this bill is that it delivers voluntary prescription drug coverage to this Nation's Medicare beneficiaries. I find the low-income benefits of this bill to be one of its biggest strengths. It is better than anything we ran that came in at $400 billion or below last year.
