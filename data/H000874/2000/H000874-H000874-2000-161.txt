Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I share the chairman's concern, as I expressed in the last amendment, about the offset. However, this is much less of an offset of a relatively modest number. I was trying to glean carefully what the chairman was saying. I am not going to oppose this amendment. I think the gentleman's amendment is a worthwhile objective.  Again, I am hopeful that we will get the requisite number of dollars so wecan, in addition to the dollars the gentleman is seeking, which are relatively modest for this objective, we can add back into the Inspector General so we do not underfund that, because the chairman is absolutely correct, we cannot further decrease this account.
