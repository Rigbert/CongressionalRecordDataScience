 President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, to introduce legislation that will promote the American dream of homeownership.  Our legislation will specify that providing homeownership down payment assistance to American families constitutes a charitable activity under the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.  As the cornerstone of middle-class wealth in our nation, we should be doing everything possible to promote broad investment in owner-occupied housing. Today, we have that chance.  It should not be a surprise that homeownership among low to moderate income families is lower than for those with higher incomes. The single biggest obstacle to achieving this dream is the lack of a downpayment.  Across America there are organizations that assist low to moderate income families with that first important step toward homeownership. In California, one of these groups, the Nehemiah Corporation, helps literally thousands of families each year by providing down payments.  While the Federal Government provides tax incentives for increased homeownership, we should make it easier for the private sector to provide their own brand of incentives. Importantly, this legislation will do several things to ensure that the private sector continues to have the tools it needs to provide this important assistance.  One, our legislation will specify that homeownership down payment assistance to American families constitutes a charitable activity.  Currently, Internal Revenue Service regulations do not clearly address the special circumstances of those organizations that provide downpayment assistance to families.  Two, our bill is structured to ensure that a charitable down payment assistance program is not used to support the purchase of rental properties or expensive homes.  Three, our legislation is designed so that the taxpayers do not pick-up the tab. Since, home sellers often contribute to charitable down payment assistance providers in connection with the sale of a home, those contributions are not charitable in nature; they are an expense related to selling a home.  This legislation clarifies that a party to a home sale transaction may not claim a charitable contribution deduction for a contribution to a down payment assistance organization made in connection with the sale.  And, although Internal Revenue Service regulations do not specifically address down payment assistance programs, our legislation merely codifies current practice.  This legislation will ensure the continued growth of this essential segment of the financial services market at no cost to the taxpayers.  And, as my friend from Pennsylvania has said, equity in homes is the leading source for collateral for small business start-up borrowing.  At a time when the economy still fails to produce jobs, the expansion of small business and the employment they provide is essential to the health of our economy.  It is a win-win situation in the truest sense of the term and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
