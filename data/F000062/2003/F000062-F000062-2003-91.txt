 President, this amendment essentially updates the definition of ``medical information.'' It takes a medical definition submitted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. It is the definition that is used by a majority of our States. I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of this definition from the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the California Medical Association, the Community Clinic Consortium, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, and the AIDS Health Care Foundation be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 American Medical Association,                                    Chicago, IL, November 3, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Medical      Association (AMA), we applaud you for your amendment that      would improve the medical privacy protections in the National      Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003 (S.      1753).       Your amendment would strengthen the protections in S. 1753      restricting the sharing of medical information for      employment, credit or insurance purposes, by broadening the      definition of ``medical information'' to ensure that it      covers all patient information held by physicians and other      health care providers, including mental and behavioral health      information.       Thank you for your efforts to protect sensitive patient      information in this important legislation.           Sincerely,     Michael D. Maves, MD, MBA.                                  ____                                      American Cancer Society,                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Cancer      Society and its millions of volunteers and supporters, we      applaud your efforts to protect patient medical information      from improper use or disclosure by employers, insurers or      creditors.       Many cancer patients and their families are concerned about      the privacy of information relating to their medical care,      especially with the increasing use of electronic payments and      data keeping. As a result, the American Cancer Society      supports a definition of medical information that allows      medical research to advance, while at the same time, protects      the rights and needs of patients and their family members.            Sincerely,      Daniel E. Smith,        National Vice President, Federal and State Government      Relations.      Wendy K. D. Selig,         Vice-President, Legislative Affairs.                                  ____                               California Medical Association,                                 Sacramento, CA, October 31, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the California Medical      Association and its 35,000 member physicians, we support your      efforts to protect patient medical information from improper      use or disclosure by employers, insurers or creditors.       Many patients and their families are concerned about the      privacy information relating to medical care, especially with      the increasing use of electronic payments and data keeping.      We support a tight definition of medical information of when      such information could be used. Your language accomplishes      this while at the same time allowing appropriate utilization      for research purposes.       Please let us know if we can do more to support your      efforts.           Sincerely,                                               Steven M. Thompson,     Vice President, Government Relations.                                  ____                                       San Francisco Community                                            Clinic Consortium,                              San Francisco, CA, October 31, 2003.     Re The San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium Supports S.          1753, the Medical Information Privacy Amendment to the          Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The San Francisco Community Clinic      Consortium--an organization of neighborhood health centers      serving 66,000 low-income and uninsured San Franciscans--     strongly supports the passage of S. 1753, the Medical      Information Privacy Amendment to FCRA.       The vague definition of ``medical information'' in FCRA      creates loopholes in FCRA protection that could prove harmful      to people like our clinic clients with stigmatized diseases      like mental illness, HIV/AIDS and long-term chronic      conditions. S. 1753 corrects the potential problems and      provides the more complete protections that people deserve.       S. 1753 would clarify and strengthen FCRA's definition of      medical information. It would also eliminate the false      distinction between medical information and medical      transaction information. This new definition is critical to      protecting the privacy of individuals with chronic illnesses.      Even the possibility of breaches of patient medical record      confidentiality undermines health care. Patients who know      their medical care information could and would be shared with      employers, credit organizations and insurance companies will      be less forthcoming with their health care providers and,      thus, the quality of health care they receive will be      compromised; this is neither necessary nor desirable.       SFCCC looks forward to continuing to work with you to      protect the essential privacy of individuals' medical and      health status information; this is a cornerstone of effective      health care. Please call (415 345-4233)     if you need additional information or assistance on this      matter.           Sincerely,                                                    John Gressman,     President/CEO.                                  ____                                San Francisco AIDS Foundation,                              San Francisco, CA, October 29, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The San Francisco AIDS Foundation      strongly supports the passage of S. 1753, the Medical      Information Privacy Amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting      Act (FCRA). While the FCRA attempts to protect consumers from      having their medical information used for employment, credit      or insurance purposes, the vague definition of ``medical      information'' in FCRA creates loopholes in the protection      that would prove harmful to people living with HIV/AIDS,      mental illness and other stigmatized diseases. S. 1753      rectifies the problems in the underlying legislation and      provides the protections these consumers require and deserve.       The current definition of medical information in FCRA does      not protect the information consumers would supply on      documents such as life insurance applications, which ask what      medications a consumer is taking. Nor does FCRA protect      information obtained without consent. A specific example of      this is the reporting of unpaid medical bills from HIV      clinics. FCRA does not protect consumers from banks data      mining its customers' medical payment transactions to make      credit decisions. The majority of U.S. bankruptcies are due      to health care costs, which give banks an incentive to      determine a customer's creditworthiness based on health. The      ties between insurance companies and banks are continuously      strengthened as large banks often have hundreds of      affiliates, many of whom are also insurance companies. As      insurance companies move to electronic forms of payments,      they are giving banks large amounts of medical transaction      data about their clients. This may include the type of clinic      and specific service delivered.       S. 1753 would clarify and strengthen FCRA's definition of      medical information and eliminate the false distinction      between medical information and medical transaction      information. This new definition is essential for people      living with HIV/AIDS because it provides them with financial      privacy. After more than 20 years of dealing with the      epidemic, there is still significant cultural stigma attached      to HIV disease. Potential disclosure of medical information      and breaches in financial privacy create additional health      care access barriers. It is therefore essential that the      confidentiality of ones health status and medical information      be protected from inappropriate use in employment, credit or      insurance purposes.       The AIDS Foundation looks forward to working with you to      promote medical information privacy and health status      confidentiality. Please do not hesitate to call at 415-487-     3096.           Sincerely,                                                   Ernest Hopkins,     Director of Federal Affairs.                                  ____                                   AIDS Healthcare Foundation,                                Los Angeles, CA, November 3, 2003.     Re Letter of support for privacy amendment to S. 1753.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein:       AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) would like to thank you      for sponsoring a legislative amendment to the Fair Credit      Reporting Act that will protect the privacy of personal      medical information in the form of payments for medical      services and products and other transactions. As the United      States' largest AIDs organization, and provider of medical      care to over 12,000 persons in the U.S., AHF is acutely aware      of the need to protect consumers from unauthorized use of      data pertaining to their medical treatment. Such information      is clearly private, and it is highly inappropriate for it to      be used for marketing or similar purposes. Such an abuse can      only erode the trust patients have in their medical providers      and the medical system in general. Thank you, again, for      sponsoring this amendment, which AHF is happy to support.           Sincerely,                                                  Clint Trout,                                    Associate Director, Government     Affairs-Federal.                                  ____                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We applaud you for your efforts to      strengthen and improve the medical privacy protections      containd in your amendment to expand the definition of      ``medical information'' under The National Consumer Credit      Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003 (S. 1753).       Although the original bill's medical privacy section      includes significant new consumer protections that black-out      the use of medical information for employment, credit, or      insurance purposes, it includes an inadequate definition of      the term ``medical information,'' which could result in      creating a loophole that weakens the bill's intended      objective. By describing ``medical information'' using the      National Association of Insurance Commissioner's (NAIC)      definition, which has been agreed upon and implemented by      insurance regulators in a vast majority of states, your      amendment closes existing loopholes and eliminates the      opportunity for unscrupulous use of sensitive medical      information.       We also support your amendment because it eliminates the      inconsistent differentiation between medical information and      medical transaction information, providing greater certainty      to the bill's language and to future interpretations of      legislative intent. This would be a marked improvement to the      underlying bill's definition of medical information, which as      currently written does not protect mental or behavioral      health information, data provided by consumers on life      insurance applications, or medical information obtained      without consent, such as the reporting of an unpaid bill from      a cancer center. We believe the effect of these harmful      oversights can be negated by passage of your amendment.       As you know, millions of consumers worry that their health      providers or insurers may be sharing their private      information with others. Beyond this concern, however, is a      feeling that they have less and less control over their      sensitive medical files. Medical information should have no      place in employment decisions or credit determinations and      related corporate entities should not be able to share it--     this information deserves the strongest protection under the      law, but beyond that, it is important that we give consumers      back some control over who can and cannot use this      information.       Both the National Consumer Credit Reporting System      Improvement Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions      Act, recently passed by the House of Representatives, contain      landmark provisions protecting consumers' private medical      information. This amendment builds upon these strides by      correcting important deficiencies in the Senate bill, and we      strongly urge its adoption by the Senate and its inclusion in      the legislation that emerges from the Conference Committee.      Again, we congratulate you on your thoughtful and bipartisan      amendment, and wish you success in its passage on the Senate      floor later this week.           Sincerely,     Rahm Emanuel,       Member of Congress.     Walter B. Jones,       Member of Congress.
