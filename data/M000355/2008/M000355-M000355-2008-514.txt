 President, I wanted to take a moment to explain the next vote. The President indicated over the weekend that he would veto a 30-day extension. We have been dealing with this issue for almost a year. We have in the Rockefeller-Bond proposal a bipartisan compromise that came out of Intelligence 13 to 2. There is no need for a 30-day extension. But even if there were, you wouldn't get a 30-day extension by adding it to this bill. It is extremely important to oppose the 30-day extension. We know it won't become law on this bill. It wouldn't become law if it were passed freestanding, because the President would veto it. We may be talking about a very short-term extension here in the next few days, but we are still on FISA after today. We will not get off FISA until we make some determination of how we are going to dispose of this important measure.  I urge all my colleagues to vote against cloture on the 30-day extension amendment.
