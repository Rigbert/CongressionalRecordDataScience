President, the world is facing a global food crisis, and it is growing worse by the day. Each morning, we see a new front-page headline reminding us of the urgency of the situation. It threatens not only the health and survival of millions of poor people around the globe, many of them children, but it also threatens the stability of governments in some parts of the world where hunger and food shortages are most acute. It threatens global security and even our own national security.
