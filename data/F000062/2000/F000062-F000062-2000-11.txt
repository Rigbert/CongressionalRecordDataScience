 President, I rise today to recognize California's participants in the Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad for their outstanding efforts and accomplishments. I am so proud of their performances and the dignity with which they carried themselves.  This year, the United States had another spectacular Games, and I am particularly pleased that Californians had much to do with our success. Some of this year's most memorable moments involved athletes from California: Marion Jones was the first woman ever to medal in five track and field events, Sean Burroughs helped our baseball team snatch gold from a heavily favored Cuban Team, Eric Fonoimoana and Dain Blanton won gold in the beach volleyball tournament, Venus Williams was the second woman ever to win gold medals in both singles and doubles tennis, and Lisa Leslie led the women's basketball team to its 34th Olympic championship.  The Olympics have long been the world's premiere stage where athletes compete; their performances are inspiring and, sometimes, heart-breaking. And while the world enjoys two weeks of drama and intense competition, we must remember that these athletes have chased their Olympic dreams for years, even decades, with perseverance and courage. I thank each athlete--qualifier and medal winner alike--for giving us the privilege of witnessing their triumphs. Each performance was a very personal moment in these athletes' lives, and I am inspired by their courage and resolve to pursue their Olympic dreams. These athletes competed with all their heart and they make California proud.
