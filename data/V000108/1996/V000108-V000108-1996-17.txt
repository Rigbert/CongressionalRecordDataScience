Speaker, it is my great honor to commend the Circles of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana. This distinguished organization is holding its fourth annual benefit at St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago, IN this Sunday, October 6, 1996.  The Circles of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana is the combined effort of four separate Circles of Serbian Sisters organizations, each of which contains about 200 members. The presidents of the Circles of Serbian Sisters are: Ms. Helen Tezich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago; Ms. Natalie Tieca, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville; Ms. Ann Rudman, from St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville; and Ms. Milica Bodrozic, from St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville.  Four years ago, these organizations unified to assemble this humanitarian fundraiser in order to provide aid to orphaned and refugee children in the former Yugoslavia. Last year alone, the Circles of Serbian Sisters sent over 7,000 packages and vaccines to these displaced children, who are forced to live in refugee camps and shelters. These individually wrapped packages consisted of underwear, sweat suits, and candy. Circles of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana works with the International Orthodox Christian Charities and the Serbian Orthodox Church in the former Yugoslavia.  Four priests, who have supported this effort from the very beginning are: Father Steve Kovaceivich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago; the Very Reverend Father Milan Savich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville; the Arch Priest John Todorovich, from St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church; and Father Lazar Kostur, from St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Church.  The following distinguished clergymen from the Serbian Orthodox Church have sent their blessings for the event Metro Bishop Irney--Kovacevich--Serbian Orthodox Hierarch of the New Granica Metropolitinate, seated in Third Lake, IL; His Eminence Metropolitan Christopher--Kovacevich--Serbian Orthodox Hierarch for Midwestern America, seated in Libertyville, IL; and His Grace Bishop Sava--Jurich--Serbian Orthodox Bishop of Australia and New Zealand, Surrogate Bishop to His Holiness Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle, administrator of the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of USA and Canada.  During this year's banquet, which is held at a different church each year, two sisters, Ms. Millica Bodrozic and Mara Dobrijevich, who have been involved in this movement from the very beginning, will describe what they experienced as they traveled to the former Yugoslavia to deliver the aid packages. Thank you notes from the orphaned children will also be read during this benefit.  Mr. Speaker, during this sad time in the former Yugoslavia, the mission of the Circles of Serbian Sisters offers renewed hope in the humanity of all people. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Circles of Serbian Sisters and wishing them well on their fourth annual banquet, as well as the continued success of their humanitarian efforts.                          ____________________
