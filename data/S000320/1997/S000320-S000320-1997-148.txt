 President, as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to briefly state my views on the Warner amendment.  Let me first make it clear that I represent a donor State. From 1992 to 1995, Alabama only received about 78 cents back for every dollar it sent to Washington in gasoline taxes. Other States, like Massachusetts for example, received about $2\1/2\ back for every dollar paid in gas taxes.
