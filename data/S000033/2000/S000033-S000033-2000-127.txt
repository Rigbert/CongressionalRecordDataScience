 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Progressive Caucus budget. Unlike the Republicans, progressives understand and have developed a budget which addresses the reality that millions of Americans today are working longer hours for lower wages; that this country has, by far, the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the industrialized world; and that, while the wealthiest people have never had it so good, 20 percent of our children live in poverty, 44 million Americans lack health insurance, and millions more are unable to afford the prescription drugs they need.  This budget understands that many in the middle class are going deeply into debt to be able to send their kids to college and that we must significantly increase funding for education so that every child has the opportunity to succeed.  This budget understands that we do not need to give tax breaks to billionaires, spend huge sums of money on wasteful and unneeded weapons systems, or provide multinational corporations with $125 billion a year in corporate welfare.  Mr. Chairman, the progressive budget addresses two particular outrages that this Congress must deal with. First, we significantly increase funding for the veterans of this country who have put their lives on the line to defend this Nation, and we are proud to do that.  Secondly, this budget in a meaningful way begins to address the horrific Medicare cuts brought about by the so-called Balanced Budget Act of 1997, cuts which have caused terrible reductions in services for the elderly, in hospitals, home health care agencies, and nursing homes.
