Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the Original GI Bill, the first legislation of its kind establishing educational assistance for our nation's veterans. Seventy years ago this week, on June 22, 1944, Congress enacted the Servicemen's Readjustment Act and introduced a new veterans benefits program that continues to this day. The GI Bill has had, and continues to have, an incredible impact--opening doors for servicemembers and their families and benefiting society as a whole.   Our nation has a strong history of ensuring those who fight in defense of our freedom have access to career-enhancing, educational benefits. The GI Bill not only provides veterans with the tools to transition from our military force to our workforce, it is sound and valuable investment that collectively benefits our society.   I have long believed that the post-World War II education benefits created the modern middle class. Because of the GI Bill, millions of veterans who have defended the American Dream are achieving--and sustaining--it.   In 2001, when I became chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, one of my major legislative priorities was to modernize and expand the GI Bill. I wrote and Congress enacted the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act (P.L. 107-103) which at that time provided the largest increase in GI Bill benefits since World War II.   Prior to passage of my legislation, veterans receiving the maximum benefit under the Montgomery GI Bill received $24,000 toward their degree. The benefit was terribly under-utilized as eligible vets were declining to participate because the benefit was too small to make a difference in the cost of college. We had the foresight to adjust this benefit for inflation, ensuring that the value of the benefit would keep pace if the cost of college increased. The maximum benefit is now $59,328.   The GI Bill can be used for a variety of education and training opportunities--including certificate programs, post-secondary degrees, and work-study programs, including the successful Helmets to Hard Hats apprenticeship program--that can boost both marketability and earning potential for veterans.   And now that we have an all-volunteer military that is smaller and highly trained, it is critical we have good benefits that attract and retain quality young people into our armed services.   We remain in awe of their bravery and are humbled by the selfless sacrifice of our nation's veterans. Accordingly, Congress again beefed up GI Bill benefits in 2008 with passage of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act (P.L. 110-252), putting a college degree within reach for men and women who have been called to active duty since September 11, 2001.   Each year more and more veterans benefit from this program and the Post-9/11 GI Bill combined with the continued funding increases yielded from my law will hopefully give every veteran the ability to take full advantage of all the GI bill has to offer.                          ____________________
