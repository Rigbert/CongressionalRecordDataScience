 I urge my colleagues to vote for the conference report.  Today is a monumental day for the United States Senate. After 22 months of hard work, we are finally ready to vote, and hopefully overwhelmingly approve, election reform legislation. The House-Senate conference committee has presented this body with an outstanding piece of legislation.  This conference report will usher in tremendous improvements to the elections process across this country and the Federal Government will share the costs. Through the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission, States will receive the best objective information on improving election systems.  The conference report will ensure that those who are legally registered and eligible to vote are able to do so, and do so only once. The new requirements for the creation of statewide voter registration databases, voter registration and mail-in registrants voting for the first times are the core of the new protections against fraudulent registration and fraudulent voting.  I thank the State and local organizations that have been there with us from the beginning and a special thank you to Doug Lewis from the Election Center. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of those organizations whose expertise and support was invaluable throughout the process.
