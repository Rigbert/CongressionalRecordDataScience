 President, the COPS Program: $163 million. This amendment will take it up to what it has historically been for the last 8 or 9 years, about $1.16 billion. At the time we are cutting back FBI agents, we have cut the violent crime task forces, FBI agents no longer do interstate bank robbery, car thefts, et cetera. All local municipalities are in a hole. Everyone is in trouble. Deficits are high. We are worried about terrorism. The first guy who is going to run across a Bin Laden-type figure is not one wearing night vision goggles with the Special Forces. It could be a cop.  We are cutting back on homeland defense, local law enforcement. There has been an 83-percent cut from the COPS level we just approved in the omnibus bill just weeks ago. This will provide for 4,400 more cops at the very time--think about this--the entire FBI is 11,000 FBI agents. We are talking about adding 4,400 cops.  The COPS Program has worked. No one has a cogent argument as to why it has not worked. I urge adoption of the amendment.
