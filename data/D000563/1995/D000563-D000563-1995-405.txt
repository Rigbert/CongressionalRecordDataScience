I think in some areas you have to draw lines where you can go too far. I don't argue that you can.  Let me say to the gentleman, I think many times what the Republican Party misses is that aspect of our Federal Government which talks about the common good. The common good in many instances requires us all to basically give up some of our power and authority so as a nation we are doing the right thing.  I am sure the gentleman would agree that that is something that is very important to our country, and yet it seems the Republicans are so troubled by that that they would push through this unfunded mandate bill so quickly and so extreme that when you sit down and apply it to specific instances, it just doesn't make sense.
