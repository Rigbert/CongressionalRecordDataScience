President, words and numbers are often used on this floor to describe the ongoing war in Iraq. In recent weeks, we have found ourselves debating the policy decisions that created the current climate in Iraq, the current strategy in Baghdad, and the policy shifts that need to occur to bring our men and women home. We frequently cite the fast-rising numbers of military fatalities and injuries and the growing number of innocent civilian deaths.  A central element of this picture and of this discussion should always be the sacrifices and the suffering of the families at home. Vermont, small State that we are, bears the burden of the highest fatality rate in the country, with more deaths per capita in Iraq than any other State. These losses have left dozens of families searching for comfort as they mourn their loved ones.  But in the darkest and saddest of times, a new Vermont family has emerged, brought together by the efforts of students at Norwich University, the Nation's oldest military college, which calls Northfield, VT, its home. ``Vermont Fallen,'' developed and produced by students at Norwich for a media course, profiles the journeys of families from across our State as they grieve the loss of their sons, fathers, husbands, and friends. Many of these families, brought together by community screenings of the documentary, now are able to turn to each other for comfort.  With this remarkable project, these students from Norwich University--many of whom have friends, family, and colleagues serving on the front lines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--have given a great gift to these families and to us all. They have honored in this special way those from Vermont who have fallen and they have offered a glimpse into the searing and highly personal grief and mourning that have touched thousands of American families and scores of American communities, across Vermont and across the country. They have produced a tribute that speaks directly to each human heart.  NBC's ``Today'' recently aired a segment about ``Vermont Fallen.'' I ask unanimous consent that the transcript be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                        NBC's Today--May 9, 2007Class project by students at Norwich University pays tribute to Vermont                  soldiers lost in Iraq and Afghanistan       ANCHORS: DAVID GREGORY       REPORTERS: DAWN FRATANGELO       DAVID GREGORY, co-host:       Vermont has lost more soldiers per capita in Iraq than any      other state. Now students at Vermont's Norwich University,      the nation's oldest military academy, are paying tribute in a      unique way. Here's NBC's Dawn Fratangelo.       (Beginning of clip of ``Vermont Fallen'')       Unidentified Woman #1: I screamed and said, `No, not Eric.      My only boy.'       Unidentified Woman #2: Colonel Williams told me immediately      that Mark didn't make it.       (End of clip)       DAWN FRATANGELO reporting:       Three of them were named Mark. There were also three      Chrises. Half of them were under the age of 24. They are the      Vermont fallen, 25 men from this small state killed in Iraq      and Afghanistan. Now, subjects of a powerful documentary told      through the shattered families left behind.       Unidentified Man: (From ``Vermont Fallen'') You're upset      with everybody when your son dies, and you don't think      rationally. I don't know if I'll ever think rationally again.       FRATANGELO: There was something more here than just the raw      pain and tears you see on screen. It's about those behind the      camera, and the incredible bond that it formed.       So as young filmmakers, were you intimidated at all about      approaching these families?
