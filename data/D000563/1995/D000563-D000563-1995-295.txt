Speaker, if you have ever gotten into your car in the middle of the night to drive a critically injured or critically ill person to the hospital, you know that every minute seems like an hour. You pray to God that you will get to that hospital in time to save the life of someone you love very much.  That is what the debate on the floor or the House of Representatives is all about when we talk about the future of Medicare. Because if the Republicans have their way and cut $282 billion out of Medicare over the next several years to fund a tax break for wealthy Americans, we are going to see hospitals closing in America, particularly in my part of the world in small-town America. It will mean for a lot of people a much longer drive in the middle of the night, many more prayers, and a lot more hope that they will make it in time.  Is this the Republican vision of America which people voted for last November? I don't think so. I hope the Gingrich Republicans will abandon this tax cut program that they have put forward and will instead focus on really strengthening Medicare instead of the cuts that they are proposing which will close hospitals across the United States.                          ____________________
