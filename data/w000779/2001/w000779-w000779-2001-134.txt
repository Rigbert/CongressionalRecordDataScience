President, I want to respond just for a few minutes to my colleague from California. I think she knows I admire her enormously. I think the Record will show the distinguished Senator from California and I agree on a vast majority of the issues that come before the Senate.  What is troubling about the argument that is advanced before the Senate tonight is that after State officials in California botched the job of deregulation--by the way, this was not Senator Feinstein; Senator Feinstein did not do that, but State officials in California botched the job--now the message is, the public entities and those responsible to taxpayers are just supposed to trust folks in California to hope everything is going to work out. Given the hardship we are facing in the Pacific Northwest, that is just a little much to swallow; it is hard for this Senator to swallow, despite the fact that I have great respect for my colleague from California.  I think tonight we have seen--certainly over the course of the last hour--that there is a sharp difference of opinion between California's two Senators on this matter. Senator Boxer worked with us in close consultation. She is in support of this amendment. She believes it is going to help bring folks together in the West for a comprehensive solution.  I think what she is saying is she does not want her State to be a scofflaw. She does not want her State to, in effect, be a deadbeat in the course of this whole discussion as the State of California asks the distinguished new Senator from Virginia to be part of an effort--and myself and others--to come up with a comprehensive solution to this question.  The distinguished Senator from California started her presentation by reading from some letters from private utilities in California and, in particular, focused on the fact that Southern California Edison is in opposition to this amendment.  The fact is, the Washington Post noted this recently. Southern California Edison actually passed along nearly $5 billion in net income to its parent, Edison International, which used the money to pay dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase its own stock.  So what you have is a private company, Edison International, that my colleague cites tonight as the reason the Senator from Virginia and other colleagues should vote against the bipartisan Smith-Wyden amendment because we are individuals who ought to be concerned about Southern California Edison first.  I want Southern California Edison to get a fair shake. That is why we made very clear in our amendment that no one would get a preference if, in fact, you had the worst case scenario of an actual bankruptcy unfolding in the State of California. I just do not want Southern California Edison and a handful of these private interests to get a free ride. I do not know how it passes the smell test. I think this is why Senator Boxer agrees with us on this matter.  How we can say to the people of the Pacific Northwest, who, in effect, got these glowing thank-you letters from Senator Feinstein, that somehow they are not going to be repaid, even though it involves only a few hundred million dollars, may not be a big deal to California, but it is a huge deal to the ratepayers in our area. We are concerned. We always have to make debt repayment to the Federal Government. These sums make a real difference.  So I am very hopeful, as our colleagues overnight reflect on the debate that is being held on the floor of the Senate, that they will stand with Senator Smith, Senator Boxer, and myself rather than with Southern California Edison, which has been busy sending billions of dollars overseas, when all the rest of us on the west coast have been trying to figure out how to get through a very difficult situation.  Mention was made of the fact that this amendment requires out-of-State generators to be paid in full before other creditors are paid. Our amendment does no such thing. It does no such thing. It only deals with a fraction of the debt that is owed by California utilities. It only requires the debt be repaid at the end of a bankruptcy proceeding when a plan of reorganization is put in place. If the worst case scenario takes place, which we believe our legislation helps to avert, then we will have a measure of fairness in the consideration of how to handle that situation.  Senator Feinstein also quoted from out-of-State generators. These are the companies that the Governor of California has called profiteers. Those are not my words; those are the words of the Governor of California.  So I am sure my colleagues, by this point, are awfully confused about the back and forth. But I do think Senator Feinstein has framed the debate well. On one side are the interests of those directly responsible to taxpayers, those who have no shareholders, nobody who can absorb the cost, nobody who can be involved in some kind of sleight-of-hand arrangement where you can send billions of dollars overseas.  The people who are supporting Senator Boxer, Senator Smith, and myself, and others, do not have those kinds of shareholders involved in those multibillion-dollar deals that were reported in the Washington Post.  They are standing up for taxpayers. They are the ones who would be helped by this bipartisan amendment. It is very clear, on the basis of the letters that have been read in opposition, that on the other side are the interests of these private utilities.  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article outlining Southern California Edison's program to send $5 billion overseas be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2001]California's Utility Sent Parent Firm $4.8 Billion--Audit Results Anger                             Consumer Groups                  (By William Booth and Rene Sanchez)       Los Angeles, Jan. 30--The first of several audits to be      released by the state regulators said that one of      California's two nearly bankrupt utilities, Southern      California Edison, legally passed along nearly $5 billion in      net income to its parent, Edison International, which used      the money to pay dividends to its shareholders and to      repurchase its own stock.       The audit, released Monday night by the California Public      Utilities Commission, also showed that Southern California      Edison is now broke and so strapped for cash it cannot keep      buying electricity at rates higher than it can pass along to      consumers.       the $4.8 billion was, in part, proceeds from the sale of      the Southern California Edison's power plants, which the      utility was required to sell under California's 1996      deregulation plan. Deregulation here sought to break up the      utility monopolies and open the state up to free-market      forces.       Consumer advocates--and some elected officials--reacted      angrily to the audit, accusing the utilities of pleading      poverty and begging for financial assistance from the state      to avoid bankruptcy.       ``Basically, they took the money and ran,'' John Burton, a      Democratic leader of the state Senate from San Francisco,      told reporters. ``Had they not done that they would not be in      the financial problem they are in. If ratepayers bail them      out, ratepayers should get something in return, like power      lines or something.''       But officials with the utilities said their critics are      playing politics and misinterpreting their books. Tom      Higgins, senior vice president at Edison International, said:      ``There's been no profit, no windfall. This is the recovery      of capital investment.''       The past profits and current solvency of the state's two      struggling utilities are central to California's energy      crisis. Most experts agree that the state is suffering from      soaring prices and its 15th day of emergency energy rationing      because of a failed and dysfunctional deregulatory plan,      which allowed wholesale energy prices to soar while capping      the rates utility companies could charge consumers. In the      past six months, the utilities have gone bust, while      wholesale power producers have reaped huge profits.       California is fast running out of time to solve its      immediate energy crisis. The state already has used up the      first $400 million in emergency appropriations for      electricity purchases. The Legislature is considering bills      to make the state a major buyer of power--and to pass along      possible steep increases in costs to consumers. Gov. Gray      Davis (D) worked through the weekend trying to hammer out a      longer-range plan, but so far the Legislature has passed only      emergency measures and decrees--and no long-term solutions.       Higgins, the Edison International executive, said Southern      California Edison was required to sell off its plants after      deregulation in 1996, and that it did so--mostly to out-of-     state companies that are now the wholesale suppliers of      California's electricity. The utility sold off its gas and      coal-fired plants, but retained its nuclear and hydroelectric      facilities.       The money they got from plant sales, Higgins said, went to      pay off the banks that loaned them the cash to build the      generating stations and to repay investors and shareholders      who also put money into plant construction. The transfer of      money occurred from 1996 through last November.       ``It's like you have a house and mortgage and you sell the      house and you recover your initial investment and then pay      off the mortgage,'' Higgins said.       Another audit of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the other      struggling utility, will be released within days. That      results are expected to be similar.       ``The only reason this would be controversial is that the      consumer groups are trying to rewrite history,'' said John      Nelson, a spokesman for PG       Nelson said his utility did the same thing as Southern      California Edison--it sold plants, paid off loans and sent      the rest to its holding company, PG Corp. He would not      disclose exactly how much was transferred, but said it is      safe to assume a figure of several billion dollars.       Consumer advocates around California, however, said it did      not matter that the utilities were returning investments to      their shareholders, a practice that no one has asserted is      financially improper or illegal. Today, they began lobbying      state lawmakers to scrap an emerging legislative plan that      would cover much of the utilities' purported debts with      billions of dollars in publicly financed bonds.       ``This confirms what we've been saying all along,'' said      Matt Freedman, a director of the Utility Reform Network.      ``Edison is not being straight with the public or the      Legislature about the extent of its debt.''       Freedman also said that the audit shows that in recent      months Edison has been selling some of its own generating      power back to itself at high prices on the open market, then      claiming both profit and debt.       ``It's like a laundering scheme,'' he said.       Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network said      the audit could significantly influence the fastmoving      legislative debate on the state's energy crisis. He said that      while it was not illegal for the utilities to transfer money      to their parent companies, ``the question is, `Was it      prudent?' ''       But Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert      Hertzberg (D), said there are no substantive new revelations      in the Edison audit and that the Legislature is proceeding      with a plan outlined last Friday that would cover much of the      utilities' debts in exchange for the state receiving warrants      to buy stock in the companies.       ``I don't know that it changes the landscape at all,''      Hefner said, referring to the audits. ``All along we've been      saying we're not going to do this and get nothing back. We're      driving as hard a bargain as we can.''
