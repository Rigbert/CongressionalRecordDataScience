Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to join my colleagues, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner), and really the entire committee on both sides of the aisle, in praising the long and distinguished service of Beth Kilker, Elizabeth Kilker.  Elizabeth Kilker has served with the committee for almost 25 years. I have been on the committee for 22 years, Mr. Speaker. I have known her. I have admired her. She is always a positive force. She has worked with chairmen and ranking members from Texas, Mississippi, Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, and now New Jersey.  Throughout these years she has been extraordinarily helpful, effective, and always positive, perhaps something she learned at Immaculate Heart Academy in Girardville, Pennsylvania. But she certainly has brought a real sense of class, distinction and is, as I said, a very, very effective person.  The committee has not just been blessed, but the veterans themselves have been blessed. They have been enriched by her service, they will miss her, and may God bless everything that she does going forward.
