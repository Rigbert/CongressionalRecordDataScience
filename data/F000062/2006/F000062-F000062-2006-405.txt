 President, I introduce today legislation to require the White House to notify Congress when it declassifies information. This bill will both enhance Congress's oversight abilities and ensure that intelligence is not used for political gain.  This legislation recognizes that as the head of the executive branch, the President has the authority to declassify any information he so chooses. It does not place any conditions or procedures on that declassification process, it only requires that the Congress be provided with notice so that it can meet its own constitutional responsibilities.  Information is usually declassified because the public's need to know outweighs the security risks to intelligence sources and methods. In such cases, it is important for the Congress to be informed so that Senators and Representatives can discuss the issues with the American people.  And if the President declassifies information so that his subordinates can discuss intelligence with reporters, Congress should be alerted so that the intelligence committees can ensure that national secrets are not being used for political purposes.  According to court filings and media reports, the Vice President's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, acting on the direction and authorization of the President and Vice President, disclosed information in the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to select journalists. This was not done to provide the American people with a fuller understanding of the pre-Iraq war intelligence; the Estimate was fully and publicly declassified shortly afterwards in a more appropriate manner. Rather, the selective declassification and leak was intended to stem a tide of bad press and discredit an administration critic through a subtle campaign of media manipulation.  According to the prosecutor in Mr. Libby's case, Libby provided information on Iraq's purchase of uranium from Niger to New York Times reporter Judith Miller. The Niger claim was not a ``key judgment'' of the NIE, meaning that it was not deemed by the intelligence community to be a priority. It was included in the body of the report ``for completeness,'' according to the primary author. At the time, the Department of State's intelligence office found the Niger uranium claim to be ``highly dubious,'' and the intelligence community downplayed the Niger connection afterwards:  The CIA had deleted a reference to Niger from the President's October 7, 2002 speech in Cincinnati;  Two senior intelligence officials had downplayed the assessment in testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee;  The International Atomic Energy Agency had denounced the claim as being based on forged documents; and  The intelligence community had retracted the intelligence.  Let me say that again: the intelligence community had retracted this piece of intelligence. None of this additional information, apparently, was provided by Mr. Libby.  Had the Senate and House intelligence committees been informed of this declassification, as would be required by this legislation, Members could have corrected the public record.I would hope that with this reporting requirement, administrations of both political parties will be deterred from improper use of intelligence.  In addition to stemming the politicization of intelligence, the bill I introduce today also notes the importance of keeping the full intelligence community informed of declassifications. If the President chooses, for whatever reason, to declassify information, the intelligence agency that had been responsible for those secrets has to take steps to protect intelligence sources and methods.  Similarly, the National Archives are to be informed upon a Presidential declassification so the Nation's records can be appropriately maintained. As has been highlighted again today with the release of the Archives audit over the reclassification of intelligence, the Archives play an important role in providing declassified intelligence to the public. To do so, it must be informed when information enters the public domain.  It should be made clear that there are more traditional procedures by which individual intelligence agencies declassify information on a regular basis, when the release of that information is seen as no longer damaging the national security. This is done thousands of times a week throughout the intelligence community.  It is important that the public have access to as much information on its government's activities as possible. To that end, I look forward, through this legislation and otherwise, to working with my colleagues and the executive branch to ensure that declassification is done as extensively and as quickly as possible without risking our national security.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2660       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
