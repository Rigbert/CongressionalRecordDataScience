Speaker, we have had some protestations, particularly from the gentleman from Cleveland or just outside of Cleveland, with respect to baselines. Mr. DeFazio spoke of baselines.  And the question and answers, we pretend that there can be a savings which is going to be applied to a tax cut and for the wealthiest in America, but that somehow this savings doesn't cost anybody anything. It is a free lunch. It is sort of like supply-side economics that was brought to us in 1981, and we were told that the budget would be balanced as a result of supply-side economics by October 1, 1983.
