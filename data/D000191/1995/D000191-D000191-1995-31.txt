Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Neumann] for his leadership on this issue. This is an example that if Congress applies the proper scrutiny to the Pentagon, the same scrutiny that is being applied to many other budgets of the Federal Government, there are places to save funds.  The GAO report that the gentleman mentioned that a Senator from Iowa and I had commissioned found that the OSA aircraft far exceed the wartime needs of the Pentagon, and they are routinely used for missions that have no urgency, missions where the generals or the assistant secretaries involved could make the same trip on commercial aircraft for a fraction of the cost. The helicopters which are used frequently between Andrews Air Force Base and the Pentagon at a cost of between $400 and $1,600 more per trip, saving 10 to 12 minutes, but boosting a lot of egos, are also a place where this amendment would apply.  Mr. Chairman, it is time the same strictures are applied to the Pentagon that we are applying to other parts of the Federal budget. This is definitely an area where funds could be saved.  Mr. Chairman, I was not here for the opening dialog, but my understanding is that perhaps the committee is going to accept the amendment. I would like at this point, if I could engage the chairman in a brief colloquy.
