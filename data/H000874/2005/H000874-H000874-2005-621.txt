Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  Mr. Leader, I noticed that the budget conference report is not listed on the schedule next week. The gentleman and I talked about that last week. Can the gentleman tell us when the gentleman believes the budget conference will be appointed and when we might have that on the floor?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I believe the Committee on the Budget chairman, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), has had some informal discussions with his Senate counterpart. I have spoken to the majority leader of the Senate. They are hoping to call a conference committee meeting sometime next week, which means we will have to go to conference sometime next week. As the gentleman may or may not know, the Senate is taking a work period the following week, so they are trying as hard as they can to get this conference formed, a meeting, and work done so that we can have a conference report on the floor of the House and the Senate by the end of next week.                              {time}  1645
