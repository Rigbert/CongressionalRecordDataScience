President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. We have been working on this for a long time. For 4 years, we have actually had an amendment that would accomplish this. The approach we are taking now is the right approach because it is letting scientists decide, not people who come to this Chamber and say hysterically there is going to be harm done to the environment. We can look at history, and, as we have said severaltimes before, of the over 1 million of these processes that have taken place, there is not one bit of evidence of a problem to the environment.  I have a letter from the Ground Water Protection Council. It is a group of EPAs throughout America. They strongly endorse this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         GWPC,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, March 7, 2002.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: The Ground Water Protection Council (GWPC)      strongly encourages you to support the Bingaman-Inhofe      Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment.       The GWPC is a national association of state agencies who      regulate the nation's ground water and underground injection      control programs. Our members and Board of Directors are      professional geologists, hydrologist, geo-chemists and      petroleum engineers.       As the state agencies charged with protecting the nation's      ground water supplies and regulating the oil and gas      industry, we are very concerned that failure to pass the      amendment would result in an additional and unnecessary      regulatory burden on both states and the industries they      regulate, with no environmental benefit.       We are aware of a March 6, 2002 letter to you opposing the      Bingaman-Inhofe Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment and have the      following comments:       In no state is the oil and gas industry exempt from the      requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. A number of      activities conducted as part of oil and gas exploration and      production are regulated under the UIC program, including      injection of produced water and some related wastes.      Hydraulic fracturing is fundamentally different because it is      part of the well completion process, does not ``dispose of      fluids'' and is of short duration, with most of the fluids      being immediately removed.       Fracturing fluids do not contain MTBE. Fracturing fluids      may contain small amounts of other hazardous chemicals but      constituents such as benzene do not appear in fluids that      would be used in fracturing shallow formations. Such fluids      are used in deeper formations that are usually thousands of      feet below the strata that drinking water wells actually tap      into.       Any ``regulatory rollback'' would occur only after careful      EPA study and only if EPA determined, based on the study and      the peer review by NAS, that federal regulation of hydraulic      fracturing is not necessary.       The letter ignores the fact that states already regulate      underground injection and hydraulic fracturing. In fact, the      ``exclusive deal'' for the oil industry that is alleged in      the letter was in actually a recognition by Congress in 1980      that states were already effectively regulating oil and gas      exploration and production activities and had done so for      years. Congress further recognized that it did not make sense      to change these effective state programs by making the states      comply with redundant federal regulations.       The letter alleges that hydraulic fracturing threatens      underground sources of drinking water. The letter does not      allege that hydraulic fracturing has actually resulted in      adverse impacts to USDWs because no such impacts have ever      been confirmed.       The proposed amendment would not ``overturn two Court of      Appeals decisions.'' It certainly would not overturn LEAF II.      In fact, it codifies LEAF II. It doesn't even overturn LEAF      I, but would allow EPA to determine that the current state/     EPA regulatory partnership is working effectively and that      additional federal regulation is not necessary       The proposed amendments would not ``fully suspend''      regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Current state regulations      would be unaffected and remain in force.       On behalf of the Ground Water Protection Council, we again      urge you to support the Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment.           Sincerely,                                                  Michel J. Paque,                                          GWPC Executive Director.
