 President, I applaud and share Senator Inouye's desire to strongly support the Army in its transformation to a lighter, more deployable, agile, lethal and survivable force, in order to meet the challenges we have today and certainly expect in the future. This transformation to an Objective Force is very ambitious in terms of new capabilities, and I think we should all recognize the significant technological risks associated with this endeavor.
