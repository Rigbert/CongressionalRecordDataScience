Speaker, yesterday the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds) was quoted in Roll Call as saying, ``The Democrats are whining about the process rather than getting into debate on the substance.''  I am going to talk about substance tomorrow, but let me talk about process today. I ask my colleagues on the majority side of the aisle, what do they think about 212 Americans who represent approximately 235 million Americans, not Democrats, 235 million Americans, who had no opportunity to see the substance of your proposal on Thursday night?  Cannot we cry foul over a Republican budget process that completely shuts out the representatives of the people, not us as individuals, but of the people that we represent, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and, yes, those who are not aligned.  Our ranking member on the Committee on the Budget, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) was not allowed into the conference on this resolution; yet we adopt a rule that today will not debate substance but, by process alone, will recommit this bill to the Committee on the Budget.  Mr. Speaker, I am pretty sure I detected a few Republican tears in the wee hours of the morning that they could not get this through. As a matter of fact, I heard the distinguished gentleman from Florida talking about that and lamenting. After all, that is when the majority learned the painful truth: It would have to wait 4 days. Look who is crying now.  Mr. Speaker, the other side of the aisle has had a weekend of bad press on these frankly heavy-handed budget tactics, and people are starting to reexamine the substance in this budget, a budget that provides huge tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and let the budget ax fall on education, contrary to the bipartisan agreement in the other body, and seniors who need prescription drugs, and our environment.  Mr. Speaker, let us vote down this rule. Let us return this matter to the American people and have a full and fair debate.
