Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, this provision is intended to address a longstanding concern about a policy of the Fish and Wildlife Service where new refuge lands are ``closed until opened.'' Accordingly, all preexisting uses are terminated when land is acquired by the Fish and Wildlife Service. This has created conflict at many refuges where sportsmen accustomed to using these lands suddenly find them closed for an unpredictable amount of time.  The purpose of this paragraph, which inserts new language in section 4(d)(3)(b)(x) of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, is to create the presumption that when the Fish and Wildlife Service brings new lands into the System, compatible wildlife recreation activities ought to be allowed to continue unless the Secretary makes a determination before the acquisition that such activities are not compatible with the purposes of the System.
