Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding resident of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Donald Hamilton. On September 29, 2000, Mr. Hamilton, along with his friends and family, will be honored for his 32 years of dedicated service to the Laborer's International Union Local #41, at a dinner to be held at the International Union of Operating Engineers Local #150, in Merrillville, Indiana. Mr. Hamilton's distinguished career in the labor movement has contributed to the safety and security of workers in his community and improved the quality of life for laborers throughout Northwest Indiana.  Mr. Hamilton has devoted his entire working career toward the expansion of labor ideals and fair standards for all working people. For more than 30 years, Mr. Hamilton has been a member of Local #41, and has held several positions throughout his tenure. His peers were sorry to see him retire from perhaps his most important role at Local #41, that of Business Agent, on August 1, 2000. Don served admirably as Business Agent for Local #41 since his election 18 years ago. While this was his longest held position, and the one for which his co-workers at Local #41 will always remember him, he never limited his dedication to that one position. Mr. Hamilton served as vice-president of the Indiana State District Council of Laborers and HOD Carriers for eight years, sat on the executive board for six years, and served as auditor for three years. For five years, Don served as president of the Northwest Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council, two years as its vice president and three years as its secretary-treasurer.  Don's contributions are not limited to labor causes. He regularly finds time to serve his community as well. He is the past president of the Lake County Planning Commission and was a board member for eight years. He has also spent two years as a board member of the Lake County Association for Retarded of Northwest Indiana. Don Hamilton has dedicated much of his life to efforts that benefit his fellow union members and advance the prosperity and strength of his community of Northwest Indiana and the entire state.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Don Hamilton. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His work in the labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana with opportunities they certainly would not have otherwise enjoyed. Mr. Hamilton's leadership kept the region's labor force strong and helped keep Americans working. Those who have worked with him in the labor movement and in his community will surely miss Mr. Hamilton's dedication and sincerity. I hope my distinguished colleagues will join me in wishing Don Hamilton a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
