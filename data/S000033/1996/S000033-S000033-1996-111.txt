 Chairman, I would simply conclude by stating that I think the Watt amendment is simple and straightforward. What it says is that in the United States of America, we should not have children sleeping out on the streets, we should not have people paying 50 or 60 percent of their income for rent. I would strongly support the Watt amendment.
