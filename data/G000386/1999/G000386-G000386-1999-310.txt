 But before he does, in front of all of my colleagues, I want to thank him very much for an outstanding statement that focuses on the complexity of the bankruptcy problem. Most importantly, he focused attention on the bipartisanship of this legislation and on our commitment to getting it passed not only this Congress, but this year. It can be done.  I encourage the Democratic and Republican leaders to have the necessary meetings and conversations it takes to bring this bill to the floor under a reasonable agreement so we can start work on it. In just a few hours, we can work our way through the disagreements that other Members might have and do it in a bipartisan way and get this bill on its way to the President of the United States.  So in public, I am happy to thank the Senator from New Jersey for his cooperation. He has worked with me in a truly bipartisan way. For constituents who might be listening anyplace in the United States who are concerned about this body or Congress as a whole or Washington, DC, being too partisan, this bankruptcy bill is an example of where bi-partisanship has worked. If I had tried to do this in a partisan manner, this bill would not even be as far as it is.
