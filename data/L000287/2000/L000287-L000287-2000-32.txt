Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me this time and for all of his help in support of this effort.  I also, Mr. Speaker, would like to begin by thanking the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for working with me on this bill. As cochair of the Human Rights Caucus, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) have led the fight against the use of child soldiers.  I would like to thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson) and his staff, as well as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from New York (Chairman Gilman), for working with me to bring this bill to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I have a deep respect for the power of young people. Forty-three years ago, I was but a child myself when I first met Martin Luther King, Jr., and joined the nonviolent struggle for justice in America. So I know, Mr. Speaker, that young people can change the world. That is why the idea of using children as soldiers so disturbs me.  As the last remaining superpower, the United States is morally bound to use our strength to protect those who are weak and exposed. Yet, as we stand here, thousands by thousands of children in Colombia, in Sierra Leone, and countless other countries around the world have been forced to kill at one moment and used as cannon fodder the next. Children who should fill rows of school desks, instead fill columns of soldiers. The brutal use of children to fight adult wars must end. The time is now. Our job is simple, to lead the way.  In January, the United Nations reached an agreement to ban child soldiers.                              {time}  1200  Last week the President signed this treaty. This resolution calls on the President and the Senate to work together and build support for this protocol. It urges the Congress and the President to establish a fund to help child soldiers reenter society. And most importantly, this resolution calls on the United States to use its moral authority to lead efforts across the globe to put a stop to this brutal practice.  Many of us, Mr. Speaker, have fought long and hard for freedom and justice in our own country, but our commitment to human rights, to peace, to nonviolence, to a sense of community, to justice, that commitment cannot stop at the water. It is our moral obligation, our mission, and our mandate to lead the struggle to protect children everywhere from the violence of war.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues for joining in this help, joining in support of this effort to bring this bill to the floor today.
