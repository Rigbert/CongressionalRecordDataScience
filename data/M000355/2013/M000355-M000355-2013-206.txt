 President, this week we mark National Police Week 2013 as a time to pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the many men and women in Federal, State, and local law enforcement across America. It is an appropriate time for those of us who benefit from their efforts--and that is all of us--to express our gratitude.  The Nation's Capital welcomes thousands of police officers who are gathering to celebrate National Police Week. They will honor their fallen fellow officers and rededicate themselves to their duties of defending the property, dignity, and lives of those who would fall prey to criminals outside the law.  I want to especially recognize the many men and women who work to enforce the law in my home State of Kentucky. Many of them have traveled to Washington this week, and today I will have the pleasure of meeting with some of Kentucky's finest. I want to personally thank them for bravely risking their lives in service of people across the Commonwealth.  Earlier this month in Richmond, Kentucky, a solemn ceremony was held at the Kentucky Law Enforcement Memorial on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University. This memorial lists the names of every known fallen peace officer in Kentucky history. Along the bottom of it are the words, ``Blessed Be the Peacekeepers.''  The ceremony was held to add the names of two law-enforcement officers from Kentucky who were killed in the line of duty in 2012. Hodgenville Police Officer Mark A. Taulbee was killed in a vehicle pursuit on September 16. Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Anthony Rakes was shot during a traffic stop on November 14.  I extend my sympathies to the families of Officer Taulbee and Deputy Rakes for their tragic loss.  Their names will be added, along with 6 other Kentucky peace officers whose names had not previously been on the memorial. There will be a total of 509 brave Kentuckians on that wall.  I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in holding the deepest admiration and respect for the many brave law-enforcement officers across Kentucky and the Nation. Theirs is both an honorable profession, and a dangerous one. It is also a necessary one, as the maintenance of peace and order in a civil society that we take for granted could not exist without them.  Kentucky is grateful to our law-enforcement officers and their families. And we are grateful for the sacrifice of Officer Mark A. Taulbee and Sheriff's Deputy Anthony Rakes to preserve the rule of law.  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Commonwealth of Kentucky law-enforcement officers added to the Kentucky Law Enforcement Memorial this year be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Mark A. Taulbee; Hodgenville Police Department; End of      Watch: September 16, 2012.       Anthony Rakes; Marion County Sheriff's Office; End of      Watch: November 14, 2012.       Releigh Killion; U.S. Marshal; End of Watch: May 24, 1884.       Thomas D.
