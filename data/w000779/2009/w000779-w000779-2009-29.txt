President, I rise today to introduce the Take Back Your Health Act of 2009. I want to thank my friends Senator Cornyn and Senator Harkin for joining as original cosponsors of this bill.  This bill is another example of how Democrats and Republicans can come together on health reform. This bill incorporates ideas that bridge the philosophies of both parties: prevention, individual responsibility, and paying for health care services that provide value.  These days, health care reformers talk about bending the cost curve down and focusing on delivery system ``game changers''. Often my friends and I have talked about how pevention--preventing disease or illness before it happens--does both, but is not scored as bending the cost curve by the Congressional Budget Office.  Over the last year, I have worked with some of the brightest minds in prevention--Doctors Dean Ornish, Mike Roizen, and Mark Hyman--on how to design a program that will change the focus of medicine from treating medical problems to preventing them while delivering savings. The road that took us to this bill has not been an easy one, but I believe this bill achieves all of our goals when it comes to encouraging healthier behaviors that will help prevent disease, especially chronic diseases.  The heart of this bill is what's called an intensive lifestyle treatment program. This program is an individualized health plan prescribed by a doctor that gets people living healthier and getting healthier through exercise, nutrition counseling, care coordination, medication management, and stopping smoking.  This type of program has been proven to help or even reverse the progression of many chronic diseases. A Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield study found that their costs went down 50 percent after their patients took part in an intensive lifestyle program. That can mean big savings for Medicare and for seniors.  Even a CMS Medicare demonstration--which notoriously does not scoresavings for anything--found that people who went through a lifestyle program had the same or lower costs over three years than as Medicare beneficiaries who didn't go through the program.  In times like these, the American people want to know that the Medicare program is going to get their money's worth. The Take Back Your Health Act embraces a pay-for-performance type system. Doctors are paid a bundled payment to encourage efficiency and teamwork, and they are held responsible for their success. If a patient's health status does not improve according to at least two measures, the doctor doesn't get paid. In addition, if a patient goes through the program for diabetes, but still has problems and has to go to the hospital, the lifestyle treatment doctor doesn't get paid.  The last innovation in this program is that it gives individuals a financial incentive for getting healthier. Every person who goes through this treatment program and improves his or her health status gets a one-time $200 reward.  The beauty of this bill is that everyone has skin in the game: the doctor, the patient, and the government. That will be the secret of its success. It is just this kind of innovative program that can be a real game-changer for Medicare and for our entire health care system, by bringing the focus of our health care system back to the basics of making us healthier.  I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley on including this bill in health reform. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors on this bill.                                 ______                                       By
