I have had an interest in sub-Saharan Africa for quite some time. After 9/11, finally the United States decided they would do something of concern in sub-Saharan Africa. So what we have had since that time is an interest in helping them to build African brigades, as the terrorists come down through the Horn of Africa and Djibouti and into the continent. We need to help the Africans build brigades so they can resist, not doing it for them, not doing it in place of the Africans, but to help them so they can defend themselves. That is exactly what we have been doing.  I have been honored to be the point man on the Armed Services Committee to go over and work with these guys.
