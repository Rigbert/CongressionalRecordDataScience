Chairman, on the point of order, this was included in the bill at the insistence of the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the committee for the purposes of providing for the emergency that they foresaw with respect to effecting a solution to the problem of our computers working after January 1, 2000.  In that context, it was judged to be an emergency and critically important to be included in this bill so that the objectives of this bill and every other bill other than the defense bill could be ensured to be carried out in the next millennium.  I would hope that the Chair, realizing the critical nature of this provision, therefore, might find that in fact it was in order.
