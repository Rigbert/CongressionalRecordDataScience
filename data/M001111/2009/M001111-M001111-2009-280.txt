 President, for the information of all Senators, the amendment following the vote on the Murray amendment is a Coburn amendment about ensuring that government contracts are competitively awarded. I agree with the premise of the amendment that follows this. However, his amendment is drafted in a way that precludes certain types of contracts that are authorized by statute and have the strong support of Congress. For example, his amendment doesn't acknowledge contracts that are authorized by the Small Business Act, such as minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The Coburn language also ignores the AbilityOne Program, known as the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program, which provides job opportunities for blind and disabled Americans through Federal contracts.  The amendment I am offering assures that we do award government contracts competitively but does it in a way that makes sure we take care of small businesses and veteran-owned businesses and women-owned businesses.  I encourage all my colleagues to vote for the Murray amendment.
