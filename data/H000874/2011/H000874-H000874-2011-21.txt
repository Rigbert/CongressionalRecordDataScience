 So, my Tea Party friends, I am sure you lament the fact and think this bill ought not be passed. But I haven't seen you. I haven't heard you. I haven't gotten a letter from you.  I tell my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, I have demonstrated throughout this year that when we had the opportunity to work together, I worked to get the votes so that together, we could pass legislation that was necessary to run this country. So I don't take a back seat to anybody in this Chamber willing to work together in a bipartisan fashion. But this bill was not worked together in a bipartisan fashion. This bill seeks to poke a finger in the eye of the President of the United States, who has said, I will veto this bill, not because of the three things that I said were absolutely essential but because of something that is not essential to pass. Now the majority leader lamented last week that this would create 5,000 jobs if we passed the Keystone pipeline project. But a bill that would create at least a million jobs, the American Jobs Act, lays languishing in the bowels of the committee.                              {time}  1630
