President, I started my public service career fighting for rural health. In a State that has many rural hospitals, the rural health care delivery system is especially important to Kansas. One of my first speeches was to rural hospitals. Since that time, I have been beating the drum, so to speak, for our rural areas about how important it is to focus on rural health.  I have always said that people in rural towns deserve the same access to care and level of treatment as their urban counterparts. I have made it my mission to protect our rural health system and patient access to the best possible care. I am honored to serve as the cochair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus where I work with my colleagues to fight for our rural health care system every day.  Unfortunately, these days it feels as though rural health care, and all of those involved in it, face an uphill battle. Over the past few years, the rural health system has continued to face even more challenges.  Funding for rural health care programs has been targeted again and again. This year the Senate Finance Committee held a markup with regular order where we considered some of the rural extenders that are absolutely vital to our rural communities. Regrettably, we have more work to do. We have to convince and educate our colleagues, this administration, and everyone else about the importance of rural health care. We have been successful in protecting some of the ideas I have championed, especially on the rural extenders side, but we have more work to do. As this process moves forward, we need to ensure we follow regular order on the floor of the Senate and for any pay-fors for the doc fix package. While I was pleased with some of the additions that addressed rural health care in the package passed out of committee, I have concerns that these issues were not included or addressed in the most recent package introduced in the House and in the Senate.  In addition to ensuring rural health is part of any moving legislation, I wish to ensure it is a package that is offset and paid for, and this has to be done before I can support it. But the bottom line is that we, the Senate, need to return to regular order and ensure that practice does continue.  As will many of my colleagues in the Senate, I will continue to vigorously fight to rein in Federal spending and toreduce the deficit. In order to address this fiscal crisis, I think Congress must enact basic structural changes to entitlement programs that will strengthen and preserve these programs for future generations while protecting current participants. Without real tangible reform and cuts in Federal spending, we will bankrupt the country. At the same time, we need to ensure that any of those policies we put in place do not result in a disproportionate impact on our rural health care system or restrict patients' access to the care they need. As I started saying today, this is going to be an uphill battle. But I, for one, am ready to lead the charge.  As a member of both the Finance and HELP Committees, as well as the cochair of the Rural Health Caucus, I have tried to be a leader in the discussion about the need to address the entire health system.  I have made it a point that within our health care system discussions, we need to talk about the differences between our rural areas and the care and treatment provided in those rural settings and their urban counterparts. We need to address common misconceptions about funding challenges in rural communities before taking a Lizzie Borden ax to the funding streams.  Throughout my career in public office, I have made it a point to always fight for Kansas and rural health care providers. This has been one of my top priorities in Congress. I understand the important role of rural health in America and continue to advocate for policies that protect and preserve these benefits.  Most recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--have made some changes that will be particularly harmful to rural health. More specifically, their changes will force doctors into a guessing game about their patients. The condition of payment changes CMS is making would require the physician, and no other level provider, to not only predict at the time of admission to the critical access hospital that the patient will require hospital care for more than two midnights, but also that the patient can be cared for and discharged in less than 96 hours. This is an extremely narrow CMS window for the physician to make a determination about that patient's future needs--extremely difficult, if not impossible. A physician may certify that they expect the patient to be treated and discharged within 96 hours, but, unfortunately, the patient's situation may change and they may need to be kept longer. The physician's concern will be that they have failed to meet the terms of their certification according to CMS. This is likely to lead to premature discharges and readmissions, both of which CMS has taken actions to minimize.  A CEO for one of our critical access hospitals in Council Grove, KS, writes:       This new ``condition of payment'' rule causes potential      conflicts with what is best for the patient, causes issues      for the physician in having to predict outcomes at admission      in complex cases, and may cause increased expense for      medically unnecessary transfers to more costly care centers.  Today I am introducing the Critical Access Hospital Relief Act of 2014. My bipartisan legislation would remove the condition of payment for critical access hospitals that requires a physician to certify that each patient will be discharged or transferred in less than 96 hours. This is another example of having to tell CMS, ``If it isn't broken, then there is no need to fix it.'' We need to focus on ensuring rural patients have access to their health system, not coming up with bureaucratic ways to make it harder for patients in rural areas to get quality care from their doctors.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Critical Access Hospital Relief Act of 2014.                          ____________________
