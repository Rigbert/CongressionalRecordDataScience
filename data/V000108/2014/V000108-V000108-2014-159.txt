Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate several of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens. The Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor, American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, recognized several individuals for their dedication and service during the 39th Annual Labor and Community Awards Reception, which was held at Wicker Park in Highland, Indiana, on Thursday, April 24, 2014. These individuals, in addition to all Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are the epitome of the ideal American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.   At this year's event, several individuals and organizations received special recognition. The Joseph A. Beirne Community Service Award is presented each year to local and national labor leaders for their volunteer service to United Way. This year, Jim Stemmler, retired Business Manager for Ironworkers Local 395, was the recipient of this prestigious honor for his outstanding dedication and noteworthy service to the United Way movement.   Dave Fagan, Financial Secretary, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150, is this year's recipient of the President's Award. Mr. Fagan was honored for enhancing the well-being of workers throughout Northwest Indiana through countless contributions to further the philosophy of the Labor Movement.   The Union Label Award was presented to Lake County Sheriff John Buncich for his unselfish devotion to the Labor Movement through its promotion in all areas of endeavor: social, civic, educational, and political.   Larry Regan, Vice President, Teamsters Local 142, was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many years of Labor activism and his commitment to his community. For the exceptional service he has provided to the people of Northwest Indiana, he is worthy of our admiration and respect.   Dr. Debra Dudek, Director of Title and Special Student Services for the Portage School District, was honored with the Community Services Award for her exemplary service to her community and to the enhancement of the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana.   The Industrial Sector Award was presented to Dave McCall, Director, District 1, United Steelworkers, for his leadership and support of working families throughout Northwest Indiana.   David Tharp, Midwest District Vice President, Carpenters Local 1005, was the recipient of the Building Trades Sector Award, which was bestowed upon him for his many years of service to the Labor Movement and his outstanding dedication to his fellow union members.   Tim Murray, of the Ceramic Tile, Terrazzo and Granite Cutters Union Local 21, and Michael Larson, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 697, received the George Meany Award for their significant contributions to the youth of their communities through their involvement with the Boy Scouts of America.   Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These honorees are all outstanding examples of these qualities. They have demonstrated their loyalty to their unions and the Northwest Indiana community through their hard work and tireless service.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and exemplary citizens, as well as all of the hardworking union men and women throughout America. They have shown commitment and courage toward their pursuits, and I am proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
