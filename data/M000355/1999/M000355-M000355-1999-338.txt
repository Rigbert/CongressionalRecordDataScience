 Lieberman):  S. 846. A bill to make available funds for a security assistance training and support program for the self-defense of Kosova; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.                      the kosovo self-defense act  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kosovo Self-Defense Act. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in offering this bill. Our proposal would provide $25 million to arm and train members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. This would equip 10,000 men or 10 battalions with small arms, antitank weapons, for up to 18 months. Let me repeat that: For less than the cost of one evening's air raids, we can provide significant defensive capabilities to those most willing to fight Serb aggression inside Kosovo.  I know the administration questions why the United States should take this bold step. My question is, Why haven't we already made the decision to arm and train the Kosovar Albanians who are on the ground fighting for their homes, their loved ones, and their rights? It seems to me that the question is not why, but why not? It took 4 years of bloodshed to recognize we should arm the Bosnians. How many lives will be lost before we do the right thing in Kosovo?  There is widespread agreement that President Clinton and his National Security Advisers have made a grave tactical error in removing even the threat of U.S. ground troops. With this declaration seemingly repeated hourly by top Clinton officials, the United States has signaled to Milosevic that, regardless of his actions--including genocide--America does not have the determination to stop this outrageous behavior. After months of hollow American threats, we are now crippling our prospects for success by signaling to Milosevic just how far we are willing to go. No option should have been taken off the table.  Just last October, with great fanfare, the President announced a cease-fire, but it was a farce. The Serbs continued their brutal war against the Kosovars. In Pristina, cynics were heard to say, ``If they only burn a village a day it keeps NATO away.'' The Serb campaign to exterminate all semblance of Albanian society raged daily--just not on a massive, headline-grabbing scale.  Unless faced with serious and sustained military pressure on the ground, this war will go on until Kosovo is empty of all Albanians. Given administration and public reluctance to deploy U.S. troops, there is only one option: The KLA must be given the means to defend their homeland. All reports indicate that the KLA is growing in number and remains willing to fight Serb aggression. Given the right equipment and limited training, the KLA could offer a significant deterrent to Milosevic's murderous thugs.  If the administration had armed the Kosovar Albanians in January when I first suggested that approach, I believe the daily tragic exodus of refugees could have been avoided.  I ask unanimous consent the op-ed I wrote which appeared in the Washington Post back in January advocating this course of action be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1999]                        Independence for Kosovo                          (By Mitch McConnell)       Once again, NATO ambassadors have condemned barbaric      atrocities deliberately inflicted by Serb forces on cold,      hungry, exhausted civilians. Top generals have been      dispatched to warn that Western patience has been strained by      Belgrade's slaughter of 45 villagers in Racak. The Serbs have      retaliated by evicting the American chief of the observer      mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE)--leaving a more sympathetic French official in      place.       It is time for the United States to accept reality,      recognize Kosovo's independence and provide Pristina's      leadership with the political and security assistance      necessary to halt Serbia's genocidal war.       Kosovo's humanitarian disaster continues today. Although it      is true that some 300,000 refugees have left the mountains      where they fled from Serb ethnic cleansing last summer, the      catastrophe has simply moved behind closed doors.      International relief agencies support a program of one warm      room per household, but this effort is barely meeting the      basic human needs of the extended or expanded families      created by the war. Families     ranging in size from 12 to 18 people, half of whom are      children, are crammed into the only standing room left in a      house, usually no larger than 12 by 20 feet. With freezing      temperatures and heavy snow, shortages of mattresses,      blankets, warm clothing and food are evident throughout      Kosovo. Schools and clinics are shuttered or shattered.       Nongovernmental organizations and the U.S. Disaster Team      have performed heroically in hostile conditions.      Unfortunately, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the      World Food Program and Agency for International Development      headquarters have become bureaucratic bottlenecks slowing the      availability of relief supplies to these able partners.       The Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement for Kosovo has failed.      There is no cease-fire. The massacre in Racak is only the      latest example of weekly Serbian violence. Invariably, the      victims are civilians. Each time the Serbs offer the same      explanation: Violence resulted from their search for the      perpetrators of a crime. The Serb military response is always      brutally disproportionate to the needs of any legitimate law      enforcement effort. As one little girl cried after her      village was shelled, ``I would understand if they killed      soldiers, but they killed my home. Why?''       In addition to violating the cease-fire, the Serbs have      failed to comply with another key aspect of the agreement.      Belgrade was required to substantially reduce its Kosovo      force level. In fact, a senior American official acknowledged      the effort to verify the troop withdrawal was a farce. No one      knows how many Serbs are still deployed in Kosovo.       Hopeful of replacing this menacing presence, the      administration is developing an ill-advised plan to create a      new civilian police force. Unarmed and with the benefit of      only a few weeks training, this force is destined to fail or,      far worse, become hostages. An American diplomat summed up      the situation: ``The Serbs will continue to go where they      want, do anything they want, whenever they want.'' Neither      OSCE nor a civilian police force will change that outcome.       The primary reason the agreement has collapsed is that the      use of force has been abandoned as an option. A senior OSCE      French official observed, ``In October, Milosevic was      presented with two options--to be bombed or to accept      verifiers. He agreed to the OSCE mission. We now stand in      lieu of any military option. . . . Our political intervention      is incompatible with military action. No nation will be      willing to take military action and risk retribution against      its citizen verifiers.'' In short, 2,000 potential hostages      prevent any meaningful debate about force.       The use of force has been further undermined by the      withdrawal of virtually all 300 aircraft deployed in the      fall, and by members' statements that any effort to implement      the Activation Order for airstrikes will require more votes      by NATO. Challenge inspections of potential Serb military      violations were forfeited in a Belgrade-NATO document      guaranteeing prior notice of all air verification flights.      Finally, the Serbs know from daily testing that aggression      will produce little more than a rhetorical rebuke and renewed      talks.       George Mitchell is said to have produced Ireland's Good      Friday Agreement by shuttling between 12 factions, few of      which were ever in the same room at the same time. The case      in Kosovo has been much simpler, with only two real points of      view, one seeking independence, one an interim autonomy      settlement. Since the summer ethnic cleansing campaign there      has been only one view: independence.       American negotiators, constrained by European anxiety and      inertia, have failed to accept the inevitability of this      objective. The administration clings to the idea that this      goal is unachievable politically and unwinnable through      combat. This is no longer the case.       The United States should have learned several pertinent      lessons in Vietnam. To win, the Kosovo Liberation Army does      not need to control territory. It must be able to maneuver at      will, be well trained, equipped and financed and enjoy      popular support. Last year's Serb offensive energized      universal popular support for the Kosovo Liberation Army      (KLA), and military analysts now point to substantial      improvements in the KLA's tactics, command and control,      financing and arsenal.       Our policies must recognize the essential goal:      independence for Kosovo. To achieve it, we must take several      steps:       Expand direct U.S. aid to nongovernmental humanitarian      organizations and improve the management of international      organization relief efforts.       Suspend U.S. funds for the OSCE observers.       Demand a NATO vote to implement the Activation Order for      airstrikes.       Recognize Kosovo's independence and implement plans to arm      the KLA.       Facing hard realities has always been America's best      course. It is the only course to follow in Kosovo.  Mr. McCONNELL. Rather than choosing this course, the U.S. and NATO have relied solely on the use of controlled airstrikes. Now, I supported this use of force and believe we should come to the defense of the Kosovar Albanians, the victims of genocide. However, the nightly strikes on Milosevic's terror machine have not stopped the massive killing. In fact, the atrocities have dramatically increased since NATO action began. Our halfhearted effort has allowed Milosevic the freedom to feed the most evil of instincts. Police, paramilitary, and army units are engaged in an effort to deport or exterminate 2 million Albanians.  Air power alone cannot stop this slaughter. This week the Albanian Government recognized this fact and called on the United States Government to arm the KLA. That was a shift in position of the Albanian Government. Recognizing the growing strength and tenacity of the KLA, the Albanian Government has switched positions and said we ought to arm the KLA.  I ask unanimous consent the article concerning that matter in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 20, 1999]                    Albania Asks West To Arm Rebels                            (By Peter Finn)       TIRANA, Albania, April 19--The Albanian government has      asked the United States and other NATO countries to arm the      Kosovo Liberation Army and Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani      is prepared to raise the subject when he meets with President      Clinton during the NATO summit in Washington this week, a      senior adviser to the Albanian leader said today.       The decision is a significant policy shift for Albania,      which until NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia began last      month had maintained an official policy of neutrality toward      the different Kosovo Albanian political movements, including      the KLA, which has been fighting to win the province's      independence.       But Prec Zogaj, a senior adviser to the Albanian president,      said today that one of the effects of the mass expulsion of      ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, as well as reports of Serbian      massacres of civilians, has been to transform the rebel army      into the single voice of Kosovo Albanians, sidelining      provincial leaders who advocate nonviolence.       Albania, in response, is now willing to throw its      diplomatic weight behind the guerrillas' appeals for arms      from the West, Zogaj said in an interview. ``We have to find      ways to send military aid to Kosovo,'' Zogaj said. ``In      Kosovo, the only force that protects civilians is the KLA,      but they do not have enough arms.''       The change of policy threatens to deepen the strains in      relations between Albania and the Serb-led government of      Yugoslavia, which broke off diplomatic ties with Tirana on      Sunday and whose armed forces have fired shells into northern      Albania in the past week. Although the Albanian army is in      disarray, the West has long been concerned that it would be      drawn directly into the Kosovo conflict and ignite a broader      war.       The rebels set up training camps in mountainous northern      Albania and smuggled arms into Kosovo from there. But the      Albanian government has not officially sanctioned their      activities on its soil, and argued that it was unable to      control the rebels' movements in the north because the region      was so lawless.       ``The KLA was [previously] a military segment of the Kosovo      liberation movement,'' Zogaj said. ``Today, now, the KLA is      the movement itself. There is no other option.''       In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin      said he was not aware of a formal request from Albania to arm      the rebels, but he said Albania has informally communicated      its desire to do so. The United States has made clear it      continues to oppose arming or training the rebels, Rubin      said.       The Clinton administration does not support the rebels'      objective of a Kosovo independent of Serbia, Yugoslavia's      dominant republic. However, administration officials have      warned that the longer NATO's air war continues, the greater      the chances are that the guerrilla army will fill a power      vacuum in Kosovo.       Zogaj said Albanian officials raised the question of arming      the Kosovo rebels with U.S. Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's      supreme commander, when he visited Tirana Saturday. Zogaj      said officials have made the same request repeatedly to U.S.      officials in the past three weeks. Zogaj said Clark refused,      adding that the general cited the arms embargo placed on      Yugoslavia as a barrier to such a move.       But Zogaj said that Albanian officials inferred from their      conversations with Clark that he really feared that if NATO      armed the rebels, Russia would arm the Serbs. Zogaj said the      KLA was obtaining new arms on the international black market      and continued to buy weapons from Serbian arms merchants      despite the war. Zogaj also estimated that 8,000 new rebel      recruits from other countries have arrived in Albania in the      past four weeks. If true, that could nearly double the size      of the rebel fighting force.       Albania is one of more than two dozen European countries      that will join NATO's 19 members in Washington, for a three-     day summit that begins Friday.  Mr. McCONNELL. Milosevic's storm troopers must face operations in the air and on the ground. The KLA is willing to wage this war on the ground. It is their homes that are being burned,their businesses destroyed; and, worse, their wives and sisters being raped, their families being slaughtered. They don't need convincing to summon the will to fight. What they need is international support.  Senator Lieberman and I have a proposal which will begin this effort. If the only people willing to fight are the KLA, we should do what we can to see that they have the ability to do so. Who else will provide the necessary deterrent to Milosevic and his army? The administration has made it clear that it will not be America's sons and daughters. I don't want to see United States soldiers fighting this war, but I also cannot abide the continued extermination of the people of Kosovo. They are entitled to defend themselves. We should not delay any further in our commitment to their legitimate cause.  Let me sum this up as I see my friend from Connecticut is here. What we have is a situation with the KLA where their leaders are in communication with the State Department and our military on a daily basis. We have an organization which, by telephone, is identifying military targets inside Kosovo for our planes. We are dealing with the KLA multiple times a day, both diplomatically and militarily. We are obviously pulling for them. We are egging them on. We are saying, ``Go out there and do it.'' But when they request an opportunity to be adequately armed, we say no. It is an utterly absurd position.  We have heard the rumors around town. We heard these in the 1980s, when the issue was supporting the contras, that there are some bad characters in the KLA. I don't think we have time to run a background check on everybody involved in this effort. The question is simply this: Who else is willing to fight the fight on the ground inside Kosovo on behalf of the Kosovar Albanians? There is nobody else willing to fight this war on the turf. We are already cooperating with them. We already deal with them on a daily basis. We are encouraging them. They are our allies. Why not give them the opportunity to engage in a fair fight on the ground inside Kosovo where the atrocities are occurring?  The growing suspicion of all of us is that this air war can go on forever and not have an impact on the real problem, which is inside Kosovo. The Senator from Connecticut and I believe we are advocating here a proposal that is in the best interests of the United States of America and of NATO. We have obviously picked a side. We are on their side. The question is whether we should fight this war entirely on their behalf or whether we should give them an opportunity to help us fight it--since it is their land, their family, and their principal concern. We think we have a proposal here that makes sense.  Finally, for a mere $25 million--which is less than we are spending on these air raids per night--we could arm the KLA for up to 18 months to give them a chance to defend their wives, their homes, and their families.  So I thank the Senator from Connecticut for joining with me on this proposal. I see he is here now to speak on its behalf.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 846       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
