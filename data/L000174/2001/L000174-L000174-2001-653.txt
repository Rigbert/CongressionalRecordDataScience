 I do also appreciate him saying that we now come to the vote. I point out this matter has come to a vote much quicker than the last contested Attorney General, which was in President Reagan's term, with a Republican-controlled Senate, where they took about 10 months to bring it to a vote. The nomination papers arrived Monday, we voted in the committee on Tuesday, and we are going to have a final vote on Thursday.
