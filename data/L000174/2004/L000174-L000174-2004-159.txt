President, I submit today a bill that will assist the States of Vermont and New York in commemorating the extraordinary cultural; historical, and recreational heritage of one of Vermont's greatest natural treasures, Lake Champlain.  Nearly 400 years ago, in 1609, Samuel de Champlain entered a green valley where he arrived at the lake that today carries his name. Lake Champlain stretches nearly 120 miles from Whitehall, NY, to the Richelieu River in Quebec and is nestled between the dramatic peaks of the New York's Adirondacks and Vermont's picturesque Green Mountains.  The Samuel de Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission Act of 2004 will authorize the National Park Service to fund a Commemoration Committee established with the Governors of Vermont and New York in order to plan national events for 2009 that celebrate the arrival of Samuel de Champlain and the rich heritage of the lake--which includes all people present when Champlain arrived in the valley and the communities that exist today.  We Vermonters sometimes affectionately refer to Lake Champlain as the ``Sixth Great Lake,'' and I have many fond memories of this wonderful lake. As a boy I spent time fishing and boating in its waters and over the years have taken my family on many enjoyable ferry rides across the lake. More recently I have become an avid scuba diver, and my own explorations of shipwreck sites in the lake have inspired me to educate others about its history and work to help preserve its unique heritage.  Just as in my own family's history, Lake Champlain's history links together Vermont and our Nation's storied histories.  Shortly after Champlain entered the region, what is now known as Lake Champlain was quickly recognized as the vital transportation route for the Northeast which had been used by Native peoples for centuries. Early settlers used the lake to explore unknown lands and create new settlements in the wilderness of Colonial North America.  Lake Champlain is awash in a rich maritime history. The chain of lakes that includes Lake Champlain has been called the ``The Great Warpath'' because of its use by early Colonial armies and flotillas. It played a critical role in the birth of the United States Navy through early military and naval struggles played out along its shores and in its bays.  The most famous naval battle on Lake Champlain occurred in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, when Benedict Arnold managed to successfully delay a British invasion of the rebelling colonies at the Battle of Valcour Island.  Lake Champlain holds one of the largest and best preserved collections of historic naval and other shipwrecks. As an avid scuba diver, I have viewed many of the shipwrecks first hand and am always awed by how well they have been preserved.  The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, Lake Champlain Basin Program, and many other Vermonters and New Yorkers have worked hard to preserve our fabulous maritime archaeological heritage so that other intrepid adventurers can dive in and explore a part of Vermont's past that helped shape the direction of our developing Nation.  Over the years as my family and I explored the lake's maritime history we also learned about its role in the growing economy of our young Nation. As the United States became more settled and stable, Lake Champlain became a center of flourishing commerce in the Northeast and a critical conduit for getting goods up and down the eastern seaboard.  In fact, historians call the 19th nineteenth century Lake Champlain's ``Golden Era'' of waterborne commerce. During that time the lake's peaceful waters were churning with the wakes of hundreds of steamboats, canal boats, ferries, merchant sloops and schooners--all plying their trade to markets in the Northeast and abroad.  Today, the storied waters of Lake Champlain are treasured by Vermonters and New Yorkers and millions more as an outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational resource. Activities such as boating, fishing, and tourism help Lake Champlain support a regional economy of more than $9 billion dollars. No other inland body of water has played such a decisive role in the history of the United States as has Lake Champlain.  The arrival of Samuel de Champlain had profound influence on our Nation's history that goes far beyond the simple naming of a lake--this event lead to a multitude of great historic, cultural, and economic achievements that to this day continue to influence life throughout the United States.  This legislation will help our country and the many small towns and groups around Lake Champlain properly celebrate our common heritage.                                 ______                                       By
