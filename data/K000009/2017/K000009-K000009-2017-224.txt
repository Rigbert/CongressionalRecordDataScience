Scarborough took place the day after Mr. Putin praised and propagandized Mr. Trump as ``bright and talented'' and the ``absolute leader of the Presidential race.'' That was about a year before our election. Months later, the President-elect asked the Russian Federation to hack Hillary Clinton's email. How about that by our President-elect?  September 8, 2016: At NBC's Commander-in-Chief Forum, Mr. Trump praised Putin by saying:       If Putin says great things about me, I'm going to say great      things about him . . . I've already said he is very much of a      leader. The man has very strong control over his country.  He is right about that. If you speak against Putin, you can be murdered in Russia.  America, pay attention.                          ____________________
