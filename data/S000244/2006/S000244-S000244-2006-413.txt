Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment would make technical corrections to H.R. 2965. The amendment modifies 13 dates in various provisions of the bill to reflect the passage of time since its introduction, and also corrects one sectional cross-reference, and a reference to an executive branch agency.  In addition, this amendment adds a provision to correct an amendment that was accepted during the Judiciary Committee's markup, which would require Federal Prison Industries, Inc., to establish a cost accounting system. This technical change is necessary to implement the amendment. Finally, the proposed amendment makes a grammatical correction.  The changes are all technical in nature, but essential to the proper implementation of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Michigan claim the time in opposition?
