President, I thank the distinguished Senator, my good friend, for his very kind remarks in reference to my service on the Ethics Committee. I repeat the same basic substance of what he said on his behalf as well. It is a thankless and tireless but a very important job. I thank him for his comments.  As chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, we obviously and naturally have discussed this. So I know the strength of his views on this matter as well. Not only do I think this would be a very dramatic step backwards for us in terms of the public's perception of integrity of its Government, but I think it would be terribly unfair to the most conscientious Judges and Justices. Because a Judge's income from honoraria would depend on how often appearances and speeches were made, those who dedicate the most time and attention to their job as a judge would end up benefiting the least.  As I have indicated before, if we have a problem--and I think we do--regarding salaries for Judges, we ought to address the problem in that way.  I yield to my friend.
