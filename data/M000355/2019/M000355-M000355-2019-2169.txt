 President, for the past week now, the Senate has been considering a package of legislation to strengthen our Nation's diplomatic presence in the Middle East. The Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act would renew our commitment to Israel's security, expand cooperation with Jordan, and impose new consequences on the perpetrators of Assad's brutality in Syria.  When America's national security and vital interests are at stake, some circumstances require not only the use of important diplomatic tools but also direct involvement from the United States. That is why I introduced an amendment to S. 1, so the Senate can speak clearly and directly about the importance of our Nation's ongoing missions in Afghanistan and Syria.  I know a broad consensus about American leadership in the world exists in this body. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to this vision and to the men and women fighting on the ground to uphold it. I was glad to see a big bipartisan majority of this body vote to advance my amendment on Thursday. I hope a similar majority joins me in voting to approve this mainstream amendment today, and I look forward to passing this thoroughly bipartisan legislation later this week.                          ____________________
