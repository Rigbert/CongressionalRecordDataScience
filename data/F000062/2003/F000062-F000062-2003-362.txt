 President, I rise in support of Justice Callahan to go from the California State appellate court to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This woman was really born in Senator Boxer's and my backyard. She is a Bay area person. She was born in Palo Alto. She attended Stanford, graduated with honors, attended the University of the Pacific McGeorge Law School. She has been both a deputy city attorney and deputy district attorney. She founded the first child abuse unit in the DA's Office of San Joaquin County. In 1996 she was elevated to the State Court of Appeals from the Superior Court of San Joaquin County. She has served with distinction for the past 6 years, has extraordinarily strong support.  I certainly believe, and I believe Senator Boxer concurs in this, that she is going to be an excellent judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am delighted to support her and to recommend her and to vote for her.  I yield the floor.
