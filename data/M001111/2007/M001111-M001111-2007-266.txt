 I have a number of Senators who are asking us to call up amendments. We would like to work with all of you to do that in a regular fashion. Maybe we can do that after the Senator from Louisiana is speaking, but at this point we are going to allow the Senator from Louisiana to speak and then move back to regular order, which will then be the Grassley-Inhofe amendment, No. 2444.
