 President, I rise to pay tribute to a great Kentuckian and a man who has dedicated his entire career to promoting civil rights and helping people. My good friend Ben Richmond, the longtime president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, recently announced his impending retirement from that position. Mr. Richmond has served as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League for nearly 30 years-since 1987.  Mr. Richmond is a civil rights champion who has led a venerable civil rights institution such as the Louisville Urban League to new heights. Under his tenure, the Louisville Urban League has promoted job training and education for many in Louisville's African-American community. His body of work is so outstanding that in 2007 he received from the city the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award, a recognition for a local activist who is dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted peace, equality, and justice.  Since Mr. Richmond took over the Louisville Urban League, the staff has grown from around 20 to 30 and the annual budget grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 million. Mr. Richmond is the driving force for fundraising for the budget.  The Louisville Urban League placed more than 200 people in jobs last year with a combined annual income of nearly $5 million. It helped about 1,000 prepare for finding employment through career expos, job training, referrals, and career counseling. It also has many programs to help youth and seniors.  The Louisville Urban League is nearly halfway towards realizing their goal of seeing 15,000 local African Americans earn college degrees between 2012 and 2020. Mr. Richmond oversaw the Louisville Urban League's move to a new headquarters in 1990. And under Mr. Richmond's tenure, the Louisville Urban League was just one of 13 Urban League affiliates nationwide to receive a top score in a self-audit required by the National Urban League.  We are lucky, that after his retirement, Mr. Richmond plans on staying in Louisville. Our city can continue to benefit from his wisdom and experience. I want to wish my good friend Mr. Ben Richmond all the best in retirement, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Ben for his successful tenure at the helm of the Louisville Urban League. The city of Louisville and the State of Kentucky have certainly benefitted immeasurably by his many efforts over the decades.  The Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper recently published an article extolling Mr. Ben Richmond's many accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 21, 2015]                   Urban League CEO Richmond Retiring                         (By Sheldon S. Shafer)       Ben Richmond, a cornerstone of local social activism for      more than a quarter century and a major advocate of economic      equality, is retiring as president and CEO of the Louisville      Urban League.       Richmond announced his impending retirement at an Urban      League board meeting Tuesday, after serving as head of the      civil-rights organization since 1987.       Under the leadership of Richmond, a mainstay in the push to      improve economic development in western Louisville, the Urban      League has long been dedicated to promoting job training and      education, primarily for Louisville's poorer citizens.       Richmond ``has been one of the anchors for diversity and      for stability in not only the African-American community but      the overall Louisville community,'' said Raoul Cunningham,      Louisville NAACP president. ``I am going to miss Ben, his      counsel and his cooperative spirit.''       Richmond ``has become known around the country for      innovative and groundbreaking approaches to helping residents      improve their quality of life,'' said Dan Hall, a University      of Louisville vice president and the Urban League board      chairman. ``He is intensely passionate about helping      individuals find a pathway to success.''       Richmond received Louisville Metro's Dr. Martin Luther King      Jr. Freedom Award in 2007, an annual recognition given by the      city to a local activist dedicated to King's principles and      who has promoted peace, equality and justice.       Then-Mayor Jerry Abramson said at the time that ``over his      decades of leadership, countless lives have been improved      through Ben's tireless efforts in workforce development,      housing and youth programs.''       The national Urban League was founded in 1910, and the      Louisville agency in 1921. The local league was set up      chiefly to help rural black Southerners who had moved to      Louisville after World War I.       The Louisville Urban League under Richmond has greatly      expanded its reach. It placed about 250 people in jobs last      year and     helped around 1,000 more prepare for finding employment. The      league's career-development efforts range from helping job      seekers draft resumes to mock job interviews.       In recent times the league has sponsored Saturday morning      enrichment classes for children. And it has found buyers for      dozens of new single-family homes built on vacant or      abandoned property under its Project Rebound program in      Russell, helping to transform the surrounding neighborhood.       League efforts annually include career expos; job training,      referrals and career counseling; a variety of services for      employers; homeownership training and counseling: a health      and wellness program called Get Fit Louisville; a walk to      defeat childhood obesity; and a long list of programs to help      both youths and seniors in many ways.       Benjamin K. Richmond, 71 and single, was born in Durham,      N.C., and raised in Jackson, Miss.       Richmond came to the Louisville Urban League as president      and CEO in 1987, after top jobs with league affiliates in      Wisconsin and Michigan. Richmond here replaced the league's      longtime leader, the late Art Walters. Walters, who died in      2010 at age 91, directed the Louisville Urban League from      1970 to 1987.       Since Richmond took over, the league's staff has grown from      around 20 to 30--also aided by dozens of volunteers--and its      annual budget has grown from under $1 million to around $3.3      million this year. The funds have been cobbled together      largely by Richmond--from Metro United Way and numerous      public and private sources.       The current budget, for instance, includes about $340,000      from United Way, less than $100,000 from Metro Government and      a $1.2 million federal grant earmarked primarily for programs      for seniors.       The league has several departments, including the Center      for Workforce Development, the Center for Housing and      Financial Empowerment and the Center for Youth Development      and Education.       Richmond said in an interview Monday that he expects to      remain on the job until around June 30, or until a      replacement is named by the agency's board, after a planned      national search. He said he may then stay on under a contract      for a while longer.       Richmond intends to stay in Louisville, while traveling      some to visit relatives in Mississippi and Arizona.       But he pledges to remain active, noting that ``there are      many opportunities in both the public and private sectors      here. I will see what emerges. But I want to have fun.''       Among many achievements during his tenure, Richmond cited:       Opening the league headquarters in 1990 at 1535 W.      Broadway, a 19,000-square-foot office, community meeting      site, classroom and job-training facility. The league      invested $1.6 million in the headquarters, which was paid off      long ago. Richmond said the league headquarters has spurred      significant nearby development along Broadway.       The economic impact of the league in terms of finding jobs      for more than 200 people last year. Their combined annual      income should be nearly $5 million.       Richmond noted that in recent years the league helped find      jobs for dozens of minorities in construction of the KFC Yum!      Center, and he said the league was instrumental in getting      the PGA of America to establish an urban youth golf program      and also hire top staff minorities.       That a halfway point has nearly been reached toward a      goal--shared with partner organizations such as Simmons      College and Jefferson Community and Technical College--to      have 15,000 local African-Americans earn college degrees      between 2012 and 2020. The minority effort is part of the      community's 55,000 Degrees effort.       That the league last year received a top score in a self-     audit--a review of its staff, policies, finances and      procedures--required every three years by the National Urban      League. The Louisville agency was just one of 13 affiliates      of the national organization to achieve that status, Richmond      said.       Richmond said he is proud that under his oversight the      local league has attained financial stability, adding that he      believes his organized is widely respected.       Under Richmond, the league has become more diversified.      About half of its 36-member board and about half the staff      are white. Richmond said he has strived to ``practice what we      preach--racial diversity.''       Richmond ``has been a tremendous leader,'' said Metro      Councilman David Tandy, D-4th District. ``There is still work      to do, but he has been at the forefront of the second, or      third, wave of the civil-rights movement, focusing on      economic opportunity. . . . He has played a pivotal role in      the community.''       Richmond ``has tried to create opportunities and meet      challenges our community has faced,'' said longtime ally Sam      Watkins, president of the Louisville Central Community      Center, another West End-based, pro-development group.       ``He's been a champion for west Louisville and has been      proactive in trying to garner desperately needed attention      for the area's issues and problems.''                          ____________________
