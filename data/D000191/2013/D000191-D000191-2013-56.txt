Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Again, there are grounds for some agreement here. I agree with the gentleman from California that this very sensitive issue, access to forest lands, is critically important to people who live in, around or near the forest, or people who choose to travel there to recreate.  We recently had a disastrous example in my State. The Proposed Travel Management Plan in the Wallowa-Whitman Forest, which is in Mr. Walden's district in northeast Oregon, the plan was developed in 2009, little public input; would have closed a substantial amount of the road network. It became a huge, huge controversy because of the lack of public involvement. I had complaints from my constituents and we're 250 miles away. Although I do recreate sometimes in that forest, but it's not on the road. I access the areas by forest roads. So this is something that was of major concern.  A regional forester who was new said, yeah, you're right, they really screwed this up; let's do it over again. They started all over again in a very collaborative public process.  But this goes a little bit beyond requiring the public to be notified and involved. In fact, it's a little contradictory because major parts of this bill do away with NEPA, which does require meaningful public involvement and response to comments by the public meaningfully by the agency. So I don't know whether we've removed that requirement from the existing law for the removal of roads and that's why we have to have this amendment or not.  But this goes a little further. It says these would be legally created roads. As you know, I mean, we get people down in Nevada and elsewhere arguing with the government or even attempting to take back government property by saying these are legally created and are not the property of the Forest Service.  So first you have to decide which roads are legal, which are covered, which are illegal, not covered. Who is going to decide that? The Forest Service user group who has an informal road that they have established? How will that help with this problem?  It also requires the Forest Service to make a specific decision regarding a road or trail closure, including adequate and appropriate public involvement. Okay. Well, what are those standards as opposed to, say, the NEPA standards which should apply in these cases? So I think that this could actually lead to more confusion and litigation.  I agree with the gentleman that there is a problem. This is a sensitive area. In some areas the Forest Service has not dealt well with it and believe there are other avenues to a solution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, perhaps I could assist the gentleman in his confusion by simply reading the amendment, which is simple, straightforward, and clear:       The Forest Service shall not remove or otherwise eliminate      or obliterate any legally created road or trail unless there      has been a specific decision, which included adequate and      appropriate public involvement, to decommission the specific      road or trail in question. The fact that any road or trail is      not a Forest System road or trail, or does not appear on a      Motor Vehicle Use Map, shall not constitute a decision.  That is it. That is the alpha and omega of this amendment in its entirety. If you're going to close a public road to the public, you need to ask them first.  I cannot emphasize enough how important this is to the mountain communities of the Sierra Nevada that depend on mountain tourism for their economies. Tourists don't go where they're not welcomed. Tourists don't visit where they can't get to. The public's use of mountain trails and roads is absolutely central to mountain tourism, and removing or closing these trails or roads is not something that should be done behind closed doors by administrative fiat.  I ask for your ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, that doesn't address the concern about legally created road or trail. Again, I'm not aware that there is a definition elsewhere in the bill, nor in this amendment, for ``legally created.'' And there is tremendous controversy and litigation over the issue of ``legally created.''  It does go on to say:       The fact that any road or trail is not a Forest System road      or trail, or does not appear on a Motor Vehicle Use Map,      shall not constitute a decision.  That leaves open the issue of informal-use roads, potentially in sensitive areas, that would have to go through a process before they could be closed. What if it's a newly developed ORV trail through a sensitive meadow? We had someone running doughnuts up in a very sensitive meadow in the Three Sisters Wilderness in an area--on the edge of the Three Sisters Wilderness. I mean, did that become a road or a trail that then would be available to vehicles and we couldn't close that area? And they did, they put in big rocks and other things to close the area off to motor vehicles. Would that have been precluded under this amendment? I don't know.  This opens too many questions to controversy and interpretation. There are times when we do need to act quickly when abuse is taking place. There are other times when the Forest Service has to act more deliberately. I believe the Forest Service can do a better job. I believe in having the public notified, the public fully involved; And the best way to do that on these roads is through NEPA.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part C of House Report 113-215.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:     SEC. 508. LIMITATIONS ON TYPES OF DAMAGES THE FEDERAL                    GOVERNMENT MAY SEEK ARISING FROM WILDFIRES.       The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the United      States, may not seek intangible damages from a landowner from      whose land wildfire escaped to Federal land when such      intangible damages are not permitted by the law of the State      in which the landowner's land is located.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 351, the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. LaMALFA. I appreciate working with the chairman of the committee, Doc Hastings, on the amendments to this legislation.  This amendment seeks to prevent the Department of Justice from seeking excessive, unquantifiable damages from property owners who have fires accidentally escape from their property onto public lands.  We have seen U.S. Attorneys sue landowners for hundreds of millions of dollars above the damage to national forests and the costs of firefighting based on very speculative claims about the value of habitat--claims which appear to be based not on science, not on fact, but only on the desire to generate revenue for the government.  When the Forest Service gains as much revenue from lawsuits as it does from timber receipts from an actual working forest, something is surely wrong with the system. This language would help to end that problem in many Western States. However, I plan to continue working on this issue until we develop a 50-State solution to this problem. So it is for these reasons that I respectfully ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment at this time.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.  There was no objection.                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part C of House Report 113-215.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:     SEC. 508. DEFINITION OF FIRE SUPPRESSION TO INCLUDE CERTAIN                    RELATED ACTIVITIES.       For purposes of utilizing amounts made available to the      Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior for      fire suppression activities, including funds made available      from the FLAME Fund, the term ``fire suppression'' includes      reforestation, site rehabilitation, salvage operations, and      replanting occurring following fire damage on lands under the      jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned or following fire      suppression efforts on such lands by the Secretary concerned.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 351, the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                              {time}  2000  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, disasters like the massive Rim fire that impacts my colleague's, Mr. McClintock's, district in Yosemite National Park, which many people believe is a national treasure, and I agree, not only threaten residents, homes, and other structures, they also destroy valuable public property: forests that provide jobs in rural communities, revenue for local governments, and recreation for Americans.  Unfortunately, planning and procedural hurdles often prevent the Forest Service from salvaging usable timber and returning the land to a healthy condition.  This amendment enables the Forest Service to rapidly undertake salvage, rehabilitation, and replanting by allowing those activities to be included in fire suppression operational and funding plans.  When wildfires impact private timberland, owners know that salvage and restoration work must be conducted immediately. The window before decay and insects eliminates timber's value can be only weeks. Site rehabilitation must be done before the rainy season to prevent landslides and sediment from clogging waterways. However, the Forest Service's ability to conduct these operations on public lands is so restricted that timber which could generate jobs and revenue literally rots on the ground, even as adjacent private timberland is rapidly rehabilitated.  After the 46,000 Bagley fire in my district last year, private landowners sprang into action and, it is my understanding, that salvage and rehab operations are already complete on nearly all these private lands. These areas have been replanted and rehabilitated and soon will once again be healthy, productive forests. The Forest Service lands, however, lie nearly untouched as the value of the burned timber disappears.  In Trinity County, in northern California, 13 lightning-sparked fires burned over 250,000 acres during the memorable 2008 fire season and caused $150 million in suppression costs. However, the Forest Service conducted salvage and rehabilitation on just a few hundred acres, leaving an area one-third the size of Rhode Island blackened and scarred.  This amendment speeds the salvage and rehabilitation process by allowing the Forest Service to plan this work in conjunction with suppression plans and removes procedural hurdles by defining these activities as part of suppression efforts. The amendment allows, but does not mandate, the use of suppression funds for these efforts. Again, it does not mandate, but allows, the use of suppression funds for these efforts. The CBO has stated this amendment has no impact on overall Federal spending.  Finally, this language will offset firefighting costs by generating revenue for local communities and the Federal Government through salvage operations. Federal agencies spent over $1.9 billion on firefighting in 2012, and every dollar derived from salvaged timber is one less dollar diverted from other programs.  As you may know, I have cosponsored an amendment with Representative McClintock streamlining judicial delays that slow salvage operations. This amendment complements that language by accelerating the salvage and rehabilitation planning progress but functions independently.
