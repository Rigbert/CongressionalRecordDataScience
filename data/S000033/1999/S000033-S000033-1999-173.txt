 Speaker, let us be clear. This budget is a disaster for American veterans and this rule is a disaster for veterans. And that is why this rule is being opposed by almost every major veterans organization in the country, including AmVets, the Blinded Vets, the DAV, the Paralyzed Vets, the VFW, and the Vietnam Vets.  The truth is that the President's budget for veterans is totally inadequate and the Republican budget for vets is even worse. It is unacceptable to me that in a time when some Members of this body want to give tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, we cannot come up with $3 billion to protect medical care for veterans all over this country.  Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, by a unanimous vote, the Senate did the right thing and they raised the amount of money available to vets. We need to defeat this rule, send it back, so that we can join in the Senate and say ``yes'' to our veterans and make sure they get the medical care to which they are entitled.
