 President, I am happy to join Senator Chafee in introducing the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to urge the Senate to pass S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act.  This bill was originally introduced by the late Senator John Chafee, who dedicated much time and energy to this important legislation. It is with great honor that we carry with his efforts for passage of this critical legislation.  I would like to submit for the Record a letter I received from an Iowan. Her story illustrates the urgent need for passage of this bill.  Barbara Morrow of Evansdale, Iowa, was diagnosed in January 1995 with breast cancer after being screened by the CDC Early Detection Program. Because she had no insurance and no money, she had little hope of finding medical care to treat her disease.  After exhaustive efforts, she was able to secure medical treatment from doctors willing to perform charity care.  Unfortunately, in January 1999, she learned that her breast cancer had spread to her lungs. She returned to the same doctor who treated her earlier. For 14 months, she has been receiving chemotherapy and is alive today.  Ms. Morrow owes more than $70,000 for treatment she has received. She pays what she can each month to the hospital where she receives her care. The bills cause great worry and she considers stopping treatment to stop the bills.  She is a mother and a grandmother and she wants to live.  It is urgent that Congress pass S. 662 to allow women to receive the treatment they need to beat this disease. We have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of thousands of women and mothers across the Nation.  I urge your support for this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me by Barbara Morrow be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Charles Grassley,      444 N. Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to urge you to pass S.      662, The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. In January      1995 I was diagnosed with breast cancer after receiving a      mammogram through the Center for Disease Control Breast and      Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (CDCBCCEDP). I had no      insurance and no money to pay for treatment. I have been      struggling ever since.       My struggles began when the results of my CDC mammogram      suggested breast cancer. Initially two doctors refused to      perform a biopsy because I had no insurance. Finally, Dr.      Gerrelts in Waterloo agreed to take me as a patient and      perform a biopsy for free. The biopsy was malignant and three      to four days later Dr. Gerrelts performed a lumpectomy. Dr.      Gerrelts made an appointment for me with Dr. Nadipuram, a      Waterloo oncologist. Dr. Nadipuram agreed to provide      chemotherapy treatment and a radiologist provided 8 weeks of      radiation without charge. I needed a surgically implanted      cath-a-port for administration of the chemotherapy. Dr.      Gerrelts did this surgery for free. I received six months of      chemotherapy ending in September 1995.       Even though my initial treatment for breast cancer was      complete without a lot of bills, the expenses began to mount      from then on. I needed a cath-a-port flush every 6 weeks,      check ups every six months, and a bone scan every time I had      an ache. In January 1999, Dr. Gerrelts sent me for an x-ray      of my lungs. It was found the breast cancer had spread to my      lungs.       Dr. Gerrelts once again sent me to Dr. Nadipuram. Dr.      Nadipuram sent me to the University of Iowa Hospitals and      Clinics in Iowa City for treatment. At the University of Iowa      I had many biopsies, scans, and tests. Recurring breast      cancer was found in my brain also. University of Iowa told me      I did not fit the criteria for their stem cell transplant      program and all they could offer me is chemotherapy that      would keep me alive for six months.       I returned to my home in the Waterloo area devastated, with      no money, no insurance, and no hope. I once again asked Dr.      Nadipuram to treat my recurring breast cancer. He has been      treating me with chemotherapy ever since and I am still alive      14 months later.       I applied for Social Security disability benefits after my      diagnosis for recurring breast cancer. Over a year later, I      will finally begin to receive benefits April 19, 2000.      However, my medical bills have accumulated and these bills      must still be paid by me. I owe over $70,000. I send what I      can each month to Allen Hospital, Covenant Hospital, Covenant      Clinic, a radiologist, and Dr. Nadipuram all of Waterloo. I      also send money to the University of Iowa Hospitals and      Clinics and the doctors at the University of Iowa. In spite      of this I continue to be hounded by all of these institutions      and doctors asking me to pay more. My bills are so high I      often wonder if I should quit treatment so I will not saddle      myself and my family with so much debt.       But, my grandson was diagnosed with cancer at age 9. He is      now 16 and my daughter and I continue to care for him. I must      stay alive to help my daughter and grandson.       Breast cancer and it's treatment are overwhelming. Being      unable to pay for treatment is devastating. Please pass S.      662 so that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer      through the CDCBCCEDP can receive treatment.           Sincerely,                                                   Barbara Morrow.
