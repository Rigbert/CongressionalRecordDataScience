 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Friday, October 31. I further ask that on Friday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted, and that the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2646, the A-Plus Education bill, with the time until 10:30 a.m. being equally divided between Senator Coverdell and Senator Daschle or Senator Daschle's designee.
