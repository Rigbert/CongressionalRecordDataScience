 President, I have a question. Is the Senator saying that the President of the United States will fully be within the law if, when this passes tonight, if this were attached, if he is in a press conference and says, ``I want to compliment the Senate on expanding NATO, and I want to tell Senator Conrad I'm not certifying anything''--would that be OK legally?
