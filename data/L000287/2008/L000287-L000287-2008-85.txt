Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1102, I call up the bill (H.R. 5719) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to conform return preparer penalty standards, delay implementation of withholding taxes on government contractors, enhance taxpayer protections, assist low-income taxpayers, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
