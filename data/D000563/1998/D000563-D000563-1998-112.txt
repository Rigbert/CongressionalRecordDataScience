If the Senator from South Dakota is truthful in what he says, as I believe he is, and if a majority of the Senate supports this reform, why isn't this bill on the floor? If a majority of the Senators are prepared to vote for it, why isn't this bill being brought up for consideration at this moment?  Just a few minutes ago, the Senator from South Dakota made what is called a unanimous consent request to go to the bill. That is literally what it means. It takes unanimous consent of the Senate--not a majority vote--to bring it to the floor, and one Senator on the Republican side stood up and objected. So we were stopped in our tracks.  But can the Senator from South Dakota explain to those who are watching this debate why we have to go to a unanimous consent request to bring a matter to the floor which we believe enjoys the support of more than a majority of the membership of the Senate.
