Mr. Speaker, Rep. Randy K. Weber Sr., Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, and Rep. James P. McGovern should have been included as original co-sponsors of a piece of legislation that I introduced yesterday, H.R. 3526, a bill to permit persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to enter into transactions with certain sanctioned foreign persons that are customary, necessary, and incidental to the donation or provision of goods or services to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilian populations, and for other purposes or more simply, the Humanitarian Access Facilitation Act.                          ____________________
