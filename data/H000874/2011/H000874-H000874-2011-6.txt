Speaker, I appreciate the majority leader's observations. I don't think I got an answer to the question. But having said that, if in fact an agreement is not reached prior to, say, the middle of next week, is the House prepared to preclude the eventuality of 160 million people losing their tax cut? Are you prepared to preclude the possibility of 48 million people losing their Medicare benefits? Are you prepared to preclude 2.3 million people losing their unemployment insurance by acting on an overwhelmingly bipartisan agreement that was reached in the United States Senate?  I yield to my friend.
