But their leadership, Mr. Novelli,appeared at a press conference and endorsed it. I notice he has had a few things to say lately. He dislikes drug companies, but it is a little late for that conversation.  As you take a look at their prescription drug plan, isn't it interesting to the Senator when President Lyndon Johnson created Medicare and the bill was passed, he only needed 8 months to put the Medicare Program in place to cover seniors, and this President says he needs more than 2 years before he can actually offer the benefits of his prescription drug program. Does the Senator from Michigan have any idea why this takes so long and why the President wants to wait?
