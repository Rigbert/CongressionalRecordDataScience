President.  I would like to pick up on a couple of points made by Chairman McCain, and particularly on this matter of tackling the issue in a bipartisan way.  Certainly, when a consumer business gets flattened early in the next century as a result of a Y2K failure, they are not going to ask, is it a Democratic failure or a Republican failure? They are going to say: I have a problem. What is being done to fix it?  The central point we have been trying to make--Chairman McCain, and Senator Dodd, who is the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, and I--is that we have spent many weeks trying to tackle this in a bipartisan way.  The fact of the matter is that when the bill came out of the Senate Commerce Committee, we were not at that time able to come before the Senate and say we did in fact have a bipartisan bill.  As a result of the negotiations that have taken place for many weeks now--led by Senator Dodd, our leader, Senator Feinstein of California who has great expertise in this matter, and a variety of Democrats--we have now a bill that has 11 major changes that assist consumers and plaintiffs in getting a fair shake with respect to any litigation which may develop early in the next century.  These were all areas where a number of Members on the Democratic side of the aisle thought that the original Senate Commerce Committee bill came up short. We went to Chairman McCain, and we said we would like to get a good bill; we would like to get a bill the President of the United States could sign; we would like to get a bipartisan bill.  We said we had a few bottom lines. One of them was that we were not going to change jurisprudence for all time; this was going to be a time-limited bill. Chairman McCain agreed to our request that this last for 36 months. This is a sunsetted piece of legislation. We insisted this bill not apply to anybody who suffers a personal injury as a result of a Y2K failure. If you are in an elevator or you suffer some other kind of grievous bodily injury as a result of a Y2K failure, all existing tort remedies apply.  We took out all the vague defenses that some people in the business community earlier thought were important. We said we are not going to give somebody protection if they just say they made a reasonable effort to go to bat for a plaintiff or the consumer.  Those 11 major changes were made to try to be responsive to what the White House and a variety of consumer groups feel strongly about.  Frankly, the area I am most interested in, in public policy, is consumer rights. I started with the Gray Panthers. I was director of the Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected to the House of Representatives, making sure that consumers got a fair shake and that the little guy was in a position, if they got stuck in the marketplace, to have remedies. That is at the heart of my public service career.  I believe this is a balanced bill. This forces defendants to go out and cure problems for which they have been responsible. It also tells plaintiffs we would like them to mitigate damages; we would like them to figure out ways to hold down the cost; we should direct as much as we possibly can to alternative dispute systems. Picking up on the theme of Chairman McCain, that is a bipartisan proposition. I think we have been responsive to key concerns that have been made by those with reservations about this bill.  There are some areas where we cannot go. I will emphasize as we move to today's debate a couple of those big concerns. We cannot allow under our legislation the creation of new Y2K torts that are not warranted on the basis of the facts. We believe, in areas like the economic loss issue which was debated so intensely yesterday, that the appropriate remedies involve State contract law. When consumers are faced with economic losses, we want to see them get a fair shake in this area, and we believe State contract law should govern.  What we are not able to do is allow those who believe State contract law is inadequate with respect to economic losses, we cannot support them repackaging those claims as new Y2K torts. We favor the status quo. With respect to economic losses, we want to see consumers protected in the right of contract. However, this Member of the Senate thinks it would be a big mistake to create on the floor of the Senate today and in the days ahead new Y2K torts, new tort claims, that don't exist today under current law.  I am very hopeful that we are able to finish this legislation today. It is bipartisan legislation now as a result of the 11 changes that have been made. I am very hopeful the White House will not veto this legislation. I have said repeatedly that to veto a responsible bill is just like lobbing a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving the Nation's prosperity. That is what is going to be the real effect of vetoing a responsible bill in this area.  We continue to remain open to ideas and suggestions from colleagues. We want this bill signed. We have made, as I say, 11 major changes since this bill left the Senate Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis under the leadership of Senator Dodd, who is the Democratic leader on the Y2K issue. There are areas where we cannot go, such as the creation of new Y2K torts in this area.  I look forward to today's debate and am anxious to continue to work with colleagues in a bipartisan way. I am very optimistic that the bill the Senate hopefully will pass today will get the support of the White House.  I yield the floor.                     Amendment No. 612, As Modified  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I send a modification to amendment No. 612.  It is my understanding this amendment is acceptable to both sides.
