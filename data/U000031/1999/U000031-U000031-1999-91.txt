Chairman, I would just like to point out that this is a small step but it is a small step in the right direction. Full accountability, full offsets, keeping our promise to the American taxpayer is something that I think we all believe in here, and if we are going to be a fiscal conservative and think about the dollars going out, we have to support this amendment to make sure it is 100 percent pure.
