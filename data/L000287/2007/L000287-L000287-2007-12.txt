Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.  Under this administration, we have adopted a record eight free trade agreements. In trade and globalization, there are winners and there are losers.  Mr. Speaker, increasing the funding and efficiency of the trade assistance program is the very least we can do as a Congress.  In my home State of Georgia, we have used more than 125 percent of our allotment. Why? Because agriculture and textile jobs are disappearing. They're leaving the State of Georgia.  These families are struggling just to make ends meet. They want to work. They need to work. How can we oppose, how can we be against investing in our greatest asset, the American workforce?  We can spend hundreds, thousands, millions and billions of dollars on war. Can we spend just a few dollars on the workers of America?  To oppose this bill is heartless, it makes no sense, and it is irresponsible.  So I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this important bill.         Modification to Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. McCrery  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during consideration of H.R. 3920, pursuant to House Resolution 781, the amendment printed in part B of House Report 110-417 be modified by the form I've placed at the desk.
