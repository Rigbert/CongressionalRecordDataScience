 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hugh L. Grundy for his many years of service to the United States. On June 30, 2001, Hugh will be honored by the City of Crab Orchard, Kentucky, for his dedication to our Nation, and I know my colleagues join me in expressing our gratitude for his many contributions.  Hugh Grundy is a true American hero and has dedicated much of his life to the cause of freedom. During World War II, he served as a Major in the U.S. Army Air Corps/Air Force. After that, Hugh went on to serve concurrently as president of the Civil Air Transport and Air America. Secretly owned by the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, these two air transport organizations were staffed by civilians who conducted undercover missions in Asia and other parts of the world in support of U.S. policy objectives. Often working under dangerous conditions and with outdated equipment, CAT and Air America crews transported scores of troops and refugees, flew emergency medical missions, and rescued downed airmen. Hugh and the brave people he commanded played a vital role in the war against Communism and their commitment to freedom will never be forgotten.  Hugh Grundy is a native Kentuckian. Born on his parents' farm in Valley Hill, KY, he grew up helping his father raise and show yearling saddle horses. While Hugh's love for aviation and his service to our Nation caused him to be away from the Commonwealth for many years, he returned to the Bluegrass to retire. Hugh and his wife of 58 years, Elizabeth, or ``Frankie'' as she is known to her friends, now live on their family farm, called Valley Hill Plantation. After many years on the go, Hugh and Frankie are very content with the peace and quiet associated with farm life.  Although Hugh Grundy is now retired, his record of dedication and service continues. On behalf of this body, I thank him for his contributions to this Nation, and sincerely wish him and his family the very best.                          ____________________
