Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 114) concerning the importance of the distribution of food in schools to hungry or malnourished children around the world.  The Clerk read as follows:                            S. Con. Res. 114       Whereas there are more than 300,000,000 chronically hungry      and malnourished children in the world;       Whereas more than half of these children go to school on an      empty stomach, and almost as many do not attend school at      all, but might if food were available;       Whereas the distribution of food in schools is one of the      simplest and most effective strategies to fight hunger and      malnourishment among children;       Whereas when school meals are offered to hungry or      malnourished children, attendance rates increase      significantly, particularly for girls;       Whereas the distribution of food in schools encourages      better school attendance, thereby improving literacy rates      and fighting poverty;       Whereas improvement in the education of girls is one of the      most important factors in reducing child malnutrition in      developing countries;       Whereas girls who attend schools tend to marry later in      life and have fewer children, thereby helping them escape a      life of poverty;       Whereas by improving literacy rates and increasing job      opportunities, education addresses several of the root causes      of terrorism;       Whereas the distribution of food in schools increases      attendance of children who might otherwise be susceptible to      recruitment by groups that offer them food in return for      their attendance at extremist schools or participation in      terrorist training camps;       Whereas the Global Food for Education Initiative pilot      program, established in 2001, donated surplus United States      agricultural commodities to the United Nations World Food      Program and other recipients for distribution to nearly      7,000,000 hungry and malnourished children in 38 countries;       Whereas a recent Department of Agriculture evaluation found      that the pilot program created measurable improvements in      school attendance (particularly for girls), increased local      employment and economic activity, produced greater      involvement in local infrastructure and community improvement      projects, and increased participation by parents in the      schools and in the education of their children;       Whereas the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002      (Public Law 107-171, 116 Stat. 134) replaced the pilot      program with the McGovern-Dole International Food for      Education and Child Nutrition Program, which was named after      former Senators George McGovern and Robert Dole for their      distinguished work to eradicate hunger and poverty around the      world; and       Whereas the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education      and Child Nutrition Program provides food to nearly 2,000,000      hungry or malnourished children in 21 countries: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) expresses its grave concern about the continuing      problem of hunger and the desperate need to feed hungry and      malnourished children around the world;       (2) recognizes that the global distribution of food in      schools to children around the world increases attendance,      particularly for girls, improves literacy rates, and      increases job opportunities, thereby helping to fight      poverty;       (3) recognizes that education of children around the world      addresses several of the root causes of international      terrorism;       (4) recognizes that the world will be safer and more      promising for children as a result of better school      attendance;       (5) expresses its gratitude to former Senators George      McGovern and Robert Dole for supporting the distribution of      food in schools around the world to children and for working      to eradicate hunger and poverty around the world;       (6) commends the Department of Agriculture, the Agency for      International Development, the Department of State, the      United Nations World Food Program, private voluntary      organizations, non-governmental organizations, and      cooperatives for facilitating the distribution of food in      schools around the world;       (7) expresses its continued support for the distribution of      food in schools around the world;       (8) supports expansion of the McGovern-Dole International      Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program; and       (9) requests the President to work with the United Nations      and its member states to expand international contributions      for the distribution of food in schools around the world.
