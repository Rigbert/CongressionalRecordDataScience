President, in my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I also think it is necessary, as we wind down this debate, that I take care of a couple of misconceptions that occurred during the debate.  My late father, a man who had so much to do with shaping my views, a man who was a self-taught historian--a very good one, I might say--always told me if somebody misstates history, it is wise that someone else stands up and states it correctly so the mistake does not go down to the next generation.  There was a popular misconception behind the proposed constitutional amendment. The distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, touched on this on the first day of the debate, and actually again today, when she discussed her theory as to why victims are not specifically mentioned in either the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights.  According to Senator Feinstein, when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written in the late 18th century, public prosecutors did not exist. I should quote exactly what the distinguished Senator, my good friend, told us on this point. She said:       When the Constitution was written, in America in the late      18th century and well into the 19th century, public      prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence      criminal trials themselves by hiring a sheriff to arrest the      defendant, initiating a private prosecution. The core rights      of our amendment to notice, to attend, to be heard were      inherently made available to a victim of a violent crime.  She then quotes the following passage from an article by Juan Cardenas, in the ``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy'':       At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the      prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as      their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often      hired a prosecutor.  She then continued:       Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of      private prosecution. . . . [T]his began to happen in the mid      19th century, around 1850, when the concept of the public      prosecutor was developed in this country for the first time.  She then argued the Constitution must now be amended to rebalance the criminal justice system and ``restore'' rights to crime victims.  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also my friend, Senator Hatch, told us on Tuesday that he draws the same conclusion from history. He said that when the Constitution was drafted:       There was no such thing as a public prosecutor; victims      brought cases against their attackers.  He then said:       When the Constitution was drafted, victims of crime were      protected by the same rights given to any party to      litigation.  Not surprisingly, the majority views in the report of the Senate Judiciary Committee are likewise predicated on the notion of ``restoring''--``restoring'' rights to crime victims that they enjoyed at the time the Constitution and Bill of Rights were being ratified. The majority views said the following:       The Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment is      intended to restore and preserve, as a matter of right for      the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim      participation in the administration of criminal justice that      was the birthright of every American at the founding of our      Nation.       At the birth of this Republic, victims could participate in      the criminal justice process by initiating their own private      prosecutions. It was decades after the ratification of      the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that the offices      of the public police and the public prosecutor would be      instituted. . . .''  When I heard my distinguished colleague say there was no such thing as a public prosecutor in this country when the Constitution was drafted, I was surprised. I had been a public prosecutor. I was the vice president of the National District Attorneys Association at the time I was elected to the Senate. The fact is that, had I not opted for the anonymity of the Senate, I was next in line to become president of that association, one of my few regrets in having to leave to come here, but the Senate would not wait. And, frankly, I did not want to wait.  But as a former public prosecutor and one who studied a great deal of history of prosecution, I was quizzical. So I did a little research.  I might say, when I state that, you understand, of course, we Senators are often times but constitutional impediments to our staff. But, by the same token they deserve a lot of credit, Julie Katzman, in my office, an able lawyer, did a lot of research as did Bruce Cohen from the Judiciary Committee. They found this article by Mr. Cardenas that Senator Feinstein quoted, which does appear in volume 9 in the ``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.'' In fact, if you take the passage the distinguished Senator from California quoted and relied upon, from page 367, about how victims of crime used to act as their own counsel, it is describing the general practice in this country in the 17th century, not in the late 18th century when the Constitution was written.  Mr. Cardenas discusses what happened at the time of the American Revolution on page 371, a few pages after the passage quoted by the sponsor of this proposed constitutional amendment. He writes:       Whatever its derivation, the American system of public      prosecution was fairly well established at the time of the      American Revolution.  Mr. Cardenas notes that Connecticut was the first colony to establish a system of public prosecutors, in 1704, over 80 years before the Constitution was written.  In Vermont, the Office of the State's Attorney is established in chapter II, section 50 of the State constitution of 1793. Even before Vermont joined the Union as the 14th State, it had a system of public prosecutions run by the State's Attorneys. Samuel Hitchcock was State's Attorney for Chittenden County, VT, from 1787 to 1790, during the time that the Federal Constitution and the Bill of Rights were being written. Samuel Hitchcock was State's Attorney in Chittenden County, from 1787 to 1790, some time before I became State's Attorney, in the last century--or, this century, depending upon how we do this. In May of 1966, until 11:59 in the morning on January 3 of 1975, I served as State's Attorney, also, of Chittenden County. At 12 noon, January 3, I took a different job. I have held it ever since.  Now, private prosecutions may not have been eliminated in all the colonies by the time the Constitution was written. They were, however, eliminated in Virginia, home of some of the foremost architects of the Constitution. Mr. Cardenas writes:       [B]y 1711, the attorney general [of Virginia] appointed      deputies to each county in the state, and these deputies      began exercising their authority to prosecute not only in      important cases, but in routine ones as well. . . . By 1789,      the deputy attorney general had complete control over all      prosecutions within his county.  There was a place that had the sort of criminal justice system that the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and others attributed to the time the U.S. Constitution was written, but that place was not the United States. Mr. Cardenas describes it on page 360 of his article:       The right of any crime victim to initiate and conduct      criminal proceedings with the paradigm of prosecution in      England all the way up to the middle of the 19th century.  It was England that had a system of private prosecution in the 18th and 19th centuries, not the United States, not even New England in the United States.  To make sure I had my facts straight, I had to look through some other historical source material. I looked at an essay in volume 3 of the ``Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice'' by Professor Abraham S. Goldstein on the history of the public prosecutor in America. Professor Goldstein tells us essentially the same thing as Mr. Cardenas.  Most American colonies followed the English model of private prosecutions in the 17th century, but as Professor Goldstein tells us, that system ``proved even more poorly suited to the needs of the new society than to the older one.'' For one thing, victims abused the system by initiating prosecutions to exert pressure for financial reparation. These colonies shifted to a system of public prosecutions because they viewed the system of private prosecutions as ``inefficient, elitist, and sometimes vindictive.''  According to Professor Goldstein, some of the colonies have no history at all in private prosecutions. In the areas settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, consisting of parts of what are now Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, the Dutch brought public prosecutions with them.  In any event, Professor Goldstein comes to the same conclusions as Mr. Cardenas. On page 1287, he writes:       [B]y the time of the American Revolution, each colony had      established some form of public prosecution and had organized      it on a local basis. In many instances, a dual pattern was      established within the same geographical area, by county      attorneys for violations of state law and by town prosecutors      for ordinance violations. This pattern was carried over into      the states as they became part of the new nation.  Actually, for almost 200 years that was the system in my own State of Vermont. Now prosecutions are done by the State's Attorneys of the 14 counties and, in some instances, by the Attorney General.  Professor Goldstein goes on to discuss the fact that the Federal system of prosecution was always a system of public prosecution. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, enacted the same yearthe Constitution was ratified, the U.S. Attorney General was ``to prosecute and conduct all suits within the Supreme Court of the United States in which the United States might be concerned.'' The general authority to ``prosecute in each district'' for Federal crimes was vested in local U.S. district attorneys appointed by the President.  Professor Goldstein is a highly respected scholar. He is the Sterling Professor of Law at Yale Law School. In fact, at one time he was the dean of that prestigious institution. He is widely regarded as an authority on criminal law and criminal procedure. When Professor Goldstein says every American colony had established some form of public prosecution by the time of the Revolution, I think we Senators can probably take that to the bank.  To be on the safe side, since we heard Senators say otherwise about this, I thought we should check further. We checked another source, a 1995 article by Professor Randolph Jonakait of the New York Law School. It appears in volume 27 of the Rutgers Law Journal beginning on page 77. Not surprisingly, it says much of the same thing about the history of public prosecutions as I had already learned from Mr. Cardenas and Professor Goldstein.  I quote from page 99:       Although the American colonies initially followed the      English prosecutorial pattern, a different process began to      emerge around 1700. Public officials took responsibility for      the prosecution of crimes generally or just for the limited      set of offenses that directly affected the sovereign. As      public prosecutors emerged, private prosecutions in the      colonies disappeared. This evolution of the American criminal      justice system was quick and thorough. By the time of the      Revolution, public prosecution in America was standard, and      private prosecution, in effect, was gone. Indeed, it was so      established and taken for granted at the inception of the new      Federal Republic that public prosecutors, although not      mentioned in the Constitution, were, without debate, granted      exclusive control over prosecutions in Federal courts.  Mr. Cardenas, Professor Goldstein, and Professor Jonakait are all quite clear that the concept of government-paid public prosecutors did not develop in this country for the first time ``around 1850,'' as the Senate was mistakenly told on Tuesday. All these authorities agree that public prosecutors have been around in this country for much longer--about 150 years longer--and that they were the rule, not the exception, by the time Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton and all the other framers of our Constitution got together in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft our Nation's founding charter.  If the Bill of Rights, which was written a few years later, makes no specific mention of crime victims, it is not because the framers thought victims were protected by a system of private prosecutions.  My point, of course, is the proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights cannot be justified as ``restoring'' victims' rights enjoyed at the time the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were drafted. Rather, if we are to draw any lesson from history, it is that the framers believed victims were best protected by the system of public prosecutions that was then, and remains, the American standard for achieving justice.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter dated April 25 from Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben opposing the proposed constitutional amendment.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2000.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I write to convey the views of      the Department of Justice on S.J. Res. 3, a resolution      setting forth the text of a proposed Victims' Rights      Amendment (VRA) to the Constitution, which was voted out of      the Committee on the Judiciary on September 30, 1999, and      sent to the full Senate. The Department continues to have      significant concerns with four aspects of S.J. Res. 3.      Although we continue strongly to support a victims' rights      amendment to the Constitution, and would support S.J. Res. 3      if the concerns detailed in this letter were addressed, we      oppose the amendment in its current form. In the interim, we      hope you will continue to help crime victims through the      enactment of appropriate legislation.       As you know, the President and the Attorney General both      strongly support a victims' rights amendment that will ensure      that victims have a voice in the criminal justice system. See      Pres. Proc. No. 7290, 65 FR 19823 (Apr. 10, 2000); Speech of      Attorney General Janet Reno to the National Organization for      Victim Assistance (Apr. 7, 2000). At the same time, this      Administration believes that our constitutional system, which      the Framers established after much deliberation and debate,      has served our nation well for more than 200 years and should      not be altered without the most cautious deliberation. See      Statement of President Clinton in Support of Victims' Rights      Constitutional Amendment (June 25, 1996). Our support for the      VRA has rested on the premise that the Amendment would not      undermine existing constitutional provisions' thus, our first      concern has been that the resolution lacks an express      provision preserving the rights of the accused. In light of      our role as the chief federal law enforcement agency, our      support has also depended on the Amendment not hampering      effective law enforcement; accordingly, our second concern      has been the unduly stringent standard for creating      exceptions to the Amendment's applicability where necessary      to promote the interests of law enforcement. We are committed      to an amendment that gives real rights to victims while      satisfying these basic criteria. This letter augments our      previous letter of June 17, 1998 (enclosed), regarding the      then-current S.J. Res. 44, in which we noted the above-     mentioned concerns. This letter also reflects further      concerns we have about the Amendment's application to the      pardon power and the reopening of restitution that we      discussed with committee staff before markup in September.                  preserving the existing constitution       As we stated in our previous letter, we believe that, to      ensure the protection of existing constitutional guarantees,      the VRA should contain language that expressly preserves the      rights of the accused. To that end, we urged that the      following language be added: ``Nothing in this article shall      be construed to deny or diminish the rights of the accused as      guaranteed by the Constitution.''       Moreoever, we are concerned that new language that has been      added to the proposed VRA would further alter our existing      constitutional framework. Section 1 of S.J. Res. 3 has been      amended to grant victims the right ``to reasonable notice of      and an opportunity to submit a statement concerning any      proposed pardon or commutation of a sentence.'' This      provision would create an unprecedented incursion on the      President's exclusive power to grant pardons, commute      sentences and remit restitution. See U.S. Const. art. 2,      Sec. 2, cl. 1 (pardon power); Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256,      263-64 (1974) (commutation power falls within the pardon      power); see also Knote v. United States, 95 U.S. 149, 153-155      (1877) (pardon power includes authority to remit unpaid      financial obligations imposed as part of a sentence). The      Supreme Court has observed that ``the draftsmen of [the      pardon clause] spoke in terms of a `prerogative' of the      President, which ought not be `fettered or embarrassed.' ''      Schick, 419 U.S. at 263. The Court has also observed that      ``whoever is to make [the pardon power] useful must have full      discretion to exercise it.'' Ex parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87,      121 (1925). In addition, we note that this provision could      encroach upon the clemency powers of governors in states      where their authority is also plenary.       S.J. Res. 3 does more than simply diminish the control over      pardons that the Framers vested in the President; it does so      in particularly significant ways. The proposed language would      require the President to give victims notice and an      opportunity to submit a statement (Section 1), and would      arguably permit a court to reopen a pardon, commutation, or      remission of restitution (Section 2). It also seemingly would      authorize Congress to regulate the pardon power in some      respects by granting Congress ``the power to enforce [the      VRA] by appropriate legislation,'' rather than reserving      enforcement authority to the President (Section 3). By      contrast, under our existing constitutional framework, the      President has both the responsibility and authority to      determine the procedures for his Administration's handling of      executive clemency requests so that he may receive the      information he deems necessary, including input from victims      and others. The current procedures are set out at 28 C.F.R.      Sec. Sec. 1.1-1.10. The Department is presently exploring      how, and under what circumstances, additional victim      interests can be best integrated into the Department's      advisory role in counseling the President as he makes      decisions about clemency.       Furthermore, the pardon provision differs from the rest of      the VRA, which focuses on criminal proceedings. Although      other provisions of the VRA would give victims rights      in proceedings in which defendants have rights, the pardon      provision would grant victims rights in a setting in which      no one--including defendants--has ever possessed rights,      and that has always been controlled entirely by the      President. The Framers assigned this power wholly to the      President, and we oppose any amendment that would encroach      upon it.                        law enforcement concerns       As we have noted previously, we are concerned that the very      high standard for exceptions to the Amendment's victims'      rights guarantees in Section 3 of S.J. Res. 3 would render      the government unable to remedy the practical law enforcement      problems that may arise under the Amendment. We believe     that the authority to create exceptions should exist where      necessary to promote a ``significant'' government interest,      rather than the ``compelling'' interest required by the      current draft. It is important that the VRA be flexible      enough to permit effective and appropriate responses to the      variety of difficult circumstances that arise in the course      of implementing the Amendment. This concern is explained in      more detail in our letter of June 17, 1998.       Our last issue concerns the addition of restitution to the      list of proceedings and rulings subject to retrospective      relief. We believe that any remedies provision should strive      to make rights of victims real and enforceable, while      ensuring that society's and victims' interests in finality      and effective law enforcement are not undermined. Measured      against these objectives, we believe Section 2 of S.J. Res. 3      is overly broad and would unduly disrupt the finality of      sentences. The current language would appear to permit a      victim to reopen the restitution portion of a sentence for      any reason at all, at any time, even after a sentence has      been served in full. The problems for law enforcement that      could be caused by this provision include, for example, the      possibility that because of the limited economic means of      many defendants, restitution awarded to some victims at      sentencing might have to be decreased to accommodate      subsequent claims by victims who come forward after      sentencing; the potential that defendants will litigate the      reopening of a restitution order without the reopening of      other parts of the sentence; and the difficulty in reaching      and defending plea agreements in light of possible reopenings      of and changes in the terms of restitution. In our view,      these issues constitute serious obstacles to including      restitution among the matters subject to retrospective      relief.       Further, we believe the inclusion of restitution in Section      2 is not necessary in light of existing legislation providing      relief for victims who are denied restitution or whose      restitution is inadequate. If a federal court fails to impose      restitution in accord with controlling statutes, the      government can appeal the unlawful sentence without impairing      the defendant's Double Jeopardy rights. See 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 3742(b); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 137      (1980). Likewise, the States can legislatively protect      victims in this regard by authorizing state prosecutors to      appeal criminal sentences that do not satisfy state      restitution statutes. Congress and the States can also enact      legislation to address perceived gaps in current laws without      going so far as to amend the Federal Constitution.          doing more for victims while improving the amendment       This Administration, with Congress, as kept its commitment      to victims of crime, even as it has pushed aggressively for a      victims' rights amendment. We have witnessed historic      reductions in violent crime over the past seven years, and      through our efforts, criminal victimization is at its lowest      point in twenty-five years.       Even with the significant drop in violent crime, we have      not become complacent. In 1994 the President signed into law      the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which      gives victims of violent crime and sexual abuse the right to      speak out in court before sentencing, providing them the      opportunity to describe the impact such victimization has had      on their lives.       The Department, working with Congress, has also provided      unprecedented levels of funding for victims' services. Since      1993, we have received over $2.2 billion in the Crime      Victims' Fund, over 90 percent of which has been distributed      to the states and victims' compensation and assistance funds.      The Violence Against Women Act has also infused new dollars      into victim services: under that act, the Department has      funded nearly $1 billion in new domestic violence programs      for states, communities, and tribes since 1995.       In addition to funding, the Department has taken other      steps to improve the way it provides services to victims. We      are auditing every component that has any responsibility for      our contact with victims to assure appropriate staffing,      improve practices and address problems. We have also revised      and updated the Attorney General's guidelines for victim      assistance.       There is more yet that can be done while we continue to      strive for an appropriate constitutional amendment. For      example, as then Associate Attorney General Raymond Fischer      testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998, we      can enact federal legislation that will improve victims'      rights and services in the federal system while at the same      time providing funds and other incentives to states to      improve their own victims' rights laws and policies.\1\ By      passing such legislation, we can build a crucial bridge to      the victims' rights amendment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ In this regard, it is worth noting that, thanks to the      concerted efforts of crime victims' advocates and      governmental bodies at all levels, all fifty States have now      enacted laws safeguarding crime victims' rights in the      criminal justice process, and 32 States have amended their      constitutions accordingly.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       We appreciate the Judiciary Committee's willingness to work      with the Department on issues relating to the Victims' Rights      Amendment over the last four years. Although we continue      strongly to support a victims' rights amendment to the      Constitution, and would support S.J. Res. 3 if the concerns      detailed in this letter were addressed, we oppose the      amendment in its current form because it fails to do so. We      urge the Senate to continue to work with the Department in      improving the constitutional amendment, while in the interim,      continuing to assist crime victims through the enactment of      appropriate legislation. Should you have any questions,      please do not hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                     Robert Raben,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
