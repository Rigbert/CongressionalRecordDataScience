President, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico had an exemplary career as attorney general of New Mexico and, obviously, is in a position probably to know more about the bar of New Mexico than anyone else in his State; and his service replicates that of other Senators on both sides of the aisle from their representing their States.  My question is this: The traditions of the Senate mean so much, and most of them are there for a reason. The tradition of having to get clearance from home State Senators--and, of course, every State is equal in the Senate. But Federal judges have an enormous impact on the States. The tradition has always been that the home State Senators have the best idea who the Federal judge is who is going to be making decisions that affect the men and women of that State. This has not always been perfect, but has it been the experience--I ask this of my friend and former attorney general of his State, a Senator of great respect and competence--has it been his experience that in the main, very much in the main, this has worked extremely well?
