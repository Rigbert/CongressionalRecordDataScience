 President, I apologize to my colleagues for interrupting their conversation. Hopefully, it can continue upon completion of my remarks, and I may well wish to join in.                           Health Care Reform  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the American people have seen what Democrats in Congress plan to do with seniors' health care. They have looked on in disbelief as almost every Democrat in the Senate voted again and again and again to slash Medicare. Now they are watching in disbelief as Democrats float the idea of herding millions more--millions more--into this nearly bankrupt program as part of a backroom deal to force their plan for health care on the American people by Christmas.  Every day it seems we hear new revelations about secret conference room deliberations where Democrats arefrantically working to get their 60 votes by Christmas. And every day we hear about some new idea they have come up with for creating a government plan by another name. This week's version would have the Office of Personnel Management running the program, an idea that was shot down almost as soon as it was announced by the former OPM Director who said it couldn't be done.  This is what he said: ``I flat out think that OPM doesn't have the capacity to do this type of role.''  This is precisely the kind of approach Americans are tired of in Washington, and this is precisely the kind of health care plan Americans did not want.  Seniors thought they could expect lower costs. What they are getting instead is an assault on their Medicare. Small business owners thought they could expect lower costs. What they are getting instead are higher taxes, stiff fines, and costly mandates. Working Americans thought they would get more efficiency, less fraud, cheaper rates. What they are getting instead are new bureaucracies and higher costs.  Business leaders from across the country enthusiastically support the idea of health care reform. They know better than anyone that costs are out of control and that something needs to be done. But they have read the bill Democrats in Congress have come up with and they are telling us this isn't it. This isn't it, they are saying. Not only won't this bill solve the problem, they say, it makes the existing problems actually worse.  The Vice President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was here yesterday. He said there is a desperate need for reform--reform that bends the cost curve down. He said, unfortunately, this bill fails the test. He says this bill will only lead businesses to lower wages, decrease working hours, reduce hiring, and cut jobs. He said it adds to the deficit; it adds to the debt. It includes massive new spending programs and entitlements and incredibly, as I have noted, it also borrows from existing entitlement programs. It borrows from existing entitlement programs that are already in trouble.  Businesses look at this bill and they see $\1/2\ trillion in new taxes, as many as 10 million employees at risk of losing coverage, and crushing new mandates. This is not reform. This bill doesn't solve our problems, it spreads them. That is why seniors don't like this bill. That is why job creators don't like this bill. That is why public opinion has dramatically shifted against this bill.  Americans want reform, but this is not the one they asked for. This bill is fundamentally flawed and it can't be fixed. There is no way to fix this bill.  Americans want us to stop, they want us to start over, and they want us to get it right. Democrats should stop talking at the American people and start listening to them.  Now, Republicans are prepared to provide a platform for the debate as long as it takes--as long as it takes. The majority leader said we would be working every weekend. We take him at his word. We expect to be here this weekend, and we look forward to it. Republicans are convinced there is nothing more important we could do than to stop this bill and start over with the kind of step-by-step reforms Americans really want.  We have amendments. We want votes. We have been waiting since Tuesday to have more votes. We are eager to continue the debate.  Here is what my good friend, the majority leader, said when we started the debate on November 30:       Debating and voting late at night. It definitely means the      next weekends--plural--we'll be working. I have events I'll      have to postpone, some I'll have to cancel. There is not an      issue more important than finishing this legislation. I know      people have things they want to do back in their States, and      rightfully so. I know people have fundraisers because they're      running for reelection. I know there are other important      things people have to do, but nothing could be more important      than this, and we notified everybody prior to the break that      we would be working weekends.  We took the majority leader at his word when we started this debate on November 30 that we would be working weekends. Actually, it is a week later--this past Monday of this week--he said, ``It appears we certainly will be here this weekend again.''  My Members understood we would be here on the weekends. We don't think there is anything more important we can do, and we are a little bit upset--maybe more than a little bit--that we were not able to vote on an amendment yesterday. We have been prepared to vote for several days. There are amendments that have been offered that we can't seem to get a vote on. The American people are expecting us to vote on this bill, and we are here and prepared to do it. We would like to get started voting on amendments today.
