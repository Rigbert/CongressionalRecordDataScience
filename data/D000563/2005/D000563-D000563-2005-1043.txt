If the underlying purpose of this amendment is to allow the Boy Scouts of America, or similar organizations, to have their annual jamboree--which I understand they use military facilities and continue to do so, and I have no objection to that. Could I ask the chairman of this committee to please read with me on page 3, starting with line 16, the paragraph that follows, and ask him if he would explain this to me. As I read it, it says:       No Federal law shall be construed to limit any Federal      agency from providing any form of support for a youth      organization that would result in that agency providing less      support to that youth organization than was provided during      the preceding fiscal year.  As I read that, the Appropriations Committee could not appropriate less money for a youth organization next year than they did this year if we pass this permanent law. Is that how the Senator from Virginia reads it?
