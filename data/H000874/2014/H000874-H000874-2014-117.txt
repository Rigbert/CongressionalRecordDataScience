Speaker, the $155 billion, of course, is a gross figure and includes items beyond discretionary figures in that bill.  The fact of the matter is that NIH has been cut by a very substantially higher percentage than that, somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 percent, maybe 5 percent. So it is a substantial decrease in the ability to pursue grants, both external grants and internal research by the NIH, on the afflictions that confront our people, whether it be heart disease, cancer, pediatric research, diabetes, Alzheimer's. All of those will be affected to a much larger extent than would be projected by the gross figure of $155 billion to which the Leader responds.
