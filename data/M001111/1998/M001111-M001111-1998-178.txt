 President, in just a few days, the Department of Energy will lose one of its best, most able and selfless public servants. Al Alm, Assistant Secretary for the Department of Energy's Environmental Management program, is leaving federal service on January 31.  Al epitomizes the best in public service. Integrity and responsibility are his hallmarks. He has left those marks throughout the government, in academia, and in private industry. Al's government service has included positions in the Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of the Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, theEnvironmental Protection Agency, and two stints in the Department of Energy. He has been a tireless advocate for the programs in which he has been involved, most notably for me, cleanup of our nation's most polluted former defense nuclear production sites.  I personally found Al to be the most accessible and helpful assistant secretary in the administration. He worked closely with me, other members of the Washington congressional delegation, our staffs, and our constituents to ensure Hanford's most important programs received adequate funding and support. Al's steadfast support for Hanford, in the face of so many competing needs, has been outstanding. Whether it is safety, funding, expediting work, or employee concerns, he has been out in front. I will sorely miss Al.  Al has accomplished a lot in the 20 months in which he has served as the leader of Environmental Management. He has led the charge in revitalizing management and focusing energy on getting sites--and programs--closed, or well on their way to closure, by 2006. The billions of dollars and decades of time saved are extraordinary in themselves, but the public health and environmental protection are the real, tangible results of his efforts. He has helped us develop a goal and start moving toward that goal.  Mr. President, I want to say a big thank you to Al Alm on behalf of myself and my Senate colleagues. We will miss him and his leadership of a very difficult, complex and controversial program. We wish him all the best in whatever endeavors he undertakes and hope he leaves knowing how much we have appreciated his enthusiasm and hard work.                          ____________________
