He hit upon something here I do not think people are fully aware of or sensitive to, and that is the effect what we are doing here is having on the markets. We keep hearing if something happens, that there is an impasse, it is going to have a deteriorating effect. The markets have been very good. Interest rates are low. Things are going very well right now mostly because of the anticipation of the fact we are going to have a balanced budget.  I can remember so well, as the Senator can remember, when we had the discussion on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and we lost it by one or two votes and what happened to the markets after that and the devaluation of the dollar against the yen and the mark. The deterioration was unprecedented. And so I would suggest that what the Senator from Wyoming says is true. There is nothing we could do that would enhance the optimistic future of the economy than to go ahead and take this Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and pass it.  I do not think most people are aware, Mr. President, that we have passed a Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which essentially does what the President committed to do during the last continuing resolution. It does provide for a balanced budget, and it uses real numbers, CBO numbers, those numbers that come from the Congressional Budget Office, which the President stood before a joint session of the legislature and said is the most reliable source that we can use, so we can end smoke and mirrors and we can handle what is out there.  The thing that concerns me more than anything else, and I ask the Senator from Wyoming if he agrees, is that we have passed a budget. It does what the American people asked us to do in November of 1994. And the President does not have a budget. So while I am not in on the negotiations, how do you negotiate when you have a budget and the other side does not have one? I wondered if the Senator had figured that out yet.
