Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2828) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.R. 2828       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXTENSION.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified      in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that      would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission project numbered 12569, the Commission shall, at      the request of the licensee for the project, and after      reasonable notice, in accordance with the good faith, due      diligence, and public interest requirements of that section      and the Commission's procedures under that section, extend      the time period during which the licensee is required to      commence the construction of the project for up to three      consecutive 2-year periods from the date of the expiration of      the extension originally issued by the Commission under that      section.       (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period      required for commencement of construction of the project      described in subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall reinstate the      license effective as of the date of its expiration and the      first extension authorized under subsection (a) shall take      effect on the date of such expiration.
