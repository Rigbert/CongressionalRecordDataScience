 President, I am pleased today to return to the consideration of H.R. 2826, the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. I thought we had a very productive opening day yesterday. We heard from many of our colleagues. We will continue to do that. We have several amendments that we are in the process of reviewing on both sides of the aisle here, and we are doing our best to consider the views and concerns of all Members.  Again, I would like to reiterate this morning how important it is that Members let me and Senator Mikulski and our staffs know of any amendments they plan to offer. I urge those Senators with amendments to come to the floor. This is a very important bill. This funds a lot of very important agencies, and the quicker we can realize what we have to do and how we are going to go about it, the better off we are and we will expedite this legislation.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
