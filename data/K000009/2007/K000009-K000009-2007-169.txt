Though she passed away last year, her memory and her spirit continue. She is truly a woman who made a difference, and whose efforts echo beyond her lifetime.  The great-great-granddaughter to Chief Kaishpa Gourneau, great-great-granddaughter to Chief Sasswain, Henry Poitra and great-great-great-great-granddaughter to Chief Gaytay Manomin (Old Wild Rice), a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Joyce Mahaney grew up on the Turtle Mount Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota. Her Indian name Snow Feather (Koonea Meguen) was given to her by her great-grandmother, Cecelia Malaterre. A Naming Ceremony was done by her adopted father, Francis Eagle Heart Cree of Turtle Mountain, who is also the local spiritual leader and medicine man in the area.  She attended the Ojibwe Indian School, Turtle Mountain Community High School, and Minot State University where she received a degree in Education. She also attended the American Indian Training Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the University of Toledo. She came to Ohio in the 1970s following her marriage to Toledo native, Russell Mahaney. They raised two children.  In 1988, Joyce Snow Feather Mahaney founded the Toledo-based American Indian Intertribal Association. The purpose of the organization is to preserve and showcase American Indian culture through community activities. Her incredible leadership has developed the Association as a premiere showcase of Native American culture, language, and spirit. Several hundred Native Americans participate in the organization's ongoing activities such as: The Toledo Pow Wow, cultural programs, and the annual summer solstice ceremony at the site of the Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1794.  An adult education teacher, she was also Executive Secretary at the Toledo Museum of Art, served as executive director of the Cleveland Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program, and director of the Eagle Wing Program in Toledo and other Native American programs in northern Ohio.  Although she spent the last three decades of her life in Ohio, Joyce Snow Feather Mahaney has maintained her deep roots in the Turtle Mountain area, visiting family and friends and offering presentations in the community which captured the spirit of the indigenous people, the sacred land of her ancestors and the rich cultural heritage of the Plains Ojibwe.  An award-winning poet, she has written and self-published poetry books, Prairie Winds and Spirit of Dakota. In fact, the threads of this Ojibwe Prayer were woven deep into the fabric of the life of Joyce Snow Feather Mahaney, and describe her legacy most eloquently.                             Ojibwe Prayer     Oh Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the winds And whose            breath gives life to everyone, Hear me.     I come to you as one of your many children; I am weak .... I            am small... I need your wisdom and your strength.     Let me walk in beauty, and make my eyes ever behold the red            and purple sunsets Make my hands respect the things you            have made.     And make my ears sharp so I may hear your voice.     Make me wise, so that I may understand what you have taught            my people and The lessons you have hidden in each leaf            and each rock.     I ask for wisdom and strength Not to be superior to my            brothers, but to be able to fight my greatest enemy,            myself.     Make me ever ready to come before you with clean hands and a            straight eye.     So as life fades away as a fading sunset.     My spirit may come to you without shame.                          ____________________
