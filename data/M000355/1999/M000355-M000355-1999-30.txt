 President, the first amendment does not permit regulation of contributions or expenditures for issue advocacy. The Supreme Court has allowed regulation of contributions and expenditures that are (1) coordinated with a candidate--and thus a contribution--as well as (2) those that can be used to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, including independent expenditures by corporations and unions--but not independent expenditures of political parties. The Supreme Court has never allowed regulation of contributions and expenditures for issue advocacy and other activities that are (1) not coordinated with a candidate and (2) do not include express advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate.  Buckley and its progeny prohibit regulation of issue ads and contributionsand expenditures used to engage in issue advocacy. As originally drafted, the Federal Election Campaign Act FECA would have required disclosure of all contributions over $10 received by any organization which publicly referred to any candidate or any candidate's voting record, positions, or official acts of candidates who were federal officeholders.  The D.C. Court of Appeals struck down this ``issue advocacy'' provision in Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 821, 869-78 (D.C. Cir. 1975). The invalidation of the issue advocacy disclosure provision was the only part of the D.C. Circuit's decision that was not appealed to the Supreme Court. Back then supporters of regulation at least accepted the constitutional impossibility of regulating issue advocacy.  In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 43 (1976), the Supreme Court expanded upon the D.C. Circuit's view that issue advocacy could not be regulated and limited the scope of FECA's contribution limits and other regulations to cover only money used for ``communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.'' This includes money contributed to a candidate, his committee and the hard money account of his party.  The court stated that ``funds used to propagate * * * views on issues without expressly calling for a candidate's election or defeat are * * * not covered by FECA.''  And such funds cannot be covered by any bill Congress adopts because the Supreme Court said in Buckley that its narrow construction of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), limiting its scope to money that can be used for ``express advocacy,'' was necessary to avoid ``constitutional deficiencies.''  In sum, the Buckley Court looked at Congress' effort to cover ``all spending'' intended to ``influence'' elections and said we cannot regulate beyond the realm of express advocacy. Buckley held that:       So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in      express term advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they      want to promote the candidate and his views.  As one former FEC chairman, Trevor Potter, has written, Buckley.       Clearly meant that much political speech Congress had      intended to be regulated and disclosed without instead be      beyond the reach of campaign finance laws.  The outer bounds of constitutionally permissible regulation of political activity. The farthest the Supreme Court has ever gone in permitting constraints on political speech was its decision in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).  In this case the Court upheld prohibitions on independent expenditures--non-coordinated ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate--paid for directly from corporate treasuries.  There is no basis for construing this case as justifying restrictions or prohibitions on contributions or expenditures that are not express advocacy.  In fact, any argument that Austin provides a basis for contribution or expenditure limits on funds that do not go to a candidate and are not otherwise used for express advocacy is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978).  In Bellotti the Court ruled that a Massachusetts statute prohibiting ``corporations from making contributions or expenditures for the purpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters'' was unconstitutional because it infringed the first amendment right of the corporations to engage in issue advocacy and, more importantly, the wider first amendment right ``of public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas.''  The case made clear the distinction between portions of the challenged law ``prohibiting or limiting corporate contributions to political candidates or committees, or other means of influencing candidate elections'' (which were not challenged) and provisions ``prohibiting contributions and expenditures for the purpose of influencing . . . issue advocacy.  The Court explained that the concern that justified former ``was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through creation of political debts'' and that the latter (issue ads) ``presents no comparable problem'' since it involved contributions and expenditures that would be used for issue advocacy rather than communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.  Bellotti conclusively rejected prohibitions on contributions and expenditures for issue advocacy, while expressly leaving open the possibility that the government ``might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.''  And Austin merely confirmed that the state government could regulate or even prohibit independent expenditures by corporations, which are used to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. But Austin has nothing to do with contributions and expenditures for communications discussing issues.  The reformers are fond of the Supreme Court's statements in Austin concerning the corrupting influence of aggregated wealth. But this dicta does not support regulation of party soft money. And arguments predicated on it do not withstand scrutiny.  This clear from the fact that after Austin the Supreme Court stated in the 1996 Colorado Republican Committee case that ``where there is no risk of ``corruption'' of a candidate, the government may not limit even contributions.''  Moreoever, the Court has explained that the prohibitions on corporations and unions making contributions or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate are permissible to the extent that they ``prohibit the use of union or corporate funds for active electioneering on behalf of a candidate in a federal election'' the Court does not consider contributions and expenditures used for issue advocacy and purposes other than expressly advocating the election or defeat of a federal candidate to involve such risks because it has held that the government cannot prohibit ``corporations any more than individuals from making contributions or expenditures advocating views,'' that is a quote from Citizens Against Rent Control, 454 U.S. 290, 297-98 (1981).  Moreover, the Court has explained that ``Groups [such as political parties] . . . formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass capital'' do not raise the specter of distortion of the political process necessitating regulations on the use of the treasury funds of unions and for profit corporations because the resources of groups such as political parties and other issue groups ``are not a function of [their] success in the economic marketplace but popularity in the political marketplace.''  Restrictions on issue advocacy, including contributions for it are always invalidated by the Supreme Court. Consistent with this narrow definition of the legislative power to intrude into this most protected area of free speech, the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional the most rudimentary state and local restrictions on individuals, political committees and corporations when it involved regulation of issue advocacy and the funds that pay for it, as opposed to contributions or expenditures for express advocacy.  See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 356 (1995), invalidating requirement that issue-oriented pamphlets identify the author;  Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 197 (1981), invalidating city ordinance limiting contributions to committees formed to engage in issue advocacy.  First National Bank v. Belotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), invalidating law banning corporate contributions and expenditures for issue advocacy.                          ____________________
