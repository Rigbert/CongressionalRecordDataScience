 President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just a couple of observations about the vote just completed.  The constitutional amendment to strip political speech out of the first amendment and give the Government the power to control said speech was just defeated 61 to 38. We have had previous votes on the Hollings amendment in other years.  I would just like to mention for the benefit of my colleagues this is the biggest vote against the Hollings amendment yet achieved in the Senate. The opponents of this amendment included all but 4 Republicans and 11 Democrats. So I think it was a very encouraging indication of growing support for protecting the first amendment.  I want to thank my colleagues for this overwhelming vote against the amendment. Also I thank Tamara Somerville and Lani Gerst for their continuing good work on this issue. They are both members of my staff.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
