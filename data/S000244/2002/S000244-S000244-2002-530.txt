Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, this is not the usual motion to recommit that this House considers at the end of legislation. Those motions direct the committee of jurisdiction to report the legislation back to the House forthwith with an amendment. The motion to recommit of the gentleman from Texas omits the word ``forthwith,'' and that means that if this motion is adopted, the bill will go back to the Committee on the Judiciary and will come out sometime in the future to be brought up under another rule where the House will spend another day listening to the same arguments that we have debated and rejected repeatedly through the amendment process.  So for that reason alone, the motion to recommit should be rejected.  Now, secondly, litigation resulting from a massive terrorist attack is precisely the type of complex legislation envisioned to be decided in our Federal courts. That type of litigation involves multiple parties from different districts asserting multiple laws, but having the same set of facts that the court will decide.  The House has already dealt with this issue when, earlier last year, it passed H.R. 860 by voice vote. This was supported by Members on both sides of the aisle and unanimously reported by the Committee on the Judiciary. This legislation is known as the multi-multi-multi bill, which is in direct response to air crash cases and multiple tort cases such as a terrorist attack, and it directs which Federal court those types of cases can be consolidated in. So the House has already dealt with that issue.  The amendment is unnecessary because it does not require the bill to be brought back forthwith. It is a sneaky way to attempt to kill the bill by referring it to the committee, and I would urge Members to oppose this motion simply to get rid of this issue and to send it on its way to the other body.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of the time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).
