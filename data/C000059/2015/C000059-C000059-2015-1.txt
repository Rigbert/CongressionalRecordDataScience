Davis, the language included in the omnibus recognizes that this administration has not been working with States on the Stream Buffer rule in a collaborative manner. Ten States have signed memorandums of understanding with OSM to work together as ``collaborative agencies'' on the rule. These memoranda established processes for data and information sharing and for the exchange of comments and ideas. Unfortunately, earlier this year, 9 of those 10 States withdrew in protest.  This mandatory congressional directive will require that OSM reengage with States and share data and information, as they should have been doing all along. We will be monitoring this implementation. The committee commits to working on an implementation process moving forward to ensure that OSM reengages with the States and actively involves them in the process.
