Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Michael Clifft. On November 30, 2001, Michael, along with his family and friends, celebrated his retirement from the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Local Union 374 after more than 35 years of dedicated service.  We in Northwest Indiana applaud Mr. Clifft's achievements thus far. At the young age of 23, he was initiated into the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, an event that marked his entry into a productive career in this field. A native Oklahoman, he joined our community in 1968 when he was transferred to Local 374 in Hammond, Indiana. His sense of dedication and professionalism that was formed in the Heartland came to fruition in Northwest Indiana with his many positive contributions in our community. We often seek in traditions a reflection of American ideals: reliability, loyalty, and an unwavering commitment to a strong work ethic. The Clifft family yields to us all an example of uncompromising dedication to this ethic--his father before him and his daughter after him are both distinguished Boilermakers. Mr. Clifft has provided the constituents of the First Congressional District with a positive standard after which they can model themselves.  As a testament to his dedication to the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Mr. Clifft was appointed to the position of Assistant Business Manager of Local 374 in 1995. For the six years he served in this position, he represented Local 374 with the same integrity that he has devoted to his career, his family, and his friends.  With his induction into the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Mr. Clifft became a member of a family of professionals that spans the globe. His efforts to serve his international brothers and sisters to the best of his abilities are the reasons we honor him today. Yet these obligations do not curtail his involvement with those who have supported him in these endeavors. The Clifft family should also receive some of the praise offered today. His wife, his five children, and his ten grandchildren have selflessly shared this man with our community and they are also deserving of our gratitude.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Michael Clifft. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His work in the labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana opportunities that might have remained undiscovered. Mr. Clifft's contributions kept the labor force strong and his loyalty and sincerity embody all that is admirable in America's workforce. I sincerely wish Michael Clifft a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
