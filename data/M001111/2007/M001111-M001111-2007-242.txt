 President, today I recognize Mrs. Fausta Sawal for her outstanding service in senior citizen communities in our home State of Washington. Mrs. Sawal was selected among 16,000 volunteers to receive the Senior Companion 2007 Spirit of Service Award.  The Spirit of Service awards are given to individuals who have demonstrated both leadership and a commitment to service within their communities. Mrs. Sawal has been a true role model in the community, helping senior citizens and disabled adults for more than 16 years. During her service with the Volunteers of America Senior Companion Program in Seattle/King County, she made a profound difference in the quality of life for dozens of people. Mrs. Sawal was there to call 911 when one of her clients suffered from a heart attack. She also provided assistance when another client fell from a bus and needed to be taken to the hospital. Time and again, Mrs. Sawal demonstrated her caring nature and her ability to effectively assist individuals in a time of need.  Mrs. Sawal has not limited her work to helping individuals. She has been a leader within many community organizations. Currently, she is the president of the Senior Companion Program Advisory Council, a member of the Filipino Community Center, and a volunteer at both the Asian Counseling and Referral Services and the International Drop-In Center. Mrs. Sawal has been active in each of these organizations, taking on many responsibilities including organizing special events, assisting case managers and clients, assisting with in-service trainings, procuring sponsors, and recruiting volunteers.  In addition to her role in the community, this amazing woman has raised eight children. Mrs. Sawal has more than 20 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren. In 2004, she was chosen as the Mother of the Year in Seattle's Asian community.  I would like to thank Mrs. Sawal for the positive impact she has had on so many lives in Washington State. Both her past activities and her current pursuits are helping to create healthier and happier communities. I am sure Mrs. Sawal will continue to make significant contributions to her family and in the elderly and disabled communities in Washington. Mrs. Sawal is a remarkable woman, and I am pleased she is being honored for her years of dedication to helping others.                          ____________________
