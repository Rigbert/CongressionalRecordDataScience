 Chairman, I am outraged that we are not given the option to support both fairness in our criminal justice system and a strong stance against crime and illegal drugs. The issue here is extremely important. There is no excuse for a young man in the ghetto to be arrested for crack cocaine possession and get 5 years in prison when the more affluent powder cocaine user risks only 1 year in jail. The simple fact is that the poor and the black minority are treated unfairly under current sentencing guidelines.  Don't get me wrong. This Congressman thinks that drugs are a scourge on America and I strongly believe we must fight cocaine use in any form. We should be addressing the fairness issue by raising the punishment for powder cocaine, not lowering the sentence for crack offenses. I am deeply disturbed that this was not given as an option today.  I come from an almost all white State and I know that the people of Vermont want tough law enforcement and tough penalties against drug dealers. But they do not believe that a white cocaine user should be treated far more leniently than a black cocaine user. And that is what the issue is here today. The criminal justice system must be fair and unbiased or it is simply not just.
