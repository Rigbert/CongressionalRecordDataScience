President, earlier today, I called in a hold on the nomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak Reform Board. Consistent with my policy of publicly disclosing holds, I am including the following statement in the Congressional Record, stating my reasons for placing a hold on this nomination:  I am placing a hold on the nomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak Reform Board because of her role as an Amtrak Board member in voting to terminate Amtrak's Pioneer route. A subsequent GAO report indicates that at the time Ms. Rosen approved terminating the Pioneer, other Amtrak routes that were even less profitable than the Pioneer were kept in service. Before I will allow Ms. Rosen's nomination to move forward, I am seeking certain assurances from Ms. Rosen that if confirmed as a member of the Amtrak Reform Board, she will insist that Amtrak make decisions about passenger rail service on the basis of objective financial criteria.  Subsequent to calling in my hold on Ms. Rosen's nomination, I and my staff had conversations with her to discuss my concerns. During those conversations, I received assurances from Ms. Rosen that as an Amtrak Board member, she would insist that decisions about Amtrak routes and services would be made on the basis of objective financial criteria and that she would work with me and other Members of Congress to address the needs of rural communities for passenger rail service. As a result of these conversations, I am withdrawing my hold on Amy Rosen's nomination to the Amtrak Reform Board.                          ____________________
