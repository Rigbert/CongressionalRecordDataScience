President, obviously $87 billion is an eye-popping sum of money, and taxpayers want the Congress to turn every penny over twice. That is what Senator Dorgan and I have done. We've gone through every number with a sharp pencil. This amendment, without in any way hampering the efforts to deal with the grave concerns in Iraq, could save taxpayers $1.8 billion.  For example, in a report for Senator Bingaman and myself, the Congressional Research Service found $200 million could be saved in connection with the purchase of petroleum products.
