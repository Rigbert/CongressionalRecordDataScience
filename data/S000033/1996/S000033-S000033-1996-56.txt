 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment that is being introduced by the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] and myself does two important things that most Members of this body agree with:  First it deals with the very serious problem of unfunded mandates, of forcing citizens in close to 2,000 counties in 49 of our States to pay more in local property taxes than they should be paying because the Federal Government has fallen very far behind in its payment in lieu of taxes on federally owned land.  Mr. Chairman, despite an increase that was granted 2 years ago in the PILT authorization levels, the actual appropriations have been kept nearly level, resulting in a revenue shortfall to local communities in real terms. For fiscal year 1996, for example, local governments will receive only 60 to 70 percent of the payment level which was set in the authorization. This amendment would begin to address this unfunded mandate by increasing the payment in lieu of taxes program by $10 million. Currently the PILT Program provides $113 million. If this amendment passes, we bring the total up to $123 million. The formula by which payments in lieu of taxes are made is a complicated one and each property is treated differently. But, on average, if this amendment is passed, there would be a 9-percent increase in PILT funding for our States and communities.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a great deal of discussion recently about devolution and our concerns for local communities and local government. I know something about that as the mayor of the city of Burlington, VT for 8 years. In Vermont, many of our communities are hard pressed to pay escalating property taxes. Fifty-one communities in Vermont, close to 2,000 nationally, would benefit by an increase in PILT payments. It is high time that the Federal Government accepted its responsibility to do right by local communities.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
