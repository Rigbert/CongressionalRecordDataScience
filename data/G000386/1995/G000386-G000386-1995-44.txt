 President, I want to respond to a point made by the distinguished Senator from New York earlier, Senator Moynihan, when he said you cannot balance the budget by cutting taxes. I do not respond just to what Senator Moynihan said; I respond to this point because it is made continually by people on the other side of the aisle.  First of all, it certainly is ironic to be getting lectures from the other side about how to balance the budget. The only alternative on their side was voted down yesterday 96 to 0. That was the President's budget. And it would never balance. A chimpanzee with a typewriter will bang out by accident the entire Encyclopedia Britannica before the President's budget would be balanced.  The question is whether or not Republicans then can walk and chew gum at the same time. And, of course, we can. We can balance the budget and then cut taxes at the same time. We must do this. We can do this with minimal risk because we use very conservative and very credible CBO estimates, unlike the President who has been afflicted, like some of his predecessors, with the narcotic of optimism.  I yield the floor.
