On the bill of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg), I think it is H.R. 2355, dealing with the insurance issues, there is a lot of interest on our side of the aisle. Will that bill be considered? Did you list that as one of the health bills that would be considered?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, no, we did not list that bill as of yet. There are still discussions going on about that bill, and until those discussions are concluded, we cannot predict when it will come to the floor.
