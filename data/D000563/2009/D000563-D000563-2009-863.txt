This is a rare, historic opportunity for the Senate to consider a nomination sent to us by the President. It doesn't happen very often. In my career, my 13th year in the Senate, this will be my third opportunity in the Judiciary Committee to actually ask questions of someone who aspires to serve on the highest Court of the land, a lifetime appointment and a very important appointment in terms of our Nation's history.
