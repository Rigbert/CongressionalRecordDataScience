President, I would like to take a moment to honor the twenty-two Vermonters who will be representing our country this week at the XVIIIth Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Perhaps Chris Graff of the Associated Press said it best when he noted in an article that appeared in the Rutland Herald that Vermont produces more than its share of Olympians, ``. . . a fact that should surprise no one. There is something about Vermonters and the Vermont spirit that is so keenly associated with the Olympic spirit.'' Maybe it is the mix of severe weather, Yankee stubbornness, and that New England work ethic that instills in Vermonters an appreciation for hard work and perseverance.  Representing Vermont on the U.S. Men's Ice Hockey Team is the now famous John LeClair from St. Albans. LeClair may play professional hockey for the Philadelphia Flyers, but he has never forgotten his roots in the small city of St. Albans. John donates his time and expertise to the people of Franklin County throughout the year. His skill and All-American image have brought civility and a touch of New England neighborliness to the most unlikely of sports. For the first time ever, the National Hockey League is competing in the Olympics. Vermonters are rooting for John LeClair to leave a lasting impression.  If there is one thing Vermonters excel at it is getting through snow, so it makes sense that Vermont is well represented on the U.S. Olympic Cross Country Ski Teams. Four Vermonters will be on the team; Marc Gilbertson and Laura Wilson of Montpelier, Kerrin Petty from Townshend, and Suzanne King of East Warren. This is Marc's first time as a member of a U.S. national team and I admire his grit in going after his Olympic dream. Laura, Kerrin and Suzanne will bring experience to the women's team and are aiming to show the world what Vermont women are made of.  The Nordic Combined event has Norwich native Tim Tetreault competing. Tim's parents Tom and Anne will be going to Japan this week to watch their son, who has been skiing since he was five, compete in his third Olympic games. The Freestyle U.S. Ski teams also include four skiers and a head coach from Vermont. Ann Battelle from Williston got hooked on skiing during her years at Champlain Valley Union High School and has never looked back. Jim Moran of Stowe and Evan Dybvig of Turnbridge who have both spent many cold hours conquering the slopes of Stowe, will also be competing. Donna Weinbrecht, another team member, knows well all the steep trails and sharp twists at Killington mountain. The four will be joined by coach Jeff Good from Williston.  Skiing comes naturally for Vermonters, but add a rifle and you have a sport Vermonters can really get behind! Seven Vermonters will be doing just that on the U.S. Biathlon teams--Dan Westover from Colchester, Robert Rosser of Underhill, Kristina Viljanen-Sabasteanski of Richmond, Deborah Nordyke from Jericho, Kara Salmela of Bolton Valley, Algis Shalna (head coach) from Williston, and Timothy Derrick (assistant Coach) of Jericho. Head Coach Shalna brings with him Olympic experience having competed for the Soviet Union's Gold Medal winning team in the 1984 Winter Olympics. The group has been training at a state-of-the-art Vermont National Guard facility in Jericho--which will be hosting the World Junior Biathlon Championships just after the Olympics.  New to the Olympics but familiar to Vermont is snowboarding. As the birth place of this sport and home to Jake Burton's renowned snowboard company, it is appropriate that Vermont will be sending three talented competitors as part of the first U.S. Snowboarding Team. Ross Powers from South Londonderry, Ron Chiodi of Rochester, and Betsy Shaw of East Dorset will be traveling to Nagano this week. Ross knows all about travel since snowboarding has taken him all over the world. He will celebrate his nineteenth birthday on February 10th and be joined by his mother, Nancy, in Japan. East Dorset will be cheering for their neighbor, Betsy, who has ``surfed'' mountains all over the globe but knows the ones in Southern Vermont best. Ron too will bring his Vermont experience at Stratton Mountain with him to the Olympics.  Also going to Nagano, Japan is Vermonter Kathryn Vigesna Lipke of Belvidere. She will be serving as one of five international jurors who will judge the snow-sculpting competitions. Having lived in the mountains of Belvidere with its snowy peaks and dense woods, Kathryn will make an excellent judge of cold weather beauty.  I am truly proud of the athletes Vermont is sending to the Olympics. I commend them for their hard work and the example they set for Vermonters and for athletes everywhere, and join all Vermonters in wishing them the best in the 1998 Winter Olympics.                          ____________________
