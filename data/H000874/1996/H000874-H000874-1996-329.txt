Speaker, as I understand this legislation, it is necessary. If we do not pass it, many in this House on both sides of the aisle will have many constituents who will be hurt. America, in my opinion, will be hurt if we do not allow this to pass at this time.  However, we have a selective sense of responsibility. We did not want to hurt veterans, we did not want to hurt those who go to national parks, we did not want to hurt those who got Social Security checks, and I did not want to hurt any of those, either. So what we continue to do is ask people to come to work, as a responsible employee, but guess what, we are not going to pay you, and we lock out others who cannot serve their constituencies. People are at risk because apparently some Members of this House are not feeling it.  The leadership is about to suggest that this House, like Pontius Pilate, wring its hands and say that we will go home until January 23; no responsibility for the pain that is being caused, no responsibility for the services that are being denied; like Pontius Pilate, it must be somebody else.  Mr. Speaker, as I said at the outset, I will not object to this particular piece of legislation, because unlike some in this House, I believe we ought to be responsible. People sent us here to ensure that their lives would be, to the extent we could affect them, be better. To object to this would not affect that end, but some in this body believe that if their end is appropriate, any means they utilize to attain it are justified. That is wrong.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
