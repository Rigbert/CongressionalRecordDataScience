I am pleased that together we were able to take some initial steps to remedy this issue. However, I think it is evident from the overwhelming evidence that the proposal did not go nearly far enough in relieving the financial distress of these home health agencies. The ones that are paying the price are the good agencies, the cost-effective agencies that are serving our seniors. That is the tragedy.
