 President, I rise today to commend an organization in Kentucky that is working to build brighter futures for children by fighting the trauma of child abuse, violence and neglect. The Family & Children's Place, based in my hometown of Louisville, KY, has provided support to families and children in the region for over 127 years.  And I am pleased to report that they are taking a big step forward in being able to accomplish their mission by the construction of a new Child Advocacy Center. This center will be a model for charities with similar missions throughout the southeastern United States by including charity services, law enforcement, child protective services, and prosecutors all in one location.  The Family & Children's Place's mission is to strengthen the community through research-based services that heal the trauma of abuse, violence, and neglect and promote safe, healthy and stable families. They work to educate families to prevent abuse, respond to children on the very day that abuse comes to light, treat victims to reduce damage to their lives, and take steps to protect children from further maltreatment. They have created an array of services to prevent, end and treat these problems.  And they do all this thanks to the generous donations of many notable Louisville area businesses and sponsors, and under the leadership of the group's president and chief executive officer Mr. Daniel Fox.  Mr. President, I wish to bestow the gratitude of this United States Senate on the Family & Children's Place of Louisville, KY, and wish them continued success for many years to come. Their success can only benefit the youngest and most vulnerable Kentuckians, who need their services the most.  Recently, the newspaper the Louisville Courier-Journal published an article highlighting the new Child Advocacy Center for the Family & Children's Place, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that particular article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Courier-Journal, Oct. 25, 2011]           Family & Children's Place Has Money for Big Center                         (By Sheldon S. Shafer)       Family & Children's Place, a charity dedicated to helping      sexually exploited children, has raised the money it needs to      proceed with plans for a Child Advocacy Center at the old      Salvation Army site near Fifth and Kentucky streets.       The Louisville Metro Police Department's Crimes Against      Children Unit and prosecutors from the Jefferson County      commonwealth's attorney's office also will have      representatives at the center, envisioned as the city's first      comprehensive site to help young victims of abuse or      violence.       The center ``will be a tremendous addition to the      neighborhood, a top-notch project, and it will be great for      the kids who come through here,'' said Daniel Fox, president      and chief executive officer of the Family & Children's Place.       The organization plans to move its existing Child Advocacy      Center from Fourth Street near Muhammad Ali Boulevard to a      site near the Old Louisville, Limerick and South Broadway      neighborhoods.       Police investigators, prosecutors and contract      pediatricians usually have to come to the current office,      which is small, to interview or help victims. At times, the      arrangement results in multiple interviews and extra stress      for the children, Fox said.       Consolidating services, including those of Family &      Children's Place's counselors, at the Kentucky Street site      should 14 mean help can often be provided more quickly, he      said.       ``The idea is to get everyone together at one location,''      Fox said. ``We hope to make it a national model for dealing      with child sexual-abuse cases.''       The agency bought the property at 512 W. Kentucky St. from      the Salvation Army in 2009 for $450,000. The Salvation Army      left the site, which has a long history for use as a      hospital, rehab facility and command center, when it      purchased the old Male High School building four years ago.       Fox said plans call for gutting and refurbishing the      18,000-square-foot structure and building several additions,      increasing the space to 22,000 square feet.       The agency hopes to break ground by March and occupy the      renovated site by the end of 2012. The project will cost      about $4 million.       In addition, it is spending more than $700,000 to buy a      vacant tract southeast of Fifth and Kentucky streets, behind      the former Salvation Army property, from the National Society      of the Sons of the American Revolution.       The Family & Children's Place has worked out a land swap      with the commission that runs Memorial Auditorium. The      commission will give the children's agency a parcel (now an      auditorium parking lot) on the corner of Fifth and Kentucky      streets to be used for one of its additions.       The children's agency, in turn, will use part of the land      it is buying from the Sons of the Revolution to develop      parking for the auditorium.       Longer-range plans call for the Family & Children's Place      to use most of the rest of the land it is buying from the      Sons of the American Revolution to build a 10,000-square-foot      family-support center.       The timing of the family center is uncertain, Fox said, but      the plan is to move the children's agency's main offices and      staff from 2303 River Road to that location. The family      center's cost is estimated at more than $2 million, much of      which is yet to be raised.       So far the children's agency's Building Brighter Futures      campaign, which began 2008, has about $7.3 million in      donations and pledges, including $2 million from Kosair      Charities and $1 million from the James Graham Brown      Foundation. The eventual target is $11 million, including      money for operations and endowment.       Of the sum raised to date, nearly $5 million has been      earmarked for the Child Advocacy Center project, including      land acquisition, and just over $2 million for agency      operations. Most of the balance has been budgeted for the      endowment.       The children's agency plans to borrow against the pledges      to get enough construction money to start work, Fox said.       He said the agency has tried to keep neighbors apprised of      the plans as they have unfolded, including periodic      briefings.       Herb Fink, an Old Louisville neighborhood leader, said the      neighbors have been working with the children's agency for      several years. He said they opposed an initial plan, since      shelved, for the agency to use Ben Washer Park, on the north      side of Kentucky at Fifth, for part of its Project.       Renovation of the old Salvation Army site ``will improve      the neighborhood, save an old vacant building and cleanup an      eyesore. We want to be very supportive of this (children's      services) program that is of national significance,'' Fink      said.       Family & Children's Place provides direct services to about      1,000 exploited children annually.                          ____________________
