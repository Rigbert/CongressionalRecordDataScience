Speaker, I'm sure it comes as no surprise to my colleagues that I have a special appreciation for those that are unafraid to speak their mind, expose absurd policies for what they are, and bluntly and forcefully announce when the emperor has no clothes.  It is with mixed feelings, therefore, that I speak to my colleagues today on the upcoming retirement of Jerry Leone from the helm of the Public Power Council--the regional organization representing the interests of the customers of the Bonneville Power Administration.  Jerry is one of those rare individuals willing to provide unvarnished opinions. But she has more than the ability to distill complex issues into clear and unvarnished analysis and critique. Jerry provides clear insights, bold ideas and an uncanny ability to herd the often disparate interests within public power.  Jerry has been at the helm of PPC for more than a decade, guiding the region's public power systems through numerous challenges, including treatment of the region's aluminum plants, skyrocketing electricity rates, the West Coast energy crisis, formation of a Regional Transmission Organization, ESA listings and a review of the future of Bonneville. Public power, the region and the Northwest delegation are fortunate to have had the benefit of Jerry's insights and efforts throughout this effort.  Jerry is not merely a public power icon. She's a lawyer, a wannabe lineman, a retired member of the Coast Guard Reserves, an accordion player, and a journalistic wit.  I wish her the best in her retirement and thank her for her advocacy and tenacity expressed through numerous wry comments, witty insights and cogent observations.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E218]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] TRIBUTE TO JERRY LEONE ON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE PUBLIC POWER COUNCIL                                 ______                                                          HON.
