It is impossible to summarize his life in a few words, but I offer this tribute.  Jim was a man of sound convictions who valued and respected opposing views. He was keenly interested and engaged in politics. He was a teacher who invited his students to explore the world and challenged them to think. He understood that good teaching is full of ideas and committed himself to 40 years of excellence at the University of Oregon. He was a generous mentor and a leader who helped shape Oregon politics and politicians.  Jim Klonoski believed in the future. A host of public officials in Oregon will tell you they were inspired by Professor Klonoski to hope for and to work like hell for change. His son, Jake, noted the historic inauguration of President Barack Obama was a joyous family celebration of his father's unshakable faith in a better future.  Jim Klonoski's family was the center of his universe. His life was infused with love and admiration for his wife and children. His students were frequently amused and sometimes amazed by stories about the children. He was equally devoted to his wife of 30 years, Ann Aiken, and Judge Aiken was a frequent guest in his political science classes.  No tribute to Jim is complete without mention of baseball. He was a fan and a fanatic. Legions of local baseball families remember Jim as a fixture at his sons' games, and area umpires no doubt recall the many tips he offered them in hopes of improving their officiating skills.  There is a Japanese proverb that says ``Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher.'' All of us privileged to have had our day with Jim Klonoski are grieving his unexpected death.                          ____________________
