 President, I will be brief. The Senator from Minnesota is the major player in this effort. The Senator from Delaware is not.  This is, in a sense, a real Minnesota tradition of progressive politics. The two guys who jumped out on this first and responded immediately were the two Senators from Minnesota. I have experienced the same exact thing in the State of Delaware as I go around and see the guardsmen.  One of the reasons the distinction was made in the past between whether a President called up the Guard or a Governor called up the Guard was the nature of the incident for which the Guard had to be called up in those circumstances. When the President called up the Guard, it was usually--not always--relating to a national defense issue. When Governors called up the Guard, it was for hurricanes and floods and very worthy and worthwhile and important things to our constituents.  Let's make it real clear: This is not a hurricane. This is not a flood. This is not a natural disaster. This is an unnatural disaster called a war. The reason my guardsmen in Delaware were called up and all of our guardsmen are called up now is for a war. This is a war.  Here we are on December 7, 60 years after Pearl Harbor, and where are we? We are once again faced with what we were faced with then. This is the first time since then American soil has been struck. What is the most likely place where the next terrible tragedy will occur if our enemies have their way? In America. The reason the Guard is on the border, at the airports, and throughout our communities is as if there were a foreign army marching on us. That is what this is about. The Soldiers' and Sailors Act was designed to take that into effect.  I compliment both my colleagues. I am flattered they let me be one of the cosponsors. They deserve a great deal of credit for calling this to our attention. I will be surprised if they don't get 100 votes. I compliment them for their foresight.
