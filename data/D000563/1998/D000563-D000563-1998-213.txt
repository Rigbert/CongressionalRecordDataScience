I thank the Senator.  I think that really tells the story. First, there is no requirement, and if there were, it is unenforceable. So this really is eyewash. This is an opportunity to have something to vote for, but the real something is coming. It is the amendment by the Senator from California.  Basically, what we are talking about now is whether or not we are for trigger locks to protect children. I am in favor of firearms safety and education. But the bottom line is that little trigger lock put on a revolver or a handgun keeps it from destroying another child's life.  We can vote for or against the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, but after it is all said and done, the real deal here is the amendment by the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. She is the one who says, you do not just have to have trigger locks on the premises, you have to sell them with the gun. You have to make sure the gun owner walks out with a trigger lock, not just a nod and a shelf with a trigger lock on it. I am afraid that nod is all we get from the Senator from Idaho. It is not good enough. It will not save a life. It is, in fact, an effort by some to find something for which to vote. I hope they will find in their hearts enough empathy for the real problems facing America to support the Senator from California.
