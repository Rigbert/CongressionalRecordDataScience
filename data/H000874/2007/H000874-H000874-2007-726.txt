I was at dinner last night and Secretary Paulson was there. Secretary Paulson, as everybody knows, was the managing partner of Goldman Sachs. Obviously he worked very hard and is a very successful individual. He has been in his job now for a few months.  He said to me he was surprised how hard Members of Congress worked, how complex were the challenges confronting them, and how much of an education, frankly, over the last months he has had in dealing with Members of Congress, working on both sides of the aisle, how hard they had to work to come to grips with solving our Nation's problems.  I want to make it very clear that Members of Congress do in fact work 6, 7 days a week, and that is the rule, not the exception. And when they are at home in their districts, they are doing what the Founding Fathers expected them to do, particularly in this House, the people's House. They are going home and listening to their public and having town meetings, they are visiting business enterprises that are creating jobs and visiting schools. They are talking to their constituents. They are meeting people with problems with the Federal Government in their district offices where, as the minority whip has pointed out, they have offices, district offices, to serve their public. That is our job.  I tell my public that this job really is a two-fold job. Fifty percent of it is coming to the House and voting yea or nay on policy. Fifty percent of it is making sure that our districts are represented well in their interface with the Federal Government.                              {time}  1145  The Federal Government has an impact on our States, on our municipalities, on our jurisdictions and on our people, on our veterans and on our seniors in particular, but many, almost everybody. It is our job to be in close communication with them. As a matter of fact, the reason we are elected every 2 years, by the Founding Fathers' device, was to specifically keep us in close touch.  So I agree 100 percent with the minority whip when he indicates that our Members are working, whether they are here on this floor or they are at home. Period. Having said that, we are going to be considering a CR pretty soon because nine of the 11 appropriation bills that we were supposed to pass into law are still not passed. They weren't passed by the end of the fiscal year, September 30 of 2006. They have not been passed as of January 19, and we are going to try to get at least a CR passed so that we can fund last year's responsibility.  And I want Members to know that the committees have had essentially 2 days to work in this place, Tuesdays and Wednesdays; and the committees have been complaining that they aren't able to get their work done. I want everybody to know, Mr. Blunt and I are close friends. We are not close Democratic friends and Republican friends; we are close friends. We see one another a lot, we talk to one another a lot, but what I have said, and the whip knows I have said this, we are going to come in Monday nights. Now, why are we going to come in on Monday nights? Because if we do not come in Monday nights and we come in Tuesday night at 6:30, the committees cannot meet because they can't get quorums.  Woodrow Wilson said that the work of Congress is done in its committees. If committees can't work, the Congress can't work. America sent us here to work, to get its work done, to make a difference, to take us in a new direction, and that is on our side.  I am prepared, as the leader, to take some of the flack when sometimes, as we wanted to do today, as the whip knows, we wanted to do the pension bill today. Mr. Dreier objected, it wasn't in the regular order, we understand that, we are going to accommodate that, so we are going to do it Monday. We think it is going to be an overwhelming vote on that. That could have been done today. We could have done that and moved it on, but we will be here on Monday. And committees will have Tuesday and Wednesday. Next week is a short week, the week after is a short week, so we won't be meeting on Fridays. So we are not on an onerous schedule.  But I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this leader wants to accommodate the interest of Members. Why? Because I know you work hard, because I have been here for 26 years and I work very hard, and my colleagues work hard. I want you to also know that I think it is our responsibility and duty to the American people to be here in sufficient time to allow us to do the people's business.  And I want the people to know that when we are not on the floor on a Friday and only doing a half an hour or an hour's work, as the gentleman indicated, that our committees have 4 hours, from 9 to 1, to try to do their work.  Now, we are early in the session, so they may not have needed today. And, yes, I could, as practice has been, when we get to Thursday conclude, well, we can get this out of the way and go home. I know Members like to do that.  I want Members to be informed on a regular basis it is my intention, as the leader, as the person responsible for scheduling, to talk to our committee chairmen and committee ranking members that they will have the opportunity to get their work done, and I am hopeful that they will report that work to the floor.  My friend and I have discussed getting work for the floor is sometimes difficult; but I say to my friend, I think it is more difficult if the committees don't have the opportunity to work. We are trying to provide that, while at the same time, I say to my friend, provide for Members' schedules, not only at home to work, but Members to be at home to see their children and their families and their wives and their husbands. We think that is important as well.  So scheduling, as my friend, Mr. Blunt, has observed, is tough; but we are going to try to provide a schedule which provides the opportunity to do our business here and at home and to make sure that we stay in close touch with our families.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
