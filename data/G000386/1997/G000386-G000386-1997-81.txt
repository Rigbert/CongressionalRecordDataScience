 President, I rise today to introduce the Investment in Education Act of 1997. This bill will close gaping loopholes in the current bankruptcy code which allow companies that declare bankruptcy to cheat schools out of badly needed education funds. This bill has the support of Senator Durbin, the ranking member on my subcommittee. In an effort to work in a truly bipartisan way, I have reached out to the administration and have made several changes in the bill to accommodate the White House. As of now, I have received very positive signals from the administration and I'm optimistic that the administration will come out in favor of the bill.  As we all know, our Nation's educators face difficult challenges every day, whether from crumbling facilities or classes that are too large because a school district can't afford additional teachers. Money won't solve every one of the problems facing our schools. But protecting funding for education from losses due to bankruptcies will do a great deal of good. That's why I believe that the Congress should enact the Investment in Education Act quickly to stem a federally created drain on already scarce education resources.  As President Clinton has said, the era of big Government is over, and we have a responsibility in Congress to make certain that Federal laws--like the bankruptcy code--do not tie the hands of State and local governments. My bill will close bankruptcy law loopholes and provide millions of education dollars without raising taxes or spending any additional Federal money.  Under current law, the bankruptcy code allows a Federal judge to retroactively lower the assessed value of a bankrupt debtor's property--often indirect conflict with State laws. And another part of the bankruptcy code artificially subordinates local property tax revenues.  All of this lowers the amount of money available for education since education is overwhelmingly dependant on local property tax revenue. In fact, there have been instances in which school districts have had to refund money they have already received and spent. In this way, the bankruptcy code is taking money earmarked for education and spending it instead on administrative costs such as lawyers' fees. We need to close these loopholes to put kids, and not bankruptcy lawyers, at the top of our Nation's priorities.  During a hearing which I chaired before the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I found out about a school district in Texas that lost enough money in one case to provide 375,000 meals for needy children. And I heard testimony about a school that could not rebuild its kindergarten which had been destroyed by a tornado as a result of money lost in a bankruptcy case earmarked for the school. In the State of Texas alone, between just a few school districts, about $70 million earmarked exclusively for education are currently at risk. Because the Administrative Office of the United States Courts does not keep comprehensive records on this, we don't know how big this problem is. But we know that it's a substantial problem. I say let's fix it now.  The Investment in Education Act will close these bankruptcy loopholes so that there will be more money for meals for needy children, more money to pay for teachers' salaries, and more money to repair dilapidated schools. By passing my bill, we can ensure that our schoolchildren get the education dollars they need.  Finally, section 3 of the Investment in Education Act will be of great help to children who are owned back child support. Section 3 of the bill will permit children and spouses to go into the exempt assets of the bankrupt debtor in order to make sure that unscrupulous deadbeats can't get out of paying child support by hiding their assets in bankruptcy. I don't think that Congress ought to let the bankruptcy code stick it to kids and so my bill corrects that.  This bill has bipartisan support and has been endorsed by the National School Boards Association and the Iowa Association of School Boards. And as I mentioned earlier, I am optimistic that the administration will come out to support the bill. I know that time may be short, but since this bill has bipartisan support, I hope that we can pass it quickly. Mr. President, I have several letters supporting my bill and several news articles regarding the negative effect of bankruptcy on education. I ask that they be entered into the Record and that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1149       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 2. ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT.       Section 552(c)(1) of title 11, United States Code, is      amended by inserting ``provided that, notwithstanding any      federal or state law relating to the enforcement of liens or      judgments on exempted property, exempt property shall be      liable for debts of a kind specified in Section 523(a)(5) of      this title,'' at the end of the subsection.                                                                    ____                                               Iowa Association of                                                School Boards,                                Des Moines, IA, September 2, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to thank you for      introducing and sponsoring ``The Investment in Education Act      of 1997''. This important legislation will pump millions of      badly-needed dollars into schools by closing loopholes in the      federal bankruptcy code which unscrupulous debtors use to      avoid paying delinquent property taxes. These delinquent      taxes go to fund important education programs such as school      lunch programs for needy children and school construction and      renovation projects. Thus, a loss of these revenues mean      fewer school lunches, school buildings in disrepair and fewer      teachers, since property tax revenues also fund teachers'      salaries.       This federally created drain on local revenues intended for      education, if not checked in the near future, will obviously      have a devastating impact on our ability to provide our      children with a quality education. Companies which declare      bankruptcy should not be allowed to use federal law to      shortchange our children's education.       With the federal government turning more power over to the      states, Congress has the responsibility to remove federal      laws--like these bankruptcy loopholes--which tie the hands of      local government. ``The Investment in Education Act of 1997''      is a step in that direction. It increases education funding      by returning lost revenue to schools instead of raising taxes      and without sending local revenues to Washington.       On behalf of Iowa's 377 school districts, thank you for      your leadership in finding a solution to this problem.           Sincerely,                                             Ronald M. Rice, E.D.,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                                         Office of                                       Sioux County Treasurer,                                   Orange City, IA, July 29, 1997.     U.S. Senator Charles Grassley,     ATTENTION: John McMickle,     Senate Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. McMickle: Thank you for taking the time to discuss      the issues and concerns regarding bankruptcy and its affect      on local taxing bodies here in Iowa.       I have been following with interest the proposed changes to      the Federal Bankruptcy statutes as presented by the National      Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers      (NACTFO) and concur with the findings and recommendations in      their report. I believe that you have a copy of the report,      entitled ``Local Governments Recommendations for Reform of      the United States Bankruptcy Code''.       Following our conversation of July 23, I did send an e-mail      message to all County Treasurers in Iowa, requesting      information on the affect of bankruptcy on tax collections.      To date, I have had a limited response to that request.      Approximately ten percent of the treasurers have contacted      me. Overall, their indications are that the statutes do not      present any big problems in Iowa. The main concern would be      the delay in payment of the taxes due.       An example here in Sioux County is to the point. In the      Boyden-Hull School District, $13,457 in taxes remain      uncollected due to bankruptcy by two property owners. $7,806      of this amount due is to go to the local community school      district, if and when collected. These dollars are needed by      the local school to keep programs running.       We have been fortunate in the Iowa Bankruptcy Courts to not      have any judges that want to adjust amounts due on our      priority claims for taxes. We have usually received the      amounts that we file with the courts, although usually      without interest due to late payment.       My reading of the proposed changes indicates that the      judges would not have the latitude to change amounts due,      nationwide, and that would serve us well. Both of the     cases affecting the Boyden-Hull School District are filed      outside of Iowa and we are at the mercy of the local      bankruptcy judges on collection.       Thank you for your interest in the affect of this      legislation at the local level. If I may answer any further      questions that you or the Senator would have, please contact      me.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert R. Hagey,     Treasurer.                                                                    ____                                         Polk County Attorney,                                    Des Moines, IA, July 31, 1997.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts,          Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: John McMickle of your office was      kind enough to send me a copy of your proposed ``Investment      in Education Act of 1997'', amending sections 724(b) and      505(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. I do not practice regularly in      Bankruptcy and so may not be as qualified to comment as many      of the people you will be hearing from, but I do represent      Iowa's largest county in its attempts to collect overdue      property taxes in those situations where Bankruptcy Court      involvement is unavoidable. I would strongly support your      attempt to reduce the impact on local governments of the      Bankruptcy Code's artificial lien priority shifting and pre-     emption of state law.       As you know, because of Iowa's consolidated tax system, a      County is responsible for collecting taxes not only for      itself but for the cities, school districts and other public      bodies in the jurisdiction. The Treasurer is an involuntary      creditor. He or she cannot evaluate and react to lending      risks the way a normal creditor can. The Treasurer cannot      police the debt or collateral or take additional steps to      protect the County when a debtor is in trouble. Taxes are      limited, so the County cannot build a reserve fund if it sees      danger ahead. It is difficult to reduce general relief or      quit collecting garbage or layoff teachers when economic      conditions result in delayed tax collections. That is often      when people look to government for additional assistance.       In Iowa, state law requires a wait of 21 months or more      after a missed September local tax payment before property      can be taken to pay the tax debt. This is reasonable      protection for property owners who may be in trouble.      Government is, after all, a service, not a business trying to      make money off of the debt. Our procedure does, however,      often result in local taxes being put off while other more      aggressive creditors are paid. To then allow these creditors      priority over local taxes, as the present section 724(b) does      in many instances, seems eminently unfair. These junior      lienholders were aware of tax priorities at the time they      took their liens and to allow them to jump over local      government seems, to me, to be a pure windfall. Your bill      would correct this by keeping everyone in the same lineup to      which they originally agreed.       We have had particular problems dealing with out of state      bankruptcies involving Iowa properties but courts which do      not understand the Iowa tax system and the fact that property      is valued for tax purposes twenty-one months ahead of the      first payment based on that value. We have often lost      moderate payments simply because we cannot fly off to another      state or hire a lawyer there to explain our case. Your      proposal to reduce the impact of section 724(b) would also      indirectly, but greatly, benefit Iowa local governments in      this regard.       Finally, as to your proposal to limit the retroactive      impact of section 505(a), I can only say that in my own      experience I have found this section to be used primarily as      a negotiating tool by debtor and junior creditor lawyers in      Chapter 11 cases, who use the threat of redetermination to      browbeat the County into compromising taxes to provide a      larger income stream for junior lienholders. I strongly      support your bill's effort to limit the impact of this      section on local government as well.       Thank you for your consideration and good luck in      convincing your associates of the desirability of your      proposals.           Very Truly Yours,                                               Michael J. O'Keefe,     Assistant Polk County Attorney.                                                                    ____  Schools Turn To Income Tax--Most Districts Already Charge An Income                   Surtax. Should Des Moines Join Them?       Iowa school districts increasingly are turning to a new      tax--an income surtax--to supplement the property taxes and      state aid they've long relied on.       A movement is under way for Des Moines to join the trend.       The school-district income surtax may not be familiar      everywhere. It has not been used by the schools in most of      Iowa's largest cities, but 204 of the state's 379 school      districts now use it to raise extra money for education.       It's a simple concept that can raise a lot of cash for      classroom programs, new school buses, asbestos abatement,      routine maintenance, and remodeling. It works this way: A      school district approves a levy(ies) for one or more of those      purposes, either by a vote of the school board or citizens,      and designates the income surtax as a source of revenue.       Each person in the district who pays state income taxes is      then charged an additional amount to meet that obligation--up      to 20 percent of his or her state income-tax bill. On a state      tax bill of $200, at the maximum 20 percent rate, you'd send      the state an extra $40 to be returned to your school      district. (Counties may also use the income surtax for      emergency medical services. Taxpayers who live where both      their school district and county have an income surtax don't      pay more than 20 percent combined.)       Think of the income surtax as a tip-automatically tacked      onto a restaurant tab, and districts have been increasingly      hungry for it.       Why? Growing pressure on their budgets, including higher      expectations in general, more low-income students who need      help to succeed and aging buildings that need to be renovated      or replaced.       Iowa law first allowed use of the income surtax for school      districts in 1972, under restricted circumstances. Use of the      income surtax increased after lawmakers OK'd an ``enrichment      levy'' in 1975, which let school districts spend extra local      money on educational improvement through either the income      surtax, property taxes or both. But the explosion in the      number of districts with an income surtax came when the      ``instructional support levy'' replaced the enrichment levy      in 1991, with state money part of the bargain.       From Ackley-Geneva to Woodbury Central--and in districts      like Ames, Decorah and Sioux City--the income surtax raised a      total of $27.2 million statewide for the 1996-97 school year      that ended June 30. That compares to $1.9 million just 10      years earlier. Of that $27.2 million, $24.6 million went to      the instructional support levy (which also got $43.3 million      in property taxes and $14.8 million in state money, with the      state paying less now than it originally promised).       The income surtax raised another $72,000 for the      educational improvement levy, a one-time opportunity for      school districts to boost their budgets that could be put in      place only in the 1991-92 school year and continued until      rescinded by the school board. (Just four districts have it).      The income surtax raised nothing in 1996-97 for the asbestos      levy. It raised $2.5 million for the physical plant and      equipment levy.       Who has the income surtax? Rural school districts      predominantly, where the push for it began as a way to reduce      reliance on property taxes and keep school budgets healthy,      although plenty of cities participate. Iowa City, for      example, raised the most--$2.6 million--this past school year      for the instructional support levy. In the immediate Des      Moines area, only the Bondurant-Farrar, Southeast Polk and      North Polk school districts have the income surtax.       The surtax has been proposed for the Des Moines school      district as a means to move ahead the $315 million Vision      2005 plan for updating its 63 buildings.       Residents of the Des Moines district paid $124.5 million in      state income tax in 1996. Based on that year's incomes, each      1 percent of surtax would bring in about $1.2 million for the      school district. The talk is of needing nearly $12 million      annually from the surtax, which would require nearly a 10      percent rate.       Part of the appeal of the income surtax is that it spreads      the tax burden more equitably than property taxes or sales      taxes, and businesses are likely to support it since they      don't pay it. Part of the drawback is that it stands to      increase the differences in tax burdens among local school      districts, perhaps putting Des Moines at a further      competitive tax disadvantage.       Somehow Des Moines has to settle on a way to come up with      money it needs for its schools, and a tax increase of some      sort is inevitable.       Whether that ought to include the income surtax needs a      careful look, one taken knowing that many other Iowa      communities have found that it works for them.                                                                    ____                   [School Board News, Aug. 19, 1997]                  Schools Lose When Firms Go Bankrupt       Your school system might be missing out on thousands of      dollars every year because corporations involved in      bankruptcy proceedings are able to get their tax obligations      cut.       The Dallas public school system, for example, is losing      $450,000 during the current year, due to a federal law that      makes it virtually impossible for school districts to collect      tax revenue from businesses that have declared bankruptcy.       Accordingly to Dallas Superintendent Yvonne Gonzalez, the      district could have used this money to hire 15 extra teachers      to reduce class sizes or provide $150 in school supplies for      more than 3,000 teachers. ``We anticipate an equal or greater      loss each year for the foreseeable future,'' she says.       That's because Dallas, like most local school districts      across the nation, depends heavily on ad valorem taxes, which      are assessed on businesses and individuals based on the value      of property.       When businesses declare bankruptcy, however, school      districts and other local governments tend to be last in line      to collect the back taxes owed by property owners. Lawyers      and banks holding mortgage liens are paid first. As a result,      schools often never see the money they are owed, and in some      cases, are required to refund taxes already received.       NSBA supports federal legislation to correct this problem.      The Investment in Education Act would amend the federal      bankruptcy code to increase local revenues derived from      property taxes.       The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on      Administrative Oversight and     the Courts held a hearing on the bill Aug. 1. The bipartisan      measure will be formally introduced in September by      subcommittee chair Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen.      Richard J. Durbin (D-III).       A description of the bill prepared by Sen. Grassley's      office notes that ``virtually every state has experienced      some revenue shortfall'' in school funding, due to two      provisions in the bankruptcy code. The issue has been getting      a lot of attention in Texas lately, however, because the      state experienced so many real estate bankruptcies in the      early 1990s.       Elizabeth Weller of the Dallas law firm Blair, Goggan,      Sampson and Meeks notes that the Houston school district lost      $1 million in a single case. Weller, who represents some 200      clients on this issue, a third of whom are Texas school      districts, adds that in the past few years, the Fort Worth      Independent School District (ISD) lost more than $480,000 in      a total of four cases; the Dallas ISD lost nearly $450,000 in      six cases; and the Lake Worth ISD $357,000 in a single case.       Section 505(a) of the bankruptcy code gives bankruptcy      judges broad power to overrule property valuation decisions.      This means a judge can decide to reduce a business's tax      burden to ensure that the company's debtors can receive more      of what they are owed.       Debtors often seek to have the taxable value of property      reduced for as much as 10 years before the bankruptcy filing      and request a refund of taxes already paid. Current law      allows judges to approve these requests.       The bill would amend Section 505(a) to permit a bankruptcy      court to reverse a property valuation decision only when the      bankruptcy debtor has the right to challenge such a decision      under applicable nonbankruptcy law.       Section 724(b) requires that most other claims on a      bankruptcy estate be paid before ad valorem liabilities.      Thus, various expenses, including lawyers' fees, are paid      before and at the expense of tax liabilities, eventually      forcing local jurisdictions to accept much less in delinquent      back taxes than they would otherwise be entitled to receive--     if they receive anything at all.       The bill would amend Section 724(b) to provide that ad      valorem taxes protected by liens are paid ahead of other      expenses, increasing the likelihood that local jurisdictions      receive the same revenues they would have received if the      company didn't file bankruptcy.       ``My clients are sympathetic to wage claimants and others      holding priority claims'' under the bankruptcy code, Weller      says. They are citizens that serve and protect,'' she says.      School districts are not asking for a special priority;      they just want to be treated like any other creditor.       Weller says there's been ``definitely a lot more cases'' on      this issue in the past few years, even though there hasn't      been an increase in corporate bankruptcies as there has among      individuals. What has changed in that ``corporate attorneys      have become more aware of how they can use the law to avoid      paying taxes.''       One of several examples cited by Weller involves the      bankruptcy of Merchants Fast Motor Lines. Taxes secured by      liens on personal property were reduced by a bankruptcy      court's application of Sections 505(a) and 724(b).       That resulted in five county governments, three city      governments, and the school districts of Dallas, Houston, and      Irving losing a total of more than $70,890. The taxing      entities face the threat of additional tax losses when the      properties are sold.       In some cases, a bank holding the mortgage on a property      demands that the seller declare bankruptcy so the taxes will      be reduced, thus increasing its profits from the sale.       That's what happened to the Hurst Euless Bedford      Independent School District in Texas, which filed suit in      state court in May 1992 to collect delinquent taxes for a      company for 1989 and 1990.       The day before the case was set to go to trial, the debtor      filed bankruptcy, attorney Barbara M. Williams said at the      hearing. The company succeeded in getting the taxes reduced      for 1989 and 1990, even though the debtor did not foreclose      upon the property until 1991. The property value was reduced      more than $1.5 million, and the school district lost more      than $61,000 in tax revenue. The debtor then filed a motion      to dismiss the bankruptcy.       A single bankruptcy can have a major impact on a small      school district. For example, when the Lancaster, Texas,      school district was involved in a legal battle over the      bankruptcy and foreclosure of a country and western bar, it      succeeded in obtaining $150,000 in back taxes, Weller notes.      That money was enough to restore kindergarten for the      district's schoolchildren, which had been eliminated when the      school suffered severe tornado damage.                                                                    ____                        Lancaster Independent School District,                                     Lancaster, TX, July 28, 1997.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Senate Judiciary Committee,     SH-325 Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     RE: Proposed Changes to Bankruptcy Code Sec. Sec. 724(b) and          505.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am very pleased to write this      letter in support of your efforts to modify the Bankruptcy      Code to make revenue recovery easier for local governments.      As a small suburban school district, the Lancaster      Independent School District has felt the effects of debtors      using bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying ad valorem taxes.      In one particular case, a debtor avoided payment of taxes for      almost ten years before the tax-laden property was sold      through a bankruptcy plan to a new owner who paid the taxes.      As a result of this account being resolved, the School      District collected more than $130,000 and was able to fund      fullday kindergarten. I am attaching an article from our      local newspaper that describes the importance of the payment      of this account.       Although the example I have given would not have been      specifically affected by your proposed changes to the      Bankruptcy Code, it represents the types of issues facing      local governments who cannot collect essential revenue      because of abuses of the bankruptcy process by property      owners. In our case, the issue was much more than a matter of      an individual paying his fair share of taxes. For Lancaster      ISD, this was a matter of whether or not we could provide      essential public services.       Thank you very much for your actions on behalf of local      governments. Please let me know if I can provide any      additional assistance in this effort.           Sincerely,                                                        Bill Ward,     Superintendent.                                                                    ____                    [Today Lancaster, Aug. 10, 1997]      Money in the Bank--LISD Receives Biggest Back Taxes Payment                            (By Chuck Bloom)       Gary Faunce is a happy man. Happier than usual.       The Lancaster school district top finance man is breathing      a little easier with an infusion of more than $133,000 in      back taxes paid by the LISD's most notorious delinquent      account.       Bear Creek/GID II, representing the Crystal Chandelier,      delivered payment of $133,377 July 24 to the district's tax      attorneys, Blair, Coggan, Sampson and Meeks, closing out a      ``difficult chapter'' in the district's financial life,      Faunce said.       ``This helps us make next year's budget and it certainly      lifted us through this year's budget.'' he said. ``It has      been very helpful to fund a few programs.''       Faunce said much of the funds would be earmarked to cover      the cost of full-day kindergarten in the LISD, which begins      this Monday for all 5-year-olds.       The Crystal Chandelier, located at Bear Creek Road and I-     35, was purchased by John Drain earlier this year, and worked      with BGSM to resolve the delinquent tax problem.       ``With the property in the hands of a new owner, we are      hopeful that it will remain off the delinquent tax roll,''      said Nancy Primeaux, BGSM regional manager. She said her firm      would monitor the GID account ``to ensure the property's      prior history is not repeated.''       In addition, the district received $6,915 from Jordan      Tractor and Marine, plus payment on five other accounts,      Primeaux said.       Needham Carpets, which is subject to seizure activity, had      its bankruptcy filing dismissed ``with prejudice'' by the      Bankruptcy Court. The ruling prevents Needham from filing for      bankruptcy for the next 12 months, and BGSM can proceed with      its litigation and seizure efforts.       The LISD has been working under an extremely tight      financial cloud, due in part to the large amount of back      taxes owed.                                                                    ____                                                    North Carolina                                     League of Municipalities,                                                  August 14, 1997.     Hon. Lauch Faircloth,     317 Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Faircloth: We are aware of proposed amendments      to the Bankruptcy Code that will ensure better local tax      collection and administration when a taxpayer files for      bankruptcy. We support these amendments, included in Senator      Grassley's Investment in Education Act of 1997, that amend      Sections 724 and 505(a)(2) of Title 11 of the US Code.       The amendment to Section 724 will prevent the property tax      lien from being subordinated to other liens when property is      sold free and clear of liens during bankruptcy. This is      already the case under North Carolina law, as has been held      and affirmed by our courts, if the tax collector reads the      notice carefully enough to understand there is to be a sale      free and clear of liens and if the collector knows to contact      the city or county attorney and request that an objection be      filed to the sale.       Under existing Section 505, a bankruptcy court can      redetermine the value of property for tax purposes and      recompute the tax owed, if the debtor had not appealed the      value to the Board of Equalization and Review, and this is      true even though the time for making an appeal to the Board      has expired. This has happened in several cases in North      Carolina, and the taxes were always recomputed downward. The      proposed amendment to Section 505 prohibits a bankruptcy      court from making this reassessment if the time for making an      appeal under state law has expired.       We appreciate your consideration and, in the interest of      more equitable property tax collection and administration, we      feel these are good amendments and would request your      support. Would you please share your position on the      amendments?           Sincerely yours,     Terry A. Henderson,       Director of Advocacy.     S. Ellis Hankins,       Executive Director.                                                                    ____         The Office of Salt Lake County Attorney, Douglas R.            Short, County Attorney,                                                    July 29, 1997.     Attn: John McMickle.     Re amendments to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 505 and 724(b).     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senator, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and          the Courts, 308 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Salt Lake County's tax revenue,      including those of the several school districts located      within the county, has been adversely affected by 11 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 724(b) and 505. Both provisions discriminate      unfairly against governmental entities and take needed      governmental and school revenue and shift it to other      creditors of the estate.       For example, because 11 U.S.C. Sec. 505 permits the      bankruptcy court to redetermine the value of property for tax      purposes, Salt Lake County and schools have lost substantial      tax revenue because debtors have been permitted to challenge      assessments without the necessity of complying with state      law.       In one chapter 11 proceeding Salt Lake County and the      school districts lost $61,800 due to the provisions of 11      U.S.C. Sec. 505. In another chapter 11 proceeding the debtor      attempted to obtain a refund of taxes paid three years prior      to the bankruptcy filing and one post-petition year totaling      approximately $80,000. The county settled after the trustee      agreed to drop his pre-petition refund but lost approximately      $18,000 which the Trustee would not have been entitled to      under state law. Further, in 1996 the county and school      districts lost another $13,500 in a chapter 7 proceeding      because of section 505 jurisdiction. The above actions could      not have been brought had state law applied.       Title 11, U.S.C., Sec. 724(b) is often used in this      jurisdiction to take county and school district tax money and      shift it to administrative expense and other priority      claimants. It should be eliminated or limited to federal      statutory liens. It is evident from the legislative history      of Sec. 724 and its predecessors that Congress never      contemplated the impacts of shifting local property tax      revenue away from schools and local governments, which      provide police and fire protection and other essential      services to estate property, to other creditors such as      chapter 11 administrative expense claimants and lienholders      junior to the tax liens.       Thank you for considering the foregoing issues.      Unfortunately we are not able to present this in person.      However, your assistance is appreciated.           Sincerely,                                             Mary Ellen Sloan,                                 Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney,     Civil Division.                                                                    ____                          Treasurers' Association of Virginia,                                                    July 29, 1997.     Re Investment in Education Act of 1997.     U.S. Senator Charles Grassley,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the      Treasurers' Association of Virginia to express our support      for the Investment in Education Act of 1997. The membership      of the Treasurers' Association consists of over 180 county,      city and town treasurers throughout the Commonwealth of      Virginia. In Virginia, the local treasurer is responsible for      the receipt and collection, safekeeping and investing,      accounting and disbursement of local government revenue.       Of primary importance to our members is the retention of an      effective ad valorem tax lien on real property. This lien is      paramount to all other debts under Virginia law. In giving      this lien the ultimate priority, the Virginia legislature      recognized the importance of real property taxes to Virginia      localities. Real property taxes are an indispensable method      of funding government functions including schools, police and      fire protection, sanitation and other essential government      services. Under the current bankruptcy scheme, however, this      first priority lien can be negated by a bankruptcy trustee      acting pursuant to Sec. 724(b).       The legislation which you have proposed would rectify this      anomaly of the Bankruptcy Code. This legislation would exempt      a ``properly perfected unavoidable tax lien arising in      connection with an ad valorem tax on real or personal      property . . .'' from the scope of Sec. 724(b). This      amendment is consistent with the original legislative history      of this subsection, and reflects the primary importance of ad      valorem taxes and tax liens in the operations of local      government.           Sincerely,                                                   Kevin R. Appel,     Counsel.                          ____________________
