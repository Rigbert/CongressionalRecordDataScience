 President, today I introduce legislation designed to assist the transition to democracy, a free-market economy, and civil society in the Russian Federation.  Mr. President, the Russian Federation, which is currently undergoing severe political and economic crises, continues to possess thousands of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them. If for no other reason, therefore, maintaining stability in Russia remains a vital national security concern of the United States.  I have stated in detail on earlier occasions my belief that for the foreseeable future the time has passed for massive infusions of economic assistance to Russia. Since the collapse of Soviet communism, the capitalist world has injected into Russia more than one hundred billion dollars in grants, loans, and credits. Ultimately, however, the Russians themselves must take responsibility for putting their own economic house in order.  With few exceptions, future American economic assistance to Russia should be predicated upon a systematic reform of its economic, tax, and criminal justice systems, and in greatly reducing the corruption that plagues nearly every facet of Russian life.  The one exception I mentioned last summer was emergency food assistance to forestall starvation during the brutal Russian winter. I am happy that the Administration under the lead of Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has embarked upon just such a rescue program.  But, Mr. President, in the absence of basic, large-scale economic aid, we must search for other means to assist Russia in its painful transition to democracy and free-enterprise capitalism.  We are often mesmerized by current problems. So it is important to remember that since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, the Russian Federation has, in fact, made significant progress in democratizing its government and society.  Building upon that progress, the continued development of democratic institutions and practice can, Mr. President, help to foster the stability in the Russian Federation that is squarely in America's national interest.  Educational and professional exchanges with the Russian Federation have proven to be an effective, and remarkably low-cost, mechanism for enhancing democratization in that country. Moreover, these exchanges hold the promise of long-term, lasting pay-offs as the exchange participants move into positions of responsibility in public and private life.  With that in mind, Mr. President, I am introducing the Russian Democratization Assistance Act of 1999.  Recognizing that maintaining stability in the Russian Federation is a vital national security concern of the United States, this legislation authorizes the expansion of selected, already existing educational and professional exchanges with that country and authorizes a study of the feasibility of a Russia-based, internationally funded Foundation for Democracy.  Specifically, the legislation increases authorization for each of fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 for several programs with the Russian Federation that have a proven track-record of excellence. My colleagues will note the unusually low amounts of funding involved in each of these programs.  The annual authorization for the Russian portion of the Future Leaders Exchange Program, popularly known as the Bradley Scholarships after former Senator Bradley of New Jersey who sponsored the original legislation creating the program under the Freedom Support Act, will be increased to four million dollars from its current level of just over two million dollars. I am proud to have co-sponsored this program at its inception.  Under the Future Leaders Exchange Program, high school students from the former Soviet Union are selected in national, merit-based, open competitions to live for one academic year in the United States with a host family and to study at an American high school.  The United States Information Agency, now to be merged with the Department of State, works with two non-profit organizations--the American Council of Teachers of Russian and Youth for Understanding--on the recruitment, selection, orientation, and travel of the foreign students, and with twelve youth exchange organizations around our country in their placement and monitoring. Alumni are encouraged to join organizations when they return home and to participate in follow-on activities coordinated by these two American organizations.  Mr. President, the Future Leaders Exchange is universally recognized as a huge success. And what an investment.  Annual authorized funding for the Russian portion of the Freedom Support Act Undergraduate Program would be increased to three million dollars from its current one-and-a-third million. In this program, foreign undergraduates are selected for one year of non-degree study in American universities, colleges, or community colleges in a variety of fields, including agriculture, business administration, communications and journalism, computer science, criminal justice studies, economics, education, environmental management, government, library and information sciences, public policy, and sociology.  The American Council of Teachers of Russian, and Youth for Understanding administer this program for the United States Government.  Another outstanding, highly relevant, program within the Freedom Support Act whose scope this legislation would increase is the Community Connections Program. The annual authorized funding for its Russian component would rise to fifteen million dollars from its current level of seven million.  In the Community Connections Program, entrepreneurs, local government officials, education officials, legal professionals, and non-governmental organization leaders are offered three-to-five week practical training opportunities in the United States. Forty local communities across this country host the participants, thereby creating grass-roots linkages between the United States and regions of Russia, which may enhance opportunities for exchanges to be sustained beyond the life of the assistance program.  A very small but highly topical program that my legislation would expand is the Freedom Support Act Fellowships in Contemporary Issues. The Russian component of this program currently receives only $370,000. This act would nearly triple that annual authorization to one million dollars.  Under the Contemporary Issues Program, government officials, leaders of non-governmental organizations, and private sector professionals from Russia receive three-month fellowships in the United States for research in several strategic areas. These include sustainable growth and development of economies in transition; democracy, human rights, and the rule of law; and the communications revolution and intellectual property rights.  This program is administered through a grant awarded to the International Research and Exchanges Board, an organization with decades of experience in exchanges with Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  Finally, my legislation would greatly strengthen the Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship Program, named after our esteemed former colleague from Maine who later served the nation as Secretary of State. Annual authorized funding for the Russian portion of this program would rise to seven million dollars from its current level of nearly three-and-three-quarter million dollars.  Muskie Fellows receive fellowships for one-to-two years of graduate study at American universities in business administration, economics, law, or public administation. The program is administered by the American Council of Teachers of Russian and the American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study.  The Muskie Fellowship Program is particularly important, since it gives the next generation of Russian professors on-site exposure to American scholarship and American society. The so-called ``multiplier effect'' that these professors will have upon their students will last for decades.  Mr. President, the sum total authorization for these five innovative and highly successful exchange programs is only thirty million dollars per fiscal year. The benefits in enhancing democratization in Russia and in promoting Russian-American relations are significant. It is an investment in the future that we should make.  Mr. President, the second part of this legislation concerns a grant of fifty thousand dollars to conduct a feasibility study of a Russia-based, internationally funded foundation for democracy.  The assassination last November in St. Petersburg of Galina Starovoitova, a former Member of the State Duma and Russia's most prominent female politician, was universally perceived as a defining moment. Starovoitova's murder, as yet unsolved, is seen as symptomatic of the growing power of organized crime and nationalist and communist extremists to undermine the foundations of the fragile Russian democracy.  The shock of the assassination had not yet worn off when friends and admirers of Starovoitova around the world spontaneously began to consider ways to create something positive from the horror. Several individuals including Carl Gershman, President of the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, and Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who worked in Moscow for the Carnegie Endowment, have proposed creating a Russian democracy foundation in Starovoitova's name.  This Starovoitova foundation would be a non-governmental, non-partisan, strictly Russian but internationally funded center for the study and promotion of democratic practices. Its work would involve public education in a country where democracy increasingly is equated with crime, insider privatization, and mass poverty. The Starovoitova foundation could also train democratic activists for governmental and non-governmental service. Moreover, it might serve, in Professor McFaul's words, as a ``kind of Russian Civil Liberties Union,'' helping citizens defend their constitutional rights.  I have reason to believe that the Starovoitova foundation would find broad support within Russia and be able to attract funding from several other democratic countries around the world.  In a well-known phrase, Weimar Germany failed not because it had too many enemies, but because there were too few democrats. Weimar's tragic end need not be repeated in Russia. GalinaStarovoitova's murder already has motivated record numbers of voters to turn out for municipal elections in St. Petersburg with strong support for the democratic parties. The Starovoitova Foundation for Democracy could maintain this momentum, even as it memorializes a courageous politician.  The planning grant I am proposing would authorize the United States Government to engage an organization specializing in the study of Russia to investigate the depth and breadth of support for such an institution and, if there is the requisite support, the best way to proceed with organizing the foundation.  Mr. President, the Russian Democratization Assistance Act of 1999 is a targeted response to assist the Russian Federation as it struggles to move away from the legacy of seven decades of communist tyranny and misrule. It recognizes that Russia's problems are too large and too complex to be amenable to instant solutions. But by significantly expanding educational and professional exchanges with Russia, and by taking the first steps toward the creation of a foundation for democracy there, this legislation can make an important long-term contribution to democracy and stability.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 372       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
