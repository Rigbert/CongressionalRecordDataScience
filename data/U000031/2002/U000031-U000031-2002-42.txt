I go to all different sizes. I was on the Western Michigan University campus earlier this morning. But whether it be an elementary school, a high school, a private school, a charter school, and we passed a great charter school bill earlier this evening, but one of the toughest times that I have had sitting down with students is when I have met with kids that have kids, 13, 14, 15-year-old girls. They thought it was fun until they had the child. They see now what the work is and they have a tough life ahead of them. They really do. It is all we can do to encourage them to stay in school because their lives are changed dramatically if they do not continue to get that high school diploma or GED afterwards.  And as I have sat down with those girls, kids really is what it is, they know how tough it is. And it is that message, and I am now 49 years old and they do not always want to hear from a 49-year-old guy, so it is better for them to hear from their own peers. And they do not have a very good story to tell. We really got that discussion, as I said, at a number of different schools. We just sat around the table and they outlined for me the hardships that they now face and the realization that they probably should not have done what they did. And, frankly, it was before a lot of these programs came into play.  Abstinence does work. Those programs and that funding is important, and it keeps them on a much better path. Project Reality, a group from Illinois, came out with six good reasons to fund abstinence education: One, teens want to learn about abstinence. Nearly all teens, 93 percent, said they should be given a strong message about abstinence.
