President, Rosa Parks and Judge William B. Bryant are two venerable figures in our Nation's movement toward equality for all Americans. I am proud that the Senate has taken the opportunity today to recognize and celebrate these two extraordinary individuals. I commend Senator Stabenow for introducing this bill to name a Federal building in Michigan after Rosa Parks, a cherished civil rights leader. I also commend the efforts of Senator Warner, who has worked with me for the past 3 years to name the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC, the ``William B. Bryant Annex.''  Judge Bryant's service to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is truly historic. He continues to perform duties as a senior Federal judge at the age of 93. He began his legal career with the belief that lawyers could make a difference in eliminating the widespread racial segregation in the United States. He became a criminal defense lawyer in 1948, taking on many pro bono cases and was soon recognized by the U.S. Attorney's office for his skills as a defense attorney. The U.S. Attorney's office hired him in 1951 and he became the first African American to practice in Federal court here in the District. Judge Bryant was nominated by President Johnson to the Federal bench in 1965 and became the first African American Chief Judge for the United States District Court in DC.  Naming the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse after Judge Bryant is a fitting tribute to this distinguished jurist. Much like Judge Prettyman, Judge Bryant has had an illustrious career in public service and on the bench. I thank my colleagues for honoring Judge Bryant's service.                           Amendment No. 2292
