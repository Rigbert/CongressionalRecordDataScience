Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Whirlpool Corporation on the tremendous occasion of its 100th anniversary. Headquartered in Benton Harbor, Michigan, Whirlpool is the global leader in the home appliance industry: delivering products of unmatched quality to customers in virtually every corner of the world.  Since its founding in 1911, Whirlpool has continued to build upon its well-earned reputation as a socially and environmentally conscious company by improving the quality of life in countless communities, fostering strong private-public partnerships, and setting the industry standard for energy efficiency and conservation.  Much has changed for the company in the past 100 years, but through it all Whirlpool has remained true to its Midwest, hometown roots. Michigan has faced more than its fair share of challenges through the recent economic downturn, but companies like Whirlpool are helping lead the way for our State's recovery and to restore our Nation's economic competitiveness.  The company is currently undertaking the multimillion-dollar construction of a state-of-the-art headquarters office campus in Benton Harbor. Whirlpool has also played an integral role in the half-billion-dollar Harbor Shores development project, which is revitalizing the St. Joseph-Benton Harbor area.  Thank you to Whirlpool for a century of creating jobs and giving back--here's to the next 100 years.                          ____________________
