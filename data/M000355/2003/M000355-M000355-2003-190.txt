 President, I rise today to honor my friend E. Linwood Tipton. Tip, as he is known by friends, will have devoted 38 years of his life to the dairy industry upon his retirement later this year.  Growing up on his family's farm in Missouri, Tip's interest in agriculture developed at a young age. He attended the University of Missouri where he earned a bachelor's degree in Agriculture and a master's degree in Economics. After serving his country as an officer in the U.S. Army Finance Corp, Tip returned to the dairy industry where his talent and leadership were recognized and he quickly advanced.  In 1987, Tip was appointed president and CEO of the Milk Industry Foundation and the International Ice Cream Manufacturers Association. Under his direction, the International Dairy Show began in 1988 and evolved into the Worldwide Food Expo, an event that currently features over 1,000 exhibitors from 150 different countries. He also created Dairy Forum, a major annual conference for dairy producers and processors. In 1990, he rallied the milk industry to form the International Dairy Foods Association, IDFA, an organization that encompasses the Milk Industry Foundation, the National Cheese Institute, and the International Ice Cream Association. Tip's innovative ideas and strong leadership have stimulated the growth of IDFA. Tip led the way in the creation of the extremely successful `` Milk Mustache'' and ``Got Milk?'' marketing campaigns.  His knowledge of the dairy industry and the economy has encouraged Secretaries of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representatives of both political parties to seek his counsel. In 1984, President Reagan appointed Tip to the National Commission on Agricultural Trade and Export Policy. He has been active on Capitol Hill by testifying numerous times before congressional committees and initiating the annual Capitol Hill Ice Cream Party.  Nondairy organizations have also benefited from Tip's leadership. He founded the International Sweetener Colloquium so sugar and sweetener-using industries could assemble and discuss sugar policy. Tip is a past president and chairman of the board of the National Economists Club and the National Economic Education Foundation. He also has been active in the D.C. community by serving on the ``Main Street'' restoration project's board of directors.  Tip is truly a visionary in the dairy industry. From regulating dairy food retail packaging to implementing marketing campaigns, he has delved into every aspect of the dairy business. Tip's leadership should be commended and, therefore, I ask each of my colleagues to join me in honoring this remarkable man's dedication to the food industry, his community, and his Nation.                          ____________________
