President, if I may join in this colloquy, I am glad for the clarification from the senior Senator from Washington and am pleased to know it is her legislative intent for the Department of Education to continue to use not-for-profit servicers and maintain their existing contracts and that not-for-profit servicers will be permitted to compete in the future for additional accounts. Like other not-for-profits around the country, the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, VSAC, has provided counseling services and low-cost loans to students and Vermonters for more than 40 years. Since then, VSAC has worked hard to establish and maintain strong and longstanding working relationships with Vermont's higher education institutions, as well as K-12 schools, to provide outreach programs critical to the economic vitality of Vermont. In their new role servicing Federal loans, VSAC has consistently received praise from their customers and scored high in customer satisfaction surveys. In fact,when Congress switched to direct lending we ensured that not-for-profit servicers would continue to service Federal loans because of the superior customer service experience that not-for-profits servicers have consistently provided. I am glad that Congress is continuing to recognize the importance of not-for-profit servicers in our communities and intends to allow for their continued role of servicing Federal loans and helping more students gain access to college and more students to complete their degrees.
