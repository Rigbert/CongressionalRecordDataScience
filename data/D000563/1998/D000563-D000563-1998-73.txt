President, today the Senate is beginning consideration of a very controversial and contentious issue, the veto override of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  I will vote to sustain the President's veto of this bill, which I believe is seriously flawed. But to make my position clear and state in positive terms what I believe we should do to address this troubling issue, I am introducing legislation today known as the Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998.  I am pleased to have a bipartisan group of Senators as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators Snowe, Collins, Torricelli, Mikulski, Graham, Landrieu, and Lieberman.  We believe that post-viability abortions should be allowed in only two types of situations--when the life of the mother is in danger or when she faces a medically certified risk of grievous physical injury.  Senators Daschle and Snowe put forward a measure last year that reflected this principle. I support them, and our legislation builds on what they did.  Our bill has one significant difference from the Daschle proposal, an addition that we believe enhances the Daschle amendment. Our legislation would require a second non-treating doctor's certification that the abortion is medically necessary to protect the life of the mother or prevent grievous physical injury. This second certification could be waived only in the case of a medical emergency, and the physician would have to document the nature of the medical emergency.  We believe this approach is one that can be passed in the United States Senate. It is backed by a substantial and bipartisan group of Senators. It is a compromise approach that can bring to a reasonable conclusion the long-running debate over late-term abortion procedures. I urge my colleagues to read the language closely and give it careful consideration as a good faith effort to resolve this troubling issue in a fair and humane manner.  Unlike the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, this legislation would actually reduce the number of late-term abortions because, instead of banning only one procedure, the measure would ban all post-viability abortions except when a continuation of the pregnancy risks grievous physical injury to the mother or poses a threat to her life.  At the same time, the legislation holds to the Roe versus Wade standard which makes a clear distinction between abortions occurring before and after viability. Unlike the partial birth abortion ban, our bill preserves this important distinction and is thus more likely to pass court scrutiny. Before viability, a decision to have an abortion must be made by a woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience. But in the closing weeks of a pregnancy, the court affirms a role for addressing the public concern about late-term abortions and makes it clear that the State can draw the line limiting abortions to the most serious circumstances.  I hope the legislation we are introducing today can help us resolve this debate once and for all, in a manner that is consistent with our laws and the views of most of the American people.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the text of the measure be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2297       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Grievous      injury is defined, as in last year's Daschle-Snowe      alternative to the partial-birth abortion ban bill, as (1) a      severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically      caused by the pregnancy of (2) an inability to provide      necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition, and is      limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy      is medically indicated. The certification requirements could      be waived in a medical emergency, but the physician would      subsequently have to certify in writing what specific medical      condition formed the basis for determining that a medical      emergency existed.       This legislation provides a more effective and      constitutional approach to this difficult issue than the      partial-birth abortion ban:       This legislation will actually reduce the number of late-     term abortions. In contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban      will not stop a single abortion at any stage of gestation.      The partial-birth abortion ban, by prohibiting only one      particular procedure, will merely induce physicians to switch      to a different procedure that is not banned. The Late-Term      Abortion Limitation Act will stop abortions by any method      after a fetus is viable, except when medical necessity      indicates otherwise.       This legislation fits clearly within the constitutional      parameters set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court for government      restriction of abortion. In contrast, the partial-birth      abortion ban, by prohibiting certain types of abortions      before viability, breaches the court's standard that the      government does not have a compelling interest in restricting      abortions prior to viability.       This legislation retains the abortion option for mothers      facing extraordinary medical conditions such as breast      cancer, preeclampsia, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkin's      lymphoma, for which termination of the pregnancy may be      recommended by the woman's physician due to the risk of      grievous injury to the mother's physical health or life. In      contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban provides no such      exception to protect the mother from grievous injury to her      physical health.       At the same time, by clearly limiting the medical      circumstances where post-viability abortions are permitted,      this legislation protects fetal life in cases where the      mother's health is not at such high risk.       The Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act is similar to the      legislation proposed by Senators Daschle, Snowe, and others      last year as an alternative to the partial-birth abortion ban      bill, with one significant change:       The legislation requires a second doctor to certify the      medical need for a post-viability abortion, to ensure that      post-viability abortions take place only when continuing the      pregnancy would prevent the woman from receiving treatment      for a life-threatening condition related to her physical      health or would cause a severely debilitating disease or      impairment to her physical health.       Enforcement of the legislation is identical to the      enforcement mechanism in the Daschle-Snowe alternative. The      Justice Department could initiate a civil action against a      physician who knowingly violated this law, with penalties of      up to $100,000 and/or loss of medical license (up to $250,000      and/or loss of medical license for repeat offenses).
