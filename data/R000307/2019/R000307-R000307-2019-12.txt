 I know that the Presiding Officer certainly knows all about this, given her Active-Duty service on behalf of our Nation.  As he has pointed out, every service has been affected by this. Speaking for the U.S. Marine Corps, part of the Marine Caucus that we have here, and talking with Bob Neller, who is our retiring Commandant--he has pointed out specifically that they don't have enough to do--I mean, we are proud of the Marine Corps. I always say we do more with less, but this time, you can't do more with less and then less and then less, and that is precisely where we are.  I thank the Senator for making an outstanding statement. I join him in this plea on a bipartisan basis to get these appropriations bills done.  Thank you.                 National Mental Health Awareness Month  Madam President, I rise today, along with many of my colleagues, in recognition of National Mental Health Awareness Month.  We on the Senate Agriculture Committee have worked extensively on mental health issues, fighting for improved mental health services and mental health parity, especially in our rural and smalltown areas. We have made great strides over the years in improving access to mental health services and eliminating the stigma of seeking treatment. However, as we continue to see violent tragedies around the country resulting from individuals with mental illness, or even solely looking at suicide rates, which continue to increase--let me point out that in Kansas, there were over 500 suicides in 2016 alone. If the figures were available, I am sure that would be increased, especially with the problems we have in farm country, where we are going through a very rough patch--a fifth year of prices below the cost of production. There is a lot of stress out there in farm country. All of this shows me that more can certainly be done to address the deficiencies in our current system.  Kansas has one suicide prevention lifeline crisis center, located in Lawrence, KS. That is to assist people experiencing mental health crises from the entire State. In many of our rural areas, we continue to struggle with providing adequate access to mental health services.  Those facts apply just for those patients who seek out care. Too many times, people struggling with mental health are either unaware that they can seek help, or they are simply unwilling to do so because of the stigma that is often associated with mental illness. That is why we need to take the opportunity not just this month but every day going forward to improve awareness and understanding about mental health.  The same can be said for addiction. On the Agriculture Committee, we are all proud to have played a role in the passage of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act last year to help address the opioid crisis. However, Kansas is still facing significant challenges with meth addiction. We fought the good fight to eliminate meth labs in many of our States, and now the cartels in Mexico have much more virulence--if I can use that term--with regard to meth.  I am currently working on legislation to help extend the reach of important, often lifesaving treatments for addiction to folks in our rural areas. We can improve mental and behavioral well-being while continuing to reduce the stigma associated with seeking out mental health and addiction treatment.  Additionally, having the privilege of being the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and speaking for my ranking member, Senator Stabenow, as well, you have probably heard me say that we have been in a rough patch in farm country over the past several years. That is certainly true. However, those of us who represent farm country can be more reticent to discuss the toll these troubled times take on farmers, ranchers, growers, and their families, who work tirelessly each day to produce the food and fiber for the United States and a troubled and hungry world.  Farmers, ranchers, and growers face highly demanding working conditions on a good day but more especially during a time of lower prices. As I have indicated, it is the fifth year of prices being below the cost of production. So we see mitigation payments coming out of the Department of Agriculture.  Historically, there have been efforts made by Congress to address these concerns, including the programs that took place during the 1980s farm crisis--I was in the House of Representatives at that particular time; those were very tough times--and recognition of this issue in the 2008 farm bill.  As we began the 2018 farm bill process, we looked for opportunities to address this pressing issue, and it led to renewal of the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. Members on both sides of the aisle in the Capitol recognize the importance of a nationwide Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. It provides support for all producers, farmers, ranchers, and their families through partnerships with organizations in their local communities. Local communities are stepping up, but in terms of getting that network applied, that is another story.  This network recognizes the State and local organizations that have been addressing behavioral health concerns for farmers and ranchers and authorizes grants to support the programs that assist those who are in crisis, especially during this month when we are addressing this topic.  We have just heard from the distinguished Senator from Georgia about the need to avoid a CR in terms of a national defense, and that is true, but in this particular case, it is authorized, but it is subject to appropriations.  On this particular issue, to prevent suicides and mental health illness from resulting in a tragedy, not only in our cities, not only in other States, but across our rural and smalltown areas, it is exceedingly important that we fund this so that we can get the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network up and running and provide the help they really need.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
