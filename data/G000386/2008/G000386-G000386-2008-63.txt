 President, today I congratulate Mr. Bob Fulwider as he nears the end of his term as the 103rd chairman of the Nation's largest insurance association, the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, IIABA. Mr. Fulwider was elected to the IIABA's executive committee in 2002, and was installed as the association's chairman last September.  Founded in 1896, IIABA, or the Big ``I'' as it is better known, is the Nation's oldest and largest association of independent insurance agents and brokers, representing a network of more than 300,000 agents, brokers, and their employees. During his term as chairman of the Big ``I'', Bob Fulwider has been a leader on a number of issues for the association including regulatory reform and natural disaster insurance. Perhaps most importantly, during this year's consideration of the farm bill and specifically its impact on crop insurance, Mr. Fulwider was a forceful advocate for his association who led with professionalism and determination.  Mr. Fulwider has over his lifetime built two financial and insurance planning service businesses throughout eastern Iowa including West Liberty and West Branch, IA. Mr. Fulwider is also a former national board director and a past president of the Independent Insurance Agents of Iowa, IIAI.  Mr. Fulwider has been honored with several national and state awards. He has been honored with two IIABA Presidential Citations--in 1987 and 1994. He was named IIAI Agent of the Year in 1993 and received the association's ``Mr. Chairman'' Award in the same year. He also received the Agent of the Year Award in 1990. He is the first honoree in the Iowa association's history to receive the award twice. In 2002, Mr. Fulwider was honored with the Sydney O. Smith Award, IIABA's highest individual government affairs honor. In 2003 he was named to the Iowa Insurance Hall of Fame.  In addition, Mr. Fulwider is extremely active in his community. After graduating from Iowa State University, he taught in Iowa public high schools and served on the Iowa State University faculty prior to entering the insurance business. Mr. Fulwider is past president of the Muscatine County Economic Development Council and training director and board member of the Iowa Council--Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Fulwider has served as Scoutmaster of his local troop for 25 years and has received numerous Scouting awards including the Silver Beaver. Additionally, he is active in his church and Masonic Lodge.  I want to thank Bob Fulwider for his work with the IIABA over the years and for his commitment to his profession, his community, and our state of Iowa. His efforts are greatly appreciated. I am proud to count Bob as both a constituent and a friend. I wish him, his wife Jan, and their family all the best in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
