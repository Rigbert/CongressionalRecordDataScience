Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  In addition, the House will consider several important bills from the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  First, H.R. 1181, the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, sponsored by Chairman Phil Roe, which ensures that the Second Amendment rights of VA beneficiaries are not restricted without due process.  Next, H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act, also sponsored by Chairman Roe, which grants the VA Secretary increased discretion to remove or suspend VA employees due to poor performance.  Finally, H.R. 1367, sponsored by Representative Brad Wenstrup, which enhances the VA's ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees.  The failures of the VA are well-documented and completely unacceptable. These bills are a step in the right direction towards creating greater accountability at the VA, and keeping our promise to Americans' veterans who have sacrificed so much for us.
