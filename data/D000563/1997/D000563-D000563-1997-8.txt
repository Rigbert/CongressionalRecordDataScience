President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy and Lautenberg in proposing sweeping new legislation that fills in many of the specifics relating to children and the public health that must be included in any future legislation related to the proposed tobacco settlement.  The tobacco companies have made billions of dollars addicting and exploiting our children. Now, they seek to protect themselves from existing and potential lawsuits. This legislation brings us back to the fundamental issues that must stay at the top of the public health agenda. Reducing the devastation and disease caused by tobacco should be our number one goal, not an afterthought.  This legislation is our effort to start filling in the blanks on any tobacco measure. It's time to stop speculating and start laying down markers we feel must be part of any comprehensive agreement.  Under this legislation, the tobacco tax would be raised $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. This kind of increase is a proven deterrent to underage smoking.  Of the additional revenues that would be raised beyond what was proposed by the state attorneys general, one-half would be used to fund medical research into illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The other half of the additional revenues would fund an expansion of the Head Start program, child care grants, and other child and family initiatives.  The legislation seeks to ensure a significant decline in underage smoking by establishing tough performance smoking reduction targets. The reduction targets--modeled on legislation I introduced earlier this year--set a goal of a 40 percent reduction in youth tobacco use in four years, 60 percent in 6 years, and 80 percent in 10 years. If the goal is not met, penalties of up to $1 a pack will be imposed on the sale of tobacco products manufactured by a company whose products are consumed by underage users, with steeper penalties for repeated failure to meet youth tobacco targets.  In addition, we are offering some new incentives for the tobacco companies to meet the targets. If a company fails to comply for three or more consecutive years, the company will be required to stop selling cigarettes in single packs--the size kids buy--and start selling them only in cartons, whose price might cause kids to reconsider their desire to buy cigarettes. If this step was not sufficient to bring a company into compliance, another year violating the performance standard would trigger a requirement that the product be sold using generic packaging, without catchy logos.  As far as kids are concerned, it's time for the tobacco companies to put their profits on the line. Under our legislation, every new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit tobacco will become an economic loss to a tobacco company. We must hold each company individually responsible for its sales to minors.  In addition to setting performance standards, the legislation provides for a national tobacco use reduction program which includes smoking cessation programs, media-based advertising about the dangers of tobacco use and aggressive public education.  The bill also compensates states for Medicaid expenditures resulting from tobacco-related illnesses; affirms the authority of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to regulate tobacco as a drug and delivery device; mandates strong warning labels and ingredient disclosures; reduces exposure to secondhand smoke; prohibits tobacco companies from deducting any settlement liabilities as a business expense; and provides assistance for tobacco farmers.  I commend this legislation to my colleagues and urge them to support it.                          ____________________
