 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my long-time friend and Chief of Staff, Michael S. McGill. I have known Mike for nearly two decades and have had the privilege of working with him when I was Mayor of San Francisco and during my tenure in the U.S. Senate. I have a great respect and appreciation for Mike, who has devoted his life to public service and served the state of California with excellence and honor.  Mike earned a B.S. in business administration at the University of Kansas, and is still an avid Jayhawks fan. He earned his Master's in political science at the University of Texas, which prepared him for a long and distinguished career in public service. In 1967, Mike joined the U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer and was assigned to the Model Cities Program in Fort Worth, Texas. There he committed his time and energy to issues affecting urban communities.  After moving to San Francisco in 1972, Mike developed a passion for water policy, the issue area in which he has provided me with indispensable knowledge and advice. He served for three years as executive director of the Bay Area Economic Forum, and for seven years as executive director of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR). As head of SPUR, he faced competing agricultural, urban, and environmental interests, but he was able to mediate these differences to the benefit of California.  Since 1993, Mike has served as my Chief of Staff. He has done an outstanding job. He has managed my five Senate offices, which serve more than 32 million constituents. This in itself is a tremendous undertaking, and I am proud to say that Mike has succeeded in ensuring that the people of California are served with care, compassion, and efficiency.  As the cornerstone of my staff for the past seven years, Mike's dedication and integrity have earned him the respect of everyone he has worked with and advised. His door is always open, because no issue is too big or too small for Mike's attention and guidance.  In particular, Mike's advice in approaching and solving the water issues that impact California has been invaluable. In my state, water is our lifeblood, and this has made it a contentious issue. I have been thankful to have Mike's experience and insight on an issue that is by no means an easy one.  In my office, we can count on Mike and his wealth of knowledge that ranges from politics to baseball to American history. He and his wife Mary enjoy traveling throughout the country, visiting presidential homes and Civil War battlefields. He is also a dedicated father to two wonderful daughters, Deidre and Erin, who are proud of his accomplishments.  Mike will be leaving my office to return to one of his passions, urban planning, this time at the General Services Administration. There he will work in the Public Buildings Service, managing and preserving historic buildings and landmarks. I have no doubt that Mike will be an asset to the GSA, just as he has been to my office.  It is with sadness, but also great pride, that we bid farewell to Mike McGill. He has been a true friend and a valued advisor throughout the years. Mike is one of California's treasures, and he will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
