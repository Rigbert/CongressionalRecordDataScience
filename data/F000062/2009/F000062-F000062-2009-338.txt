 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to reintroduce legislation to enable hundreds of former Santa Susana Field Laboratory Workers or their survivors to receive compensation for illnesses caused by exposure to radiation and other toxic substances.  Specifically, the Santa Susana Fair Compensation Act would provide a special status designation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act to Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees, so they can receive the benefits they deserve.  In addition, the bill would extend the ``special exposure cohort'' status to Department of Energy employees, Department of Energy contract employees, or atomic weapons employees who worked at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory for at least 250 days prior to January 1, 2009.  This revision would ensure that the Act's benefits are available to any of those workers who developed a radiation-linked cancer due to their employment at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory.  This bill fulfills the intent of Congress when it approved the act, providing compensation and care for nuclear program workers who suffered severe health problems caused by on-the-job exposure to radiation.  The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is a 2,849-acre facility located about 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.  During the Cold War, it was used for the development and testing of nuclear reactors and powerful rockets, including those used in America's space and ballistic missile programs.  Sadly, many workers of the Cold War era were exposed to radiation on a regular basis. But claims for compensation are hampered by incomplete and inaccurate records.  Some records show only estimated levels of exposure for workers, and are imprecise. In other cases, if records were kept, they cannot be found today.  Many Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers were not aware of the hazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no protective equipment--like respirators, gloves, or body suits--was provided to workers.  More than 600 claims for compensation have been filed by Santa Susana Field Lab workers, but only a small fraction have been approved. A lack of documentation, or inability to prove exposure thresholds, has hindered hundreds of claims that may well be legitimate. And, for some lab workers and their families, it is impossible to reconstruct exposure scenarios due to records having been destroyed.  Santa Susana Field Lab workers and their families now face the burden of having to reconstruct exposure scenarios that existed more than 40 years ago, in most cases with little or no documentation.  The case of my constituent, Betty Reo, provides an example of why this legislation is necessary.  Ms. Reo's husband, Cosmo Reo, worked at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory as an instrumentation mechanic from April 18, 1957 until May 17, 1960.  Cosmo worked in the rocket testing pits and was exposed to hydrazine, trichlorithylene, and other cancer-causing chemicals which attack the lungs, bladder and kidneys.  Cosmo died of renal failure in 1980. Ms. Reo applied for benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act. She has been trying to reconstruct the exposure scenarios under which her husband worked, but without adequate documentation she has been repeatedly denied benefits.  This bill would help people like Betty Reo, people who lack the documentation necessary to prove their cases, and those who worked in any of the four areas of the Santa Susana site.  I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting these injustices and cutting through the ``red tape'' that prevents Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers, and their families, from receiving fair compensation.  For many, such as Ms. Reo, time is running out. We can no longer afford to delay, and this bill provides a straightforward solution to fix a broken system.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 709       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Santa Susana Fair      Compensation Act''.     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF MEMBER OF SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.       (a) In General.--Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees      Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42      U.S.C. 7384l(14)) is amended by adding at the end the      following new subparagraph:       ``(D) The employee was so employed for a number of work      days aggregating at least 250 work days before January 1,      2009, by the Department of Energy or a Department of Energy      contractor or subcontractor at the Santa Susana Field      Laboratory in California.''.       (b) Reapplication.--A claim that an individual qualifies,      by reason of section 3621(14)(D) of the Energy Employees      Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (as      added by subsection (a)), for compensation or benefits under      such Act shall be considered for compensation or benefits      notwithstanding any denial of any other claim for      compensation with respect to such individual.                          ____________________
