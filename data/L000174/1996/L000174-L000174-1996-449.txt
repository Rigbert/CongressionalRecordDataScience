President, the January 7, 1996 New York Times Magazine contains an interview with the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  Many of us have followed her situation, during six years of house arrest, and her recent release by the Burmese authorities. She is a woman of remarkable courage, honesty and clarity of purpose. She wants to do whatever she can to improve the lives of her people, and she has devoted her life to that goal. She believes unequivocally that democracy is the only way, and she has the trust and support of the overwhelming majority of Burmese citizens.  As she says in the interview, the Burmese authorities continue to refuse to even discuss a process for instituting democracy, because they are too fond of their power and privileges. But Suu Kyi knows that eventually the SLORC will have to sit down and negotiate with her. As she points out, that is what happened in South Africa, and even in the former Yugoslavia although there only after the slaughter of a quarter of a million people and the destruction of much of Bosnia. Those two examples represent the SLORC's options. Either a peaceful way out, or mass demonstrations and an explosion of violence that will make them wish they had listened to her.  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator McConnell's legislation to impose sanctions on the Burmese government. Senator McConnell has been a strong advocate for human rights and democracy in Burma, and I applaud him for it. It is important that the United States have a consistent policy, and I believe that until the SLORC demonstrates a genuine willingness to negotiate the transition to democracy with Suu Kyi, our policy should be to isolate the SLORC from the world community it yearns to be part of. In that regard, I would note that the SLORC has named 1996 ``Visit Myanmar Year.'' I hope that anyone considering accepting the SLORC's invitation will read the interview with Suu Kyi, and be aware that they may find themselves staying in hotels and traveling on roads that were built with forced labor.  Mr. President, I am not going to ask that the entire interview be printed in the Record, but I urge all Senators to read it. I do ask unanimous consent that Suu Kyi's response to the question ``What do you want people in the United States to know about you?'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Excerpt From Interview With Suu Kyi       Q: What do you want people in the United States to know      about you?       A: That we are not near democracy yet and that there are,      so far, no signs that we are progressing toward      democratization. The National Convention [that Slorc was      holding to draft a constitution], as it stands, is not a step      toward democratization at all.       I think a lot of Americans very much take their rights for      granted. And I think many of them do not know what life is      like for those of us whose security is not guaranteed by a      democratic constitution. So I would like to ask them to try      to put themselves in our shoes, and ask how they would feel      if they were deprived of all rights. I would like them to see      us not as a country rather far away whose sufferings do not      matter, but as fellow human beings in need of human rights      and who could do so much for the world, if we were allowed.                          ____________________
