President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be withdrawn; the Carper substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening action or debate; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.
