President, I rise today to draw attention to the critical issue of organ and tissue donation, particularly with the upcoming National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week (April 16th-22nd) upon us. Although many of us will be back in our home states next week, we must remember to spread the word about the need for donation whenever we have the chance.  National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week was first designated by Congress in 1983 and proclaimed by the President annually since then to raise awareness of the significant need for organ and tissue donation and to encourage all Americans to share their decision to donate with their families so their wishes can be honored. Last year, for example, the Transplant Recipients International Organization's Chicago chapter reached thousands of people through its donation displays at City Hall and other public buildings. In addition, many groups sponsored donor recognition ceremonies, remembrance services, and other events to honor the generous and caring individuals and families who have given the gift of life.  Today, nearly 70,000 men, women, and children are waiting for an organ transplant and the list is growing longer. Each day about 57 people are given the gift of life through the generosity of organ and tissue donations, but another 16 people on the waiting list die because the need for donations greatly exceeds the supply available. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow in the coming years. All anyone needs to do is this: say yes to organ and tissue donation on a donor card or driver's license and discuss your decision with your family members so they know your wishes. Transplantation does save lives, but only if all of us help as we strive toward a fair, equitable and accountable system of organ and tissue donation and transplantation.  Last session, the Give Thanks, Give Life resolution that I sponsored with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy and Senator Levin and others was passed in the Senate. This legislation, which has the support of numerous national organ and tissue donation organizations, designates Thanksgiving of 2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with each other since the final decision to share the gift of life is almost always made by a loved one's family. This week, I also introduced the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act of 2000, which sets up a new policy stating that all Medicare beneficiaries who have received a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their transplant will be covered for as long as anti-rejection drugs are needed.  There are many stories that touch the heart on this compelling issue, but I'll share just one. Kelly Therese Nachreiner was a bright, artistic teenager in the class of 2002. At 16, she went with her mother, Mary, to get her temporary driver's license. At that time, Mary pointed out the donation question on the form for her license to Kelly, having no idea how her daughter would respond to this serious issue. Kelly quickly responded, ``Well, of course, Mom, I mean if somebody can live after me . . . if I'm dead why does it matter? Why do I want to keep those organs? If I can save somebody else's life, why wouldn't I?'' Just one month later, her unselfish decision would save the lives of three people after she died as the result of an automobile accident. Kelly not only saved those three lives, she also brought a spotlight to the issue of organ and tissue donation awareness, which can potentially save thousands more.  Mr. President, all of us would want to save somebody else's life if we could. Let us continue to work together throughout National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week and beyond, to promote organ and tissue donation wherever we can.                          ____________________
