President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article, ``Middlebury to Develop Online Language Venture,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2010]             Middlebury To Develop Online Language Venture                            (By Tamar Lewin)       Middlebury College, a small Vermont college known for its      rigorous foreign-language programs, is forming a venture with      a commercial entity to develop online language programs for      pre-college students. The college plans to invest $4 million      for a 40 percent stake in what will become Middlebury      Interactive Languages.       The partnership, with the technology-based education      company K12 Inc., will allow Middlebury to achieve two goals,      said Ronald D. Liebowitz, the president of the college: It      will help more American students learn foreign languages, an      area in which they lag far behind Europeans; and it will give      Middlebury another source of revenue.       ``We wanted to do something about the fact that not enough      American students are learning other languages, and it's      harder for students if they don't learn language until      college,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. ``It is also my belief, and I      think our board's belief, that finding potential new sources      of revenue is not a bad thing. By doing what we're doing with      this venture, we hope to take some stress off our three      traditional sources of revenue--fees, endowment and      donations.''       Middlebury, a 2,400-student liberal-arts college with an      endowment of more than $800 million, has offered summer      immersion language classes for almost a century, and now      teaches 10 languages in those programs at its campus and, as      of last year, some at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.       Partnerships between universities and commercial entities      have become increasingly common in recent years, but the      Middlebury venture is unusual in that it ties the college's      academic reputation in foreign languages to a third-party      vendor. Moving into such an uncharted area carries risks,      education experts said.       ``These partnerships are starting as ways for colleges,      which may feel themselves cash-strapped, to make some      bucks,'' said Philip G. Altbach, the Monan professor of      higher education at Boston College. ``I have problems with      the whole thing, particularly for a place like Middlebury,      which has a reputation as one of the best liberal-arts      colleges in the country, and for doing a very good job with      languages. They should protect that brand. They are not known      for online programs, and to jump in to the deep end of the      swimming pool, with a for-profit, is in my view dangerous.''       Mr. Liebowitz said that although the move carried risks,      so, too, does inaction. ``The way I see it, to retain our      leadership in the teaching of foreign language, we have to      evolve with the times,'' he said. ``And where things are      going, in terms of access and education, is online.''       In 2008, Middlebury joined with the Monterey Institute of      International Studies, a California graduate school, to start      the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy, an intensive      language-immersion summer program for students in grades 8      through 12. That program, which will expand to new sites in      the new venture, offers four-week residential sessions at      Green Mountain College in Vermont, Oberlin College in Ohio,      Pomona College in California, and Bard College at Simon's      Rock in Massachusetts.       Middlebury has also expanded its academic-year study-abroad      sites, the C. V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad, to 35      cities across 14 countries. Almost half the students at those      sites now come from other colleges.       A hallmark of Middlebury's language schools has been a      formal pledge to speak only the language of study during the      session.       Of course, online programs cannot replicate the immersion      experience.       The online expertise for the venture will come from K12, a      publicly traded company based in Herndon, Va. In partnership      with charter schools and school districts, K12 operates      online public-school programs in 25 states and Washington.      K12 also operates the K12 International Academy, an      accredited, diploma-granting online private school serving      students in more than 40 countries.       ``We plan to make the courses available to individual kids,      home-school kids, charter virtual schools, and teachers who      might want them as supplements,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. ``I      think the price point will be somewhere in the vicinity of      $100.''                          ____________________
