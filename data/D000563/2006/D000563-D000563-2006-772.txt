President, he is not on the floor, but Senator Warner and I have been discussing this amendment. I would like to at least leave open the option that he will join me in cosponsoring it. It is a bipartisan amendment which I would like to describe at this point, if I can, and ask the Senator from Oklahoma if I may have a few minutes to describe the amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.
