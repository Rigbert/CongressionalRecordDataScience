One former Senator who certainly knew this was my fellow Kansan, Bob Dole. During his nearly 35 years in the House and Senate--and most especially during his decade as Senate Republican Leader--Bob was ably assisted by some of Capitol Hill's best and brightest.  One of those individuals was Jim Whittinghill, who many of my colleagues will remember from his years as Bob's deputy chief of staff. Jim passed away on Thursday. I have been in contact with Senator Dole since learning of Jim's passing, and he asked me to enter the following statement in the Congressional Record:       Jim Whittinghill--or ``Whit'' as his friends called him--     and he had many--worked with me during my time as Senate      Republican leader from 1986 until 1994 in a series of      positions, including Deputy Chief of Staff. Whit was a top      flight staffer who provided me with counsel on a wide variety      of issues, including 2nd amendment rights and energy. He was      a proud Republican, but he was respected on both sides of the      aisle. Democrat Senators and staffers knew that Whit's word      was his bond, and he was very influential and helpful in      reaching bi-partisan agreements. After his years on Capitol      Hill, Whit went on to have a very successful career in the      private sector. He will be greatly missed by all those who      worked with him.  On a personal note, let me add that I was in the House of Representatives when Whit was working for Bob, and I agree with all that Bob said about him. I know I join with many others in this Chamber who knew Whit in extending our condolences to his family and friends.                          ____________________
