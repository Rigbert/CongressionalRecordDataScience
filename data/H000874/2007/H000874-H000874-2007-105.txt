 This is a good day. This is a good day because we have another opportunity to extend to children, 4 million of whom are not covered by health insurance, coverage.  I don't know how many families that is, but it's obviously millions of families who will have the confidence that if their child gets sick, they will have insurance. They can access health care. They can try to make their children well.  I want to refer briefly to my friend Mr. Boehner's comments because I agree with him that the American public expected us to come here and work together. But let us review this legislative process.  First of all, we had committee hearings. I want to tell my friend from Texas, those committee hearings were difficult. We didn't really get to the committee hearings and committee markups that we wanted to have. I think that's unfortunate. That was not our fault, I suggest to you.  Secondly, let me say that we passed a major bill through this House, approximately $90 billion. It dealt with a number of subjects, including doctor reimbursements so that they would continue to serve those who are poor under Medicaid and, indeed, under Medicare, so the reimbursement levels under Medicare would be appropriate.  We dealt with rural hospitals so that they would be reimbursed at levels that allowed them to continue to serve our rural communities. We dealt with some other issues. And, yes, we dealt with children's health insurance.  That bill went to the Senate. And there were a lot of Members of your party who didn't like the expansive bill. But before it got there, you offered a motion to recommit on our bill. You cut our spending cuts, you did not agree with those, but you adopted the revenues from the tax increase in cigarettes in your motion to recommit. Most of you, perhaps not all, but most of you voted for that motion to recommit. So this funding source is one that we have agreed to and everybody has voted for.  When it got to the Senate, we made a tremendous compromise. And we went from a $90 billion bill covering rural hospitals and doctors' reimbursement and poor people who would have been marginalized, perhaps, by the cuts to Medicare Advantage. And we made a compromise, mainly with Republicans in the Senate who felt that they wanted a more restricted bill. So that bill that is confronting us now is now a $35 billion bill, a very substantial compromise, I will suggest to you.  That bill then passed the Senate, went to the President, he vetoed it, it came back here, and you made a determination, some of you, not to vote to override the President's veto. So those 4 million children don't yet have a health insurance bill.  Then 38 of you wrote to the Speaker and said that you wanted to see certain changes. We addressed that. We addressed it very substantively, we addressed it very carefully, and we addressed it in a bipartisan way. And because this bill has to go through the Senate, we then engaged Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley so that it would not be simply Democrats saying, well, we'll take this and not that. And it was a very considered judgment applied, and almost all of the points raised in that letter were addressed.  Now, I had the opportunity this morning to meet with, not all 38, but the majority of those 38. Obviously they were correct that there was not more time to discuss this. I think that was a fair analysis. But the fact of the matter is that careful attention and compromise was taken.  Mr. Boehner is correct, I met with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt. We have a good relationship; we have the ability to talk. But I will tell you that one of the indications I had was that those changes would not affect at least one of those votes because, philosophically, that leader is not for this bill. I understand that, that's a fair position to take. We're for this bill. We want to see this bill go forward.  But I will say to my friends on this side of the aisle, on the Republican side of the aisle, I want to continue to work with those who really want to see, as that letter of 38 said, reauthorization effected because that's what we want to see. And we will continue to workwith you. This bill will go to the Senate; it will be considered there in the Senate.  We have significant, concrete changes to the legislation vetoed by President Bush, changes that are designed to address the concerns expressed by the President and by a number of Republican Members. We listened carefully to the criticisms of the vetoed bill. We reviewed the letter, as I've said, that the 38 Republicans sent to the President, as well as other letters that were distributed. I misspoke, I said it was sent to the Speaker. I observe only that apparently you wanted to negotiate with the President.  We also worked closely with Senators Grassley and Hatch, who met extensively with House Republicans. The bottom line is this: we have taken a bipartisan compromise that was strongly supported by the American people and by the overwhelming Members of both Houses of the Congress of the United States and worked to make it an even stronger bipartisan compromise.  Specifically, this legislation clarifies that it targets low-income children. That was one of the concerns. The compromises we have reached in the legislative language appended to the legislation today do, in fact, accomplish that objective. Prohibiting CHIP coverage above 300 percent of the Federal poverty level that the President talked a lot about, talked about the 83,000, we have prevented that. We said that is not going to happen.                              {time}  1600  It clarifies that illegal immigrants are not eligible for coverage under CHIP. I have not reviewed the prescription drug bill that you passed, but the legislation, I think, in this bill is stronger on that issue.  It clarifies that this bill is focused on children. That was a legitimate objection raised on your side of the aisle. We took that into consideration because we believed it was something we should respond to because that was our intent, to focus on children. As a result, we have phased out coverage for childless adults over 1 year, not 2. Some said that this is just tweaking. To have the time of phaseout, it seems to me, is a very significant change.  And, it clarifies that this bill seeks to minimize the number of children moving from private insurance to CHIP, ``crowd-out,'' requiring all States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for minimizing so-called ``crowd-out.''  We think we tried to respond, and we did respond, we believe, to the concerns you raised. These are significant, concrete changes, changes that neither affect nor undermine our principal objective and commitment: to ensure that 10 million American children from low-income working families who are eligible for coverage under CHIP guidelines today can participate in this successful program.  I, again, remind my colleagues that this indeed was the stated objective of the President of the United States, when, at the Republican National Convention in 2004, he promised, in seeking reelection by the American public, he promised this: ``In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions,'' with an S, ``millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs.'' He went on to say this: ``We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.''  Unfortunately, what stands between the children and the health care they need is the President's veto. We continue to try to achieve the President's expressed objective. I urge my colleagues, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Boehner is correct. This is not a partisan issue. There is not a Member on your side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. There is not a Member on our side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. We have an opportunity to add 4 million children to the health coverage of our country, just as the President said he wanted to do.  I urge you to stand with the bipartisan majorities in Congress, including 45 House Republicans and 18 Senate Republicans who voted for the first CHIP bill. This bill, in some ways, in my opinion, is a better bill for the suggestions made from your side of the aisle.  Stand with the States' Governors, the American Medical Association, the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the pharmaceutical companies, nurses, children's advocates and others who support this bill. Stand with the American people, 81 percent of whom support this legislation. Stand with the 10 million American children who will receive the health coverage they need and deserve under this legislation.  This bipartisan compromise addresses your concerns.  Let us give ``yes'' for an answer to America's children. Vote for this bill. It is good for America. It is good for our children.
