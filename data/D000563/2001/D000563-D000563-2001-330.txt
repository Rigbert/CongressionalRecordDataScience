 The Senator is speaking on behalf of the Hutchinson-Bond amendment which allows deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed people. I ask the Senator if the Congressional Record is correct, the Record of May 23, 2001, in which it announces the Senator from Texas, Mr. Phil Gramm, is one of the conferees on the tax bill that was recently considered and passed, the conference committee which removed the same provision we are now debating from the bill? In other words, the amendment the Senator has spoken on, you were on the conference that removed that protection from the tax bill. For the record, was the Senator one of those conferees who removed that?
