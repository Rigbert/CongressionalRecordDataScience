President, today is the 11th Annual National Sportsmanship Day, which is a unique program that champions sportsmanship and enhances student leadership and academic skills. The object of the 2001 National Sportsmanship Day is to promote appreciation for the critical role of ethics and honesty in athletics and society through student-athlete outreach programs, writing and art contests, coaches' forums and other activities aimed at furthering the principles of sportsmanship.  National Sportsmanship Day was founded at the University of Rhode Island in 1991. Today, more than 12,000 elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as colleges and universities in all 50 States and over 100 countries will participate in the events planned to help instill in young people the importance of playing fair and the value of hard work and discipline. The Institute of Sport is also proud that National Sportsmanship Day will be webcast over the Internet. Through online interaction with featured guests, exclusive interviews, and sportsmanship polls, this event will harness the power and expanse of the World Wide Web to reach students and supporters here and around the world.  The organizers of National Sportsmanship Day have gathered some of the best of our nation's sportsmen and women to serve as 2001 Sports Ethics Fellows. By sharing their remarkable accomplishments athletes Grant Hill of the Orlando Magic, soccer great Mia Hamm, Sergei Fedorov of the Detroit Red Wings, and 2000 Olympic Gold Medalist Lenny Krayzelburg, among others, will help encourage young athletes to strive and succeed by the rules of fair play. And in so doing, these gifted athletic heroes will inspire today's athletes to impart on future athletes the lessons of good sportsmanship.  Also part of this event and in its third year is a program called ``The No Swear Zone,'' which is a pledge that can be signed by athletes and coaches to stop the use of profanity in sports and everyday life. Further, in conjunction with National Sportsmanship Day, the Institute for International Sport will launch the Center for Sports Parenting. This online center will provide an interactive service where parents, coaches, educators, and team officials involved in youth sports can seek guidance on youth sports. Indeed, it is equally important for adults involved in youth athletics to teach and lead in the spirit of sportsmanship.  Sportsmanship needs to be taught to each successive generation, and I commend the Institute of Sport and all this year's participants for making sure that this valuable life lesson continues to lead the way on and off the field.                          ____________________
