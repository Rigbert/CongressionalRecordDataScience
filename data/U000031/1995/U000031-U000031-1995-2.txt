 Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman about the point, I think there are probably a lot of people out there eating dinner and probably some of them watching C-Span, and I doubt if very few of them understand all the scoring. But I will tell you one thing the American people understand. I think it is reflected in votes that have been made on this floor throughout the year. The fact that we passed a balanced budget amendment with 300 votes, it included a lot of Democrats, and maybe some of the people who are sitting here this evening. We passed a balanced budget resolution with the vast majority of Democrats voting with us.  The reason is that our people who are elected to these jobs, whether they be Republicans or Democrats, know that the American people want a balanced budget. The reason is because of the fact they balance their budget year in and year out, they know how to do it, they look at their ledgers, they see how much money is coming in, and they say, ``Why can't you do this in Washington? What is the problem? Why do we have a $5 trillion debt?'' Because we have overspent.  So the average person watching television out there, eating dinner, for those people that are, they understand how this works.
