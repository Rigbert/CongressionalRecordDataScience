Unfortunately, in holding this up, they are taking from the President of the United States tools needed to fight international terrorism. They are turning their back on the law enforcement people of this country.  We have an authorization for a charter change for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, something they have all supported, we have all supported, Democrats are all for. Republicans are holding that up. There was a charter change in here for the American Legion. All 51 on this side of the aisle have supported it. It is being held up on the Republican side. AMVETS, a charter change for American Veterans. That is being held up by the other side. We support it.  This may be the kind of political posturing people think they have to have in an election year. I think it is a crying shame.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Illinois.
