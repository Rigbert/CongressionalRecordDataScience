 President, Senators from both sides of the aisle and from multiple committees have worked hard to address the terrible crime of human trafficking. This is a growing area of domestic and international activity. Victims are counting on us to act. That is why tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is authored by the senior Senator from Texas and boasts sponsors from both parties. Victims groups and advocates have called this bipartisan measure the most comprehensive and thoughtful piece of antitrafficking legislation currently pending, and similar legislation has already passed the House of Representatives.  It is no wonder the Judiciary Committee supported, without opposition, the bipartisan bill we will begin considering tomorrow. After a reasonable period of debate and amendment, we hopeto see strong bipartisan support here on the Senate floor as well.                          ____________________
