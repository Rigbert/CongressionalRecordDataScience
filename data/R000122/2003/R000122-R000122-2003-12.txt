I said this before. This represents, in some respects, the greatest bait and switch in the history of the Republic. Seniors think they are getting pharmaceutical protections, and they will wake up and discover the Medicare Program they thought was there forever has been changed irrevocably.  Indeed, even the pharmaceutical protection is not that extensive, comprehensive, or effective. The Senator's point about the cost of traditional Medicare is well taken. We already have experience with this. We have had the Medicare+Choice plans. These are private plans that are not able to provide a benefit as cheaply as traditional Medicare.  The 2003 Medicare trustees report estimated that reimbursement from managed care enrollees would exceed traditional Medicare costs. We are reimbursing HMOs more to care for their Medicare beneficiaries than we are through the traditional Medicare Program. We know that. That is 2003. That is the report of the trustees of the Medicare system. Yet we are still under this illusion that if we pour more money into the private HMOs through slush funds, through premium support--through all sorts of mechanisms--somehow we will change the reality.  We are not going to change the reality. The reality is that this general Medicare Program is efficient, is effective, it has stood the test of almost 40 years, and it is a system that I think every American sees as being effective, efficient, and, indeed, an important part of their family's well-being in the future as it has been in the past.
