Marcelle and I have known Maida for many years, and we have always been impressed with her dedication, artistry, and selflessness. While we have come to know Maida through her tireless work for the State of Vermont, we have been impressed, but not surprised, that she brings the same dedication to figure skating, a sport she picked up at the age of 50.  Maida has served the State of Vermont over the years through her leadership as the president of the Vermont branch of the National Education Association, as a chair of the Vermont Democratic Party, and in recent years as a State representative for South Burlington. Most noteworthy though is Maida's long career as a public school teacher, a career in which she has taught young Vermonters the French language for well over 30 years. Maida's career of public service is exemplary. I know that she will continue to dedicate herself to Vermont for many more years to come.  But just as inspiring as her long career in public service is her pursuit of a personal joy and passion, that of figure skating. Maida, proving it is never too late to pursue a new joy, is as dedicated to her sport as she is to her career. Starting her days hours before many of us see the sun rise, Maida hits the ice before she hits the halls of the State legislature. Maida is a friend, a true Vermonter, and a true treasure.  Marcelle and I are proud to join her loved ones in offering a hearty congratulations to Maida Townsend onthis impressive win in one of her many passions. We are lucky to know her, and Vermont is lucky to have her.  I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``State rep wins gold in international skating competition,'' originally published by ``The Other Paper,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [The Other Paper Nov. 7, 2019]            State Rep Wins Gold in International Competition       It was an introduction even Townsend--Chittenden District      7-4 State representative--wasn't expecting to hear. But sure      enough, it's how she was presented to judges, the audience      and her fellow competitors at the International Adult Figure      Skating Competition in Lake Placid, N.Y., on Oct.17.       ``I confess that it got my attention being introduced as      representing the United States as opposed to representing my      club, which is what I am used to hearing,'' Townsend said.       But represent the U.S. she did, as skaters from around the      globe filled the Olympic-size rink. In her own category,      Adult Ladies Bronze V division--V designating competitors      born in 1951 or earlier--Townsend skated against three other      Americans and a Canadian to earn the gold.       As she took to the ice, she noted the judges' position and      prepared herself for the music to begin. ``Bumpin' on      Sunset,'' a Jazz song by Wes Montgomery, filled the arena. It      was a personal selection, as most of Townsend's program music      is.       ``There is the adage, let the music take you there,'' she      said. ``It does; you have practiced so long, over and over      again, this music is part of a person and the music just      carried me.''       As she left the ice and awaited her score, Townsend felt      great pride. She knew she had skated well and met her      requirements.       ``I'm my hardest critic,'' she said, but added, ``I knew      when I came off the ice that I'd skated it really well.''       But getting to victory was no small feat. Townsend began      preparing her program with her coach, Martha Harding, in      early summer. The two worked an hour each day Tuesday through      Thursday, adding in Fridays the month before internationals.       The program looked better each week, until just before      internationals.       ``For two solid weeks before this competition, nothing was      working right, everything was falling apart,'' Townsend said.      ``I was psyching myself out.''       But getting on the ``storied rink'' at Lake Placid--where      countless ``greats'' like the Russian duo, the Protopopovs,      Sonja Henie and Scott Hamilton have skated--made the rough      practices disappear.       ``I got on the ice to do the program and it was like those      two awful weeks never happened,'' Townsend said. ``I was in      the zone and it just felt so good.''       What's noteworthy about Townsend's skating is that it only      began 25 years ago, when she was 50 years old.       Townsend was an avid fan of watching the elite figure      skaters on television.       ``I'd find myself just so drawn to it, and oftentimes I'd      find it so beautiful I was there crying watching the      performances,'' she said.       When an ad for group skating lessons stared up at her from      the pages of a newspaper, Townsend knew the message was meant      for her.       Townsend wasn't fearful about safety when she hit the ice      for the first time. Rather, she said she was concerned about      being the ``tallest skater.'' Figure skating is a sport that      typically attracts a less aged crowd, but Townsend discovered      age is but a number. She practiced the basics in group      lessons, then found a coach to study under.       With Coach Julie MacDonald's help, Townsend honed her      skills and grew tremendously. Though Townsend was content to      continue lessons with MacDonald, her coach saw a greater      future for her.       ``At a given point in time, Julie [MacDonald] informed me      that she needed to kick me out of the nest,'' Townsend said.      ``I was very comfortable with Julie and she sensed I was too      comfortable.'' That's when Townsend paired with Harding.       ``Martha [Harding] was this really big deal coach,''      Townsend recalls. ``I was really scared, I remember saying to      Julia, 'What if she rejects me?'''       But Townsend met all of Harding's requirements and the duo      has worked well together ever since.       ``Julie knew what she was doing when she kicked me out of      the nest,'' Townsend said. ``Martha worked with me,      understanding as an older skater my goals are very different      from a kids'.''       Harding and Townsend spend much of their time working on      ``quality skating.'' For Townsend, that means dedicating      effort to flow, posture and working the edges of her blades.       ``To me, skating is when your foot is on the ice, as      opposed to jump, jump, jump, jump,'' she said. ``There's the      whole business of interpreting the music ... if all you're      doing is going back and forth jump, back and forth jump, it's      not being one with the music.''       Don't let that fool you, Townsend still gets some air. In      her early years with Harding, she did all the single jumps--     save for the Axel. Today she does what jumps and spins her      body permits.       And one of her big requirements is looking confident and      competent on the ice. It's not uncommon for people who start      skating in their adulthood to be more cautious than their      youthful counterparts, according to Townsend.       ``Adults are more cautious in skating, I think, than kids      are,'' she said. ``Kids don't have so far to fall, kids heal      a lot faster than adults and kids don't have to go to work      the next day.''       But Townsend challenges that. In fact, she's had judges      assume she's skated for most of her life. And though Townsend      is the first to say she's learned a great deal from Harding,      Harding says the feeling is mutual. ``I've learned a lot from      [Townsend] as far as being disciplined,'' Harding said.       Townsend's disciplined nature keeps her skating even when      the Legislature is in session. During the session, she's up      at 3:15 a.m. to walk her dog and prepare for the day, then      she's on the ice at 5:45 a.m. and en route to the Capitol by      6:35 a.m. But skating is good for both mind and body,      Townsend said. During the session it's a joyful event that      can be ``cleansing.''       ``If I didn't skate I think I'd be a much older 75 than I      am,'' Townsend said.       That's why Townsend would recommend the sport to anyone      who's interested but perhaps trepidatious to skate.       ``You're not too old to do it. There's no reason to be      defined by a number,'' she said. ``I really believe that. I      intend to keep skating 'til my body tells me, 'Stop.' So far      my body's nowhere near telling me to stop.''                          ____________________
