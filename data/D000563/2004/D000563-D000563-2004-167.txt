President, what those who are following the Senate debate just witnessed is, sadly, a commentary on what has happened to the Senate. We are embroiled in debate on a class action bill relative to reforming the laws of America about how lawsuits can be filed. Many Members, in frustration, have wanted to consider many other issues: Should America now, after almost 6 years-plus of not increasing the minimum wage, finally increase the minimum wage for American workers? The Senator from Idaho has joined the Senator from Massachusetts in addressing a very important issue about agricultural workers and immigration. They would like to offer an amendment for that purpose, and it has broken down. There can be no agreement reached--at least there has not appeared to be an agreement reached.  Now we are just at rest, at ease, standing and doing nothing. It is hard to imagine that any of us were elected to the Senate for that purpose and particularly as many Members of the Senate, myself included, were called to a secret meeting, classified meeting this morning, with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, as well as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, and were told at that briefing that we face an extraordinary threat to America's security. I am not saying anything out of school because I can tell you that Secretary Ridge had a press conference immediately after that private meeting and said as much to the American people.  It strikes me that under those circumstances we should be moving to consider issues relative to homeland security, not just the appropriations bills but issues relative to port security and railroad security. There are bills on this calendar which have just been languishing. At this moment in time, when we have nothing else going on on the floor of the Senate, why are we not moving as quickly as possible to consider those important appropriations bills?
