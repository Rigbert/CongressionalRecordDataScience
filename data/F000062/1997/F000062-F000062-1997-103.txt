 President, I also want to thank the Senator from New York for his help on this matter.  We have had a true bipartisan effort with Ms. Molinari and Mr. Fazio in the House and Senators D'Amato, Faircloth and Feinstein in the Senate. This bill passed the House on suspension. I believe it is an excellent bill. I think it will get the job done in a way in which we can all be proud.  The bill is slightly different than the bill that we introduced as an amendment on the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill last week. This bill provides for up to 25 percent of the cost of a first-class stamp to be attached, the extra amount added to be used for breast cancer research. Of the amount of funds raised, 75 percent would go to the NIH, and the remainder to DOD.  It is something that is widely supported by virtually every medical and cancer association in the United States.  Let me say one thing. Breast cancer is the No. 1 killer for women between the ages of 35 and 52 in this Nation today. It used to be 1 out of 20 women. Today it is one out of every eight women in the United States will come down with breast cancer. It is extraordinarily serious. This is a unique public/private partnership, the first time it has been tried, a pilot, if you will. I know it has been hotlined. I am grateful for the results. I thank the Senator from New York so very much for his work and support and the pink ribbon he is wearing on his lapel, and I believe the women of America, all of us, also thank every Member of this body.
