President, I rise today to express my concern with language included in the House version of the agriculture appropriations bill that could have the effect of depriving rural working poor families of perhaps the only source of information they have on the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.  In my own state of Illinois, for tax year 1996, over 750,000 working families received this critical tax relief. The EITC lifts approximately 4.6 million children out of poverty each year while encouraging work. The tax credit helps a substantial number of low-income working households in rural areas. A 1996 information bulletin published by the USDA Economic Research Service (No. 724-02) noted the importance of the EITC for rural working families: ``The earned income tax credit (EITC) has become a major source of support for low-income rural workers and their families, especially in the South, where the rural poor are concentrated. Program benefits for rural areas are expected to total about $6 billion in 1996 . . . providing benefits to an estimated 4.5 million low-income rural workers and their families.''  Unfortunately, report language included in the House's FY 1999 agriculture appropriations bill could deter and discourage important educational work done by CES offices. The language questions the appropriateness of CES involvement in informing families in their local communities about the EITC. This language could prompt many CES offices to discontinue their efforts to educate eligible workers about the tax credit. If that occurs, substantial numbers of low-income working families in rural areas could lose an important source of information about federal tax relief for which they qualify.  In Illinois, Coop Extension Services offices in 22 counties or communities (many rural) have been working to alert eligible working families to the EITC. The University of Illinois-Urbana Cooperative Extension Service provides programs to low-income working parents and students, including a teen parent welfare-to-work program in the high schools of East St. Louis. It published a notebook, ``The Easy Way to Prepare Your 1996 Individual Income Tax Return,'' for distribution to program participants. The notebook contains simplified tax return instructions, including how to determine eligibility for the EITC and calculate the amount of the credit. The program surveyed participants, and found that only a third of the participants had filed a tax return previously, but 86 percent filed a return after their training. A third of the participants were found to be eligible for the EITC.  The House language is simply not acceptable and should be rejected by the Senate conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill.                         Market Access Program
