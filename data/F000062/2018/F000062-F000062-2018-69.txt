 Thune, Mr. Nelson, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 398       Whereas athletic participation helps develop self-     discipline, initiative, confidence, and leadership skills,      and opportunities for athletic participation should be      available to all individuals;       Whereas, because the people of the United States remain      committed to protecting equality, it is imperative to      eliminate the existing disparities between male and female      youth athletic programs;       Whereas the share of athletic participation opportunities      of high school girls has increased more than sixfold since      the passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972      (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as      ``title IX''), but high school girls still experience--       (1) a lower share of athletic participation opportunities      than high school boys; and       (2) a lower level of athletic participation opportunities      than high school boys enjoyed almost 50 years ago;       Whereas female participation in college sports has nearly      tripled since the passage of title IX, but female college      athletes still only comprise 44 percent of the total      collegiate athlete population;       Whereas, in 1972, women coached more than 90 percent of      collegiate women's teams, but now women coach less than 50      percent of all collegiate women teams, and there is a need to      restore women to those positions to ensure fair      representation and provide role models for young female      athletes;       Whereas the long history of women in sports in the United      States--       (1) features many contributions made by female athletes      that have enriched the national life of the United States;      and       (2) includes inspiring figures, such as Gertrude Ederle,      Wilma Rudolph, Althea Gibson, Mildred Ella ``Babe'' Didrikson      Zaharias, and Patty Berg, who overcame difficult obstacles in      their own lives to--          (A) advance participation by women in sports; and          (B) set positive examples for the generations of female      athletes who continue to inspire people in the United States      today;       Whereas the United States must do all it can to support the      bonds built between all athletes to break down the barriers      of discrimination, inequality, and injustice;       Whereas girls and young women in minority communities are      doubly disadvantaged because--       (1) schools in minority communities overall have fewer      athletic opportunities; and       (2) the limited resources for athletic opportunities in      those communities are not evenly distributed between male and      female students;       Whereas, with the recent passage of bills such as the      Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport      Authorization Act of 2017 (S. 534, 115th Congress), Congress      has taken steps to--       (1) protect female athletes from the crime of sexual abuse;      and       (2) empower athletes to report sexual abuse when it occurs;      and       Whereas, with the beginning of the 2018 Winter Olympics in      South Korea, it is more important than ever to ensure the      safety and well-being of athletes by protecting those      athletes from the crime of sexual abuse, which has harmed so      many young athletes within youth athletic organizations: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate supports--       (1) observing ``National Girls & Women in Sports Day'' on      February 7, 2018, to recognize--       (A) the female athletes who represent schools,      universities, and the United States in their athletic      pursuits; and       (B) the vital role that the people of the United States      have in empowering girls and women in sports;       (2) marking the observation of National Girls & Women in      Sports Day with appropriate programs and activities,      including legislative efforts to protect young athletes from      the crime of sexual abuse so that future generations of      female athletes will not have to experience the pain that so      many female athletes have had to endure; and       (3) all ongoing efforts to--       (A) promote equality in sports and access to athletic      opportunities for girls and women; and       (B) support the commitment of the United States to      expanding athletic participation for all girls and future      generations of women athletes.
