Chairman, one of the miracles of our generation is in vitro fertilization. A husband and wife unable to have a child through this discovery are able to join together the sperm and the egg in a glass dish and create an embryo that is implanted in the would-be mother that leads to a beautiful child. Can there be anything more wondrous than this in the time that we live in?  What the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey] is suggesting is that during this process in this same dish more than one embryo is created. There they are as small as a period, the little dot pinhead. What the gentleman from Arkansas wants to do is to prohibit the doctors from even looking at these embryos, these spare embryos created to see if there is some problem that might lead to a miscarriage. For them, that is an exploitation of life. For me, it is ridiculous to reach these extremes. These are wanted children, husbands and wives trying their best to bring loving children into this world. To prohibit all research on this embryo is going way beyond what is necessary. I support the Lowey amendment.
