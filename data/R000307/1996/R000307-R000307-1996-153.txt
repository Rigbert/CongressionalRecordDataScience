Chairman, I have been keeping notes of some of the comments made by my colleagues and friends across the aisle who have been making wild-eyed speeches. While I am sure this is not the best bill possible, I may vote for it, and some of those concerns I think certainly ring true in terms of just this gentleman's concern and frustration; but I would like the opportunity to, if not set the record straight, to at least play the record that I want to hear and let people make up their minds.  No hearings, no hearings, no hearings, never had any hearings other than the 60,000 miles, the 19 hearings, and the 10,000 farmers and ranchers we visited with.  Now it is true that the subject of those hearings was not a specific bill labeled ``Freedom to Farm,'' but those hearings certainly served as a backdrop and a blueprint for that. No hearings? Well, we had a budget task force. We have tried to work together to try to reach our budget responsibilities in the past, and it became obvious that that was going to be very, very difficult for several reasons, No. 1, the budget number was really tough on the Republican side, but we were going to reach a balanced budget.                              {time}  1530  That is the thing that really drove this debate, that is, to get to a balanced budget, save the farmer and rancher $15 billion. During the budget task force hearings, we asked the minority which way do you want to go? Do you want to keep the current system, current structure? I said no, I think we are going to die. I think we are going to have policy rubble. I think we are going to lose $8 billion in the baseline, fancy word for how much money is available in agriculture. Then another $6 billion, then budget cuts, then another appropriations process, then future budget cuts, and you add it all up, it is $20, $25 billion; you end up with rubble.  I think we need a different approach. We settled on freedom to farm, which locks up more farm income, more money for production and agriculture than any other. Then we had two markups in committee that went on for hours. Started at 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, clear into the morning, one or two, same people on the floor doing the criticizing said they have not had any say in this with regards to this. Who were those people in the committee hearing, the markup that offered the amendments? Pros and cons debated?  This chairman tried to be very fair in regards to offering ample time to each and every member. It was not a hearing, no, but it was a markup, and everybody certainly knew the pros and cons of the legislation, and every farm organization in America has had this and they have had it back to the county organizations, and guess what. Most of them are for it and they penciled it out. I mean the farmer. I mean the producer finally figured out that he was going to get a payment this year, next year, did not have to pay back the advanced deficiency payments.  Yes, we have had hearings all throughout farm country. Every economist that has taken a look at this has said there is more farm income in this than any other program. Yes, all the Nation's press have weighed in. No, I really do not check with the New York Times and the San Francisco paper. I might check the Dodge City Globe. They are for it. But yes, they say yes, this is the best reform and the best program we can put together, and public opinion does count.  Now, this has been the most discussed and, quite frankly, I understand the concern of my dear friends across the aisle, cussed farm program reform we have ever had. Let us not talk anymore in regards to the hearings.  Not enough money? I usually do a glasses show. I take glasses and I pour out all the water in regards to losing the baseline in the next budget appropriations, factor when we get cut and cut and cut again, and then we say guess what, the glass that has the most water is freedom to farm. Too much money? First there is not enough money, then there is too much money.  Can we please quit referring to farm programs as welfare programs? The payment that we are now providing is significantly less than the last 5 years when the then-majority did not do any complaining about farm programs. Too much money? They are complaining about when the farmer receives it. The real issue is that the farmer, in receiving this payment, will have a risk management account. He makes that decision, not when prices are high and the farmer has no crop.  So consequently in regards to what we are trying to accomplish here, and we will continue the tap dance in regards to setting the record during the amendment process.
