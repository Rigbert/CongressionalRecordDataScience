 Madam Chairman, for purposes of clarification, before I summarize the provisions within the manager's amendment, I will highlight what the amendment does not contain.  The amendment does not contain a sense of Congress on foreign workers; nor does it decrease the criminal penalties for illegal entry and illegal presence. The latter issue will be addressed in a separate amendment I will soon offer.  I will now summarize the provisions of the manager's amendment within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.  First, the amendment contains a provision drafted by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) that will prohibit localities from requiring businesses to set up day labor sites as a condition for conducting or expanding a business. No business should be compelled to facilitate the hiring of illegal aliens by establishing labor sites on or near their premises, and this amendment will prohibit this practice.  The amendment also contains a provision drafted by the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) that requires the Attorney General to report on the status of criminal alien prosecutions, including prosecutions of smugglers. Mr. Issa is rightly concerned about the lack of sufficient prosecutions of alien smugglers who prey upon the most vulnerable.  The amendment also includes a number of important provisions that will facilitate the ability of the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to combat illegal immigration. Specifically, the amendment sets mandatory minimum sentences for repeated marriage fraud; improved sentencing enhancements for aliens who enter illegally after criminal convictions; clarifies that the Board of Immigration Appeals' decisions on motions to reopen removal proceedings are not subject to judicial review; increases penalties for passport and immigration fraud and penalizes fraud against aliens applying for immigration benefits; makes criminal defendants' immigration status an express consideration in determining whether they should be released on bond; extends the statute of limitations for all immigration-related fraud; makes passport fraud a ground of inadmissibility and deportability; and abolishes attorneys' fee awards to removable aliens under the Equal Access to Justice Act.                              {time}  1545  Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
