 President, currently students are enjoying low interest rates on their loans.  That was not always the case. In the 1980s, lenders were promised a rate of return at 9.5 percent on their loans when interest rates were high, but we were trying to keep costs down for students. In 1993, when interest rates were coming down, extra payments to lenders on 9.5 percent loans were supposed to phase out. However, they did not start phasing out and were rapidly increasing until I took action with my colleagues to end this practice.  Last year, I along with my colleagues, including Senators Kennedy and Durbin, who support closing this loophole passed the Teacher-Taxpayer Act.
