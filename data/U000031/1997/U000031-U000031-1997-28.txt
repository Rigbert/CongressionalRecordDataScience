Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, this issue is important not only because it is a matter of decency, common sense and compassion, but it is one that we need to pass this afternoon. Let me remind my colleagues again that this amendment keeps Legal Services at a funding level that is still $30 million less than in 1997, and in fact, it is about $150 million less than it was just a couple of years ago.  Mr. Chairman, we are a country founded on the basic principle of liberty and equality before the law, but when people are unable to even access our legal system because they lack representation in the funds to secure a lawyer, we are asking a portion of our society to forgo a fundamental right.  The Legal Services Corporation is an avenue for low income Americans to receive legal representation for civil matters. The lawyers who are part of Legal Services provide the guidance and the expertise needed to successfully navigate our complex and often intimidating judicial system. Very few of us could manage the intricacies of our legal system without counsel. Should we expect citizens who do not have the means to hire a lawyer to simply fare on their own? One person's legal problems are no less important than another's, and everyone deserves a fair chance regardless of their income level.  What are the civil matters we are talking about? Well, about 70 percent of the national caseload falls into categories in which children are impacted. In Michigan we had more than 80,000 cases last year; 40 percent of those fell in the category of family civil cases. But that means cases involving divorce, spousal abuse, adoption, child support. Other civil matters include housing, income maintenance issues, and consumer finance issues.  I think it is particularly interesting to note the role that Legal Services plays in helping single parents, who may or may not be also collecting welfare, secure child support payments; two-thirds of Legal Service clients are women, and many of those, of course, are single moms. I am aware, in fact, of a mom in my district who relocated to Michigan with four children after being granted a personal protection order from another State. However, the husband refused to pay child support and continued to threaten her. She had no place to turn other than the Legal Aid Bureau of southwestern Michigan, who helped her obtain a Michigan personal protection order, start divorce proceedings and obtain custody and support so that she and her children could stay together. Without assistance we can only guess what might have happened.  This Congress needs to have a heart. We are not talking about the greedy; it is the needy. And I would agree that there were abuses in the past, and I will ask unanimous consent to file all of these restrictions that this body passed. And I would respond to the gentleman from Indiana who talked earlier, that, in fact, when abuses are there we can go after folks and debar them; and, in fact, I would urge the Committee on the Judiciary on which I do not serve that they ought to have some hearings and look into those, and if the cases can be made, they ought to take some action. That is what the Committee on the Judiciary is for. But in my mind it is unconscionable for us to restrict access to Legal Services for any Americans who need representation.  Last year, we passed a welfare reform bill that enjoyed strong bipartisan support. One of the major provisions in this bill was to go after deadbeat dads, and moms, too. Mr. Chairman, in a good number of cases families that experience divorce are in fact represented by Legal Service attorneys who help in determining what their child support ought to be. Those are civil cases, not criminal ones.  Support the Mollohan-Fox amendment, and stand for the principles and ideals that make our Nation great.                      Restrictions on LSC Grantees       The restrictions on the use of funds by the LSC and its      grantees as enacted by Congress in 1996 are as follows:       1. No advocating policies relating to redistricting;       2. No class action lawsuits;       3. No influencing action on any legislation, Constitutional      Amendment, referendum or similar procedure of Congress, State      or local legislative body;       4. No legal assistance to illegal aliens;       5. No supporting/conducting training programs relating to      political activity;       6. No abortion litigation;       7. No prisoner litigation;       8. No welfare reform litigation, except to represent      individuals on particular matter that does not involve      changing existing law;       9. No representing individuals evicted from public housing      due to the sale of drugs;       10. No accepting employment as a result of giving      unsolicited advice to non-attorneys; and       11. All non-LSC funds used to provide legal services by      grantees may not be used for the purposes prohibited by the      Act.       Furthermore, provisions included in the Fiscal year 1998      Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations bill      will allow the LSC to terminate contracts of grantees which      fail to comply with these restrictions and debar grantees      from receiving future financial assistance.
