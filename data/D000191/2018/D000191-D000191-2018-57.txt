Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, as I look at the drafting--and, again, my staff says they did reach out to your staff--I am confused when you get to the 50 percent part, whether it would have to be exactly 50 percent or otherwise. I agree, and I think that it would be good to push for more flexibility.  For instance, I have a manufacturer of yurts in my district which are used in many places around the world as temporary housing. The military uses them, and others. I was approached by someone representing Airbnb about vacant houses they had, vacation homes in Puerto Rico, that could have beenused when they were saying there was absolutely no housing for any emergency workers anywhere. And certainly there could be lower cost alternatives.  I still remember when FEMA, I think it was under the Bush administration, bought a bunch of trailers that couldn't be used because they had some of that crappy Chinese formaldehyde-exuding wallboard in them, and they were not habitable. We are still importing that junk from China, by the way. So I agree they could be much more flexible.  I think this amendment, again, as written, is problematic, but I certainly agree with the intent of the amendment to look at other lower cost alternatives. However, they should meet at least some minimal standards for sanitary facilities and other things. So I, again, have concerns about the drafting.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
