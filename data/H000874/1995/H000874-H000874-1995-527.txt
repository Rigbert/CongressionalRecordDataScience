 I rise to join all of those who have already spoken on behalf of this resolution and, more importantly, on behalf of honoring a great American, a thoughtful American, yes, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] has said, a partisan American, but first an American, first a gentleman who loved his country, a gentleman who loved this institution, a gentleman who loved his fellow human beings and extended to them courtesy and respect and consideration.  I would doubt that there is a Member of either party who had the privilege of serving with Bob Michel who did not not only respect him, but hold him in deep affection.  Bob Michel was in this issue institution a person who brought us together, even at times of partisan differences. That is why Democrats and Republicans alike stand to support and to honor someone who has enriched this institution and greatly enriched his country.
