 President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the Hatch-Biden amendment by changing on page 6 of our amendment, under the title ``Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports,'' line 19--it presently reads:       (1) any person who recklessly violates any provision of      this section. . . .  I ask unanimous consent to amend it to say on line 19, subsection 1:       Any person who recklessly--  And add the words ``and knowingly''--     recklessly and knowingly.  Page 6, line 19, fourth word in, add as a fifth word ``and'' and the sixth word ``knowingly.''
