Majority Leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. And just to clarify, I get no royalties. The Wounded Veterans get the money, and I am thankful that you buy it.  But if I may finish with this, the Rules Committee will act. The American public expects us to act. We utilize technology. We utilize levees. We utilize dams. And I will tell you, many of those ideas come from your side of the aisle.  It is requested not just from Members on your side of the aisle, but Democrats and city councils and others that are along the border.  So, yes, we are taking action, just as we said we would do. The Rules Committee will find the right place to apply it, and we will be able to have the discussion on the floor.
