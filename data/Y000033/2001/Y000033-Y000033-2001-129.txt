No, I will not yield.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand it because I can hear them perfectly well, and I think they can hear me.  Maybe sometimes when there is a lot of noise, maybe there is, what I call a cumulation of facts.  Our bill says nothing, nothing about keeping the same contractors. Our bill sets high standards. Our bill requires new standards. Our bill requires federalization. I just do not quite understand why people will not accept that fact. If one truly has read the bill that was proposed last year and some would suggest we accept; and one truly believes that will give you security, then God bless you.  If one looks at what the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and I have been able to do, and the work product we put together, that will give us good security.  I even got my voice a little high this time. It must be the microphones. That is all I can suggest.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
