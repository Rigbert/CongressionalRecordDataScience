 I share the gentleman's frustration, but I would like to say that I think the answer is that so many projects within the Corps have never had the infrastructure funding that they have needed to move forward, and our bill does provide a leap forward in that direction.  I think it is an understatement to say that the Army Corps today has its hands full, and I don't think we need to add any confusion by trying to tinker around breaking up agencies and so forth at this moment.                              {time}  2100  Section 106 of the underlying bill was included in the bill after the administration proposed breaking up the Army Corps and transferring parts of it--arms, legs, heads--to other Federal agencies.  I don't really think that is in the Nation's interest. That plan was met with wide bipartisan opposition from both sides of the Capitol. Such a plan would require a plan to authorize that proposal, but of course, the administration never presented Congress with draft legislation.  Nevertheless, the administration doubled down on its shortsighted and misguided plan and was set to begin planning efforts until Congress stepped in last fall. The fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development bill authored by my colleagues from across the aisle, included this same provision which enjoyed bipartisan, bicameral support.  The Corps is responsible for the management of complex, multipurpose projects, some vast, requiring expertise in many areas. Instead of trying to break up and fragment the agency's responsibilities, I would suggest that the administration focus on how it can make the Corps successful in its current organizational structure, including deferring to the technical judgment of the Corps instead of the constant interference from OMB bureaucrats who have never laid a foundation, nor operated spillways along the Mississippi or the Missouri, and so many other responsibilities that the Corps holds across this country.  The Army Corps literally holds the lives and communities of the American people in its jurisdiction. Let them do their job. And if they are listening, they are cheering around this country.  I strongly oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same thing.  I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).
