Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment to increase funding of bilateral tuberculosis (TB) assistance, and I want to thank Representatives Engel (D-NY) and Green (D-TX) for joining me. The three of us are Co-Chairs of the Tuberculosis Elimination Caucus and have long worked toward that goal. This includes domestically, such as in the State of Alaska, which suffers from high per-capita TB rates in the United States, but also internationally.  The U.S. Agency for International Development does a tremendous amount of work across the globe providing aid. One of its most important battles is against TB, which kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease. In 2015 this amounted to 1.8 million people dying, out of the 10.4 million affected. This is more than HIV and Malaria combined. To make things worse, TB is preventable and curable.  Imagine if the Centers for Disease Control came out and said next year there is going to be a new disease. That this disease is going to infect over 10 million people and kill almost 20 percent of them in just one year. I imagine we would take it very seriously.  This is not an old world disease. TB is real and it is deadly. Pandemics of infectious disease in recent years have shown us the need to combat them ahead of time, not wait until it arrives at our shores. We have come a long way in combating TB, but more work needs to be done.  This amendment makes that possible and I urge its adoption.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).  The amendment was rejected.           Amendment No. 96 Offered by Ms. Frankel of Florida  The Acting CHAIR.
