President, last week, I introduced the Clean Cruise Ship Act to limit the dumping of wastewater by cruise ships.  Cruise ships generate millions of gallons of wastewater every day, and currently these ships can dump their waste directly into the oceans with minimal oversight.  The Clean Cruise Ship Act would require these ships to obtain permits through EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System to be able to discharge sewage, graywater, and bilge water.  It also would require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards of today's best available technology. This technology significantly reduces the pollutants that ships discharge and is already being used successfully on some cruise ships.  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been growing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel.  In the U.S. alone, cruise lines carried over 10 million passengers in 2011, with some ships carrying 8,000 passengers or more.  These ships produce massive amounts of waste: one ship can produce over 200,000 gallons, or 10 backyard swimming pools, of sewage each week; a million gallons of graywater from kitchens, laundry, and showers; and over 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water that collects in ship bottoms.  I have nothing against cruise vacations. They can be a wonderful way to visit many beautiful places.  In fact, it is because these ships sail often into these beautiful, sensitive environments that we need to be particularly careful of the pollution they release into those waters.  Here is the unpleasant reality. Within 3 miles of shore, vessels can discharge wastewater from toilets and showers into the ocean provided that a ``marine sanitation device'' is installed.  However, a 2008 report released by the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that these systems simply do not work.  The devices allow ships to discharge waste that consistently exceeds national effluent standards for fecal coliform and other pathogens and pollutants.  In fact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times greater than in untreated domestic wastewater.  While cruise ships must obtain permits to discharge graywater within 3 miles of the coast, graywater should not go directly into the sea.  Graywater from sinks, tubs, and kitchens contain large amounts of pathogens and pollutants.  Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are 10 to 1,000 times greater than those in untreated domestic wastewater.  These pollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and contaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner plates.  Even worse, beyond 3 miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage or graywater discharge. Cruise ships can actually dump raw sewage directly into U.S. waters.  The Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to address these practices.  No discharges would be allowed within 12 miles of shore.  Beyond 12 miles from shore, discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national effluent limits consistent with the best available technology. That technology works and is commercially available now.  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be banned. No dumping of sewage sludge and incinerator ash would be allowed in U.S. waters.  All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would have to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  The bill would establish inspection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our nation's health and economy. The oceans support the life of nearly 50 percent of all species on Earth.  Some cruise ship companies already are trying to improve their environmental footprint. They also want to preserve the environment--it is the natural beauty of the sea that attracts their passengers.  But the efforts between cruise ship companies are not uniform. A federal standard would apply one set of requirements to all companies.  It is time to bring the cruise ship industry into the 21st century. It is time to update the laws that protect our oceans and urge adoption of the best available wastewater treatment technology at sea.  Working together, we can support the industry while protecting the natural treasures that are our oceans. The approach taken in the Clean Cruise Ship Act will move us toward that goal.  I encourage my colleagues here in the Senate to work with me to pass legislation that will put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants along our coasts. Together we can clean up this major source of pollution that is harming our waters.                          ____________________
