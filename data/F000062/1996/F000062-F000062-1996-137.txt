 President, just to respond very briefly to the Senator from Massachusetts, the present act refers to this: Each order to show cause, or other notice in this subsection, shall be printed in English and Spanish and shall specify that the alien may be represented by an attorney in deportation proceedings, et cetera.  All we are putting back in is the reference to English and Spanish. The real fact is that, if on the California border someone is going to get a deportation notice, it really should be in Spanish if one expects them to read it and understand it.
