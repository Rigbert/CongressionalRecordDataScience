President, I am pleased that the Majority Leader raised this issue. I have seen press reports that have not accurately represented my conversation with Administrator Browner. During that conversation, I indicated that I had no plans to offer any additional clean air NAAQS legislation this year should the amendment be signed into law, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I did not indicate, however, that I would not offer clean air standards legislation after this year. I would not want to give up my right to legislate in the future and I did not do that.
