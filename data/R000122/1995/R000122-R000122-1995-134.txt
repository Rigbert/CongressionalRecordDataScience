Speaker, yesterday, a remarkable man made an important announcement in my home State of Rhode Island and on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Rhode Island's senior Senator, Senator Claiborne Pell, announced to the people of Rhode Island and to his Senate colleagues that he intends to retire at the end of his current term in the Senate.  The retirement of Senator Claiborne Pell marks the close of a career in the U.S. Senate that has spanned three and a half decades and witnessed rapid change in America and the world. Throughout these turbulent years, Senator Pell never wavered from his commitment to the search for world peace or the creation of educational opportunities for all Americans.  Senator Pell's legacy of public service began well before he was elected to the Senate in 1960. One month before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Claiborne Pell enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard where he served as a ship's cook and able seaman. After America entered the war, Senator Pell's family connections could have secured him an immediate officer's commission in the Navy, but he chose instead to remain in the Coast Guard and serve on the dangerous North Atlantic convoy runs between the United States and England in the early years of the war.  After the war, Claiborne Pell and his wife, Nuala, went abroad where Pell worked as a Foreign Service officer for the U.S. State Department. During these postwar Foreign Service years, Claiborne Pell worked in and around the capitals of Eastern Europe, where he witnessed first-hand the emergence of communist domination. Despite this experience, Pell always knew that communism was doomed to failure and predicted the ultimate death of communism long before the Berlin Wall came crashing down.  Following his Foreign Service career and a brief stint in business, Pell declared himself a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Pell ran on a platform of ``Peace and Opportunity for Rhode Island'' and despite the lack of an endorsement by the Democratic party, Pell won the Democratic primary and was elected to the Senate in 1960. At that time, one of Pell's closest friends in New England politics was Senator John F. Kennedy and it was a special delight for Pell to be going to Washington with his good friend.  During his time in the Senate, Claiborne Pell gained a reputation for serving the cause of peace and creating educational opportunities for all Americans. He has been instrumental in the passage of several arms control treaties and protocols over the years, including a treaty banning nuclear weapons in space and on the floor of the sea. Senator Pell will also always be known for creating the Pell grant, the most universally utilized higher education grant available in America today.  Senator Pell's favorite motto, ``Translate ideas into actions that help people,'' is a philosophy that has guided all of his work in the Senate, whether it was supporting civil rights legislation during the 1960's or drafting education reform legislation in the 1990's  Senator Pell is also known for his energy and unflagging devotion to his job. Despite the long hours, late night Senate sessions, and weekends working back home in Rhode Island, Rhode Island's senior Senator has never wavered in his dogged determination to make life better for all Americans. I know that he will bring the same energy and compassion to whatever task he turns to next.  It has been a privilege for me to serve with Claiborne Pell. I wish the Senator and his wife, Nuala, good health and happiness in the years ahead.                          ____________________
