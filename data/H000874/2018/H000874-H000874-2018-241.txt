Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I include in the Record remarks by Danilo Lopez. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.              March for Our Lives' Remarks by Danilo Lopez       Hello, my name is Danilo Lopez, and I am a junior at Dover      High School. I would now like to read a list of those who      lost their lives in the terrible shooting in Parkland,      Florida, February 14, 2018: Alyssa Alhadeff; Scott Beigel;      Martin Duque Anguiano; Nicholas Dworet; Aaron Feis; Jaime      Guttenberg; Chris Hixon; Luke Hoyer; Cara Loughran; Gina      Montalto; Joaquin Oliver; Alaina Petty; Meadow Pollack;      Helena Ramsay; Alex Schachter; Carmen Schentrup; and Peter      Wang.       Let us hope and pray that they are in a better place, and      we will always remember. To honor the victims, I would now      like us to all have a moment of silence.                          ____________________
