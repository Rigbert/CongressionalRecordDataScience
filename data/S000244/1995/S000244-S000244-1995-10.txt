Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to accept the gentleman's amendment, with the modification that he had just described, by stating that the administrator, whenever feasible, shall select the abandoned and underutilized buildings. I believe the modified amendment makes a significant contribution to this bill, and I am glad that this side is able to work out the problems and to support his amendment.
