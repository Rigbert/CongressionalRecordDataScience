Chairman, I oppose the position of the gentleman from Mississippi and I would like to make it clear to the Chair what is at issue here with this amendment.  Several years ago, this Congress adopted legislation which allows people who have been convicted of a felony, once released from prison, to apply to the Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, for permission to be rearmed. People across America remember the bumper sticker which said: ``firearms do not commit crimes, criminals commit crimes.'' But this provision in law currently existing allows convicted felons to be rearmed with firearms.  It is a provision pushed for and supported by the National Rifle Association. It defies logic and good sense. What I am attempting to do is to make it abundantly clear that once a person is convicted of a felony, that person is disqualified from owning a firearm in America.  We have ample evidence that convicted felons have applied to the Federal Government, have cost the taxpayers $10,000 per application to be rearmed with a firearm. If I might be allowed to continue.
