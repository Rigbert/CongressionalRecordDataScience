 President, I rise to introduce legislation that will take a bold step in reducing our dependence on fossil fuel and foreign oil. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Johnson and others in introducing the ``10 by 10 Act.''  The ``10 by 10 Act'' will require that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel sold beginning January 1, 2010, contain at least 10 percent renewable fuel. The ``10 by 10 Act'' is a signal that Congress remains interested and adamant in seeking energy independence by promoting the development of renewable fuels in the United States.  As President Bush stated in his State of the Union Address, America is addicted to oil. He also declared that we could displace at least 75 percent of the oil we import from the Middle East by 2025. I am here to say to America's agriculture community, that we're serious and we're going to do something about it.  Because the U.S. imports more than 60 percent of the crude oil we need, we have become dangerously reliant on foreign sources of energy. It is a threat to our national security for the United States to be dependent upon countries like Iran and Venezuela for our energy needs. It is also a threat to our economic security to be dependent on foreign countries for the energy that drives our economy. It is up to our farmers and ranchers to help liberate our consumers and our economy from the stranglehold of OPEC and other foreign countries on our energy needs.  This legislation will demonstrate to consumers, in a commonsense way, that each and every gallon of gasoline will contain at least 10 percent of domestically produced renewable fuel. It will show that we are serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and it will show in a tangible way that we are working to reduce that dependence.  The ``10 by 10 Act'' is a commitment to our constituents that we are working to lower that dependence, and reduce our consumption of foreign oil in every gallon of fuel they pump. With this legislation, Americans would know with certainty that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel was home-grown by farmers and ranchers right here in America.  It is important for consumers to recognize that for the vast majority of cars on the road today, no modifications are necessary to operate on a 10-percent renewable fuel blend. No significant changes are required to the fuel distribution network to allow for a 10-percent blend. The only thing standing in the way of reduced dependence on foreign oil is a signal from Congress that we recognize the virtue of homegrown alternatives to foreign oil.  Today, ethanol, a renewable fuel produced from corn, is blended in more than 30 percent of the gasoline sold in the United States. There are currently 101 biorefineries prducing nearly 5 billion gallons of ethanol annually. By the end of 2007, it is projected that we will have the capacity to produce nearly 7 billion gallons annually.  We owe it to the American people to pursue aggressive policies to free our country from our foreign oil dependence. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to replace 10 percent of each gallon of gasoline with homegrown, environmentally friendly, renewable fuel.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3553       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
