President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Gen. James Jones to be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. General Jones has served in the Marine Corps with tremendous skill and dedication, and I know he will make an equally effective U.S. and NATO commander in Europe.  I first met General Jones when he served as a Corps liaison here in the U.S. Senate in the mid-1980s. Like other Marines, then Major Jones was quiet about his war record but I learned he served gallantly in Vietnam. In some of the worldwide travel that the Corps supported and he helped arrange, I quickly realized that the service had itself a man of exceptional intellect, skill, and determination. In other words, the Corps possessed a leader in every sense of the word.  Despite his fluent French and obvious sense of diplomacy, General Jones is foremost a warrior and his career is dominated by such critical assignments as commanding the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. I visited this prestigious unit when it participated in Operation Provide Comfort after the Gulf War. One of the most impressive sights I have ever seen was then Colonel Jones giving crisp orders to his Marines only miles outside of the Iraqi town of Zaku while Air Force A-10 Thunderbolts provided aerial cover. He brought his typical professionalism to other combat-related assignments.  As the 32d Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Jones has served exceptionally. Under his leadership, the Marine Corps has developed new capabilities that will help America's 9-1-1 force to operate effectively at greater distances. In response to September 11 attacks, General Jones ordered the creation of a new unit to protect the country domestically, in addition to inspiring Marines to serve in truly outstanding action in Afghanistan and across the turbulent Middle East.  It is a testament to his achievements and character that the President selected General Jones to become the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. General Jones will be the first Marine to take on this most prestigious military command. He faces a number of challenges, including navigating the expansion of the Atlantic Alliance along with the prosecuting the war on terrorism. He will command an enormous Area of Responsibility, including much of Africa where the AIDS/HIV epidemic promises to create untold security instabilities. If anyone is up to leading allied forces to protect our interests and promote our values it is Jim Jones.  Marcelle and I wish General Jones and his wife Diane all the best as they move to Mons, Belgium. Based on our friendship and contact over the years, I know he will make us proud. I congratulate him, and, as an American, I am thankful our country has his services.                          ____________________
