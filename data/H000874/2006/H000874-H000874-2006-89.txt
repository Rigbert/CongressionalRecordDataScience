 On the following Friday, the 22nd, as the gentleman knows, Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown on that day. That is the first day of Rosh Hashanah. One of the problems, as you know, that we have is Members getting back to the West Coast in time to observe Rosh Hashanah appropriately. Friday the 22nd is currently on the schedule. Can you comment on that?
