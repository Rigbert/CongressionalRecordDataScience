Chairman, only in Washington would they say that if you ask organizations to compete in the free market, it costs more money to the Federal Government. Only in Washington would that kind of bookkeeping exist. So I am troubled by thepoint of order, but I would just say that I thank the gentleman for expressing his point of view. This will not be the last time we hear about power marketing authorities and their inability to compete in the private marketplace this year.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule on the point of order.  Section 3(j)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment proposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.  The Chair has been persuasively guided by an estimate from the chair of the Committee on the Budget that the amendments propose a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the point of order is sustained. The amendments are not in order.                Amendment No. 126 Offered by Mr. Weiner
