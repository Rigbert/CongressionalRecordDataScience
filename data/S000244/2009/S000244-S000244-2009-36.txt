Marty for a career of service to our country. For 40 years, Mr. Marty toiled to advance his dream of exploring the Arctic. Having worked after college for a civilian contractor under the U.S. Antarctic Research Program and as an infantry Imjin Scout in the U.S. Army, Mr. Marty is most known for his research at the South Pole. Later this month, Jerry will retire from the National Science Foundation (NSF). After 15 consecutive seasons at the South Pole, on June 30, 2009, Mr. Marty will begin a new chapter in his life.  From 1998 until his retirement Jerry served as the NSF Representative, South Pole Station and as Facilities Construction and Maintenance Manager for the South Pole Station Modernization Project, building a new elevated station, and the home of cutting edge research in topics ranging from astrophysics and origins of the universe, to climate change. It is a 65,000 square foot elevated research station that sits atop a moving ice sheet on stilts to protect it from snow drifts. The official dedication of the new station took place on January 12, 2008.  Jerry was involved in the Nation's Antarctic research program from 1969 until his retirement. He is one of the few people on Earth who can say he was involved, in some aspect, with every South Pole station. He was Assistant Construction Manager for completion of the second South Pole Station, including the iconic Dome enclosure for the station's buildings and was present for the dedication in 1975, helping to transition from the original station built in 1957. During 1994-1998 he served as Construction Manager associated with planning for modernization of South Pole Station, and oversaw the construction of the current station. Since October of 1994 he has not missed a single season at the South Pole, sacrificing holidays and birthdays with his family. In all, his service at the South Pole totals almost 5 years of his life.  His vision of traveling the world started with a pulldown map in his one-room school house in Monroe, Wisconsin, where he grew up as the son of a dairy farmer. He went on to graduate from the University of Wisconsin, Platteville with a B.S. from the School of Industry, with an emphasis in Construction Management. He also served for 2 years starting in 1970 with the U.S. Army in South Korea, where he spent time in the demilitarized zone as an Imjin Scout (2nd Infantry Division).  To honor his dedicated years of service to building state of the art research facilities in the highest, driest, coldest, windiest place on Earth, Jerry was honored by the United States Board on Geographic Names by having the Marty Nunataks named after him. The Marty Nunataks are a group comprising about six nunataks in the western part of the Britannia Range in Antarctica.  In 1997, as Chairman of the Science Committee, I had the privilege of meeting Jerry during a visit I made to our research facilities in Antarctica to witness firsthand the research and construction that Americans were conducting at the South Pole and to evaluate the working and living conditions for our personnel stationed there. I was impressed with the dedication and expertise of the individuals on site. It was evident then, as it is now, that Jerry was admired by his colleagues.  Having worked diligently to ensure that the South Pole Station Modernization Project was authorized and funded, I am especially proud to honor Jerry on this occasion of his retirement for his dedication to the Nation's Antarctic Program since 1969. His unending commitment to the support of science will be remembered by all who know him.                          ____________________
