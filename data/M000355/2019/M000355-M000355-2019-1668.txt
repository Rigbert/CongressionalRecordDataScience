 President, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on April 29, 2019, by the President of the United States: Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of North Macedonia (Treaty Document No. 116-1).  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
