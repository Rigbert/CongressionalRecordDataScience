SOLOMON. All we are saying is that if Members have amendments that would reinstate any of the cuts appearing in the bill that they would have to have offsetting cuts by chapter. In other words, in the Department of Veterans Affairs, HUD and Independent Agencies chapter, if you were going to reinstate a cut in that chapter, then you would have to provide for offsetting cuts within that chapter. But you are still allowed to offer further cuts on any of the chapters if you see fit, without offsetting anything.
