 President, this amendment is not about family farms or small business. This amendment benefits exclusively the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the families in this country--the very, very wealthiest people--and 99.7 percent of the families in America will not benefit by 1 nickel. By the way, for those concerned about the deficit, this will cost us $250 billion over a 10-year period.  Ironically, the Republican budget raises taxes for lower income familieswho are on the earned-income tax credit program and the children's tax credit program. So what we are doing now is giving tax breaks to billionaires in the same bill that we are raising taxes for low-income working families, and adding significantly to the deficit.  I think this should be a ``no'' vote.
