 President, I rise today to recognize Nichols Research Corp. of Huntsville, AL, which is celebrating its 20th year of technological leadership. For the past two decades, Nichols Research Corp. has made significant technological contributions to our Nation, and in so doing has shown itself to be a model example of the energy and dynamism of America's small businesses.  In 1976, Roy Nichols and Chris Horgen's small company consisted of a single office in Huntsville, AL, and a handful of employees. Since that time, Nichols Research Corp. has achieved remarkable growth, now employing 1,900 hard-working men and women in 27 offices nationwide. The astonishing rise to prominence of this once tiny firm is vivid proof that in America, great ideas, professional excellence, and perseverance can lead to unlimited success.  Since its humble beginnings, Nichols Research Corp.'s prosperity has been driven by its leadership in technological innovation and its ability to put its breakthrough ideas and professional know-how to work for all of us. For much of its history, Nichols Research Corp. has concentrated on developing technologies for America's defense. In recent years, Nichols Research Corp. has begun using its vast expertise to expand into the field of information technology, a rapidly progressing area which represents the vibrant future of the American economy. The skills and techniques which Nichols Research Corp. has gained are now being used to develop solutions for Government agencies as well as health care, transportation, and insurance businesses in the private sector.  Not surprisingly, Nichols Research Corp.'s innovativeness and leadership have drawn well-deserved praise and recognition. In 1993, Forbes magazine selected Nichols Research Corp. as 1 of only 13 firms for its ``Best of the Best'' list of small companies in America. In 1995, Nichols Research Corp. was named by the Department of Defense to its ``Top 100'' company list for research development testing and evaluation as well as other services and supplies.
