President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the majority leader's amendment to the defense authorization bill. The amendment takes important steps to improve the monitoring of the export of advanced U.S. satellite technology and to strengthen security and counterintelligence measures at Department of Energy facilities.  As a Senator, I have been privy to a wide range of classified and unclassified information relating to efforts by the People's Republic of China to acquire our sensitive technology and influence our political process. As a United States citizen, I am gravely concerned.  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I learned during the campaign finance investigation ably lead by Chairman Thompson that China developed and implemented a plan to influence U.S. politicians and elections. And from Charlie Trie and John Huang, both of whom have recently plead to felony offenses and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, I suspect we could learn more. More recently, I reviewed the Cox report, and just yesterday, listened to testimony concerning the report during a hearing of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services. The evidence is clear that China stole very sensitive military secrets involving virtually all of our nuclear weapons. What is more, I believe that the lax security at our government labs is completely inexcusable as is the Clinton Administration's abject failure to take swift and strong action when it became aware of evidence of serious breaches in our national security.  This administration is faced now with the opportunity to focus the country on constructive solutions to our problems concerning espionage and undue foreign influence. I fear, however, that we will be mired for a long time to come in the details of what happened, because those who know will not tell. Instead of a swift accounting of what went wrong, I am afraid we can expect the stonewalling and lack of cooperation we received during the campaign finance inquiry.  Yet there are things Congress can do now to improve security at our national labs, and the majority leader's amendment is one of them. The Amendment increases the exchange of information between the Administration and the Congress and requires changes at the Departments of State, Energy, Defense as well as other intelligence agencies. These changes will help strengthen security checks, licensing procedures, and access to classified information. I am hopeful that these provisions will enhance the security and protection of our most vital technological secrets and ensure that if violations do occur, swift and decisive action is taken to correct them.  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.                    bqm-74 target drone procurement
