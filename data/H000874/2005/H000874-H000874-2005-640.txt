Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Reclaiming my time, the business that the gentleman from Texas has set forth for next week is the energy business. Given the schedule the gentleman has just announced, would the gentleman expect the bill to be on the floor both Wednesday and Thursday?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, that is correct, both Wednesday and Thursday. This is a major, major piece of legislation, as the gentleman from Maryland knows. This bill has passed this House before. It required lengthy debate. It also required time to consider amendments, and we anticipate it taking all of Wednesday and most of Thursday to complete.
