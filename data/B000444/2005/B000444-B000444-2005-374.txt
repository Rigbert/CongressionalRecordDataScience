 President, my resolution, S. Res. 63, calls for an international investigation into Monday's assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri of Lebanon. The resolution also urges the President to take steps to pressure Syria to leave Lebanon.  I am pleased that Senators Lugar, Reid, Levin, Dodd, Corzine, Allen, and Chafee have joined in co-sponsoring this resolution.  The despicable murder of Rafiq Hariri has deprived Lebanon of a dedicated and effective leader.  It also is an attempt at intimidating the Lebanese people and pushing the country backward toward chaos. It must not succeed.  In Lebanon and beyond, many suspect that Syria is responsible. That's understandable--Syria has an extensive intelligence and military presence in Lebanon, its opposition to Hariri is well known, and it continues to play a destabilizing role in Lebanese affairs.  Syria must get out of Lebanon--now.  Prime Minister Hariri's emergence as an opponent to Syrian meddling in Lebanon was seen as a serious threat in Damascus. The fact that he was a Muslim holding such opinions was even more problematic, as this reflects the spread of anti-Syrian sentiment in recent years beyond the Maronite Christian community.  Cooperation across confessional lines in Lebanon complicates the ability of Syria to maintain its grip over Lebanese affairs.  That is why Syria forced Prime Minister Hariri to resign last October. And that is why Syria, through its Lebanese allies, had been trying to dilute Hariri's influence by redrawing electoral districts ahead of parliamentary elections due later this Spring.  The resolution I have introduced condemns the assassination, extends condolences to Mr. Hariri's family and the Lebanese people; it demands that Syria immediately withdraw its troops and intelligence personnel from Lebanon; it urges the President ask the United Nations Security Council to go beyond Tuesday's statement condemning the assassination by passing a resolution establishing an independent investigation.  I would add parenthetically that many in Lebanon are skeptical of an investigation that would be carried out by a government they perceive as taking its orders from Syria.  The resolution urges the President to consider imposing additional sanctions under the Syria Accountability Act.  Finally, it supports the call of the Lebanese people for an end to Syria's presence in Lebanon, and for free and fair elections for parliament this Spring monitored by international observers.  Mr. President, I'd like to add a word about what this resolution does not do. It does not in any way, shape, or form even hint at supporting the use of force against Syria.  I think it is important to state that clearly, given the mistrust of many in Congress over the administration's intentions after the mishandling of Iraq.  The intent of this resolution is to encourage the President to work with the international community to investigate the assassination and to use diplomatic pressure for Syria to leave Lebanon.  In fact, this tragic incident offers an opportunity to work closely with France. It was French-U.S. cooperation which resulted in the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution last September calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. And just yesterday President Chirac made a personal visit to Lebanon to console Hariri's family. I commend him for this important gesture.  I urge President Bush to use his meeting with President Chirac on Monday to coordinate the next diplomatic steps.  If France were to recall its Ambassador to Syria, the rest of Europe would follow France's lead. If France and the United States together called for a United Nations Security Council resolution to establish an independent investigation, I believe such a resolution would pass. Such cooperation would send a signal more powerful to the Syrians than any unilateral U.S. moves.  Given the lingering mistrust between Europe and the U.S. over Iraq, France may at first be hesitant. That is why I believe President Bush should engage personally with President Chirac to develop a joint diplomatic strategy and to dispel any apprehensions about our intentions.  Mr. President, Rafiq Hariri's assassination was about more than the murder of one leader. It was an attempt to kill the hopes and aspirations for freedom in Lebanon.  There are those who argue that we have no national interest in the independence of Lebanon. Given our bitter experiences in Lebanon, I can understand their apprehensions. But I disagree that we have no interest in Lebanese independence.  The Syrian presence in Lebanon enables the terrorist group Hezbollah to continue to operate as the only significant armed militia 14 years after the end of the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah enables Syrian and Iranian hardliners to try and derail renewed hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Based on my recent meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, it is clear that Hezbollah, through its support for Palestinian terrorist groups, is seen as a significant threat to a fragile peace process.  That is why I believe we do have an important interest in diminishing Syria's involvement in Lebanon.  At this moment, it is essential that the forces of terror hear a unified voice from the civilized world. They must not be seen as succeeding, lest they are emboldened to take even more aggressive action in other arenas. Instead, Monday's attack must be seen as a decisive setback for Syria and its allies.  I urge the President and the Secretary of State to act quickly on the recommendations offered in this resolution.  Rafiq Hariri's death must not be in vain, and the Lebanese people whom he served deserve answers--and action.  Let us hope that this barbarous murder marks the beginning of the end of Syria's presence and interference in Lebanon.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S1689-S1692]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC REFORM IN MOLDOVA                                 ______                                  RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL READY MIXED CONCRETE ASSOCIATION ON ITS 75TH                               ANNIVERSARY                                 ______                                    SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A ``ROTARY INTERNATIONAL DAY''                                 ______                                  CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER                               RAFIQ HARIRI
