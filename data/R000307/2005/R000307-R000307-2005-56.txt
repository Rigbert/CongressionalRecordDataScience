President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to General Richard B. Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his lifetime of service and unfaltering dedication to the United States Armed Forces and our country.  As both a soldier and a leader, spanning 40 years of military service, General Myers contributions to our peace and security, and that of our children and grandchildren, are a remarkable hallmark in military history. During trying times, under sometimes harsh scrutiny, and with high national security stakes at hand, General Myers has repeatedly shown his Kansas common sense, leading our military through two wars and a host of other challenges with a steady hand.  Dick Myers was well prepared for leadership. Born in Kansas City, MO, in 1942, General Myers graduated from Shawnee Mission North High School and attended Kansas State University, where he enrolled in the Air Force ROTC and was commissioned second lieutenant in 1965. After his commissioning, General Myers entered pilot training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. As a command pilot, he logged over 4,000 flying hours, including 600 combat hours over Vietnam and Laos. Serving in a wide variety of assignments over the next several decades, General Myers assumed the duties of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in March 2000.  On October 1, 2001, just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, General Myers was named the 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As the first Vice Chairman to ascend to the office, General Myers served as the principal military advisor to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council, and played a critical role in the planning and execution of the Global War on Terrorism, including the important Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.  During General Myers tenure as the chairman, he was constantly faced with unique challenges and responsibilities with both frustrating and emotional circumstances, from the worst terrorist attacks on the United States in our proud history to fighting overseas wars against terrorists and the enemies of freedom and democracy. Yet, despite all of the challenges, General Myers maintained a positive, forward looking determination and attitude, and never faltered in his responsibility to our men and women serving in the armed forces today.  General Myers' tenure and accomplishments were not limited to the Global War on Terrorism, including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under General Myers' leadership, the Joint Staff produced a far-reaching National Military Strategy, complemented by a National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, to guide the Armed Forces for the challenges of the 21st Century. This strategy serves as a template for the Global War on Terrorism, and was and will be truly instrumental in bringing freedom to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan.  General Myers also oversaw the establishment of the United States Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, the first combatant command responsible for the homeland defense of the continental United States. As part of this effort, the chairman advocated joint war fighting among the services and called on the entire U.S. Government to expand the culture of jointness in the interagency and international communities. General Myers has truly shown great leadership in his efforts to transform and modernize the military.  General Myers should also be recognized for his humanitarian role--a mission many times missing from the headlines. In late 2004, in response to the horrific events surrounding the Indian Ocean Tsunami, General Myers oversaw ``Operation Unified Assistance'', the largest coordinated and executed military humanitarian relief effort since the Berlin Air Lift. Designed to enable more than 15,000 Department of Defense personnel, 130 aircraft, and 20 United States Navy warships to distribute more than 400,000 gallons of water, 2,000 tons of food, and almost 3,000 tons of other supplies to those in need, the mission was a success.  General Myers' impeccable service and brave leadership are also reflected in the awards and decorations he has received throughout his career. General Myers is the recipient of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguish Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with eighteen oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award with four oak leaf clusters, and Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with ``V'' device with three oak leaf clusters.  Mr. President, today I have mentioned but a few of General Richard Myers' numerous accomplishments. I not only consider General Myers a strong military leader, in times of both war and peace, and a critically important person in the defense of our great Nation, I am privileged to call him a friend and a colleague. I have often said that if I were in a gunfight on Front Street in Dodge City, KS, during our States' pioneer days, there is no person I would rather have by my side than Richard Myers. I know that a grateful Nation shares my appreciation for the general--a courageous and honorable man and a strong and steadfast military leader during a truly trying time, and I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to him and his wife Mary Jo for the years they have dedicated to our country and to the betterment of the United States Armed Forces. General Myers, we wish you well.                          ____________________[Page S10115]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RICHARD B.
