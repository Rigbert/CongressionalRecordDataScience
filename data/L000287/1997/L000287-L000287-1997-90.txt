Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Jackie Robinson, Jackie Robinson, the man, the native Georgian. On this day 50 years ago this son of America, this citizen of the world, broke the color line in professional baseball.  He was a good athlete. He succeeded on the field and he was superb off the field. He was able to catch and hit. He was able to steal bases. He was able to run. But his greatest contribution was not baseball, his greatest contribution was to the cause of social justice. Through his actions he inspired hundreds to walk in dignity, to march for pride, to stand up for America by sitting in places where African-Americans had never been able or allowed to sit before.  For his action on the field, he opened doors that had been closed for generations. This one man, this one man, Jackie Robinson, continues to inspire men and women, young and old, to strive to do their best.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we salute, we pay tribute, to a great American: Jackie Robinson.                          ____________________
