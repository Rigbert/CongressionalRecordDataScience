 President, the Senate will be in session tomorrow. It is the leader's hope that we will be able to pass the respective party committee resolutions. As he mentioned previously, it is important that we get that done so that the committees can begin their work. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible during Friday's session. Normally, these routine committee resolutions are agreed to by consent. I hope that will be the case in this instance. Having said that, until this is resolved, Members should expect votes.                          ____________________
