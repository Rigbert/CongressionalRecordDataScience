Speaker, could I ask the chairman of the committee to answer a question? Would the chairman of the committee, in a spirit of bipartisanship, join with me in a unanimous consent request that as of Monday morning we open up and continue the research at the National Cancer Institutes to look for cures for cancer and for AIDS? Will the gentleman agree to that unanimous-consent in this bill?
