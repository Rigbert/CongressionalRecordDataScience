President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jennifer Joy Pinniger upon her retirement as president and CEO of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, NSSGA. Joy joined the National Stone Association in December 1996, and she has been ``Romancing the Stone'' ever since. To her that means helping decisionmakers, the aggregates workforce, and the public understand the purpose and value of the aggregates, or the stone, sand and gravel industry. She has focused NSSGA's advocacy on those issues with the most potential impact on the industry, always aware that the most effective advocates are those members of NSSGA who work every day to produce the construction materials essential to the built environment.  Joy has reminded me on several occasions that her father's roots are in Oklahoma, although as a Navy officer he moved his family around the world. Prior to joining NSSGA, Joy served very ably as chief of staff to former Senator John Warner and as an aide to Virginia Governor John Dalton before that.  Joy has championed the industry in meetings with administration regulatory agencies, always intent on finding solutions that will not only be positive for the aggregates industry but that are right for America. The Rocks Gallery in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History is an example of an NSSGA-member endowed opportunity for the aggregates story to be told from the vantage point of a world-renowned educational institution--an example of teamwork between innovative members and the NSSGA team quarterbacked by Joy Pinniger.  I have had the pleasure of working with Joy as she led the NSSGA's advocacy for passage of the last two surface transportation authorization bills. Joy realized early on that involvement of the public--those affected by the need to get to and from jobs on a daily basis, to take parents to the doctor, to attend children's soccer games; in reality all of us--was critical to success in moving surface transportation legislation forward. She worked tirelessly facilitating NSSGA member contacts with community leaders and lawmakers to build momentum for this often overlooked national priority. Success came in the form of passage of SAFETEA-LU in 2005 and MAP-21 in 2012.  Joy's advocacy leadership extended well beyond transportation to those regulatory issues affecting the aggregates industry. She continually emphasized the industry's ethics and credibility through NSSGA member company commitments to safety and health resulting in 11 years of record-breaking achievements.  With diplomatic leadership, Joy's policy, management, and motivational strength has helped NSSGA members reinforce message and guide relation bridges to fend off unjustified regulations like tightened standards for ``farm dust,'' and legislation that does not accurately distinguish aggregates operations from others.  Joy Pinniger has led the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association with distinction and integrity. I will miss her steadfast leadership, but congratulate her on her retirement and extend best wishes for whatever she chooses to do next.                          ____________________
