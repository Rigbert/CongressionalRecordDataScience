President, the motto of the Republicans in the Senate is: Talk more, produce less. Do you know what we offered them this week? We said to the Republicans: Here is the opportunity of a lifetime. Do you have a position on speculation? Do you think it is an issue? If you do, put your proposal on the floor and we will put our proposal on the floor. We will have an equal vote requirement, equal debate time. We will go at it and we will let the Senate decide. We are not going to write your version of the speculation, you would not write ours, but you have every right to do that.
