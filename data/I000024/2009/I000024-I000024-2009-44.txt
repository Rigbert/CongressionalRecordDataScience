I wanted to beat the deadline. I always wait until the last minute, it seems. One of the reasons I did is because there are so many thingspeople are not aware of, so I took the time to send to places such as Western Sahara and elsewhere to get documents that better explained a little bit more about who Ted Kennedy was than has already been stated on the floor of the Senate.  I have a good friend whose name is Mouloud Said. He is the Ambassador at Large of Western Sahara. He and I worked together for many years trying to bring some sanity into what has happened over the last 35 years in Western Sahara.  For the record, since people are not aware of this conflict that took place, back in 1975, the Moroccans invaded what was then called Spanish Sahara, later called Western Sahara. There were a lot of people chased out at that time. They fled. War ensued between 1975 and 1991. It continued during that time. When Morocco invaded that area that was later called Western Sahara, the refugees, the people who were living there who rightfully should be in that area, who should be living there today, were chased into Algeria. Tindouf is an area I have been to a couple times. The refugee camps there are so large. There are actually 175,000 refugees who were chased out of Western Sahara and have been wanting to be repatriated ever since then.  One of the former Secretaries of State, James Baker, was a hero in this area. He did the best he could to see that repatriation would take place. It seemed like every time they got close to working out something with Morocco, they would get right up to the altar and then they would cut it off. They would agree something should be done, but as they would come to agreement and get together, Morocco would back down. That took place for a long period of time.  You cannot be empathetic with the people who are there until you have walked through the little alleys and the stucco houses in Tindouf and see how these people are living, hearing their chants, their cries for freedom. Three generations now have been trying to escape, to be repatriated, and it hasn't worked.  I have a letter--I will read part of it--that ties Senator Kennedy and me to this issue. This is from Mouloud Said, who is Ambassador at Large of Western Sahara:       Indeed, this was precisely the case when Senator James      Inhofe and the late Senator Edward Kennedy reached across the      political aisle to jointly promote the cause of justice and      freedom in the Western Sahara, and respect for human rights      of the Sahrawi people. As recognized by the United Nations      Charter, the African Union, and the American Constitution,      all people have the inalienable right to freedom and self-     determination, and the Sahrawi people will be forever      indebted to these great Senators for their principled and      bipartisan stand on behalf of the Sahrawi's fundamental      rights.  That is what it is all about. We would see these people out there, and they had no one to take care of them. The Moroccans, they have friends. I have to say this: I testified probably 2 or 3 years ago at a House committee hearing. At that time, we made a list of all the lobbyists Morocco had hired. They had everybody. The money was all on one side, and only the Lord and a few people who were sympathetic to them were on the side of those people who have been living on the Algerian border for the last 35 years. That is what they are going through at this time. It is very sad.  I want to mention, talking about Ted Kennedy, how persistent he was. This goes all the way back to his involvement, back to the time when the war was still taking place. I have statements I am going to enter into the Record. They are not long. One goes back to October 1, 1992, a ``Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy at Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee Hearing on the Western Sahara.'' He goes through and tells the story of what he has attempted to do, and he had not been able to successfully get it done. The same as with James Baker and myself.  January of 1994, ``Statement by Edward M. Kennedy in Support of Amendment Promoting Implementation of Peace Plan in Western Sahara.'' January of 1994, we thought at that time we had it done. Again, an arrangement was made. It was agreed to by all parties until they got together.  June 23, 1999, ``Senator Kennedy Calls for Greater Progress in the Western Sahara Referendum.'' A referendum is all they want. They want self-determination. They want to be able to vote as to whether they want to be repatriated, which is something we in America would assume everybody has that right. But that is not the situation.  Senator Kennedy, again, went to battle to help them in June 23, 1999, and was not able to get it done.  Then, again, in 2000, he actually offered amendments for holding referendums in Western Sahara.  Later in that same year, he appealed to King Mohammed VI of Morocco to give these people a chance, at least, of self-determination. He was unable to get that done.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these documents.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy at Senate Foreign Relations            Africa Subcommittee Hearing on the Western Sahara       I want to thank Senator Simon, the Subcommittee Chairman,      for holding this important hearing today.       The ongoing crisis in the Western Sahara raises serious      questions regarding the Government of Morocco's willingness      to honor its international commitment to a free and fair      referendum in that territory. It also brings into question      the credibility of the United Nations in administering the      Western Saharan peace plan, and our own government's      commitment to the principles of sovereignty and self-     determination.       Barring immediate and dramatic progress, the peace plan for      the Western Sahara is destined to fail. If the peace plan is      to succeed, the United States must do more to make clear--     through deed as well as word--its commitment to a free and      fair referendum for the indigenous Saharawi people.       The Western Sahara is the last vestige of colonialism in      Africa. The U.N. Decolonization Committee called for      decolonization in 1966, while it was still under Spanish      rule. In 1973, the General Assembly called for a referendum      on self-determination by the Saharawi, Spain agreed to hold a      referendum and took a census to provide a voting list.       Shortly thereafter, Morocco and Mauritania, seeking access      to the territory's valuable natural resources, laid claim to      the Western Sahara. In an effort to strengthen its claim to      the territory, Morocco requested an advisory opinion from the      International Court of Justice on its legal status. The Court      found that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had ties to the      Western Sahara sufficient for claims of territorial      sovereignty. Like the United Nations, The Court supported      ``self-determination and genuine expression of the will of      the peoples'' to determine the territory's legal status.       Rather than accept that decision, King Hassan II sent      Moroccan troops into the Western Sahara. Clashes ensued      between Moroccan forces and the Polisario, the armed      resistance of the Saharawi. Invading troops ``disappeared''      thousands of Saharawi civilians, most of whom were killed.      Hundreds of others were detained without charge--and remain      imprisoned today.       The Moroccan invasion touched off an exodus of refugees      from the Western Sahara into Algeria. Seventeen years later,      tens of thousands of these refugees continue to subsist in      emergency relief tents with minimal food and water under      extremely oppressive desert conditions including violent      sandstorms and blistering heat exceeding 160 degrees.       In what became known as the ``Green March,'' King Hassan      then sent 350,000 Moroccan civilians into the territory to      strengthen his claim. Within months of the Moroccan influx      Spain withdrew, granting Morocco and Mauritania ``temporary      authority'' to administer the territory until a referendum      could be held.       Neither Morocco nor Mauritania granted the Saharawi the      right to self-determination, and their war against the      Polisario steadily escalated. The Polisario's use of land      rovers and quick strike tactics, however, achieved      surprising successes against Moroccan and Mauritanian      forces, and in 1979 Mauritania renounced its claims to the      territory.       Finally, after over a decade of war, the Government of      Morocco agreed to a U.N.-sponsored peace plan leading to a      referendum, under which the Saharawi would vote for      independence or integration with Morocco. In 1990, the      Security Council adopted resolutions approving the plan and      establishing the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in      Western Sahara (MINURSO).       Under the plan, a cease-fire was to go into effect on      September 6, 1991, and the referendum was to be held in early      1992. The parties agreed to use the 1974 Spanish census,      which recorded approximately 74,000 Saharawis, to establish a      voting list for the referendum.       Yet, only days before the cease-fire was to go into effect,      Morocco bombed a compound that the Saharawi had constructed      to house MINURSO personnel.       Inexplicably, the United States was the sole country on the      U.N. Security Council which failed to condemn this outrageous      action.       After the cease-fire went into effect, King Hassan changed      his position on the voting list. After vmg agreed to base the      list upon the 1974 census, he presented the U.N. with a list      of 120,000 additional voters from Morocco whom he claimed      were Saharawi and should also be permitted to vote. These      individuals were transported into the Western Sahara in      violation of the peace plan, which forbids the unilateral      transfer of populations into the territory without      identification at the border by U.N. personnel.       Under the peace plan, MINURSO observers are to implement      and monitor the cease-fire, oversee the release of POWs,      identify and register voters, and organize the referendum.      Fully employed, MINURSO was to consist of 1,695 military and      civilian personnel.       Yet as of today, nine months after the referendum was to      have been held, fewer than 400 MINURSO personnel are in the      Western Sahara. With severely limited equipment and      personnel, these observers have been forced to restrict their      focus to monitoring the cease-fire. Due to serious violations      of the peace plan by the Government of Morocco, the observers      have been prevented from fostering an atmosphere of      confidence and stability conducive to holding a free and fair      referendum.       These violations include preventing critical supplies for      U.N. personnel from reaching the field; denying U.N.      observers access to military areas; threatening to shoot U.N.      personnel; intercepting and blocking U.N. patrols and      sideswiping U.N. vehicles; refusing to identify land mines to      U.N. observers, resulting in the loss of three U.N. vehicles      and serious injury to U.N. personnel; banning access to the      territory by international observers, reporters, and human      rights organizations; refusing to withdraw any of its 130,000      troops; and declining to provide figures on the strength and      deployment of its armed forces, despite written instructions      to do so from the U.N. Secretary General.       Last month, in the most serious violation of the peace      process, King Hassan announced his intention to hold his own      elections in the territory, independently of the United      Nations--thereby wholly undermining the U.N. effort.       Ironically, U.N. observers have also been severely hampered      by lack of material and political support from the U.N. in      New York, which has routinely ignored Moroccan violations of      the peace plan. The Secretary General has failed to respond      politically to MINURSO's reports of cease-fire violations--     including 178 confirmed violations of the cease-fire, the      transfer of thousands of Moroccan citizens to the territory      prior to their identification by the U.N., and continuous      misbehavior with respect to MINURSO.       Accordingly, MINURSO personnel in the field today are      attempting to carry out their duties without the cooperation      of the Government of Morocco and without the political      backing of the U.N.       Despite Morocco's flagrant violations of the peace plan,      the Bush Administration has failed to press King Hassan in      any significant manner with respect to the Western Sahara. To      the contrary, the Administration has requested that $40      million in military aid and $12 million in Economic Support      Funds be earmarked for Morocco for FY '93. This is      particularly perplexing, inasmuch as no funds were earmarked      for Morocco during FY '92.       I hope that the witnesses for the Administration will make      clear today why the U.S. is not condemning Morocco for its      violations of the peace plan. The Administration should also      explain why it is unwilling to urge the United Nations to do      more to defend this important peace initiative.       Failure of the U.N. peace plan will have serious      consequences for the stability of North Africa. Unless the      Administration makes clear to the Government of Morocco its      commitment to a free and fair referendum for the Saharawi,      fighting in the Western Sahara may soon be renewed. That is a      result none of us wants, and now is the time to prevent it      from happening.                                  ____    Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy in Support of Amendment       Promoting Implementation of Peace Plan in the Western Sahara       I am introducing today, on behalf of myself and Senators      Pell, Kassebaum, and Simon an amendment to support the      indigenous people of the Western Sahara in their long and      arduous struggle for self-determination.       As U.S. citizens, we are fortunate to live in a country      founded on human rights principles and the right to a      government of our own choosing. Our democratic ideals have      inspired peoples in all hemispheres around the world.      Elections during the past twelve months in Russia, Burundi,      Cambodia, Paraguay, and Yemen are examples of the world-wide      trend away from authoritarianism and toward representative      government.       Sadly, this trend has not yet reached all regions of the      world. The indigenous Saharawi people in the Western Sahara      have waited more than 18 years to regain their right to self-     determination. Hopefully, that right will soon be restored to      them.       Since Morocco's invasion of the Western Sahara in 1975,      King Hassan II has staged a long and costly war against the      Saharawi people to obtain permanent access to that      territory's valuable natural resources.       For years, Morocco ignored proposals by the U.N. General      Assembly calling for a referendum on self-determination by      the Saharawi. When Morocco took its claim over the territory      before the International Court of Justice, the Court found      that Morocco did not have ties sufficient for claims of      territorial sovereignty. Like the United Nations, the Court      supported ``self-determination and genuine expression of the      will of the peoples'' to determine the territory's legal      status.       Rather than accept that decision, King Hassan sent Moroccan      troops into the territory who killed and ``disappeared''      thousands of Saharawi who were unwilling to recognize      Moroccan sovereignty. Then, in what became known as the      ``Green March,'' King Hassan sent 350,000 Moroccan citizens      into the Western Sahara to strengthen his claim to it.       Finally, after over a decade of war, the Government of      Morocco agreed to a U.N.-sponsored peace plan leading up to a      referendum under which the Saharawi would vote for      independence or integration with Morocco. Under this plan, a      ceasefire was to go into effect on September 6, 1991, and the      referendum was to be held in early 1992. The parties agreed      to use a 1974 census, which recorded approximately 74,000      Saharawis, to establish a voting list for the referendum.       Yet, only days before the cease-fire was to go into effect,      Morocco bombed a compound the Saharawi had constructed to      house U.N. personnel. In addition, King Hassan changed his      position on the voter list.       After having previously agreed to base the list upon the      1974 census, he presented the U.N. with a list of 170,000      Moroccans whom he claimed should also be permitted to vote.      These individuals were moved into the Western Sahara in      violation of the peace plan, which forbids the unilateral      transfer of population into the territory without prior      identification by U.N. personnel.       U.N. observers have also expressed concern regarding other      violations of the peace plan by the Government of Morocco.      These violations have prevented the observers from fostering      an atmosphere of confidence and stability conducive to      holding a free and fair referendum.       The violations include preventing critical supplies for      U.N. personnel from reaching the field; denying U.N.      observers access to military areas; threatening to shoot U.N.      personnel; intercepting and blocking U.N. patrols and      sideswiping U.N. vehicles; refusing to identify land mines to      U.N. observers, resulting in the loss of three U.N.      vehicles and serious injury to U.N. personnel; banning      access to the territory by international observers,      reporters, and human rights organizations; refusing to      withdraw its troops; and declining to provide figures on      the strength and deployment of its armed forces, despite      written instructions to do so from the U.N. Secretary      General.       In one of the most serious violations of the peace process,      King Hassan held his own elections in the territory in June--     thereby directly undermining the U.N. effort.       U.N. officials nonetheless remain hopeful of holding the      referendum this year. For the referendum to be free and fair,      the U.N. must disqualify Moroccan settlers from eligibility      to vote in the referendum.       Failure of the U.N. peace plan is likely to have serious      consequences for the stability of North Africa. If the      Government of Morocco continues to obstruct the peace      process, fighting in the Western Sahara may well be renewed.       At this critical stage in the peace process the United      States must do more to make clear--through deed as well as      word--our commitment to a free and fair referendum for the      Saharawi people.       The amendment we are introducing today:       (1) Commends the President for his commitment within the      United Nations and in bilateral relations to a free and fair      referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara;       (2) Supports the United Nations' commitment to holding a      free and fair referendum, and commends the Secretary General      for intensifying his efforts towards that end;       (3) Commends the Administration for undertaking new policy      initiatives with regard to the Western Sahara, including the      opening of contacts with the Polisario Front at the Saharawi      refugee camp in Tindouf, Algeria;       (4) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to comply      strictly with the terms of the peace plan as accepted by the      parties and approved by the United Nations Security Council;       (5) Calls upon Morocco to put an end to the transfer of      population not properly identified by the United Nations as      eligible voters in the referendum from Morocco into the      Western Sahara, and to return to Morocco all such individuals      currently in the Western Sahara;       (6) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to continue      the direct dialogue they begun under the auspices of the      United Nations in July 1993 with the goal of furthering the      peace process;       (7) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to allow      international human rights organizations to enter Morocco,      the Western Sahara, and refugee camps under their control to      assess the human rights situation; and       (8) Calls upon the President to:       Strongly advocate within the United Nations and in      bilateral relations the implementation of the peace plan as      accepted by the Polisario Front and Morocco and approved by      the U.N. Security Council;       Urge all parties concerned to take all steps necessary to      begin voter registration, starting with the updated lists of      the 1974 Spanish census, and to overcome their differences      regarding the interpretation and application of the criteria      for voter eligibility;       Institute regular contact at all levels in Washington with      representatives of the Polisario Front, in order to      strengthen the United States' evenhanded position with      respect to the Western Sahara; and       Encourage the parties to allow independent international      observers, including human rights organizations, to monitor      the situation in the territory and observe the referendum      process.       The ongoing crisis in the Western Sahara raises serious      questions regarding the Government of Morocco's willingness      to honor its international commitment to a free and fair      referendum in the Western Sahara. This amendment would make      clear our government's support for the U.N. peace process and      America's commitment to the principles of sovereignty and      self-determination.       I urge my colleagues to join us in enacting this timely and      important measure.                                  ____Senator Kennedy Calls for Greater Progress on Western Sahara Referendum       Senator Edward M. Kennedy today praised the Senate for      calling for greater progress on a long-stalled referendum on      self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara.       Since 1988, the United Nations has sought to organize a      free, fair, and open referendum in the Western Sahara, the      former Spanish colony that Morocco has illegally occupied      since 1975.       Kennedy said, ``A solution to the conflict over the Western      Sahara will enhance security and stability in Northern      Africa. After more than ten years of delay, the people of the      Western Sahara should be permitted to determine for      themselves who will govern them.''       Kennedy, Republican Senator Gordon Smith, and Democratic      Senator Patrick Leahy sponsored an amendment accepted by the      Senate on the State Department Reauthorization Bill to      require the State Department to report on progress on the      referendum. The bill, including the Western Sahara amendment,      was passed by the Senate yesterday.       The International Court of Justice, the Organization of      African Unity, the United States, and many other nations      throughout the world have not recognized Morocco's claim to      the Western Sahara, but Morocco's occupation continues. Tens      of thousands of the Sahrawi people languish in refugee camps      in southern Algeria and have been denied the opportunity to      determine their own future.       A UN referendum was originally scheduled for 1992. It has      since been delayed many times, primarily due to the      resistance of the Government of Morocco. The referendum is      now scheduled for July 2000.       In the 1997 Houston Accords, achieved under the leadership      of former Secretary of State James Baker, and in a UN plan      last December, the international community called for the      conclusion of the voter registration process and a      referendum. Morocco subsequently agreed to allow the      referendum to occur by July 2000.       Senator Kennedy praised the Administration's efforts to      resolve this longstanding dispute. He urged the State      Department to make it clear to both parties to this dispute      that the United States expects the people of the Western      Sahara to be allowed to exercise their right to self-     determination in a free, fair, and open referendum by July      2,000.       ``Morocco has been a faithful ally of the United States for      more than 200 years,'' said Kennedy, ``but its refusal to      allow the people of the Western Sahara to determine their own      political future undercuts America's efforts to promote      democracy worldwide.''       The Kennedy-Smith-Leahy amendment requires the State      Department to report on January 1, 2000 and again on June 1--     2000 on specific steps being taken by the Government of      Morocco and by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia      el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) to ensure a free, fair,      and open referendum by July 2000 for the people of the      Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration      with Morocco.       The State Department reports will include a description of      preparations for the referendum and the extent to which free      access to the territory will be guaranteed for independent      and international organizations, including election observers      and international media. Human rights organizations and other      international organizations must also be permitted to observe      the referendum.       In addition, the reports will include a description of      current efforts by the Department of State to ensure that the      referendum will be held, and an assessment of the likelihood      that the July 2000 date will be met.       The reports will also include a description of obstacles,      if any, to the voter registration process and other      preparations for the referendum and efforts being made: by      the parties and the United States Government to overcome      those obstacles. Finally, the reports will include an      assessment of progress being made in the repatriation      process.                                  ____     (Purpose: To require reports with respect to the holding of a                      referendum on Western Sahara)       On page 115; after line 18, add the following new section:     SEC. _. REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO A REFERENDUM ON WESTERN                    SAHARA.       (a) Reports Required.--       (1) In general.--Not later than each of the dates specified      in paragraph (2)1 the Secretary of State shall submit a      report to the appropriate Congressional committees describing      specific steps being taken by the Government of Morocco and      by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra      and Rio de Oro (POLIS--RIO) to ensure that a referendum in      which the people of the Western Sahara will choose between      independence and integration with Morocco will be held by      March 2000.       (2) Deadlines for submission of reports.--The dates      referred to in paragraph (1) are November 1, 1999, and      February 1, 2000.       (b) Report Elements.--The report shall include--       (1) a description of preparations for the referendum,       (2) a description of current efforts by the Department of      State to ensure that a referendum will be held by March 2000;       (3) an assessment of the likelihood that the March 2000      date will be met,       (4) a description of obstacles, if any, to the voter-     registration process and other preparations for the      referendum, and efforts being made by the parties and the      United States Government to overcome those obstacles;       (5) an assessment of progress being made in the      repatriation process; and                                  ____    Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on IDS Meeting With King                          Mohammed VI of Morocco       I welcome this opportunity to meet with the King. I have      great respect for his leadership, and I wished him well in      his important responsibilities, and in maintaining close ties      between our nations.       A particular issue I discussed with the King was the United      Nations referendum on the Western Sahara.       Morocco gained the respect of the international community      when it agreed in 1991 and again in 1997 to allow a      referendum on the future of the Western Sahara. These actions      demonstrated an impressive commitment to the right of self-     determination for the people of the Western Sahara.       The referendum is an important part of the peace process,      and I hope that it will take place as soon as possible.
