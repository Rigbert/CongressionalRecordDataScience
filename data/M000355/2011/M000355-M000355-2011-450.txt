 President, it is my intention also that this new approach will serve us for the Congress and future Congresses. In addition, we are making a transition to restore Special Reserves to its historic purpose. We know that we will face tight budgets for the foreseeable future and cannot expect increases in funding. We have to move toward funding authorizations that are in line with our actual resources and I look forward to working with my friend, the majority leader, to accomplish this.
