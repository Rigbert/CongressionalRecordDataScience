We mourn for those who have perished. We pray for those who suffer. We are inspired by the courage and heroism of the people of New York, particularly the brave firefighters and police officers. We are inspired by the fidelity to duty of our men and women in uniform at the Pentagon and around the world.  Ages ago, the Greek historian Thucydides reminded us:       [T]he bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision      of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet      notwithstanding, go out to meet it.  Yesterday we saw the bravest: firefighters and police officers who rushed into a burning and collapsing skyscraper, a chief of the New York City fire department, a deputy chief, and department chaplain who stayed at their posts as the building collapsed around them; soldiers, sailors, airmen, airwomen at the Pentagon who struggled through wreckage to take out survivors, and returned today to work at their posts; office workers in New York who carried fellow workers down 60 flights of stairs to safety.  Their bravery and their courage is an inspiration to all of us. And we are profoundly angered by those terrorists who have struck this devious, horrific blow against us all.  The emotions of yesterday and today must and will coalesce into a steely resolve to mete out justice to the terrorists, to those who harbor them, to those who train them, and to those who encourage them.  We must work with our allies to destroy the network of terrorism that is committed to imposing its fanatical and suicidal pathology on free men and women everywhere.  Yesterday we lost what little innocence that remained in our view of the world. We have been bloodied. But we retain a common and constant faith that free men and women, committed to individual progress, and mindful of the dignity of all men and women, will prevail over the fanatic dedicated to destruction and darkness.  Archibald MacLeish, the American poet, gave voice to many of the emotions we feel when he spoke of those who fell in battle:     The young dead soldiers do not speak.     Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses: who has not            heard them?     They have a silence that speaks for them at night and when            the clock counts.     They say: We were young. We have died. Remember us.     They say: We have done what we could but until it is finished            it is not done.     They say: We have given our lives but until it is finished no            one can know what our lives gave.     They say: Our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will            mean what you make them.     They say: Whether our lives and our deaths were for peace and            a new hope or for nothing we cannot say; it is you who            must say this.     They say: We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.  We will rebuild New York and the Pentagon. And although we can never replace the lives that were lost, we will give them their meaning. Let our foes everywhere know that our words are more than a lamentation; they are a call to action and a promise of swift and certain justice.  I yield the floor.
