President, I believe we have run out of those in the Senate who wish to speak. I would just like to state again that this is a nominee who is supported by both Senator Murkowski and myself. This is a nominee who got an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  As I said earlier, I think he is an individual who is smart about energy policy, he is savvy about how the Department of Energy operates and he is a solution-oriented person and Democrats and Republicans in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee saw that in the confirmation process.  There are huge challenges ahead of him at the Department of Energy, but I think he is very qualified for this position. I would urge all Senators--Democrats and Republicans--to support the nominee.  I yield back all remaining time on both sides.
