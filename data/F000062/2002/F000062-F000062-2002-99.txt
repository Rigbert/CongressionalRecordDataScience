 President, I rise today to offer the Intelligence Community Leadership Act of 2002. This legislation creates the position of Director of National Intelligence to lead a true intelligence community and to coordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts and help assure that the sort of communication problems that prevented the various elements of our intelligence community from working together effectively before September 11 never happen again.  While this bill will certainly not solve every problem within the intelligence community, I believe it to be a necessary first step towards getting our intelligence house in order.  The National Security Act of 1947, which created the bulk of our cold war era national security apparatus, created both the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Director of Central Intelligence, of which the CIA is but one component, as two positions occupied by one person.  As Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the person in this position is the CEO of the Agency charged with collecting human intelligence, centrally analyzing all intelligence collected by the U.S. government, and conducting covert action.  As head of the intelligence community, which also includes the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the intelligence-gathering elements of the FBI, as well as others, this person is responsible for coordinating a multitude of agencies and harnessing their efforts to secure the overall needs of U.S. national security.  Although this structure served as well enough in the cold war, it is, in my view, far from perfect, and, putbluntly, I do not believe that giving both jobs to one person makes sense.  Moreover, just as the particular needs of the superpower rivalry of the cold war drove the national security structure and apparatus put into place by the National Security Act of 1947, so, too, should the intelligence and anti-terrorism challenges that our country now faces in the post-9-11 world drive the creation of new national security structures adequate to the new challenge.  The President, in proposing the creation of the Department of Homeland Security has addressed part of this challenge. But the administration's plan does not do enough to address the need to better coordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts.  To start to address these problems the Intelligence Community Leadership Act of 2002 splits the current position of Director of Central Intelligence, currently held by one individual, who is tasked with running the CIA and the intelligence community as a whole, into two positions: a Director of National Intelligence, DNI, to lead the Intelligence Community and a Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to run the CIA.  It may appear somewhat paradoxical to argue that in order to assure closer and better coordination within and across our intelligence community the current position of the Director of Central Intelligence should be split, but this is, in fact, the case.  As a practical matter, the demands of these two full time jobs on the time and attention of any person, no matter how skilled in management, are overwhelming.  Indeed, running the intelligence community and running the CIA are both important enough to be full time jobs.  That was true before September 11, and it is especially true after September 11.  Even if one person could handle both jobs and reconcile the inherent conflicts, there would remain the perception that he or she is favoring either the community or the Agency.  That is not a formula which is well-suited to lead to a seamless and fully integrated intelligence community providing optimum analytic product to national decision makers or assuring that critical intelligence missions are properly allocated and resourced.  Specifically, then, this legislation would create the new position of Director of National Intelligence, DNI, a new independent head of the intelligence community with the proper and necessary authority to coordinate activities, direct priorities, and create the budget for our nation's national intelligence community.  The DNI would be responsible for all of the functions now performed by the Director of Central Intelligence in his role as head of the intelligence community, a separate individual would be Director of the CIA.  Nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and serving a ten-year term, the DNI would be insulated from the vagaries of politics and specifically empowered to create the national intelligence budget in conjunction with the various intelligence agencies within our government.  The DNI would be able to transfer personnel and funds between intelligence agencies as necessary to carry out the core functions of the intelligence community, without the need to seek permission from individual agency heads.  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, DCIA, freed from the double burden as head of the intelligence community, would then be able to concentrate on the critical missions of the CIA alone: Assure the collection of intelligence from human sources, and that intelligence is properly correlated, evaluated, and disseminated throughout the intelligence community and to decision makers.  The critical policy and resource decisions of the President's proposed Department of Homeland Defense will only be as good as the intelligence which informs those decisions.  Whatever the other preliminary lessons we may draw from the ongoing inquiry into the September 11 attacks, one thing is perfectly clear: we need to better coordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts.  If the new Department, and the President and Members of Congress, are going to be able to get the sort of intelligence we need to both safeguard our citizens and protect American national security interests, we need to address the structural problems that exist today with our intelligence community.  I believe a first step in finding a solution to this problem is relatively simple, enact legislation that would require the head of the intelligence community and the head of the CIA to be two different people.  That is what this legislation would do, and I urge my colleagues to join me both on this legislation, and in considering other reforms which may also be necessary to reformulate of intelligence community to meet the challenges of the new era.                                 ______                                       By
