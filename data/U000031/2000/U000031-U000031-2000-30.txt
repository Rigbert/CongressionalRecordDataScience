Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan Medicare prescription drug plan that we are now considering this evening.  No senior citizen should be forced to forego needed medication, take less than the prescribed dose, or go without other necessities of life in order to afford life-saving medication.  I have watched and I have heard stories and seen seniors literally cutting their pills in half so that they can make it last just a little bit longer and at a little bit less cost.  Helping provide this benefit is important. As I have had a whole wave of town meetings across my district earlier this spring, I can remember one man who brought a bag of prescriptions with him and he said, ``Mr. Upton, I know you are an optimist. Can you get this bill done in 2 weeks, because that is when this prescription is due and when I have to get it renewed?'' And I pledged to him I would work very hard to try to get a bill through this Housethis year but, sadly, not within the 2-week time frame that he wanted.  As a member of the House Prescription Drug Task Force, I had several core goals, tests that this bill does indeed meet. First, I wanted to make sure that seniors are not forced into a one-size-fits-all plan run by a distant, faceless, Federal bureaucracy and all that means in rules, regulations, restrictions, and red tape.  Second, I wanted my constituents to have the same type of plan of choice that the President, all of us as Members of Congress, and the rest of the Federal workforce does. I want my constituents to have the ability that I have to select from plans that are competing for premiums on the basis of how well the restraining health care costs, providing access to high quality care.  I urge all Members to support this bipartisan plan.
