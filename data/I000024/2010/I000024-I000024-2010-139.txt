President, we just heard from Senator Roberts about the medical devices. I think he pointed out very clearly that there is kind of another hidden tax in this legislation of some $20 billion on medical devices. I think it is important to listen to what Senator Roberts said, that it was not--it is not the device companies that will be paying this; it will be the individuals who would be paying it.  Now, the difference between my amendment and Senator Roberts' amendment is that mine excludes those devices for children and those with disabilities. For example, some of our troops coming home have lost limbs, and they have prosthetic devices. This is for them. This is for the 8-year-old whose heart quit beating in the middle of the night and they put a pacemaker in and it saved his life. It is for incubators and this type of thing. It is the same thing. It is the same offset as Senator Roberts and Senator Schumer had, and I would ask that you seriously consider this amendment. This is for the children and those with disabilities.
