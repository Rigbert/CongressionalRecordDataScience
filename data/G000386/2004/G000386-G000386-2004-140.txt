 President, in the 21st century, advances in medicine are allowing Americans to live longer than ever before. Today, the average American will live to be over 76 years old. As the collective age of society increases, so does the need for increased help, care, and support, as long-term illnesses and the frailties of age become the rule, not the exception. Faith in Action volunteers play a crucial role in ensuring that help is there for neighbors in need.  Faith in Action is a nationwide, interfaith coalition that works to help people with long-term health needs or disabilities maintain their independence by providing assistance with daily activities. Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Faith in Action boasts 100,000 nationwide volunteers serving over 200,000 care recipients.  Through Faith in Action, Americans of every faith--including Catholics, Protestants, Hindus, Jews and Muslims--work together to improve the lives of their neighbors in need. Faith in Action volunteers help others maintain their independence by doing simple things: watering flowers, shopping for groceries, taking people to the doctor, and simply listening. Sometimes they open doors that people can't open on their own.  In my home State of Iowa, over 2,100 dedicated volunteers work in local programs to contribute approximately 315,000 volunteer hours per year--a service valued at nearly $5.2 million.  But the value of Faith in Action is measured not by dollars and cents. Nor is the value measured by the number of volunteers, or the number of hours donated. The real value of Faith in Action is measured by the warm smiles of gratitude that line the faces of those whose lives have been enriched by the kind touch of a stranger.  Fred Jones is a man who knows firsthand the value of Faith in Action. Fred lives with his wife in the rural farmhouse where he was born, on the outskirts of Parnell, IA. Fred is, by any measure, a big man--standing 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighing over 200 pounds. Twelve years ago, Fred had a major stroke--a stroke that left half of his body paralyzed, and left Fred confined to a wheelchair in a home not built with wheelchairs in mind.  After the stroke, Fred's wife did not want to put him in a care facility and dreaded the thought of leaving the home where he was born. So at 76 years old and without any help, Mrs. Jones assumed the burden of lifting Fred up and down the 6-inch step from the front door of their home to the sidewalk below.  When Faith in Action was notified of the situation, the dedicated staff found resources to pay for the materials and a volunteer to install a wheelchair ramp for the elderly couple. Now Mrs. Jones is able to maneuver her husband in and out of their home with ease. Fred can now go to church, enjoy the sunshine, and watch his grandchildren play.  As an Iowan and a Member of Congress, I greatly appreciate the selfless acts of charity done by Faith in Action volunteers and I look forward to even greater accomplishments in the years to come.                          ____________________
