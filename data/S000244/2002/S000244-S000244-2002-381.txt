Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 169) to require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws; to require that each Federal agency post quarterly on its public Web site, certain statistical data relating to Federal sector equal employment opportunity complaints filed with such agency; and for other purposes.

Congress finds that--       (1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those      agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;       (2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals,      including representatives of the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of      Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of      discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;       (3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental      Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social      scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;       (4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health      Administration investigation found that the Environmental      Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist      for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and      for helping Congress to carry out its oversight      responsibilities;       (5) there have been several recent class action suits based      on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including      the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol,      Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration,      the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States      Marshals Service, the Department of Agriculture, the United      States Information Agency, and the Social Security      Administration;       (6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under      discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal      agency compliance with the law;       (7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and      severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought      against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve      its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; and       (8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any      discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or      settlement should improve agency accountability with respect      to discrimination and whistleblower laws.     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court      judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and      whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other      employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or      workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;       (2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment      security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower      incident should not be compromised;       (3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or      furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;       (4)(A) accountability in the enforcement of employee rights      is not furthered by terminating--       (i) the employment of other employees; or       (ii) the benefits to which those employees are entitled      through statute or contract; and       (B) this Act is not intended to authorize those actions;       (5)(A) nor is accountability furthered if Federal agencies      react to the increased accountability under this Act by      taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by      violating the procedural rights of managers who have been      accused of discrimination; and       (B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have      adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce      and in dispute resolution and other essential communication      skills; and       (6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the      General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under      this Act; and       (B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of      reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual      appropriations for that agency, may need to extend      reimbursement over several years in order to avoid--       (i) reductions in force;       (ii) furloughs;       (iii) other reductions in compensation or benefits for the      workforce of the agency; or       (iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agency.
