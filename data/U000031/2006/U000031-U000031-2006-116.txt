Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Chris Fisher and Dr. James Bashkin, cofounders of Nano Vir, a Kalamazoo, Michigan bioscience company that received the 2006 Tibbetts Award for innovative work to identify and develop a potential treatment to fight the virus that causes cervical cancer known as Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The Tibbetts Award is a prestigious national award presented annually by the Small Business Administration to small firms, organizations, and individuals judged to exemplify the very best in small business innovation research. This year, Nano Vir is among the select group of 55 firms from across the nation who will receive the award.  The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a vaccine for HPV that will prevent individuals from becoming infected with the virus. Nano Vir's product would complement the vaccine by fighting HPV infections and preventing cervical cancer for those who already have the virus.  The importance of this research cannot be overstated. Nearly 20 million Americans have incurable HPV, and cervical cancer is the second leading killer of women by cancer worldwide. Nano Vir is at the cutting edge of DNA research, and I commend Dr. Fisher, Dr. Bashkin, and all the folks at Nano Vir for their commitment and dedication to the betterment of millions of women's lives around the world. They may soon develop one of our most potent weapons yet in the war against cancer, and I wish them every success.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1872]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           TRIBUTE TO DR.
