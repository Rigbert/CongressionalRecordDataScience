Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Wayne Keith is certainly one of these individuals. On Thursday, January 15, 2015, Wayne will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Corona Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner.  Following his graduation from Iowa State College, Wayne took his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, known today as NASA. Following his time there, Wayne then took a position with the Aluminum Company of America, ALCOA, in 1945, where he would remain for forty years. After dedicating his time and efforts to offices in Cleveland, Detroit, New Kensington and Pittsburg, Wayne found his home in Corona where he acted as general manager until his retirement from the plant in 1986.  In addition to his strong work ethic, Wayne also exemplifies what it means to be a volunteer. After moving to Corona in 1969, Wayne immediately involved himself in the growing Corona community in a variety of capacities. Wayne took on many leadership positions with organizations such as the United Way, Corona Rotary Club, Good Samaritan Boys Home, First Congressional Church, Navy League, Peppermint Ridge, YMCA, The Greater Corona Chamber of Commerce, Corona Community Hospital, Norco-Corona Unified School District, California Manufacturer's Association and the Wagner Foundation. Few citizens can match the years of service Wayne has generously donated to the Corona community.  Given all of the contributions Wayne has made, he has received many prestigious honors. In 1975, Wayne was deemed Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Wayne has also been the recipient of other prominent awards such as the Corona Chamber's ``George'' Award, the Corona Community Hospital Volunteers Award, Peppermint Ridge's Golden Hinge Award and the Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award due to his outstanding leadership and significant contributions to the Corona community.  In light of all that Wayne has done for the community of Corona, it is clear he fully deserves the Corona Chamber of Commerce's Lifetime Achievement award. Wayne's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
