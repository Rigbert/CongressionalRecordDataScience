Chairman, nobody is complaining about the current system. People like the protection attendant with the current system. Inventors are not breaking our doors down and coming through the windows asking for these changes. There are a few multinational corporations that want to do a little snooping. And they are famous for buying out inventions of inventors in this country. You know how the current system works. Why would you want to advocate for them rather than the vast majority of inventors who want to have their rights protected.
