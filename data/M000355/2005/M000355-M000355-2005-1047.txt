 President, I rise today in support of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. With its passage, America will begin to declare its independence from foreign sources of energy.  A strong energy policy is crucial to America's economic security and national security. We must become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.  In 1985, 75 percent of the crude oil used in American refineries was domestically produced. Only about 25 percent came from beyond our borders. But today, those proportions have been turned upside down: Only about 35 percent of crude oil used here is produced at home, and 65 percent is imported from foreign countries.  That precarious balance leaves our Nation's energy needs, and even our Nation's economic strength, in the hands of others. America can do better. Four years of debate is enough: I urge this Senate to pass this much-needed energy bill now.  Kentucky has not escaped the ill effects of America's energy needs. Commercial natural gas prices in Kentucky rose by 53 percent from 2000 to 2004. Gasoline prices in the Commonwealth, and throughout the entire Midwest region of the United States, have risen by 86 percent since 2002.
