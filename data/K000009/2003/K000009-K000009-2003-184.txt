Speaker, I submit the following article to be included in the Record.                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2003]    What the World Hears When the President Speaks; The Wrong Words                         (By Abdel Monem Said)       Probably no area of the world had a keener interest in      President Bush's address on Tuesday night than the Middle      East. And probably nowhere will there be greater      disappointment. People in moderate Arab states will conclude      that the president is woefully misguided in his approach to      the region's troubles.       First, the American government seems to have divided the      Middle East into a set of separate problems, each in its own      little box: Iraq, Iran, the Palestinians and the Israelis,      fundamentalism, terrorism. To an Arab, these are all related      issues. The United States should concentrate on the problem      whose resolution would, ultimately, solve all the other      problems. That problem isn't Iraq. In fact, tackling Iraq      will worsen the situation in the Middle East. It is the      Palestinian question whose resolution has the best potential      for a positive impact on the region and beyond.      Unfortunately, it received only a passing reference in the      president's speech,       Second, Arabs do not agree with the rosy American view of      an invasion of Iraq. Mr. Bush seems to believe that the Iraqi      people will look at American soldiers as liberators. In three      or four weeks Saddam Hussein and his cronies will be toppled.      In a year or so, Iraq will be a shining example of a      democratic and prosperous country.       Arabs have a drastically different view. Some Iraqis will      look at Americans as new colonialists. Various Iraqi factions      and ethnic groups will take the chance to settle old scores.      Iraq will descend into chaos. Turkey and Iran will interfere.      The fragile countries of the eastern Mediterranean and the      Gulf will suffer. The Arab-Israeli conflict will become      increasingly volatile as violence and fundamentalism cross      national borders.       Third, Mr. Bush sees the war on Iraq as part of the global      war against terrorism, In the absence of clear evidence of      links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, Arabs see the Iraq      campaign as a deviation and distraction from the real fight.      Iraq, now greatly weakened, is incapable of threatening its      neighbors. Terrorism remains a greater threat. By going after      Iraq, the United States is taking the easy way out: a classic      war where it can find a capital to bomb, a regime to      overthrow and weapons to dismantle. The war on terrorism is a      completely different one, with political and socioeconomic      dimensions that call for patience and agonizing time.       The historical bond between the United States and the      moderate Arab states and mainstream Arabs in general      contributed to the stability of the Middle East. For half a      century, the bond worked well--to thwart Communist expansion      in the cold war, to contain the waves of Iranian Islamic      revolution and to end in 1991 Saddam Hussein's radical and      regional ambitions. Now, it seems for the Arabs, the major      force for instability in the region is the United States      itself, which is moving militarily to Iraq, ignoring the      Arab-Israeli peace process, giving Ariel Sharon a free hand      in Israel, and insinuating a radical program for change in      the region without building strategic understanding for it.                          ____________________
