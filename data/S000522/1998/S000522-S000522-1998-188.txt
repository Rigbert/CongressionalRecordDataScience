Yes. First of all, I want to call attention to the language, Mr. Speaker, that deals with incorporation of the U.S. Information Agency into the State Department.  Mr. Speaker, the conference committee on H.R. 1757 carefully structured the merger of the U.S. Information Agency into the State Department so as to preserve the integrity of the pro-freedom, pro-democracy public diplomacy activities now carried out by USIA. This bill should not be interpreted as an authorization for the State Department to take the money and run by converting USIA resources into a massive domestic State Department public relations operation.  Accordingly, the programs to which the Smith-Mundt and Zorinsky amendments apply must be construed broadly in accordance with the purpose of the legislation to ensure that these important protections continue to apply to the activities now conducted by USIA once they have been incorporated into the State Department.  This is a matter on which a number of House conferees on both sides of the aisle felt very strongly. We should never have agreed to incorporate USIA into the State Department except on the understanding that the integrity of all USIA functions will be preserved. ``Programs'' means not just the materials that USA produces and disseminates, but also the resources, including personnel and support services, that are necessary to conduct our public diplomacy abroad. I would ask the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) to comment on this very important provision.
