 But it is too bad that we only seem to talk about the dangers of terrorism when bad things happen in the United States or happen in Paris or someplace else that brings the issue to our attention. I think what we all need to remember is that it is a constant danger that may not appear to us daily, but somewhere out there are people thinking about killing us for what we believe.  So I rise today, again, expressing my sympathies to the people of Paris and those affected by Friday's terrible attacks by radical Islamic terrorists there. On behalf of the people of Iowa, I continue to stand with the people of France.  Unfortunately, the attacks last Friday should not have been a surprise. Radical Islamic terrorists have been waging war against the United States and our allies for years. When thinking about the last three decades of the last century, you think about the terrorism at the Munich Olympics or an American being murdered on a TWA plane. Then we had a Jewish person in a wheelchair thrown overboard in the Mediterranean. There was the attempt to bring down the Twin Towers in 1993by car bombs. Marines were murdered in Lebanon--over 200, I think it was. We had the attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, where our military people were living. We had the East African Embassy attacked, and we had the USS Cole attack.  Now, all of those happened before 9/11. Since 9/11, attacks have occurred around the world--from the train bombings in Madrid in 2004 to the suicide bombings in London in 2005 to the senseless slaughter in the streets of Mumbai in 2008. My focus today, however, will be on the United States homeland.  Terrorists have continued to try to attack us here on many occasions since 9/11. Some of these attacks have succeeded. Most of them have failed. Some of them have involved direct coordination with terrorist leaders abroad, and some have been committed by lone wolves inspired by terrorists overseas or the views of those terrorists. But these threats are ongoing, and that is what we should not fail to understand. Consequently, we must be vigilant to guard against those threats. We know that we will face them again.  Several prominent terrorist attacks in the United States come to mind. We all remember the carnage at the Boston Marathon in April 2013, where two brothers detonated bombs at the finish line that killed an 8-year-old boy and two others and injured hundreds more. Although the brothers did not appear to have direct ties with terrorist organizations, they were motivated by radical Islamic beliefs.  We also remember the November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, TX, where 13 people were killed and several dozen others were wounded. Incredibly, the Obama administration refused to categorize this as a terrorist attack, in spite of the fact that the shooter had traded emails with then senior Al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. The shooter also later identified his extremist beliefs as a basis of his attack.  But those tragedies only continued the pattern followed by radical Islamic terrorists since Al Qaeda hijacked and crashed airplanes into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon that fateful day in 2001. Soon after 9/11, for example, British citizen Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives packed in his shoe while on a flight to Miami in December 2001. He had previously trained at Al Qaeda terrorist camps in Afghanistan. Thankfully, he failed, but this attempted attack put us on notice that these terrorists were not finished with what happened on 9/11.  More attacks and plots followed, perhaps less well remembered after the passage of time. And the passage of time is our biggest enemy here, as we don't think about this often enough. But they still demonstrate the ongoing threat we face.  In July 2002, an Egyptian shot and killed two Israelis and wounded four others at the Los Angeles International Airport. Although the FBI did not find evidence linking the shooter to a terrorist group, the agency concluded the shooting was an act of terror.  In March 2006, another radical Islamic terrorist injured six people when he drove his vehicle into a group of pedestrians at the University of North Carolina. The attacker claimed to have conducted the attack in order to avenge the killing of Muslims around the world by our American Government.  Another example is the ``Fort Dix Six'' plot in May of 2007. In that case, six men planned to kill American soldiers at the military base in New Jersey but were arrested before they could do so. The men were inspired by jihadi videos.  In June 2009, a terrorist shot two recruiters at a military center in Little Rock, AR. One of the recruiters was killed, and the other was seriously wounded. The shooter told the judge in his case that he was a soldier of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Later in 2009, three radical Islamic terrorists were arrested just before they were able to conduct suicide attacks in New York City. One of these terrorists drove all the way from his home in Colorado to strike the New York City subway system with homemade explosives hidden inside a backpack. He later admitted in court that he was trained by Al Qaeda to be a part of what they call a ``martyrdom operation.'' He further confessed that Al Qaeda officials ordered these suicide attacks from Pakistan.  Also in 2009, on Christmas Day, a terrorist often referred to as the Underwear Bomber attempted to blow up a bomb concealed in his underwear while on a flight over Detroit. Several days later, Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for that effort.  In May 2010, a terrorist tried to set off a car bomb in the middle of Times Square in New York City. He was arrested while attempting to flee the country on a flight to the Middle East. The bomber was trained and financed by the Pakistani Taliban.  More recently, the threat from radical Islamic extremism has sprung from the chaos in Syria. By now we are all familiar with ISIS, or the Islamic State. Last year, we witnessed the horrors of ISIS's brutal and barbaric beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid worker Peter Kassig in Syria.  As FBI Director Comey explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year, ISIS presents a new type of Islamic extremist organization. For one thing, ISIS exploits social media to promote its terrorist agenda and encourage people within the United States to commit terrorist attacks. As Director Comey explained, ISIS's propaganda machine is like a devil on somebody's shoulder saying: ``Kill, kill, kill;'' and ``if you can't come to Syria, kill somebody where you are. Kill somebody in uniform. Kill anybody.'' Those are the words Comey used in paraphrasing the message that comes from ISIS on social media.  ISIS's deadly message of terror is having a profound effect here in our country. Over the last year, the government has stopped numerous individuals in the United States who tried to travel to Syria to fight for ISIS. According to Director Comey, over 200 Americans have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria for this purpose. I fear that such individuals who successfully return home could recreate the Paris attack here in our country, given the training, the indoctrination, and the battlefield experience they received abroad. The Washington Post reported on November 16 that 66 men and women in the United States have been charged with crimes associated with ISIS, including both attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS or planning attacks here.  Beyond ISIS's recruitment of Americans to fight in Syria, the Paris attack demonstrates the extreme dangers the group now poses here in North America. Look at what occurred just over the past year or so. In October 2014, a radical Islamic terrorist who could not obtain a passport to travel to Syria shot up the Parliament in Canada, killing a Canadian soldier on duty at the Canadian National War Memorial. The next day, a self-radicalized Muslim convert attacked four police officers on the streets of New York City with a hatchet after watching ISIS Internet propaganda.  In January of this year, the FBI arrested a person in Ohio for plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol with pipe bombs and guns. The terrorist also allegedly expressed a desire to support ISIS, and he had posted videos and messages on social media, supporting violent attacks by radical Islamic terrorists.  Later, in May of this year, two Islamic terrorists drove from Arizona to Garland, TX, to attack a conference center during an art exhibit. The center was hosting an exhibition of cartoons depicting the Islamic Prophet Mohammed. The pair shot and injured a security guard before being killed by a police officer. ISIS subsequently claimed responsibility for that attack.  In June 2015, law enforcement officers in Massachusetts shot and luckily killed a knife-wielding member of a group of ISIS supporters who were plotting attacks here in the United States, along the lines of what Director Comey has said: Just go out and ``kill, kill, kill.'' Two other alleged terrorists were arrested and are being prosecuted.  Just this month, an American was arrested in Ohio for supporting ISIS. He allegedly posted online detailed personal information, including their addresses, of 100 U.S. military members. He had then allegedly called on fellowterrorists to kill these military personnel in their homes and communities, along the lines of what the social networking message is from overseas to people in the United States, as Director Comey has reported to us: ``Kill, kill, kill.'' Just kill anyone.  More chilling than a lot of this is the video released earlier this week. On Monday, ISIS released a video warning countries against participating in air strikes in Syria. The video claimed that ISIS would attack these countries just as it attacked France last Friday. The video specifically threatened to attack this city, right here, Washington, DC.  According to the New York Times just this morning, ``at least three dozen people in the United States suspected of ties to the Islamic State were under heavy electronic or physical surveillance even before the Paris attacks.'' That ought to wake us all up to the dangerous environment that exists.  It is all too obvious that we will continue to face attacks from radical Islamic terrorists in the future. We ought to remind ourselves every day about this potential threat. So to help remind us both of that certainty and that we must be prepared for it, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record a long list of terrorist attacks in the United States that I prepared from public sources. The list may not include each and every attack by terrorists, but it does include a wide variety of attempted and planned attacks against our citizens. Because of space limitations on material submitted for the Record, a more complete and annotated list can be found on my website. That list also includes a separate list of individuals prosecuted in the United States for attempting to leave the country to fight for ISIS.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Radical Islamic Terrorist Attacks and Plots in the United States Since                                   9/11                         I. Successful Attacks       July 4, 2002: Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, a 41-year-old      Egyptian national, shot and killed two Israelis and wounded      four others at the El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles      International Airport. Although the FBI did not find evidence      linking Hadayet to a terrorist group, the agency concluded      the shooting was an act of terrorism because of Hadayet's      stated anti-Israel views and opposition to U.S. Middle East      policy.       March 5, 2006: Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar injured six people      when he drove a Sport Utility Vehicle into a group of      pedestrians at the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. Taheri-Azar      claimed to have conducted the attack in order to avenge the      killing of Muslims around the world by the U.S. government.       July 28, 2006: Naveed Afzal Haq shot and killed one woman,      and wounded five others, at the Jewish Federation building in      Seattle, Washington. During the shooting, Haq spoke with a      911 dispatcher and said ``these are Jews and I'm tired of      getting pushed around and our people getting pushed around by      the situation in the Middle East.''       June 1, 2009: Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot two military      recruiters at a Little Rock, Arkansas Army/Navy Career      Center, killing one and seriously wounding the other.      Muhammad had previously converted to Islam and spent      approximately 16 months, beginning in 2007, in Yemen.      Although no independent, public confirmation of Muhammad's      ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula exists, Muhammad      wrote to the judge in his case stating that he was ``a      soldier'' of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and undertook      his attack as revenge for U.S. killing of Muslims in Iraq and      Afghanistan.       November 5, 2009: Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army Major      serving as a psychiatrist, shot and killed 13 people and      wounded several dozen others at Fort Hood, Texas. Hasan      stated that his motive was jihad to fight ``illegal and      immoral aggression against Muslims'' in Iraq and Afghanistan.      Hasan had earlier exchanged 18 e-mails with Anwar al-Awlaki,      an important, U.S.-born leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian      Peninsula.       April 15, 2013: Tamerlan Tsarnaey and his younger brother,      Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, detonated two bombs within moments of each      other near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing      three people and injuring hundreds more. Although the      brothers were motivated by radical Islam to carry out the      attacks, they did not appear to have had any direct ties to      Islamic terrorist organizations.       October 23, 2014: Zale Thompson attacked four New York City      police officers with a hatchet, injuring two of them (one      critically) at a Queens, New York shopping district. The      police shot and killed Thompson, and a bystander was injured      in the process. Thompson appears to have been a self-     radicalized Muslim convert who had posted ``antigovernment,      anti-Western, anti-white'' messages online.       May 3, 2015: Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi began shooting      outside the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas during an      art exhibit hosted by an anti-Muslim group called the      American Freedom Defense Initiative. The center was hosting      an exhibition of cartoon adaptations depicting the Islamic      Prophet Muhammad. The pair shot and injured a security guard      before being killed by a police officer. The Islamic Sate of      Iraq and Syria subsequently claimed responsibility for the      attack, though the group did not provide evidence of how it      was involved with the shooters or in the attack.       July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez--who reportedly      had been in various locations in the Middle East for nearly      seven months last year--shot at government personnel in two      military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, first      through a drive-by shooting at a recruiting center, then by      traveling to a naval reserve center and continuing to fire.      Before being killed by police, Abdulazeez killed four      Marines, and wounded another Marine, a Navy sailor, and a      police officer. The Navy sailor died from his wounds two days      later. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of      terrorism.                   II. Unsuccessful Attacks and Plots       December 22, 2001: British citizen Richard Reid attempted      to detonate explosives packed in his shoes while on a flight      from Paris to Miami. The airplane's crew and passengers      subdued him, and the plane landed safely in Boston. Reid had      previously received training at Al-Qaeda terrorist camps in      Afghanistan.       May 8, 2002: Jose Padilla was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare      International Airport and subsequently accused of plotting to      attack the United States with a radiological weapon (a      ``dirty bomb''). He had previously spent several years in the      Middle East, and the U.S. government produced evidence at his      trial indicating he had attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in      Afghanistan.       May 1, 2003: Iyman Faris pled guilty to providing material      support to Al-Qaeda and providing information to Al-Qaeda      about potential targets in the United States--including a      bridge in New York City.       August 2004: A group of men in the United Kingdom, led by      Al-Qaeda ``member or close associate'' Dhiren Barot, were      arrested for being part of an Al-Qaeda plan to bomb the      International Monetary Fund, New York Stock Exchange,      Citigroup and Prudential buildings in the United States, as      well as targets in the United Kingdom. Barot had earlier      scouted the American targets while visiting the United States      in 2000 and 2001.       August 2004: Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay were      arrested after conducting surveillance at the Herald Square      subway station in Manhattan. The pair were planning to attack      the station with explosives in response to actions by      American military forces in Iraq.       August 31, 2005: Kevin James, Hammad Samana, Gregory      Patterson, and Levar Washington were indicted on charges to      wage war against the United States through terrorist      activities. The men planned attacks against targets including      American military and Jewish institutions, located in      Southern California.       November 24, 2006: Uzair Paracha was convicted of      conspiring to help an Al-Qaeda operative member suspected of      planning bombing attacks in Maryland to enter the United      States. Paracha was later sentenced to 30 years in prison.       June 23 2006: Seven men, known as the ``Liberty City      Seven,'' were arrested for being involved in a plot to blow      up the Sears Tower in Chicago as part of an Islamic jihad.      Attorney General Gonzales stated later that year that the      plotters had promised to fight ``a full ground war against      the United States.''       July 7 2006: Three men were arrested in Lebanon for      plotting to bomb transit tunnels underneath the Hudson River      in New York City. The men intended that the New York      financial district would then be flooded. The FBI discovered      the plot and gathered information on it through emails and      chat-room postings on web forums used to recruit Islamic      terrorists.       December 8, 2006: Derrick Shareef was charged with plotting      to detonate hand grenades at a shopping mall in Illinois      during the Christmas shopping season. Shareef was a Muslim      convert who reportedly had discussed his desire to wage jihad      against civilians and had also spoken of attacking government      facilities.       2007: Sabrihan Hasanoff and Wessam Hanafi, beginning in      2007 and at the direction of Al-Qaeda members in Yemen      performed surveillance on several potential targets,      including the New York Stock Exchange, for future terrorist      attacks in the United States. El-Hanafi forwarded the report      to Al-Qaeda.       May 2007: Six men planned to kill American soldiers at Fort      Dix, New Jersey, but were arrested before they could do so.      This plot is popularly known as the ``Fort Dix Six'' plot,      and the men appear to have been inspired by Jihadi videos       June 3, 2007: Four men were indicted for plotting to blow      up jet-fuel tanks and a fuel pipeline at John F. Kennedy      International Airport in New York City. Assistant Attorney      General Kenneth Wainstein said that the men ``sought to      combine an insider's knowledge of JFK airport with the      assistance of Islamic radicals in the Caribbean to produce''      a ``devastating attack.''       January 28, 2009: Bryant Neal Vinas pleaded guilty to      joining Al-Qaeda and developing a plan with Al-Qaeda      leadership to conduct an attack on the Long Island Railroad      in New York.       February 26, 2009: Christopher Paul, also known as Abdul      Malek, was sentenced for conspiring to use weapons of mass      destruction against targets in Europe and the United States.      Paul, who had received terrorist training at overseas      terrorist camps in Afghanistan, and had subsequently      joined Al-Qaeda, had worked with an Islamic terror cell in      Europe to prepare to attack targets in the United States.       May 20, 2009: Four men were arrested for plotting to bomb      Jewish synagogues in New York City after they had planted      what they thought were bombs near two synagogues. The men      also allegedly planned to shoot down U.S. military planes      operating out of Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh,      New York. The men were apparently angry over the U.S.-led war      in Afghanistan, and one told an FBI informant that he'd be      interested in joining a Pakistan-based terrorist group ``to      do jihad.''       September 2009: Daniel Patrick Boyd and Hysen Sherifi were      charged with plotting to kill U.S. military personnel at the      Quantico marine base in Virginia. They had undertaken      reconnaissance of the base and had practiced attacking the      base in July. Boyd, along with several other suspects, had      earlier been charged with international terrorism charges in      August, but those charges did not concern attacks in the      United States. Prosecutors played a tape during Boyd's      detention hearing where he decried the U.S. military, decried      the struggle of Muslims, and mentioned the honor of      martyrdom.       September 2009: Najibullah Zazi, and later Adis Medunjanin      and Zarein Ahmedzay, were arrested for planning to conduct      suicide attacks with homemade explosives in the New York City      subway system. All three had received weapons training from      Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and Zazi admitted in court that he      was trained by Al-Qaeda to be part of a ``martyrdom      operation.'' Evidence indicates that senior Al-Qaeda      officials ordered the attacks. According to the indictment      against Medunjanin, before being arrested for the planned      subway attacks, on January 7, 2010, Medunjanin attempted to      conduct an attack in New York City by intentionally crashing      his car on the Whitestone Expressway.       September 24, 2009: Michael Finton, also known as Talib      Islam, was arrested and charged for attempting to kill      federal employees by detonating a car bomb at the federal      building in Springfield, Illinois. He was arrested after he      attempted to detonate what he thought was the bomb, but which      was in fact a fake bomb. Finton reportedly idolized (and had      written to) American-born Taliban member John Walker Lindh.       September 24, 2009: Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, an illegal      immigrant from Jordan, was arrested for placing, with the      intent to detonate, what he thought was a car bomb outside of      the 60-story Fountain Place office tower in Dallas, Texas.      FBI undercover agents met with Smadi over several months      while posing as members of an Al-Qaeda sleeper cell.      According to the FBI, Smadi ``stood out based on his vehement      intention to actually conduct terror attacks in the United      States.''       December 14, 2009: Ehsanul Islam Sadequee and Syed Haris      Ahmed were sentenced for their earlier terrorism convictions      in support of terrorism. Among other activities, Sadequee and      Ahmed had driven to and taken videos--for use by ``the jihadi      brothers abroad'' with whom the pair were connected via the      internet--of targets in Washington, DC., including the U.S.      Capitol, the World Bank, the Masonic Temple, and a fuel tank      farm.       December 25, 2009: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian      citizen, attempted to blow up the commercial airliner he was      flying on over Detroit by igniting high explosives concealed      in his underpants. Several days later, Al-Qaeda's affiliate      in Yemen and Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for the      attempted attack. Abdulmutallab later plead to the charges      against him and read a statement in court saying ``I      attempted to use an explosive device which in the U.S. law is      a weapon of mass destruction, which I call a blessed weapon      to save the lives of innocent Muslims, for U.S. use of      weapons of mass destruction on Muslim populations in      Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and beyond.''       May 1, 2010: Faisal Shahzad attempted, but failed, to      detonate a car bomb in Times Square in New York City.      Evidence indicated that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the      attempted attack, and that Shahzad was in contact with the      group via the internet while living in the United States.      Shahzad was attempting to flee the country through a flight      to the Middle East when arrested.       May 2010: Paul and Nadia Rockwood, from King Salmon,      Alaska, were arrested for lying to the FBI about having      compiled a list of 20 domestic terrorism targets, including      members of the U.S. military, the media, and two religious      organizations. The couple had also begun to acquire      components for mail bombs. Rockwood, who had earlier      converted to Islam and was studying the writings of Anwar al-     Awlaki, sought to ``exact revenge by death on anyone who      desecrated Islam.''       October 20, 2010: Zachary Adam Chesser, a supporter of      designated foreign terrorist organization Al-Shabaab, pleaded      guilty to charges that included soliciting other jihadists      online to murder U.S. citizens in the United States. Among      other things, he pleaded guilty to taking specific, repeated      steps to encourage jihadists to attack the writers of an      American television show for the way the show had depicted      Muhammad.       October 27, 2010: Farooque Ahmed, a naturalized U.S.      citizen, was arrested for plotting to bomb multiple      Washington, D.C. metro stations Ahmed believed he was      conspiring with Al-Qaeda operatives in plotting the attacks.       November 26, 2010: Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-     American, attempted to wage jihad by trying to ignite what he      thought was a real bomb, but which was a fake bomb supplied      by an undercover officer, at a Christmas tree lighting      ceremony in Portland, Oregon. Among other statements Mohamud      made regarding the attacks, he said ``I want whoever is      attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or      injured.''       December 8, 2010: Antonio Martinez, also known as Muhammad      Hussain, was arrested after a sting operation for plotting to      blow up the Armed Forces Career Center in Catonsville,      Maryland. Martinez, a Muslim convert, was motivated to plot      the attack because he was upset that the U.S. and other      militaries were fighting Muslims.       February 24, 2011: Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, a Saudi Arabian      student in the United States, was arrested for planning and      having begun to build bombs for use in various terrorist      attacks in America. Targets of the attacks included former      President George W. Bush's home, hydroelectric dams, nuclear      power plants, nightclubs, and the homes of American soldiers      who had been stationed in Iraq at the Abu Ghraib prison.      Aldawsari described in his journal, as well as on blog      postings, his desire for violent jihad.       May 11, 2011: Ahmed Ferhani, a native of Algeria, and      Mohamed Mamdouh were arrested for plotting to attack Jewish      synagogues in New York City. The pair were arrested after      purchasing several handguns and one grenade. The two were      said to be ``committed to violent jihad.''       June 23, 2011: Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and Walli Mujahidh      were arrested after purchasing machine guns and grenades for      the purpose of conducting a suicide attack against a federal      building housing the Military Entrance Processing Station in      Seattle. The pair's motive was to conduct physical jihad in      the United States, as they were upset about U.S. military      activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen.       July 27, 2011: Naser Jason Abdo, a U.S. Army Private who      had been Absent Without Leave (AWOL), was arrested in a plot      against Fort Hood, Texas. He was found with jihaclist      materials, weapons, explosives instructions, and materials.      The explosives instructions were from an Al-Qaeda explosives      course manual.       September 28, 2011: Rezwan Ferdaus was arrested, following      an FBI undercover operation, and charged for plotting to use      a remote-controlled aircraft filled with explosives to attack      the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon. Ferdaus planned to commit      violent jihad with the materials, and hoped to cause a      ``psychological impact'' by killing Americans--who he      referred to as ``enemies of Allah.''       November 20, 2011: Jose Pimentel was arrested for building      and plotting to detonate pipe bombs in and around New York      City. Pimentel's intended targets included U.S. military      personnel who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. postal      facilities, and police. Pimentel was described as an ``Al-     Qaeda sympathizer,'' though he is believed to have worked on      his plot alone.
