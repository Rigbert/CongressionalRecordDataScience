President, I am glad the Senator asked that question because that is exactly the point of what I am saying. It is because of your language in the amendment that states, ``Unless authorized or provided by law,'' bilingual printing cannot be done, and it would be illegal.  We have done some quick research but there is no statute we have found which says that when Members give speeches on the floor in foreign languages, the government shall print that speech in the foreign language in the Congressional Record. It isn't there. There is no authorization in law for the printing of your remarks in Spanish. And you tell us in the language of your amendment that if not authorized by law, it cannot be done; it is illegal.  The point I am making is that the Senator started with a very positive and important premise, that English is our common and unifying language and that it should be preserved and enhanced by our Government. But the amendment then went too far. I think I know why. I believe what he is really aiming for is an Executive Order by President Clinton. Some on his side want to get rid of that. They don't like that Executive Order because that Executive Order, which is now being followed by our Government as law, says that when it comes to basic Federal services, we will help people who have limited proficiency in English understand their rights and understand their responsibilities. I think that is reasonable. I believe perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma sees it the other way.  I see my leader is here on the floor.
