 After my remarks, the Senator from North Dakota made a couple of comments. Let me respond to him. First of all, he said we do not have any cruise missile defense in this bill. That is a greater threat. Let me suggest to you if you read page 119, we have $140 million in here for cruise missile defense. And I hope that no one believes that we think that the missile threat is the only threat to America. There are many other threats that are being addressed.  Now, the other thing is that the two Senators from Wisconsin and North Dakota know very well that the defense budget is not causing the deficit. We always hear about from the big spenders over there, ``Well, we've got to do something about defense.'' The last 11 years our defense budget has declined. And for that period of time for every $1 of defense cuts, we have had $2 of increase in domestic spending. To be specific, in using 1995 dollars, in fiscal year 1985 the defense budget was $402 billion. Today we are considering one that is $265 billion.  Thank you, Mr. President.
