Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I am a little bit puzzled, listening to my friend from New York. At 151 Congressional Record, page H1599, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) said, ``If a person thinks a court in a State is depriving someone of civil rights, they can go into Federal Court.'' And at volume 150 Congressional Record at page H6580, the gentleman from New York noted that without Federal courts, ``Obviously, the progress we have witnessed in the area of civil rights would have been, at the very least, stymied, and most likely prevented altogether.''  Now, all this bill does is to allow the parents of Terri Schiavo to go into Federal Court to adjudicate her Federal constitutional and legal rights. No more, no less.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Schwarz).
