Chairman, I shall not use the entire time.  Every year since 1987, the VA medical and prosthetics research appropriation has been supplemented by funds transferred to the VA under a cooperative agreement between the DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The DOD-VA cooperative medical research program supports vital research covering a broad spectrum of health,science, and medical research focusing on conditions that impact both active duty and veterans. Among the programs funded are posttraumatic stress disorder research, cardiovascular fitness, combat casualty care, bone healing replacement, skin repair, vascular repair, spinal cord injury. This is an excellent program. I know times are tough, but I believe that we should be able to find the funds within the budget to fund this program at the modest level of $15 million.
