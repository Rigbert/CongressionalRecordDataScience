 President, few would disagree that America's top foreign policy today is to search out and destroy terrorist networks and prevent further incidents from occurring. Secretary Powell and the entire administration obviously have all of our support in this endeavor.  Perhaps more than any other democracy, Israel knows well the horror of terrorism. The extremists who hijacked American commercial aircraft and used them as missiles against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11 are cut from the very same cloth as the suicide terrorists who slaughter innocent women, children, and men in the Israeli pizza parlors, discos, and buses. The loss of life is no less tragic, nor the fear any less real, in incidents that occur in the streets of Manhattan or Jerusalem. Like America, Israel serves as proof that nations founded in freedom and democracy do not crumble when attacked by extremists. In fact, the opposite is true. America and Israel have become more united as individual nations and as allies against a common enemy.  The events of September 11 have been seared into America's national conscience, just as horrific attacks against civilians in Israel are felt in the hearts and minds of all of its citizens. While terrorism is a grave threat that both nations face, I ask each of my colleagues to consider the following:  The terrorists who carried out the September 11 attacks traveled thousands of miles to our shores to commit their evil deeds. In Israel, terrorists live within an easy bus ride to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other major urban areas. Where satellites beamed pictures of Palestinian celebrations for the mass murder of Americans into our homes and offices, Israel declared a day of mourning. Israelis need only open their front door to encounter openly offensive, aggressive, and hostile behavior; and Israel has demonstrated restraint in its response to recent attacks against its citizens.  When 20 Israeli kids were killed by a suicide bomber earlier this summer in a Tel Aviv disco, there was no massive Israeli retaliation. When Israelis were killed in a Jerusalem pizza parlor, again, there was no massive response. I think we can all now better understand the incredible restraint Israel has shown in the face of such attacks.  Criticisms over the use of excessive force by Israeli soldiers in targeting and destroying Arab terrorists on the West Bank and in Gaza are simply misguided. America is doing similar targeting of terrorist cells but on a global scale. Israel's elected leadership, as ours, has a duty and responsibility to protect its citizens against foreign and domestic threats.  Let me close with some candid comments. First, I do not believe the administration can make the determination that the PLO or the Palestinian Authority have lived up to their 1993 commitments to renounce terrorism. The proof is admitted into hospitals and morgues or buried in cemeteries every single day.  In attempting to resuscitate the peace process, America must be careful that it plays no role in recognizing or establishing a Palestinian state that is rooted in terrorism.  Second, I do not believe for one second PLO Chairman Arafat wants to end the violence. He allows terrorists to exist on the West Bank and in Gaza and spurs them into action through newspapers, textbooks, evening prayers, and even children's television programs.  Finally, America cannot win the war against terrorism without Israel. Israel has the experience, dedication, and freedom that is absolutely necessary to prevail over these fanatics. We must stand arm in arm with our ally. We must help Israel in its battle against terrorism.  Senator Feinstein and I are not going to offer the amendment we planned to offer because of the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves and as a result of the direct request of the Secretary of State. Having said that, I do not believe the Palestinian Authority has been constructive, nor do I believe they have lived up to their agreements signed back in 1993.  Shifting for a moment to another ally, if you will, of the United States--if you can call the Palestinian Authority an ally these days--I want to talk for a few moments about Egypt. I had intended to offer an amendment restricting assistance to Egypt but have been requested by the Secretary of State and the administration to withhold such action, again in light of the events of September 11 and our current efforts to respond to those events.  While I continue to have serious concerns with many of Egypt's words and deeds toward the Middle East peace process and Israel, and the troubling state of democracy and rule of law in that country, I am going to honor the administration's request. It is not my intention to impede in any way ongoing efforts to identify, track down, and punish those individuals and groups responsible for the slaughter of American civilians and soldiers.  While America finds itself at a critical moment in history, so does Egypt. A major recipient of United States assistance to the tune of nearly $2 billion, stretching back to 1979, Egypt must today unequivocally prove it is a full partner in our war against terrorism. It is not acceptable for President Mubarak and his Foreign Minister to obfuscate the assault against freedom with their not-so-hidden agenda to propagate Arab hatred against Israel and to muzzle democracy and civil society in Egypt.  An October 11 editorial in the Washington Post boldly stated what has been whispered in the Halls of Congress and in the corridors of the State Department. Here is what the editorial said:       The largest single ``cause'' of Islamic extremism and      terrorism is not Israel, nor U.S. policy in Iraq, but the      very governments that now purport to support the United      States while counseling it to lean on Ariel Sharon and lay      off Saddam Hussein.       Egypt is a leading example. It is an autocratic regime. It      is politically exhausted and morally bankrupt. President      Mubarak, who checked Islamic extremists in Egypt only by      torture and massacre, has no modern program or vision of      progress to offer his people as an alternative to Osama bin      Laden's Muslim victimology. . . . It also explains why so      many of [bin Laden's] recruits are Egyptian.  Let me be clear that during these dark and troubling times, Egypt should prove to the people of the United States and all the world's democracies, including Israel, it is indeed an ally in the fight against terrorism. The $2 billion question is whether they will succeed or fail in this task.  Secretary Powell knows that at a more appropriate time I may revisit this important issue. In the meantime, I urge the Egyptian Government to advise its ministers and media to be moreresponsible and constructive and to aggressively encourage its citizenry to understand the grave dangers of legitimizing terrorism under the guise of Islamic teachings and practices.  The Egyptian people should understand Americans were horrified and angered at news reports of celebrations of the September 11 attacks in the streets of Cairo and elsewhere. Sadly, this may be an indication the Egyptians do not share the same principles of freedom and tolerance we do. If Egypt wants to continue to have United States support, Egypt ought to earn it.  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            The Arab Paradox                       Thursday, October 11, 2001       ARAB NATIONS, including those considered allies of the      United States, have been struggling with their response to      the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan. If their      contortions were not so familiar they would be hard to      understand: After all, Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda      organization are sworn enemies of the Egyptian and Saudi      governments, which in turn depend on the United States for      their security. But it took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak      three days to choke out a statement supporting ``measures      taken by the United States to resist terrorism''; and even      then he coupled it with a parallel demand that Washington      ``take measures to resolve the Palestinian problem.''      Meanwhile, Mr. Mubarak's longtime foreign minister, Amr      Moussa, now the secretary general of the Arab League,      prompted first Arab states and then the 56-nation Islamic      Conference to adopt a resolution yesterday opposing U.S.      attacks on any Arab country as part of the anti-terrorism      campaign--a position that offers cover to Iraq's Saddam      Hussein.       In effect, Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Moussa are backing both the      military action of the U.S. alliance and the political      position of Osama bin Laden, who on Sunday claimed that      unjust American policies in Israel and Iraq justified his      acts of mass murder. The world, Mr. Moussa said, needs to      address the ``causes'' of the terrorism, and he suggested      that a United Nations conference might be the best forum.      There's little doubt what he has in mind: After all, Mr.      Moussa only a couple of months ago led the attempt to hijack      the U.N. conference on racism and revive the libel that      ``Zionism is racism.''       Behind this contradictory rhetoric lies one of the central      problems for U.S. policy in the post-Sept. 11 world: The      largest single ``cause'' of Islamic extremism and terrorism      is not Israel, nor U.S. policy in Iraq, but the very      governments that now purport to support the United States      while counseling it to lean on Ariel Sharon and lay off      Saddam Hussein. Egypt is the leading example. Its autocratic      regime, established a half-century ago under the banner of      Arab nationalism and socialism, is politically exhausted and      morally bankrupt. Mr. Mubarak, who checked Islamic extremists      in Egypt only by torture and massacre, has no modern      political program or vision of progress to offer his people      as an alternative to Osama bin Laden's Muslim victimology.      Those Egyptians who have tried to promote such a program,      such as the democratic activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, are      unjustly imprisoned. Instead, Mr. Mubarak props himself up      with $2 billion a year in U.S. aid, while allowing and even      encouraging state-controlled clerics and media to promote the      anti-Western, anti-modern and anti-Jewish propaganda of the      Islamic extremists. The policy serves his purpose by      deflecting popular frustration with the lack of political      freedom or economic development in Egypt. It also explains      why so many of Osama bin Laden's recruits are Egyptian.       For years U.S. and other Western governments have been      understanding of Mr. Mubarak and other ``moderate'' Arab      leaders. They have to be cautious in helping the United      States, it is said, because of the pressures of public      opinion--the opinion, that is, that their own policies have      been decisive in creating. Though the reasoning is circular,      the conclusion has been convenient in sustaining      relationships that served U.S. interests, especially during      the Cold War. But the Middle East is a region where the      already overused notion that Sept. 11 ``changed everything''      may just turn out to be true. If the United States succeeds      in making support or opposition to terrorism and Islamic      extremism the defining test of international politics, as      President Bush has repeatedly promised, then the straddle      that the ``moderate'' Arabs have practiced for so long could      soon become untenable. Much as it has valued its ties with      leaders such as Mr. Mubarak, the Bush administration needs to      begin preparing for the possibility that, unless they can      embrace new policies that offer greater liberty and hope,      they will not survive this war.                               Exhibit 1                                       the Secretary of State,                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator McConnell: The President and I are working      intensively to build an international anti-terrorism      coalition to track down the perpetrators of the September 11      attacks and put an end to their terror networks. The      engagement of the broadest possible coalition, including key      Arab and Muslim countries, will be critical to the success of      our efforts. At the same time, we cannot shrink from our      long-standing role in supporting peace efforts between Israel      and its neighbors, and will not stop working with the      Israelis and Palestinians to end the violence there,      implement the Mitchell Committee recommendations, and return      to productive negotiations. I need your help on this.       The Palestinian compliance legislation you introduced with      Senator Feinstein--and which may become an amendment to the      Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill--would be      counterproductive to our coalition-building and peace process      efforts and we would like to see it withdrawn.       Imposing sanctions, or even waiving sanctions following a      mandatory determination that would have triggered sanctions,      would undermine our ability to play a role in defusing the      crisis and returning the parties to negotiations. Both sides      have undertaken specific commitments to each other. We remain      engaged with the Palestinians to ensure that the PLO and PA      understand exactly what they have to do to meet their      commitments. But requiring the President to make formal      determinations of the compliance of only one of the parties      would undermine our efforts to put an end to the violence and      facilitate a resumption of peace efforts. At the same time,      it would bolster segments of Arab public opinion that are      already very critical of their regimes' relations with the      U.S. and Israel, and their support for Middle East peace. In      this regard I also urge you to avoid any actions or      statements that single out key Arab allies such as Egypt and      Jordan.       The bottom line is that we agree with the need for the      Palestinians to comply with their commitments and control the      violence and to move toward implementation of the Mitchell      Committee recommendations. But in this critical period, I      urge you not to tie the President's hands and restrict our      ability to engage with both parties to help achieve these      goals.           Sincerely,                                                  Colin L. Powell.  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
