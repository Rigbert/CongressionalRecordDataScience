It has been a great honor to be able to work with the Senator on the issue of improving the safety of imported fruit and vegetables and all imported food.  As we have learned from the two hearings that we held to date, this is a very complex issue that does not lend itself to a simple solution. It is my hope that continuing to work with the Senator from Mississippi, we will be able to complete our investigation this fall and develop a series of recommendations that will get to the heart of the problem and help to continue to ensure that our food safety is the best in the world.  I thank the chairman for his cooperation and participation in this conversation, and I yield the floor.
