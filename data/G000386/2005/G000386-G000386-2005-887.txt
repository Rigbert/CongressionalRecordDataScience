 President, it has come to my attention that S. 306 includes a provision to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act. As chairman of the committee, I am obligated to point out that the Finance Committee has primary jurisdiction over title XVIII, as amended. The provision in S. 306 that is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee amends title XVIII relating to Medicare supplemental policies. I ask Chairman Enzi to acknowledge that the Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over title XVIII of the Social Security Act and ask that he endeavor to consult on matters before the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee that touch on the Senate Finance Committee's jurisdiction.  In order to avoid unnecessary confusion as to the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee or further delay in the consideration of this bill, I would agree to accommodate your request to withhold any objection to the Senate's consideration of S. 306 with the acknowledgment that this provision and title XVIII generally are in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. This does not represent any waiver of jurisdiction on the part of the Finance Committee on this subject.   I ask the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, whether he would agree to this request.
