Chairman, I rise in opposition. The subcommitteehas always done everything we can to take care of our special operators, and that is reflected in the mark.  I do believe the gentleman's amendment is philosophically inconsistent with the underlying bill. I cannot justify devoting significant resources to SOCOM's $1 billion proposal to establish their own separate contractor-staffed facilities, when our services are undergoing tremendous downsizing pressures. It runs contrary to what we are trying to do in the bill.
