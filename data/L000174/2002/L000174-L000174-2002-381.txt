In addition to the many important features of the bill highlighted in their remarks, I would like to add that this legislation also takes major steps to simplify the program. Households would be permitted to report on changes in their circumstances by filling out a simple form every six months rather than having to take time off from work to visit the food stamp office, as often happens today. The cumbersome recertification process would be replaced by the same kind of redetermination process long used in the SSI and Medicaid programs. The crucial excess shelter deduction would be retained. This is essential to protect families in cold weather states like Vermont from facing the cruel choicebetween heating and eating. Nonetheless, legislation would greatly simplify the calculation of households' utility costs. States would be given the option to conform their definitions of income and resources in the food stamp program to those they use in other programs. This should allow states to eliminate unnecessary questions from their application forms. In simplifying the program, this legislation strives to protect families in need from experiencing hardship. Simplification should be a means of helping the program serve families better, not an end unto itself. I believe the simplification provisions in this legislation meet that test. As a result, this legislation makes important progress toward simplifying the program in ways that the benefit of State administrators and needy families alike.
