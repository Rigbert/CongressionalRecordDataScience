 Appointed in 2008 by former Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, Kathy was sought after by the Library for her extensive experience interfacing with Congress from both the public and private sectors. As the director of the Library's Congressional Relations Office, she spent more than a decade of her career building strong bipartisan relationships between the Library, Congress, and congressional staff.  Kathy has had the privilege of serving two Librarians of Congress, Dr. James Billington and Dr. Carla D. Hayden. Kathy was instrumental in supporting Dr. Hayden's confirmation process. With the help of Kathy's tireless effort throughout the nomination process, Dr. Hayden was overwhelmingly confirmed in a bipartisan fashion by the Senate during the 114th Congress.  In her time at the Library, Kathy has shaped the Library's relationship with Congress through 3 Presidential administrations, 6 Congresses, and 11 budget and appropriations cycles, building bipartisan support for Library of Congress initiatives along the way. Additionally, she worked with 10 different chairs of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee and House Administration Committee. As a member of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, I always appreciated Kathy's thorough and dutiful commitment to her role, the Library, and Congress.  During her tenure, Kathy has welcomed nearly 500 new Members of Congress during their freshman orientation activities hosted at the Library. She also created the bipartisan Library of Congress Caucus in the 111th Congress, which currently has 84 Representatives. Moreover, she helped to coordinate the congressional participation in the award of the Library's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song to the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Smokey Robinson, as well as other noteworthy musical artists.  In her position, Kathy also played an integral role in the launch of the Library's popular Congressional Dialogue Dinner Series in 2013, which has just concluded its 45th dinner. Marcelle and I have had the pleasure of enjoying many wonderful nights at the Library attending these delightful dinners and discussions.  Marcelle and I have had so many wonderful experiences with Kathy. I have to mention one especially. When Pope Francis came to speak to a joint meeting of Congress, Kathy had arranged to have a special Bible from the Library's collection available to be blessed by the Pope. She knew the Pope would bless it, so she arranged to have with it several religious medals and other things important to her and her family available to be a part of the blessing. I know the Pope didn't mind, and those of us there thought, ``This is why we think the world of her.''  Kathy has always been known as a reliable and trusted source for Library of Congress information. She will be greatly missed by Members of Congress and congressional staff alike. Marcelle and I wish Kathy the best in retirement.                          ____________________
