 James Whitemore, a retired surgeon from Carson, CA. When his son Quentin entered Cal-State Dominguez Hill, Dr. Whitemore cosigned his son's application for credit with the stipulation that the debt limit remain at $500. But without Dr. Whitemore's knowledge, MBNA, the credit card issuer, raised his son's credit limit repeatedly until it finally reached $9,000. After several years, Quentin's balance reached $9,089 and MBNA determined his account to be delinquent.  MBNA, then rediscovered Dr. Whitemore. After failing to contact the doctor as it increased his son's liability, the company then demanded that Dr. Whitemore assume responsibility for the debt as guarantor. I think this is wrong. This amendment would correct that.  I also want to respond to those who question the link between credit card debt and bankruptcy. All-purpose credit card debt is the most frequently listed debt in bankruptcy files. Eighty-eight percent of the debtors in bankruptcy have credit card debt of some kind.  According to a study by Harvard Professor Elizabeth Warren, the median debtors in bankruptcy are carrying six times higher credit card debts than other cardholders.  Homeowners in the United States spend, on average, about $18 of every $100 of take-home pay for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance on their mortgage payments. A family spending more than $28 is considered house poor. Median debtors in bankruptcy owe $47 of each $100 of income to their credit card.  Experts who testified before Congress on this issue have linked the share rise in consumer debt and the corresponding rise in consumer bankruptcy to lower credit standards.  As I have said, today, a seven times greater percentage of youth go through bankruptcy than did 5 years ago. So this is clearly a problem that is increasing.  I don't believe minors should have their credit histories ruined when they take their first steps as adults; nor should we put parents in the position of having to bail out their kids to protect their kids' future credit rating. A credit card limit, per card, of $2,500, I believe, is prudent and wise. If a youngster wants to go beyond that, they have to show that they can pay it back or, secondly, have a parent or guardian cosign.  I am very pleased to join with Senator Jeffords and Senator Durbin in presenting this amendment.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 17, 1999]                   Son's Debt Plagues Dad for 7 Years                           (By Kenneth Reich)       Guaranteeing a credit card for a child about to go off to      college is fairly common, but it seldom generates as much      trouble as it did for Dr. James H. Whitmore, a retired      surgeon from Carson.       He has been through a seven-year drama that is not over      yet.       When his son, Quentin Whitmore, entered Cal State Dominguez      Hills in 1992, he wanted him to have a credit card. This is      natural, since even if, as in this case, the child is going      to be close to home, the parent knows he will be more on his      own and may need emergency financial resources.       And so, after some exploring, Whitmore agreed to co-sign      his son's application with MBNA of Wilmington, Del. ``This I      did with the stipulation that his credit limit be $500,'' he      recalls.       At first, all went well. Quentin Whitmore was making small      payments on the card out of the allowances his dad gave him.       But then, without ever notifying his dad, MBNA, which      describes itself as ``the largest independent credit card      lender in the world with $59.6 billion in loans,'' repeatedly      raised young Whitmore's credit limit. It finally hit $9,000.       By the end of 1996, the balance on the card, including late      charges, reached $9,089, and MBNA declared the account      delinquent. It informed Whitmore Sr. that he owed that amount      as guarantor.
