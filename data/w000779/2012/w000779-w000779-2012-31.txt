President, at the end of this year the smallest county in Oregon is going to lose its biggest asset. Wheeler County Judge Jeanne Burch is retiring only because of Oregon law, which requires judges to retire at a certain age. In this case, the law is depriving my State of an exemplary public servant.  When she was appointed county judge in 1994, Wheeler County was close to bankruptcy. Since then, thanks to herleadership and perseverance, the county has been pulled back from the brink of insolvency. The county has also renovated its beautiful and historic courthouse and built a new family services center.  Judge Burch helped bring cell phone service to this remote area of Oregon. She serves on the Frontier TeleCom Network, which provides emergency communications for many counties in Central Oregon, and the Telecommunications Committee for Association of Oregon Counties. Earlier this year, she was appointed to the Oregon Commission for Women, and is now its vice chair. She is the only member of the commission from east of the Cascade Mountains.  Concerned about the growing epidemic of obesity, Judge Burch joined in an effort to make Fossil ``The Biggest Loser.'' Patterned after a popular television show, 20 percent of Fossil's 450 residents collectively lost 600 pounds to a successful effort to become healthier, eat better, and be more active.  On a personal note, Jeanne Burch has become a valued friend.  When I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996, I promised the people of Oregon that I would hold a town meeting in each of the State's 36 counties every year. On a wintery day in February 1996 I began fulfilling that promise by holding my first town hall in Wheeler County. From that cold day 16 years ago when I arrived in Fossil until now, Jeanne Burch and the people of her county have always given me a warm welcome.  For several years after that, I made it a practice to hold my first town meeting of each year in Wheeler County. A few years ago when snow storms made getting to Fossil impossible, Judge Burch and the other members of Wheeler County Court gave me a special dispensation by passing a resolution releasing me from my commitment to hold the year's first town meeting in Wheeler County.  When I held my 500th town hall in 2009 it was in Wheeler County and Judge Burch made sure that most of the town turned out. She did the same thing last year for my 600th town hall on a warm summer night on the front lawn of the courthouse she helped restore.  For 18 years, Judge Jeanne Burch has been the steady hand of county government, a good friend, a wise steward, and the gold standard for what a good elected official ought to be. We will miss her as a county judge, but I know that when I return to Wheeler County next year for another town hall, she will be there for me as she always has been.                          ____________________
