 President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it is a little bit difficult to ascertain exactly when, but we hope the Energy bill might be ready by Wednesday. We are going to work as hard as we can to get those measures ready for consideration in the Senate certainly this week. Hopefully, we can get to Energy by Wednesday.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Nevada.
