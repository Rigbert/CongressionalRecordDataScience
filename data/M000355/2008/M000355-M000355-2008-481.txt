 REID. The Senate Finance package that is now before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that we add to that widows of the veterans.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is what has been going on all week: adjustments to the package in order to play political games.  Now, with all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, we are going to have an opportunity to fix this problem on the widows of veterans at a later date.  We do not have to fix it on this first vote. How many different times do they want to change it? They originally told us they were going to give us the paper last Thursday night. It kept evolving and evolving and evolving. We will have a chance to fix this problem.  The first opportunity would be the amendment that Senator Stevens and I intend to offer. Therefore, I object.
