 HATCH. That is absolutely right. But even Roberts had to go through a lot of pain to get there--12 years waiting, nominated three times by two different Presidents.  We put him out of the committee after a 12-hour hearing. You hardly have that much for Supreme Court nominees. There were two others on that list. They complained because there were three on one day's hearing. They ignored the fact that Ted Kennedy, when he was chairman, had seven circuit nominees one day, and another four. We had at least 10 other times when we had three.  Then once we put him out of the committee, I had to bring him back in the committee so they could have another crack at him. They could not touch him. He was that good. So he had to go through an inordinate process to get there. But they knew they did not have anything on him. They know they didn't have anything on Miguel Estrada.  Mr. McCONNELL. It sounds to this Senator, I wonder if the chairman concurs, that there was a sort of rule created and applied to Miguel Estrada----
