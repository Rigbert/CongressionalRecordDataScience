 President, I rise today to protect and secure the user fees paid by America's inventors and businesses to the Patent and Trademark Office, and to stabilize that Office's funding, by introducing the Patent Fee Integrity Act. I want to thank my co-sponsors on this bill, Senators Coburn, Klobuchar, and Flake.  Throughout most of its history, taxpayers supported the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, through appropriations from general funds. However, in 1990, Congress established a 69 percent user fee ``surcharge,'' so that the PTO became funded entirely through fees paid by its users, the American inventors who make our country the world's technological leader.  Unfortunately, almost immediately, Congress began using the funds that inventors paid to protect their inventions for other purposes. In 1992, $8.1million in user fees were diverted. In 1993, $12.3 million was diverted. In 1994, $14.7 million. So it continued, growing each year, until what started as a trickle became a flood in 1998, with $199 million in PTO user fees diverted.  PTO user fees continued to be diverted in most of the following years, at varying levels. In fiscal year 2011, as Congress was finishing its work on major patent reform, a new fee diversion record was set, a staggering $209 million in user fees diverted from the PTO that year.  Meanwhile, at the same time that these fees were being taken away, the length of time that it took to get a patent out of the Patent Office steadily increased. In fiscal year 1991, average patent pendency was 18.2 months. By fiscal year 1999, it had increased to 25 months. By fiscal year 2010, average patent pendency had increased all the way to 35.3 months.  These are not just numbers. This is innovation being stifled from being brought to market. The longer it takes to get a patent approved, the longer a new invention, a potential technological breakthrough, sits on the shelf, gathering dust instead of spurring job growth and scientific and economic progress.  Ultimately, this dulls our country's competitive edge in the global economy. America's record of innovation is the envy of the world; it has provided us a marked competitive edge over the decades and even centuries. When we stifle the progress of our innovation within the PTO, we lose some of this competitive advantage, and the jobs and other economic benefits that accompany it.  Obviously, there is a direct relationship between fee diversion and patent pendency. The more fees that are diverted away from the PTO, the fewer patent examiners they can hire, the more patents each examiner has to process, and the longer it takes them to get to any individual patent--a longer patent pendency.  But it is not just the time that it takes to get a patent that is hurt by diversion of resources. The quality of the patents issued is harmed as well.  As members of this body know, the Senate Judiciary Committee is actively considering legislation to address abuses of the patent system, and the House of Representatives passed its own legislation on the subject by a strong bipartisan vote of 325-91.  A variety of businesses all over the country are being sued and subjected to letters demanding payment, often based on very questionable patents that should never have been issued by the Patent Office in the first place.  Businesses and lawyers have asserted patents for, by way of example: Scanning and e-mailing a document; completing a purchase on a website with one click, as opposed to multiple clicks; and e-mailing a press release, something that I think it's safe to say that every member of this body does many times each month.  When there aren't enough patent examiners to give patent applications sufficient attention, bad patents get issued.  As the President and CEO of the Internet Association, which represents leading Internet companies like Amazon, eBay, Expedia, Facebook, Hotels.com, Netflix, Twitter, and Yahoo!, puts it: ``the Patent Fee Integrity Act . . . would provide the Patent and Trademark Office with adequate funding and resources to improve overall patent quality. Improving patent quality is an essential step in improving the entire patent ecosystem by shutting off the supply of low-quality patents that fuel litigation by patent trolls.'' The Coalition for Patent Fairness, which includes such major companies as Blackberry, Cisco, Dell, Google, Oracle, and Verizon, notes that ``When patent quality suffers, innovation throughout America's economy is stymied, and patent trolls are able to prosper.''  To make sure the Patent and Trademark Office has the resources it needs to issue patents in a timely manner and to improve patent quality, in 2011, in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, we gave the PTO the authority to increase its user fees.  Some of us fought at that time to end the practice of fee diversion, led by my co-sponsor Senator Coburn, to make sure that the users got the full benefit of their increased fees. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol watered down the language that the Senate passed to accomplish this purpose.  One of the sponsors defended that language when it came back to the Senate, arguing that the bill ``creates a PTO reserve fund for any fees collected above the appropriated amounts in a given year--so that only the PTO will have access to these fees.''  I warned then that the House's changes provided no assurance that that is what would actually happen.  So what happened? Well, the PTO went ahead and raised its fees, as expected.  Did it get to keep all those new fees?  Unfortunately, the government wasted little time in diverting the new fees. In fiscal year 2013, $121 million in PTO user fees were diverted, due to sequestration. This pushed the total of PTO user fees diverted since PTO was made self-sufficient in 1990 to over $1 billion, $171 million, to be exact.  Requiring the payment of higher patent fees which are then used for general government purposes really amounts to a tax on innovation which is the last thing we should be burdening in today's technology-driven economy.  The fact that this latest round of fee diversion occurred through sequestration provides another reason why the legislation we are introducing today is needed. PTO never should have been subject to sequestration in the first place. As I have described, it is not supported at all by taxpayer funds--it is completely funded by user fees. These users pay for a service when they send in their fees: the timely consideration and processing of their patent or trademark application or renewal. They are entitled to have the benefit of what they paid for. These funds should not be sequestered, to pay for other government services, for which there is a deficit. The PTO does not contribute at all to the deficit, and that has been the case for more than 20 years.  As a result of PTO's budgetary shortfall, in which sequestration played a significant part: information technology modernization was scaled back significantly; the process of opening new PTO satellite offices, called for in the America Invents Act, was frozen; hiring of most support personnel was stopped; and travel and training was virtually eliminated.  Last fall brought another unfortunate budgetary disruption: the shutdown of the federal government. Fortunately, the PTO was able to keep operating for that limited time, with the balances it had in its account. However, had the shutdown continued, PTO, too, would have been forced to close up--despite the fact that it collects fees that make it self-sustaining.  There is no good reason why PTO should be subject to sequestration and shutdown. As the Business Software Alliance states in their supporting letter, ``This bill would ensure the USPTO can continue conducting self-funded operations that produce tremendous economic and social value for the United States.''  The Patent Fee Integrity Act strikes current language that makes PTO subject to the appropriations process, which has been the principal avenue through which its funding has been diverted, and ensures that it can keep its funding. However, we also include measures to maintain accountability for the agency; the bill: requires the PTO Director to submit an annual report and operations plan to Congress; requires the PTO Director to submit an annual spending plan to the Appropriations Committees; and requires an annual independent financial audit.  This bill is supported across the width and breadth of the patent user community. It is endorsed by: Bayer Corporation; Biocom; The Biotechnology Industry Organization; BSA, The Software Alliance; The Coalition for Patent Fairness; The Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, which represents a broad group of nearly 50 global corporations who employ hundreds of thousands of Americans in a variety of sectors, including 3M, Caterpillar, General Electric, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and Northrop Grumman; Fallbrook Technologies; The Innovation Alliance, which includes innovative small, medium, and large businesses, including Dolby Laboratories and QUALCOMM; the Intellectual Property Owners Association, whichrepresents more than 200 companies and 12,000 individuals in the U.S. who own intellectual property; The Internet Association; Mattel; Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association; National Association of Manufacturers; Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; and Xerox.  Many of these groups disagree vehemently with each other about patent reform. However, they all come together to unite in support of the bill we are introducing today, the Patent Fee Integrity Act.  BSA, The Software Alliance aptly observes, ``with their funds constantly under attack, the USPTO faces an endless and unnecessary challenge to provide the services for which American innovators have already paid. The Patent Fee Integrity Act will help the USPTO continue to increase patent quality, provide critical, time-sensitive services, and guarantee continuity of its operations independent of continually-shifting political considerations.''  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical bill. As the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform and others observed in the letter they sent to me in support of this bill: ``Your legislation would empower the USPTO to fully support America's innovators without adding a single penny to the deficit.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    BSA/The Software Alliance,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2013.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of BSA/The Software      Alliance and its members, which are among the world's most      innovative companies, I write to express strong support for      the Patent Fee Integrity Act, which would remove the US      Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from the congressional      appropriations process. This bill would ensure the USPTO can      continue conducting self-funded operations that produce      tremendous economic and social value for the United States.       The USPTO plays an indispensable role in sparking the      growth of America's economy by protecting intellectual      property (IP) and promoting innovation. Over the last two      decades, however, the federal government has withheld,      diverted, or sequestered more than $1 billion in USPTO user      fee collections. This bill recognizes that with their funds      constantly under attack, the USPTO faces an endless and      unnecessary challenge to provide the services for which      American innovators have already paid.       The Patent Fee Integrity Act will help the USPTO continue      to increase patent quality, provide critical, time-sensitive      services, and guarantee continuity of its operations      independent of continually-shifting political considerations.      Moreover, it will protect against reducing the USPTO's      operating capacity at a time when it needs to expand to      enable American businesses to bring new innovations to      market.       We commend you for your leadership in introducing the      Patent Fee Integrity Act and look forward to working with you      and others to ensure it garners the broad bipartisan support      it deserves.           Sincerely,                                              Victoria A. Espinel,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                                   March 13, 2014.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We commend you for introducing the      Patent Fee Integrity Act and we offer our full support.       America's economic future depends on our continued ability      to innovate and commercialize new products and processes.      American businesses are among the most dynamic and innovative      in the world. We develop the technology that creates jobs and      stimulates our economy. Our nation's universities partner      with business to conduct the ground-breaking research, as      well as educate the creative people, that fuel the innovative      dynamism of the business sector. Such investment is not      without risk, which is why the Patent Fee Integrity Act has      never been more critical.       U.S. innovators rely on patents to protect their investment      in the research and development of breakthrough innovations      such as manufacturing and product technologies and life-     saving drugs. Valid and enforceable patent rights are      essential in this process and enable the United States to      maintain its competitive edge. An adequately funded United      States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is vital in      ensuring that high quality patent rights are promptly      granted. Yet, the precarious funding situation of the USPTO      makes the realization of this essential mission impossible.       Over the last two decades, the government has withheld,      diverted, or sequestered hundreds of millions of USPTO user      fee dollars. With uncertain and insufficient funding, the      USPTO faces an endless and unnecessary challenge in providing      the services for which American innovators have requested and      paid. The Patent Fee Integrity Act would end this problem by      removing the USPTO from the Congressional appropriations      process and allow all of its user fees to fund its      operations. Your legislation would empower the USPTO to fully      support America's innovators without adding a single penny to      the deficit.       Our innovation based economy demands a fully-funded USPTO.      The USPTO needs predictability and certainty in its budgeting      so that it can provide the patent protection needed champion      America's innovators. We support quick passage of the Patent      Fee Integrity Act.

Statement on the Patent Fee Integrity Act,       The Coaliton for Patent Fairness (CPF) thanks Senator      Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for introducing the Patent Fee      Integrity Act.       As patent holders, CPF members recognize the importance of      an adequately funded U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).      We applaud Senator Feinstein for taking steps to ensure that      the PTO has the resources it needs to fulfill its essential      mission and to maintain patent quality.       Improving patent quality is a vital piece of the patent      puzzle. When patent quality suffers, innovation throughout      America's economy is stymied, and patent trolls are able to      prosper. Quite clearly, patent reviews conducted today will      have a lasting impact in the future; by helping to establish      adequate funding of the PTO, the Patent Fee Integrity Act      will support innovation.       The U.S. patent system plays an important role in helping      America's economy flourish, and abuses of that system pose a      significant threat to innovation and economic growth. We      thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership and will continue      to work with her and her colleagues toward the passage of      patent litigation reform.                                  ____                                       Fallbrook Technologies,                                   Cedar Park, TX, March 13, 2014.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As CEO of an emerging technology      company with roots in California, I write to enthusiastically      endorse your effort to introduce patent legislation that is      critically important to America's innovation ecosystem and      the U.S. economy, the Patent Fee Integrity Act. Although      Fallbrook Technologies cautions the Senate to tread extremely      cautiously with other proposed patent legislation, the Patent      Fee Integrity Act represents the only patent reform bill      which advances the one issue that unifies intellectual      property stakeholders across the innovation spectrum and thus      should be advanced by the Senate without delay.       Fallbrook is an emerging manufacturing and technology      development company dedicated to improving the flexibility of      power transmission within a wide variety of mechanical      devices. Currently, Fallbrook is located in Texas, but we      have California ties as our technology was invented in      Fallbrook, California, a large number of our investors are in      California and some key employees currently reside in San      Diego. Our core technology is the patented and award-winning      NuVinci' continuously variable planetary (CVP)      transmission system. Fallbrook's NuVinci CVP technology is a      standard component on more than 60 major bicycle brands      throughout Europe, and can improve the performance and      efficiency of products that use a transmission, such as      automobiles, agricultural equipment, light electric vehicles,      outdoor power equipment and wind turbines. Fallbrook employs      over 130 people in the U.S. (as of the date of this letter),      including about 30 of the best engineers in the transmission      sector. We currently hold over 600 patents and pending      applications worldwide and are working with our key      automotive licensees to bring gas-saving vehicles to the      marketplace.       As you are aware, for more than a decade, American      innovators like Fallbrook have had our U.S. Patent and      Trademark Office user fees diverted by Congress for other      purposes. Essentially, such fee diversion has worked as an      innovation tax which slows the technology development process      and hinders job creation. The Patent Fee Integrity Act will      repeal this innovation tax and is long overdue. Full USPTO      funding will provide the USPTO the resources it needs to      improve patent quality while Congress determines whether      further actions may be needed to improve the patent system.       We applaud you and your bipartisan cosponsors for      introducing the bill and stand ready to assist you in any way      necessary.           Sincerely,                                                    William Klehm,     Chairman and CEO.                                  ____                                          Innovation Alliance,                                                   March 13, 2014.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Innovation Alliance, a      coalition of research and development-focused companies,      thanks you and your cosponsors for introducing the Patent Fee      Integrity Act, which will put an end to fee diversion once      and for all. We have long maintained that ending fee      diversion, and thereby giving the U.S. Patent & Trademark      Office (``USPTO'') all of the fees it is paid by patent      applicants, is the single most important change policymakers      can make to improve the U.S. patent system.       Over the last 20 years, approximately $1 billion in fees      paid by patent applicants has been diverted from its proper      use at the USPTO. This unwarranted diversion of fees has      resulted in more than 600,000 unexamined patent applications      and more than 28 months in the average patent pendency time.      Ending this tax on innovation is perhaps the one change to      the patent law that unites stakeholders from all parts of the      innovation ecosystem in the United States.       The Innovation Alliance thanks you for your leadership on      this critically important issue for the patent system. We      look forward to working with you and your cosponsors to pass      the Patent Fee Integrity Act into law as soon as possible.           Sincerely,                                                     Brian Pomper,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                             Intellectual Property                                           Owners Association,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2014.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Intellectual Property Owners      Association (IPO) writes to express its strong support for      the Patent Fee Integrity Act, to provide for the permanent      funding of the United States Patent and Trademark Office      (USPTO).       IPO is a trade association representing companies and      individuals in all industries and fields of technology who      own or are interested in intellectual property rights. IPO's      membership includes more than 200 companies and more than      12,500 individuals who are involved in the association either      through their companies or as inventor, author, law firm, or      attorney members. Our members all agree that the United      States needs a fully-funded USPTO to keep our nation      competitive, encourage innovation and create new jobs.       Over the last two decades the government has withheld,      diverted or sequestered about $1 billion in USPTO user fee      collections. Removing the USPTO from the congressional      appropriations process is the most promising approach we know      for stopping the hemorrhaging of USPTO fees. We hope the      Senate will move ahead with the bill as soon as possible.       Thank you for your help in securing full, permanent funding      for the USPTO. We stand ready to assist in any way we can.           Sincerely,                                               Herbert C. Wamsley,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                         The Internet Association,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2014.   Statement of Michael Beckerman, President and CEO of the Internet   Association, on Senator Feinstein's Introduction of the Patent Fee                              Integrity Act       The Internet Association commends Senator Feinstein's      introduction of the Patent Fee Integrity Act, which would      provide the Patent and Trademark Office with adequate funding      and resources to improve overall patent quality. Improving      patent quality is an essential step in improving the entire      patent ecosystem by shutting off the supply of low-quality      patents that fuel litigation by patent trolls. That is why      The Internet Association also supports an expanded review of      the covered business method patent program to eliminate      patents that never been granted in the first instance. An      expanded review program, coupled with strong fee shifting and      discovery provisions, make up the necessary components of a      meaningful response to the patent troll epidemic. We look      forward to working with Senator Feinstein and Members of the      Senate Judiciary Committee as they prepare to address these      important issues in the coming weeks.
