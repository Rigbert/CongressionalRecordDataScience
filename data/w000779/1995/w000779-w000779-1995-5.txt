Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.  Today the debate is how to reach a balanced budget over the next few years in a manner that is reasonable, humane, and efficient. The bill before us today is neither reasonable nor humane nor efficient.  The new majority's road map to a Federal balanced budget takes America to a lot of places we do not want to go and a lot of places we should not even want to visit. These detours leave behind the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. These detours ensure that there will be a lot more wasteful military boondoggles. These detours ensure that there will be a lot more sweet days for the polluters. My colleagues, that is not right.  Let us vote for a balanced budget that brings money home that we are now spending defending the Germans and the Japanese. Let us make the polluters pay their fair share. That is the way to balance the budget.
