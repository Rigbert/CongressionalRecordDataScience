Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. The gentleman from Michigan is correct to bring this issue up. The regulations that determine dredging in the Great Lakes need to be updated and reflect the true economic value that they produce.  The Great Lakes are the fourth sea coast of this Nation and home to the U.S. Flag fleet and the Canadian Flag fleet. In addition, dozens of international vessels regularly travel through the Great Lakes, visiting port communities along the way. These vessels team up to haul upwards of 125 million tons of cargo during a typical 10-month shipping season. That is almost a half of ton for every person in the United States of America. I truly thank the gentleman for highlighting this inequity and certainly assure him that we will continue to work closely with the chairman to rectify this problem.
