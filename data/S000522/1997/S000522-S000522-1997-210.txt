Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentlewoman that the materials that we provided to Senator Hatfield clearly showed that the organizations were promoting, performing abortions on demand in these developing countries. No one is suggesting that they were doing it with U.S. tax dollars.  The issue here is fungibility. The money that we give to an organization frees up other money that then can be used to lobby for abortion in the developing world. Let me remind everybody in this Chamber that approximately 100 countries around the world protect the lives of their unborn children.  The International Planned Parenthood Federation has made it their mission, their goal explicitly to bring down every one of those pro-life laws. When we give to these organizations, we then empower them to be the super lobby to bring down the laws in Brazil, Peru. Poland recently flip-flopped and went from a pro-life country to a pro-abortion country.  In early February, a new law went into effect in South Africa, again a flip-flop from pro-life to pro-abortion. It is the organizations that are mounting this offensive against the unborn child. When we contribute to them, we are facilitating abortion overseas.
