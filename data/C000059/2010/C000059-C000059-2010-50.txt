Riverside has been blessed by dynamic and dedicated leaders, like Eric, who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work.  Eric Botkin began his career with the City of Riverside Fire Department on May 1, 1998. He held the position of firefighter paramedic until his retirement. During his career he performed as a fire investigator from February 18, 2000 through July 5, 2002. He completed Engine Certification on November 2, 2007. His last assignment was Fire Station 13 on Canyon Springs Blvd.  Prior to working for the City of Riverside Fire Department Eric was a paid/call firefighter with the Orange County Fire Authority. He also worked for Lifefleet Ambulance and Medtrans Ambulance before pursuing his fire department career.  Eric passed away at his Temecula home on December 27th surrounded by family and friends, including his wife, Hallie, and son, Hunter, 10, after battling glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Eric Botkin was diagnosed in October of 2007 and retired from the fire department on October 30, 2008. For the past two years Eric remained upbeat and was an inspiration to all.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of Riverside FirefighterEric Botkin. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
