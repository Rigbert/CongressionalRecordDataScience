Speaker, as we speak here today, progress is being made in Iraq. As chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, I have visited Iraq and witnessed firsthand their accomplishments. With our help, they have surpassed prewar electrical generation levels and are on track to be generating at almost 140 percent over their prewar level by June. Water facilities are currently operating at 65 percent of prewar levels and are improving. Current projects include the rehabilitation of 15 water treatment facilities and a canal to Basra. These projects will benefit millions of Iraqis and provide for a future of water reliability.  But make no mistake, we did not go into Iraq to improve water infrastructure or increase electrical power capabilities. One year ago, this country, along with our allies, made the decision to topple a tyrannical regime, liberate a people, and help build a democracy in the heart of a terrorist breeding ground. However, the gift of freedom and democracy is being built on the basic level of services and quality of life which they are building today. We must stand by the Iraqi people in their long and challenging journey toward democracy because their freedom contributes to our security and the security of the world.  God bless America and God bless our troops.
