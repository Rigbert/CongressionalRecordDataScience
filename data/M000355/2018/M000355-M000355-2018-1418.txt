 President, on a totally different matter, this week the Senate will consider another slate of extremely well-qualified nominees for seats on the Federal bench. A thoughtful, independent, and expert judiciary is a cornerstone of our constitutional order. It has been the case since the very beginning of our country.  Accordingly, the six circuit court nominees we will now consider have excellent reputations in the legal field and have demonstrated they understand the proper role of Federal judges in our government.  First up is Kurt Engelhardt, of Louisiana, the President's choice to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate previously confirmed Judge Engelhardt by voice vote to the Federal trial bench in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Since then, he has only strengthened his reputation for fairness and thoughtfulness.  In the latest edition of the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, his legal peers describe him as ``very conscientious'' and ``fair and independent minded.'' The American Bar Association agrees. It awarded Judge Engelhardt its highest possible rating of ``unanimously well qualified.'' I urge every one of our colleagues to join me in voting to advance Judge Engelhardt's nomination later this afternoon.                          ____________________
