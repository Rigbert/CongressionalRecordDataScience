 Mr. Leader, as you know, we have been considering the rule for the food labeling bill. It is my understanding we are going to be limited to general debate.  It is also my understanding that the reason we are not completing the bill is the Rules Committee has had some issues with reference to exactly the way in which we are going to consider the bill and the amendments.  Mr. Leader, as you know, this bill has had no hearings. None. As you further know, there are States who are very concerned. As a matter of fact, I think I have gotten a letter indicating there are 36 attorneys general around the country, Republican and Democrat, who have concerns with this bill.  Mr. Leader, I would hope that the leadership on your side would convey to the Rules Committee the necessity to have, A, open debate, and hopefully, as well, significant possibility of amendment.  I do not know whether it would be an open rule or certainly, I hesitate to use this word, but a liberal rule which will allow significant amendments to be considered by this House, again, in light of the fact that it has had no hearings whatsoever as it comes to this floor.  I yield to my friend.
