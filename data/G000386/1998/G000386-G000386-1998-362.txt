 President, first of all, I wish to comment on the prayer of the Chaplain of the Senate this morning. It is a prayer that is needed, because there is more than just one member of the family involved in the Senate. It is needed because family is very much involved. More importantly, our Chaplain practices what he preaches in the sense that he is truly a person who is a pastor not only for 100 Senators and their families but for a bigger family, the staff of the Senate. So I know that his prayer is from the heart as well as from the Scripture.                          ____________________
