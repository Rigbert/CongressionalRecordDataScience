I have said clearly in the Senate, and obviously the Senator does not accept it, but I will say it again: There were horrors beyond interrogation techniques committed by those three regimes. That is clear.  But I want to ask the Senator from Virginia, does he even accept the premise or possibility that this happened at Guantanamo?
