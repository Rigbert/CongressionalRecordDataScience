Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the underlying Istook language that was approved by the full Committee on Appropriations and in opposition to the Kolbe strike. The current language, which this amendment would delete, is a noble attempt to protect the powers of the States and the rights of taxpayers who do not wish to pay for abortions.  The current language also protects the constitutional prerogative of Congress as the only branch of the Federal Government with the authority to make laws. It does this by repealing the Clinton administration's strained and unfaithful interpretation of the Hyde amendment. The Istook language guarantees that in cases where the demand for an abortion rises from rape or incest, States may resolve this very difficult dilemma in the manner most consistent with values of their own citizens expressed through their State representatives. The amendment before us would strike the Istook language. It would thereby save the Clinton rules and force all States to fund abortion in these situations.  Supporters of the Kolbe strike claim that they are preserving the Hyde amendment. In fact, the Clinton rules which they are seeking to reinforce effectively undermine the Hyde amendment.                              {time}  1745  The Kolbe amendments, under the pretext of preserving it, would defeat it. On the Hyde amendment language, let me remind Members when it was offered by the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, was permissive, not mandatory. It allows States, it allows them, does not force them to add Medicaid funds for abortions resulting from rape or incest, but it respects the State law when that State law is more protective of those children in that very difficult situation. It took the Clinton administration to urge that the Kolbe strike amendment be defeated.
