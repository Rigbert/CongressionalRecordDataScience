 In the short term, however, we have done another item which we have not reauthorized, and that is the Export-Import Bank.  Senator McConnell believes that that has the votes in the Senate, and he believes that the highway bill that we have just sent them is a vehicle to add that Export-Import Bank proposal to. And my presumption is it will be in that bill when it comes back to us.  Hopefully, it will come back within the next few days because, of course, the highway authorization ends at the end of this month, in which case there will be no authorization to spend money on the highway program.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not, if that comes back, it will be on the floor? I have heard some discussion about the fact that the Speaker says it will be on the floor, but the Export-Import Bank would be open to amendment.  Would the gentleman tell me whether or not there are any plans along those lines.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me one more time.  The gentleman is well aware of how I feel about the Export-Import Bank, and we have a difference of opinion. I am one who has always believed in the principle that you should just deal with the subject that is before you.  We have passed the highway bill. The best advice I can give to the Senate--it is a clean highway bill until December 18--is to pass a clean highway bill and move it to the President.
