 President, for most Americans, a church is a place of worship and love, a place where the faithful go to feel mercy and compassion, which is why what happened in Texas yesterday is so difficult for many to comprehend. Why would an individual do this? Families lost so much. Our hearts go out to them in this time of untold grief. Our gratitude goes out to the civilians and first responders who answer the call when others are in need.  As we continue to learn the details of yesterday's tragic events, I, along with all Members of the Senate, will keep the victims of this tragedy and their families in my prayers.  Mr. President, on a completely different matter, last Monday I said the Senate would confirm four excellent judicial nominees by the end of the week. That is just what we did--Amy Barrett, confirmed; Joan Larsen, confirmed; Allison Eid, confirmed; Stephanos Bibas, confirmed.  After 8 years of a President who selected judges based upon an ideological litmus test designed to find nominees who favor certain groups or individuals over others, we now have a President who is sending over nominees who will ensure that the judiciary is actually living up to the role we expect in our democracy: treating everyone equally, giving every litigant a fair shake, applying the law as it is actually written, not as the judge wishes it might be. The four circuit court nominees the Senate confirmed last week will do just that.  Democrats have put up a lot of procedural roadblocks to prevent the Senate from moving forward all year. We have moved ahead anyway. As a result, despite all the obstacles from the other side, we are making significant progress.  Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work and notable leadership of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and I want to thank him again for everything he has done.  We are not finished yet. We are going to keep pressing forward on judicial nominees. We are going to keep confirming the other nominees before us as well.  This week the Senate will consider some of President Trump's other qualified nominees for various positions throughout the Federal Government. Each of these individuals will help lead their agencies to fulfill their particular mission in running the government.  First, we will advance the nomination of Steven Engel to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. Mr. Engel previously worked in the OLC, having done so under President Bush. He also served as Deputy Assistant Attorney Generaland counsel to the Assistant Attorney General. He obviously has a lot of experience advising senior policymakers on a wide variety of legal issues facing the executive branch. That is good because the role he has been nominated to has the responsibility for providing legal advice to the executive branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing pending legislation for constitutionality.  I look forward to advancing Mr. Engel's nomination tomorrow so that he can begin putting his experience to work for our country as soon as possible, and then we will turn to the various other nominees before us so they can begin doing the same. Confirming the President's nominees is an important part of the Senate's business, and I urge all of our colleagues to work together so we can get this done.                               Tax Reform  Now on one final matter, Mr. President, today our colleagues on the House Ways and Means Committee began marking up the tax reform legislation they unveiled last week. Under Chairman Brady's leadership, the committee is continuing its work to get our economy reaching again for its true potential. This is yet more momentum for our country's once-in-a-generation opportunity to update the tax system, deliver relief to hard-working American families, and get our economy creating more opportunities and prosperity.  Under Chairman Hatch's leadership, the Senate Finance Committee is continuing to move forward on its own legislation to increase opportunity and to provide more take-home pay for American families. In an open process through regular order, members of the committee will continue to have input in the writing of this tax reform legislation.  Both Chambers are working with the President and his team to overhaul our country's complex and outdated tax system. We are united around a commonsense set of goals to make taxes lower, simpler, and fairer; take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in the pockets of America's middle class; and level the playing field for American workers and businesses so they can compete against foreign competitors on an equal footing and not only create more jobs in America but keep them here too. These are goals shared by so many across our country regardless of party.  It is time to deliver real tax relief for hard-working families, and we are going to keep working together to do just that.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
