 President, let me say to my good friend from Nevada, this is a very legitimate concern that the Texas Senators have. They are working diligently, as the junior Senator from Texas indicated, with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley.  I support this bill; the majority leader supports this bill. It has broad bipartisan support. I assure my good friend the majority leader that there is not an effort here to try to slow down the passage of this extender package. But we would like to get it right, if we can, and this is a legitimate concern the Texas Senators have. I am convinced that they are working as rapidly as possible; that Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley are sympathetic to their concerns and, apparently, think they are legitimate concerns that could be addressed. So I would like to try to cheer up my good friend the majority leader that maybe progress is just around the corner.
