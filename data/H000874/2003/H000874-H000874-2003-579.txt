Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sotterley Foundation. The Sotterley Foundation received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant to enhance exhibits at the historic Sotterley Plantation.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refugees and other sites in five states and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Sotterley Foundation is receiving a grant of $28,000 and $28,000 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Sotterley Foundation will restore, display and interpret a Chesapeake Bay log canoe discovered in nearby Sotterley Creek. Visitors exploring this historic plantation along the Patuxent River will have the opportunity to examine and learn about a workboat that once plied the waters off the site. The log canoe will be protected under a shelter, and interpreted through several exhibit panels.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Sotterley Foundation that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Sotterley Foundation on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
