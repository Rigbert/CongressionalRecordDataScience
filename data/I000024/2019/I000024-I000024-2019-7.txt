President, the vote we are talking about is to waive the budget point of order that was raised by Senator Enzi. If the budget point of order is not waived, the NDAA--which I believe is the most significant vote we pass every year; it has passed for 58 consecutive years--will be referred back to committee. So that is really what is at stake here.  The budget point of order on the NDAA is primarily caused by three provisions: first, repealing the widow's tax phased in over 3 years. We have been talking about that. That is part of this point of order; secondly, giving visas to Afghans who work closely with the U.S. military during the war; and, third, allowing military servicemembers to file claims for medical malpractice.  Now, all three provisions have significant bipartisan support. The widow's tax, as was just stated, has 76 cosponsors in the Senate, 383 in the House.  A vote in this Chamber in late September to instruct conference on the widow's tax passed 94 to 0. You might keep that in mind. Anyone who talks now about opposing it actually voted for it back in September.  Now, as I mentioned in my remarks last night, I started working to repeal the widow's tax after being inspired by one of my personal heroes, a young lady named Jane Horton.  I can remember back in September of 2011, I was in a little town north of Tulsa, OK--Collinsville, OK--and I was up there talking to people, the normal type of thing we do, going around speaking with our constituents, and I recall that is when I first met Jane Horton. She lived in Collinsville.  After I had visited for a while with the group, I commented that I am the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am going to be going to Afghanistan in this next week. She said that her husband, Chris Horton, was also right at that moment in Afghanistan. I made the statement: Well, let's find out where he is, and I did. I checked into it and arranged to go by to see him as I left for Afghanistan, but I didn't see him because on September 9, 2011, Chris Horton was killed in action.  Now, after all of Jane's sacrifices in losing her husband in the line of duty, it seemed unimaginable to me that she should have to deal with the further pain of a dollar-for-dollar offset in her benefits as a Gold Star spouse. So we have worked with Jane and the other Gold Star spouses for a long time to figure out how we can do this in a responsible way. That hasn't been talked about so far, but we did it. So it has happened over a period of time.  Similarly, supporting the Afghan partners who sacrificed so much to help us help their country has long been a bipartisan priority. Everyone involved in this conference, including the Department of Defense, recognized the importance of fixing the medical malpractice issues in a commonsense fashion.  I understand my colleagues' concerns. We have worked hard to make each of these provisions fiscally responsible, and we will continue to do that.  There is a document, which nobody reads anymore, called the Constitution. The Constitution says that our top priorities here should be defending America. That is what we are supposed to be doing. Each of these provisions enables us to better defend America and allows us to take up this bill and actually pass it for the President to sign.  So I urge you to vote to allow this bill to move to final passage so that we can send this legislation to the President's desk, where he said he would sign it immediately, and he will. By doing so, it will send a clear message to our troops and adversaries that this body is serious about America's national security.                        Vote on Motion to Waive  Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of the act and applicable budget resolutions for the purpose of the conference report to accompany S. 1790, and I ask for the yeas and the nays.
