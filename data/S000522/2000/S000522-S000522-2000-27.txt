Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for his leadership on this very important issue, as well as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), and my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), who has been indefatigable for many years on this important issue.  Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) is right in pointing out that this is a bipartisan effort, and we are trying to send a clear non-ambiguous message to the British Government that we are looking at their policing bill, that we looked at it very carefully, and it falls far, far short.  Last Friday, as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I held my sixth hearing in a series of hearings which have delved into the status of human rights in the North of Ireland and the deplorable human rights record of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the RUC, Northern Ireland's police force.                              {time}  2045  Our panel of experts were emphatic about the gap that exists between the recommendations of the Patten Commission on policing reform and the bill that the British Government has now put forth in their attempt to comply with the Good Friday Agreement's instructions to ``craft a new beginning to policing.''  Professor Brendan O'Leary, one of our witnesses from the London School of Economics and Political Science, testified that the pending police bill is, quote, ``a poorly disguised facade'' that does not implement the Patten report. He said it was, and I quote again, ``mendaciously misleading'' for Northern Ireland's Secretary of State, Peter Mandelson, to suggest that his government's bill implements the Patten report.  Professor O'Leary reported that the bill improved at the Commons stage, yet he testified that the British government's bill is still very ``insufficient.'' He called it a ``bloodless ghost'' of Patten and referred to it as ``Patten light.''  Similarly, Martin O'Brien, the great human rights activist and the Director of the Committee on Administration of Justice, an independent human rights organization in Belfast, expressed his organization's, quote, ``profound disappointment at the developments since the publication of the Patten report.'' He said that ``only a third or less of Patten's recommendations resulted in proposals for legislative change.''  Mr. O'Brien reported that ``a study of the draft seems to confirm the view that the British government is unwilling,'' his words, ``to put Patten's agenda into practical effect.'' He called it ``a very far cry from the Patten report'' and said ``despite much lobbying and extensive changes in the course of the parliamentary process to date, there is still a very long way to go.''  Elisa Massimino, from the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, testified that the bill ``falls far short of the Patten recommendations'' and she pointed to many discrepancies to illustrate this. And Dr. Gerald Lynch, the President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an American appointee to the Patten Commission, restated the Commission's unanimous support for full implementation and warned, in his words, ``that the recommendations should not be cherry picked but must be implemented in a cohesive and constructive manner.''  Mr. Speaker, the witnesses at last week's hearings, as well as witnesses at previous hearings, as well as in correspondences that we have all received and in the meetings that we have had throughout this Capitol and in Belfast and elsewhere, policing has been the issue. In fact last year we had Chris Patten himself and the U.N. Special Rapporteur to Northern Ireland, Param Cumaraswamy, speak to our subcommittee. They too pointed to police reform as the essence of real reform in Northern Ireland.  It is critical to note, then, that despite the progress to date, the British government is at a critical crossroads on the path to peace in Northern Ireland. The British government has the sole opportunity and responsibility for making police reform either the linchpin or the Achilles heel of the Good Friday Agreement.  Accordingly, our legislation today calls upon the British government to fully and faithfully implement the recommendations contained in the Patten Commission report. The bill is the culmination of years of work in terms of trying to get everyone to the point where they have a transparent police force that is not wedded to secrecy and cover-up of human rights abuses.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 547 does get specific. It points out that the police bill in parliament limits the powers of inquiry and investigation envisioned by the Patten report for the Policing Board and the police ombudsman. Remarkably, the police bill gives the Secretary of the State of Ireland a veto authority to prevent a Policing Board inquiry if the inquiry ``would serve no useful purpose.'' That just turns the bill into a farce, Mr. Speaker.  The British government also prohibits the Policing Board from looking into any acts that occurred before the bill was enacted. The British government's bill also denies the ombudsman the authority to investigate police policies and practices and restricts her ability to look at past complaints against police officers. And the bill restricts the new oversight commissioner to assessing only those changes the British government agrees to, rather than overseeing the implementation of the full range of the Patten recommendations.  Mr. Speaker, when Mr. Patten met with our committee, I and many others expressed our disappointment that his report contained no procedure whatsoever for vetting RUC officers who committed human rights abuses in the past. That said, we took some comfort that the Commission at least recommended that existing police officers should affirmingly state a willingness to uphold human rights. Now we learn that the British government's bill guts even this minimalist recommendation.  Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude, and I ask that my full statement be made a part of the Record. Two years ago this week, human rights defense attorney Rosemary Nelson testified before my subcommittee expressing her deepest-held fear that the RUC, which had made numerous death threats against her and her family through her clients, would one day succeed and assassinate her. The U.N. Special Rapporteur testified at the hearing that he was satisfied that there was truth to those allegations that defense attorneys were harassed and intimidated by members of the RUC.  As we sadly all know today, Rosemary Nelson was killed, the victim of an assassin's car bomb just 6 monthsafter she asked us to take action to protect defense attorneys in Northern Ireland. Her murder is now being investigated in part by the RUC, the police force that she so feared. If the British government's police bill continues to reject mechanisms for real accountability, we may never know who killed Rosemary Nelson or defense attorney Patrick Finucane. And sadly the police force may never be rid of those who may have condoned, perhaps helped cover up, or even took part in some of the most egregious human rights abuses in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Speaker, let us have a unanimous vote for this resolution and send a clear message to our friends on the other side of the pond that we want real reform and that real police reform is the linchpin to the Good Friday Agreement.  Last Friday, as Chairman of the International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee and as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I held my sixth hearing in a series of hearings which have delved into the status of human rights in the north of Ireland and the deplorable human rights record of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.  Our panel of experts was emphatic about the gap that exists between the recommendations of the Patten Commission on policing reform and the bill that the British government has now put forth in their attempt to comply with the Good Friday Agreement's instruction to craft ``a new beginning to policing.''  Professor Brendan O'Leary from the London School of Economics and Political Science testified that the pending Policing Bill is ``a poorly disguised facade'' that does not implement the Patten report. He said it was ``mendaciously misleading'' for Northern Ireland's Secretary of State, Peter Mandelson, to suggest that this government's bill implements the Pattern report.  Professor O'Leary reported that the bill was improved at the Commons stage, yet he testified that the British government's bill is still ``insufficient''. He called it a ``bloodless ghost'' of Patten and referred to it as ``Patten light.''  Similarly, Martin O'Brien, Director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, an independent human rights organization in Belfast, expressed his organization's ``profound disappointment at the developments since the publication of the Patten report.'' He said that ``only a third or less of Patten's recommendations resulted in proposal for legislative change.''  Mr. O'Brien reported that ``a study of the draft to confirm the view that government is unwilling to put Patten's agenda into practical effect.''

And Dr. Gerald Lynch, the President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an American appointee to the Patten Commission, restated the Commissions unanimous support for full implementation and warned that ``the recommendations not be cherry picked but be implemented in a cohesive and constructive manner.''  Mr. Speaker, the witnesses at last week's hearing, as well as witnesses at previous hearings--including Patten himself and U.N. Special Rapporteur to Northern Ireland, Param Cumaraswamy--have all pointed to police reform as the essence of real reform in Northern Ireland. It is critical to note, then, that despite the progress to date, the British government is at a critical crossroads on the path to peace in Northern Ireland. The British government has the sole opportunity--and responsibility--for making police reform either the lynchpin--or the Achilles' heel--of the Good Friday Agreement.  Accordingly, our legislation today calls upon the British Government to fully and faithfully implement the recommendations contained in the Patten Commission report on policing. Our bill is the culmination of our years of work and it is our urging of an ally to do what is right for peace in Northern Ireland.  H. Res. 547 does get specific. It now contains language which I offered at the Committee stage to highlight a few of the most egregious examples where the proposed Police Bill does not live up to either the letter or the spirit of the Patten report. For instance, the Police Bill, as currently drafted, limits the powers of inquiry and investigation envisioned by the Patten report for the Policing Board and the Police Ombudsman. Remarkably, the Police Bill gives the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a veto authority to prevent a Policing Board inquiry if the inquiry would ``serve no useful purpose.'' The bill completely prohibits the Policing Board from looking into any acts that occurred before the bill is enacted.  The British Government's Police Bill also denies the Ombudsman authority to investigate police policies and practices and restricts her ability to look at past complaints against police officers. And the bill restricts the new oversight commissioner to assessing only those changes the British Government agrees to rather than overseeing the implementation of the full range of Patten's recommendations.  When Mr. Patten himself met without subcommittee, I and many others expressed our disappointment that his report contained no procedure for vetting RUC officers who committed human rights abuses in the past. That said, we took some comfort that the Commission at least recommended that the existing police officers should affirmatively state a willingness to uphold human rights. Now we learn that the British Government's bill guts even this minimalist recommendation.  Many of the reforms that the Patten Commission recommended, such as those addressing police accountability or the incorporation of international human rights standards into police practices and training, are not issues that divide the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. One must ask then, who it is that the Northern Ireland Secretary of State is trying to protect or pacify by failing to implement these recommendations.  Our witnesses concluded that the British Government is hiding behind the division between unionist and nationalists on other issues--such as what the police service's name and symbols will be--to avoid making changes in accountability structures and human rights standards for the police. According to Mr. O'Brien, ``these constraints are there apparently to satisfy the concerns of people already in the policing establishment who don't want change and don't want the spotlight shown on their past activities or future activities.''  In other words, the future of Northern Ireland is being held captive to the interests of the very police service and other British Government security services that the Good Friday Agreement sought to reform with the creation of the Patten Commission.  Mr. Speaker, there should be no doubt about the importance of policing reform in Northern Ireland as it relates to the broader peace process. Mr. O'Brien testified that ``the issue of resolution of policing and the transformation of the criminal justice system are at the heart of establishing a lasting peace.'' Dr. Gerald Lynch restated Chris Patten's oft-repeated statement that ``the Good Friday Agreement would come down to the policing issue.''  Professor O'Leary's comments were even more somber. He said:       In the absence of progress on Patten . . . we are likely to      see a stalling on possible progress in decommissioning,      minimally, and maximally, if one wanted to think of a      provocation to send hard line republicans back into full      scale conflict, one could think of no better choice of policy      than to fail to implement the Patten report . . . I think      disaster can follow . . . and may well follow from the      failure to implement Patten fully.  Both the nationalist and unionist communities supported the Good Friday Agreement and all that it entailed--including police reform. The people of Northern Ireland deserve no less than a police service that they can trust, that is representative of the community it serves, and that is accountable for its actions.  In conclusion Mr. Speaker, let me point out to my colleagues that it was two years ago this week that human rights defense attorney Rosemary Nelson testified before my subcommittee expressing her deepest held fear that the RUC, which had made death threats to her and her family through her clients, would one day succeed and kill her. The U.N. Special Rapporteur, Para Cumaraswamy testified at the same hearing that after his investigation in Northern Ireland, he was ``satisfied that there was truth in the allegations that defense attorneys were harassed and intimidated'' by members of the RUC.  As many people know, Rosemary Nelson was killed--the victim of an assassin's car bomb just six months after she asked us to take action to protect defense attorneys in Northern Ireland. Her murder is now being investigated, in part, by the RUC--the police force she so feared. If the British government's Police Bill continues to reject mechanisms for real accountability, we may never know who killed Rosemary Nelson, and defense attorney Patrick Finucane. And sadly the police force may never be rid of those who may have condoned, helped cover-up, or even took part in some of the most egregious human rights abuses in Northern Ireland.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure before us today in order to express in the strongest terms possible to the British government our support for implementation of the full Patten report and its very modest recommendations for a ``new beginning in policing.'' Statement of Gerald W. Lynch, President, John Jay College of Criminal   Justice, The City University of New York, Before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (The Helsinki Commission), September                                 22, 2000       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Commission on      Security and Cooperation in Europe. I want to thank you for      the opportunity to present testimony regarding the work of      the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland,      commonly known as the Patten Commission. I would like to      discuss the Policing Bill which is before the British      Parliament.       When I was introduced to the then Secretary of State for      Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, she said to me: ``How did you      get Ted Kennedy and Ronnie Flanagan to agree on you? (Sir      Ronnie Flanagan is the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster      Constabulary.) I told the Secretary that I believed they      agree on me because John Jay College has provided training      around the world emphasizing human rights and human dignity.      Moreover, John Jay has had an exchange of police and faculty      for 30 years with the British police, and for more than 20      years with the Garda--as well as an exchange with the R.U.C.      for over 20 years. Over that time there had been hundreds of      meetings and interactions among British, Irish and American      police and criminal-justice experts. The continuing dialogue      had generated an exchange of ideas and technology that was      totally professional--and totally non-partisan.       Many of John Jay's exchange scholars have risen to high      ranks in Britain, Ireland and America. The current      Commissioner of the police of New Scotland Yard, Sir John      Stevens, was the exchange scholar at John Jay for the Fall of      1984.       I am honored to have been selected to be a member of the      Patten Commission.       The Patten Report states that: ``the opportunity for a new      beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police      service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the      community as a whole . . . cannot be achieved unless the      reality that part of the community feels unable to identify      with the present name and symbols associated with the police      is addressed. . . . our proposals seek to achieve a situation      in which people can be British, Irish or Northern Irish, as      they wish, and all regard the police service as their own.       We therefore recommend:       The Royal Ulster Constabulary should henceforth be named      the Northern Ireland Police Service.       That the Northern Ireland Police Service adopt a new badge      and symbols which are entirely free from any association with      either the British or Irish states (We not that the Assembly      adopted a crest acceptable to all parties, namely, the symbol      of the flax)       That the union flag should not longer be flown from police      buildings       That, on those occasions on which it is appropriate to fly      a flag on police buildings, the flag should be that of      Northern Ireland Police Service, and it, too, should be free      from association with the British or Irish states''.       The Patten Commission worked for 15 months. We sought the      best professional models and practices for policing a divided      society in a democracy. We held meetings not only in Belfast,      Dublin, and London but in New York. Washington, California,      Canada, Belgium, Spain and South Africa. From the beginning,      we met with the police, clergy, politicians, civil-     libertarians and community groups. We went to police      headquarters. We visited every police sub-station in Northern      Ireland. We literally talked to thousands of police officers.       We held 40 hearings throughout Northern Ireland--the first      and only time such a commission went directly to the public.      These hearings were extremely tense. More than 10,000 people      attended. More than 1,000 spoke. Emotions ran high as they      described past cruelties and allegations of murder, torture      and brutality on both sides.       We listened. We heard the pain. We felt the suffering. We      understood the need to move on to a solution to help forge a      future in Northern Ireland that involved more than endless      re-creations of the terrible past.       We realized early in our deliberations that whatever we      recommended would need to pass muster not just in Britain and      Ireland but with police organizations worldwide.       Chris Patten said of his work on the Commission: ``It was      the most difficult, painful, and emotionally draining thing I      have ever done or would ever wish to do.'' I concur      completely.       The Patten report provides a framework on which a police      service built on a foundation of human rights can be      achieved. Again I quote, ``We recommended a comprehensive      program of action to focus policing in Northern Ireland on a      human rights-based approach.       Training will be one of the keys to instilling a human      rights-based approach into both new recruits and experienced      police personnel. We recommend that all police officers, and      police civilians, should be trained . . . in the fundamental      principles and standards of human rights and the practical      implications for policing. . . . We recommend the human      rights dimension should be integrated into every module of      police training''.       Another core issue which has not received the attention of      the media is the Patten Commission's recommendation that a      new police college be established in Northern Ireland.      Central to any organizations ability to imbue its members      with a focus on human rights is a facility at which to      conduct the necessary work and an appropriate curriculum. An      educated police officer is a better police officer.       The Patten Report stated: ``as a matter of priority, . . .      all members of the police service should be instructed in the      implications for policing of the Human Rights Act 1998, and      the wider context of the European Convention on Human Rights      and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human dignity      training, along the lines of that offered by John Jay College      in New York to the New York Police Department and police      services from some fifty countries, should also be provided.      Like community awareness training, human rights and human      dignity should not be seen as an add-on to training, but as a      consideration affecting all aspects of training.'' (Chapter      16.21)       The recommendations of the Patten Commission were      unanimous. It is crucial that the recommendations not be      cherry picked but be implemented in a cohesive and      constructive manner. The people of Northern Ireland deserve      no less than this new beginning for policing. Any significant      modifications will deprive them of this long awaited police      service capable of sustaining support from the community as a      whole.                                  ____    Statement by Martin O'Brien, Committee on the Administration of    Justice, Belfast, Before the U.S. Congress Regarding Policing in               Northern Ireland, Friday, 22 September 2000       Thank you for your invitation to testify today. The      Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) is an      independent human rights organisation which draws its      membership from across the different communities in Northern      Ireland. CAJ works for a just and peaceful society where the      human rights of all are fully protected. In recognition of      its efforts to place human rights at the heart of the peace      process, CAJ was awarded the 1998 Human Rights Prize by the      then 40 Member States of the Council of Europe. We have a      broad remit which covers many conflict-related issues such as      prisoners, emergency law, miscarriages of justice, and also      issues such as fair employment, the rights of women and      children, people with disabilities, and the need for      effective government action to prevent racial discrimination.       Since our foundation in 1981, we have worked consistently      on issues of policing and, as early as 1995, CAJ argued for      an independent international commission to look into future      policing in Northern Ireland. Accordingly we worked hard to      ensure that the establishment of such a body would be      provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. We welcomed the      broad terms of reference given to the Commission by the      Agreement, and sought to work constructively with the      Commission as soon as it came into being, under the      chairmanship of the Chris Patten. We were fortunate in that      we had earlier secured funding from the Ford Foundation and      others to undertake a major comparative research project into      good policing around the world. The findings arising from      that study underpinned all our work with the Commission and      were, we believe--from a reading of the recommendations--     useful to the Commission in its work.       In testimony in September 1999 to Congress on the findings      of the Patten Commission, we concluded that: ``CAJ believes      that, in general terms, the Commission has made a very      genuine and constructive effort to meet the difficult task      imposed on it by the Agreement. They have put forward many      thoughtful and positive recommendations about the way      forward. Most importantly of all, they have recognized (as      did the Agreement itself) that just as human rights must be      at the heart of a just and peaceful society in Northern      Ireland, it must be at the heart of future policing      arrangements.''       CAJ went on, however, to outline for Congress, some of the      serious reservations we, and other human rights groups, had      regarding the omissions from the Patten report. Amongst other      things, we expressed concern as to the feasibility of      bringing about real changes to policing if emergency powers      are still retained, if plastic bullets are still deployed,      and if officers, known to have committed human rights abuses      in the past, remain as serving officers.       Despite these important shortcomings, however, the main      thrust of our submission at that time was to urge Congress to      use its best offices to push for speedy implementation of the      positive recommendations arising from Patten. Though Patten's      recommendations did not address everything that was needed      for genuine change, they gave a clear framework within which      change could occur, and they pointed all those interested in      fundamental reform in the right direction.       Unfortunately, as we said in our earlier testimony      ``implementation is everything'', and in that context, CAJ      must report to Congress our profound disappointment at      developments since the publication of the Patten report. Our      concerns about implementation are twofold. First, many of the      changes Patten called for are long over-due, and speed is of      the essence. Second, and as important, a hesitant or      unwilling approach to major change--which is what we are      experiencing--feeds fears that change will be short-lived,      and indeed will be under-mined over the longer term.       One of the key findings of our earlier international      research was that political will is     always a determining factor in preventing or facilitating      successful change. Initially, it seemed to observers that the      necessary political will did in fact exist within government      for change. Yet, since the publication of the Patten report,      the signs have been ominous.       Patten called for the speedy appointment of an Oversight      Commissioner to oversee the pace and nature of change. The      Commission said ``we believe that a mechanism is needed to      oversee the changes required of all those involved in the      development of the new policing arrangements, and to      assure the community that all aspects of our report are      being implemented and being seen to be implemented''. This      recommendation was accepted by government, but Tom      Constantine was only appointed on 31 May 2000--almost nine      months after the Patten report was published. This tardy      appointment meant that the Commissioner was excluded from      scrutinising the draft legislation, played no part in the      detailed Implementation Plan prepared by the Northern      Ireland Office and the policing establishment, and has      still to appoint staff, take on a public profile, and      produce his first report.       Given this delay, any change that has taken place to date      has been dictated by those who have been responsible for      policing over the last 30 years and who have resisted change      in the past. Only a third or less of Patten's recommendations      resulted in proposals for legislative change, so that the      vast majority of the programme of change has been left to the      discretion of senior civil servants, and the Chief Constable.      Indeed, much of the change--whether in terms of police      training, police re-organisation, or in terms of crucial      decisions relating to Special Branch, detention centres, the      use of plastic bullets, or the extent of stop-and-search      activities--lies largely at the discretion of the Chief      Constable alone. Only with the appointment of a new Policing      Board (the political composition of which is as yet      uncertain), and/or an active and high profile Oversight      Commissioner, will people outside the policing establishment      be able to influence or assess the extent of real change      underway.       The slowness in appointing an external Oversight      Commissioner has left government open to the charge that the      nature and pace of change has been deliberately left in the      hands of those who have so mis-managed policing in the past.      This charge is not easily refuted. A study of the draft      legislation, for example, merely seems to confirm the view      that government is unwilling to put Patten's agenda into      practical effect. The draft legislation first presented to      the House of Commons in May was a very far cry from the      Patten report, and despite much lobbying, and extensive      changes in the course of the parliamentary process to date,      there is still a long way to go. (I would like, with the      Chair's permission, to have read into the record two      commentaries on the legislation. One is a short CAJ briefing      on the major outstanding concerns in the policing      legislation, and the other is a detailed series of amendments      which CAJ believes must be introduced if the legislation is      to faithfully reflect Patten).       Of course, to judge by official government statements, one      would have thought that government was fulfilling Patten in      its first draft legislative text in May. The same claim--to      be fulfilling Patten--was still being asserted in July (when,      by its own admission, it had already made 52 substantive      changes to bring the initial draft in line with Patten).      Further amendments have again been promised in the next few      weeks, prior to the House of Lords debate. However, on the      basis of CAJ's understanding to date, the changes that are to      be offered will still not deliver the Patten agenda.       If government does want to implement Patten, as it says it      does, why is it still resistant to a whole range of important      safeguards which Patten called for? Why is it impossible to      get government agreement to include explicit reference in the      legislation to a broad range of international human rights      norms and standards? What reason can there be for the      government denying any role to the NI Human Rights Commission      in advising on the police use of plastic bullets? Why are      effective inquiry powers for the Policing Board consistently      opposed? Why is the Secretary of State so adamant that the      Police Ombudsperson cannot have the powers to investigate      police policies and practices that Patten called for? Why was      the appointment of the Oversight Commissioner so long      delayed, and why is his term of office so curtailed in the      legislation?       There will be some that claim that government cannot move      fast on certain issues, precisely because Northern Ireland is      divided, and policing is a very divisive issue. While there      are, of course, many contentious issues (the name and      symbols, for example), none of the important issues listed      above divide nationalist and unionist. They do, however,      clearly divide those who want to defend the status quo, from      those who want a police service that is impartial,      representative, and accountable--able and willing to ensure      that the rule of law is upheld.       Some of the obstacles to real change can be detected by a      study of the parliamentary record. A government minister, in      the course of the Commons debate, resisted any amendments      that sought to make policing subject to international      human rights and standards. He said: ``Some appalling      human rights abuses . . . take place around the world.      Those low standards should not be compared with the past      activities of the RUC .  .  . The RUC carried out a      difficult job, often in impossible circumstances. Such      comparisons as might be made in the light of the amendment      could cause unnecessary offense. We might reasonably say      that, against the norms in question, the RUC has a good      record on human rights''. Government appears to reject      out-of-hand the many past reports of the United Nations,      and respected international non-governmental      organizations, which criticised the RUC. This stance      presumably explains the legislation's failure to address      the legacy of the past. Yet, if government is unwilling to      admit past problems, can the necessary change occur?       CAJ's fears about the pace and nature of policing change      are further heightened by the government's approach to the      separate but complementary Chemical Justice Review (also      established as part of the Good Friday Agreement). The      interrelationship between policing and the criminal justice      system is self-evident. Accordingly, it is extremely      disturbing to have to report to Congress that CAJ has serious      concerns about the nature and pace of change proposed in the      criminal justice sphere also. A new appointment system for      judges, changes to the prosecution service, and a re-vamping      of the criminal justice system generally, are long-overdue      changes. The government timetable clearly does not recognise      any urgency; CAJ, however, feels that Northern Ireland cannot      afford any further delay.       Of course, change is inevitably difficult; and change of      the scale and nature required in Northern Ireland is      particularly difficult. We urge the US Congress to use its      best endeavours to lend its support to the UK and Irish      governments as they work, with local politicians, to develop      a more just and peaceful society in Northern Ireland. In      particular, we hope that Congress would work, both directly,      and--as appropriate--in conjunction with the US      Administration, to:       1. Urge the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to amend the draft      legislation to ensure that it reflects both the letter and      spirit of Patten. Urge that the legislation conform in      particular, to Patten's exhortation that ``the fundamental      purpose of policing should be, in the words of the Agreement,      the protection and vindication of the human rights of all''.      Congress should make it clear that future US-UK policing      cooperation is dependent to a large extent on Patten's      recommendations being fully implemented.       2. Congress should urge the UK and Irish governments to      recognise the importance of greater external oversight of the      transition process, and ask that the Oversight Commissioner      be accorded the resources and remit necessary to this vital      work.       3. Congress should commit itself to monitoring developments      closely in the coming months, and urge the US Administration      to do the same. Congress may, for example, want to consider      holding further Hearings in due course to receive a progress      report on developments.       To conclude, I hardly need to remind the Chairperson that,      defence lawyer and CAJ executive member, Rosemary Nelson,      testified before him and other members of Congress on issues      of policing almost two years ago--on the 29 September 1998.       The concerns she raised in her testimony, her terrible      murder a short while later, and the subsequent police      investigation, remind us--if we need reminding--that policing      change in Northern Ireland is not an abstract or intellectual      debate. It is about the lives of real people. We must bring      about policing change in Northern Ireland; and we must ensure      that that change is right.       Everything that the US Congress can do to help those of us      on the ground secure such change will, as always, be greatly      appreciated.       Thank you.                                  ____  Testimony of Elisa Massimino, Director, Washington Office, Lawyers   Committee for Human Rights, on Protecting Human Rights and Securing  Peace in Northern Ireland: the Vital Role of Police Reform, September                                 22, 2000                            I. introduction       Chairman Smith and members of the Commission, thankyou for      inviting me to testify today. You have been a true champion      of human rights in the Congress, and you and your dedicated      staff have done so much to shine a spotlight on human rights      problems in Northern Ireland and around the world. Your      leadership on these issues has made a real difference. We      want to take this opportunity to commend you for this      important work, and to thank you.       The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights has been working to      advance human rights in Northern Ireland since 1990. We have      published a number of reports about the intimidation and      murder of defense lawyers in Northern Ireland, with      particular focus on the cases of solicitors Patrick Finucane      and Rosemary Nelson. As you know well, the precarious      situation of defense lawyers in Northern Ireland is closely      linked to the emergency law system and to the conduct of the      police. For the last year and a half, we have paid special      attention to the peace process in Northern Ireland and, in      particular, the central issue of police reform. We appreciate      the opportunity to be here today to share with you our views      on the status of efforts by the British Government to      implement the recommendations made by the Patten Commission. ii. the patten commission recommendations and the pending Police Bill       The Patten Commission's mandate was as ambitious as it was      critically important to     Northern's Ireland's future. The Good Friday Agreement called      on the Commission to propose a new structure for policing in      Northern Ireland that would make the police service      accountable, representative of the society in policies and      reflective of principles of human rights. (The Agreement,      Policing and Justice, para. 2)       Although we were disappointed that the Patten Commission      did not directly address some key issues, such as the      continued use of emergency powers, which provides the      breeding ground for many of the human rights abuses that      persist in Northern Ireland, we believe that, on the whole,      the Patten Commission successfully integrated human rights      principles into its program for reform. The Patten Commission      Report provides a clear roadmap for building an effective and      publicly-supported police force. If the British Government      were to fully implement the Patten Commission's      recommendations, it could make Northern Ireland a model for      other civil societies transitioning from conflict to peace.       But unfortunately, the British Government has taken a      different path. Despite more than 50 substantive amendments,      the bill now pending in Parliament that is meant to implement      the Patten Commission recommendations falls far short of      doing so. There are serious deficiencies in the legislation      now under consideration, many of which have been discussed in      detail by my colleagues on this panel. But I would like to      highlight three issues regarding the Police Bill that are of      particular concern to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights      because they directly undermine the central principles of      accountability and human rights around which the Patten      Commission recommendations revolve. Last month in a letter      to Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern      Ireland, we raised these and other concerns in detail. I      would like to submit a copy of that letter, dated August      16th, for your review and for the record.     A. Limitations on the policing board and police ombudsman       The Policing Board and the Police Ombudsman are entities      intended to be responsible for monitoring police conduct. The      current Police Bill, however, places crippling limitations on      these bodies that would significantly reduce their      effectiveness. For example, the Bill would undermine the      Policing Board's ability to conduct reviews of ongoing police      operations. Likewise, the Bill fails to clearly provide the      authority for the Police Ombudsman to investigate police      practices and policies, in addition to allegations of past      abuse. A credible system of investigation and inquiry into      alleged abuses and abusive practices is one of the best      guardians against such practices. But if the Police Bill is      approved in its current form, with significant limitations on      the powers of the Policing Board and Ombudsman, the capacity      for creating such a system will be severely limited.     B. The oversight commissioner       Implementation of the Patten Commission reforms was thought      by no one to be a simple task, which is why the position of      Oversight Commissioner was viewed as so important. But the      long delay in appointing an individual to serve in that post,      and the limitations that have been placed on his mandate,      create formidable barriers to his effectiveness. In part due      to the delay in his appointment, the Oversight Commissioner      has played no role in the process of drafting the Police      Bill. The British Government published its Implementation      Plan before the Oversight Commissioner was even appointed;      the RUC likewise came up with its own ``Programme for      Change'' with no input from the Oversight Commissioner. These      two documents, which purport to guide the implementation of      the Patten Commission recommendations, appear now to be the      measuring stick by which the Oversight Commissioner intends      to judge implementation. And yet these plans--the      Government's and the RUC's--do not themselves fully implement      the Patten Commission recommendations. This seems to us to      relegate the role of the Oversight Commissioner to that of      making sure that the police follow through on the changes      they decide they want to undertake--a far cry from ensuring      that the Patten Commission reforms are truly implemented.     C. Reference to international human rights standards       Although the British Government has repeatedly asserted      that it ``recognizes the importance of human rights,'' its      ongoing resistance to inserting reference to international      human rights standards into the language of the Police Bill      raises serious questions. The conduct of police in Northern      Ireland has been the subject of numerous reports by non-     governmental human rights organizations and UN bodies,      including by Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, the UN Special      Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers. Many of      these reports have concluded that police conduct in Northern      Ireland violates internationally recognized human rights      standards. Chairman Patten, in his statement accompanying the      release of the Commission's report, highlighted the central      importance of human rights standards to the Commission's      approach to police reform: ``We recommend a comprehensive      programme of action to focus on policing in Northern Ireland      on a human rights-based approach. We see the upholding of      fundamental human rights as the very purpose of policing, and      we propose that it should be instilled in all officers from      the start--in the oath they take, in their training, and in      their codes of practice and in their performance appraisal      system.'' In light of this clear statement of the human      rights foundations of the Patten Commission's      recommendations, the failure to incorporate reference to      international human rights standards into the Police Bill is      striking.       The failure of the British Government to adequately address      these concerns with the Police Bill, combined with the slow      pace of other reform measures, has already led to an erosion      of confidence in the ongoing process and doubts about the      Government's intentions. Many who support reform have begun      to wonder whether the Government is abandoning its stated      intention to fully implement the Patten Commission      recommendations. This perception will have serious      consequences for the long-term prospects for peace. For      example, under the Patten Commission proposals, 600 police      officers were supported to volunteer to retire by the end of      next month. This proposal was based on the assumption that      adequate compensation would be offered as an incentive to      retire. But so far, only 91 officers have come forward to      volunteer. According to a Police Federation spokesman quoted      in a recent article in the Daily Telegraph, the Government      has stated that no officer should benefit beyond the sum they      would earn if they remained on the force. When the Police      Federation asked the Government what incentive this would      give officers to retire, they were not given a credible      answer. I would ask that a copy of this September 10th      article be included in the record of this hearing.                  iii. breaking the cycle of impunity       As so many societies transitioning from conflict to peace      have learned, building a culture of human rights and      accountability will require having a process for addressing      past violations. Because we believe that future progress in      developing a rights-sensitive police force in Northern      Ireland depends on breaking the existing cycle of impunity,      we urged the Patten Commission to make recommendations to the      British Government in two specific cases: the 1989 murder of      Patrick Finucane and the murder of Rosemary Nelson last year.      We regret that the Commission's report was silent with      respect to these cases. While we understand Mr. Patten's      conclusion that the Commission's work was ``forward-     looking,'' our own experience in situations such as these has      been that societies cannot reconcile until the legacy of past      abuses is squarely confronted. Although it is clear that not      all of these abuses can be addressed or rectified, there are      certain cases that embody the most profoundly entrenched      practices and problems that the peace process seeks to      overcome. If a solid foundation for the future is to be laid,      these cases must be resolved.       For this reason, we urge the Helsinki Commission to      continue its vigilant attention to the Finucane and Nelson      case, at the same time as it examines broader reforms      proposed by the Patten Commission. Because I know you      share our keen interest in these two cases, Chairman      Smith, I will devote the remainder of my testimony to      summarizing the current status of those cases.     A. Patrick Finucane       Now is a critical moment in the struggle for justice in the      Finucane case. As you know, the Lawyers Committee has done      extensive research into the circumstances surrounding the      murder and has concluded that there is compelling evidence to      suggest that British Army intelligence and the RUC were      complicit in the murder. Three weeks ago, Prime Minister Tony      Blair met with the family of Mr. Finucane. The meeting was      brokered by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who himself endorsed an      independent inquiry after meeting with the Finucane family in      February. During that meeting, Mr. Ahern was provided with a      new report by British Irish Rights Watch (BIRW) that details      further credible evidence of collusion. Although the same      report was provided to the British Government, there has yet      to be a reply to the substance of the allegations in the      report.       Nonetheless, during the meeting this month with Prime      Minister Blair, members of the Finucane family, along with      Paul Mageean from CAJ and Jane Winter from BIRW, presented      the BIRW report and other information supporting the      allegation of official collusion in the murder of Mr.      Finucane. Mr. Blair appeared to be deeply concerned by the      allegations and pledged that he would read and consider all      the evidence. He conveyed to the Finucane family that he      ``personally'' wants to know if the allegations are true and      would put anyone guilty of collusion ``out of a job.''       On September 8th, we wrote a letter to Prime Minister Blair      to urge him to authorize an independent inquiry. As we stated      in the letter, ``We firmly believe that such an independent      public inquiry will serve both to help learn the truth about      the circumstances surrounding the murder and to publicly      confirm [the British] government's commitment to establishing      official accountability for human rights abuses.'' I have      included a copy of our letter to Prime Minister Blair with my      testimony and ask that it be included in the record.       Establishment of an independent inquiry would be a      significant breakthrough, and we urge you, Chairman Smith,      and your colleagues in the Congress to do all you can to      encourage Mr. Blair to make this decision.       A look at the current status of the Stevens investigation      reveals how desperately necessary such an independent inquiry      is in this case. The current 18 month-long inquiry is the      third such investigation by Mr. Stevens, who began the first      of these investigations in 1990.       As we have testified previously, we believe the Steven's      investigation is inadequate and lacks the capacity to uncover      the truth about allegations of official collusion in the      murder. As you may recall, we reported to you last March that      Mr. Steven had arrested and brought murder charges against      William Stobie, a former UDA quartermaster who worked or RUC      Special Branch, in June 1999. At Mr. Stobie's bail hearing,      lawyer for the Crown told the high court that recent      statements made by journalist Neil Mulholland led to Stobie's      arrest. However, Mr. Stobie's lawyer revealed at the bail      hearing that Stobie had been interviewed in 1990 for more      than 40 hours by members of the RUC Special Branch. These      interviews, which included Stobie's confession to supplying      the weapons used in the murder, were transcribed and have      been available to the authorities since 1990. Among other      things, these notes identify the names of the members of the      RUC Special Branch who had been warned about the murder. At      that time, the authorities never charged Stobie with murder,      and the Director of Public Prosecutions dropped unrelated      firearms charges against him in 1991.       Since the last congressional hearing into these matters,      the charges against Mr. Stobie have been lessened to aiding      and abetting murder. We have also learned that a key witness      in the prosecution of Mr. Stobie may no longer be available      and the charges against Mr. Stobie may be dropped entirely.      If brought to trial, Mr. Stobie reportedly intends to reveal      the full extent of the RUC's involvement in the murder of Mr.      Finucane.       This past August, Mr. Steven's team, now directed by      Commander Hugh Orde, seized thousands of intelligence      documents from British army headquarters revealing new      evidence of Loyalist and military collusion in the murder of      Mr. Finucane that reportedly will be used to arrest new      suspects. This new development contrasts with the 1995      decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to      prosecute anyone from the military. This decision was reached      despite evidence of collusion arising out of information      relating to Brian Nelson, a double agent recruited by British      Army Intelligence while he served as chief intelligence      officer for the Ulster Defense Association. The recent      discovery of these intelligence documents also suggests the      involvement of Brigadier John Gordon Kerr. Mr. Kerr, now a      British military attache in Beijing, oversaw Brian Nelson at      the time of the Finucane murder and allegedly gave testimony      during the inquest of Mr. Finucane under the pseudonym      Colonel J.       Despite compelling evidence that appears to suggest the      identities of the intellectual authors of the murder, the      Stevens inquiry continues to drag on. Establishment of an      independent inquiry would finally ensure that the allegations      of official collusion in the murder are squarely addressed.     B. Rosemary Nelson       In addition to the Finucane case, the Lawyers Committee      also believes that the British Government should authorize an      independent inquiry into the murder of defense lawyer      Rosemary Nelson. We view resolution of her case as essential      to the success of new accountability mechanisms in Northern      Ireland.       As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, Loyalist paramilitaries      claimed responsibility for the murder of Rosemary Nelson, who      was killed by a car bomb on March 15, 1999. Prior to her      death, Ms. Nelson received numerous death threats,      including those made by RUC officers relayed through her      clients. Ms. Nelson never received government protection      despite many appeals made to the Northern Ireland Office      and the RUC to protect her life, including those made by      Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, United Nations Special Rapporteur      on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers. During the time      that Ms. Nelson became a target of official harassment,      she herself became an outspoken critic of the RUC, and,      thanks to you Chairman Smith, was able to bring her case      all the way to the U.S. Congress. At that time, she      expressed deep fear regarding her safety and that of her      family.       The current criminal investigation of Ms. Nelson's murder      is lead by London detective Colin Port and has been underway      for almost a year and a half. To date, the investigation team      has taken 1,700 statements, spoken to more than 7,000      potential witnesses and unearthed 7,000 lines of inquiry, but      has yet to charge anyone in connection with the murder.      Because Mr. Port's investigation is limited to the specific      circumstances of the murder, we do not believe that his team      can effectively address the larger issue of who authored the      crime and whether official collusion was involved.      Furthermore, Mr. Port does not address the threats made      against Ms. Nelson by RUC officers, and this practice      continues today.       In the past we have expressed concern regarding the British      Government's inadequate response to Ms. Nelson's situation,      not only regarding the failure to provide her protection but      also to discipline those officers alleged to have harassed      her. We believe that both of these issues must be addressed      if the new accountability structures established by the      Police Bill are to be effective.       In particular, the new Police Ombudsmen office must be able      to have full power and independence to investigate complaints      against the new police force. As we have shared with you in      previous testimonies, the RUC's investigation into Ms.      Nelson's complaints were found to be inadequate and      unsatisfactory by the Independent Commission for Police      Complaints (ICPC). The file sent to the Director of Public      Prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to support      prosecution or discipline and these officers still serve as      police officers. Colleagues of Ms. Nelson viewed hers as the      ``test case,'' and Ms. Nelson allegedly filed her complaint      to test the adequacy of the system. To be effective, the new      Ombudsman will have the added challenge of proving to those      subject to police harassment that they can place their      confidence in the investigation mechanism.       Our deep concern regarding accountability mechanisms in      Northern Ireland has intensified since we recently learned      that another lawyer was under threat and has been the target      of harassment and threats by the RUC. Solicitor Padraigan      Drinan was Rosemary Nelson's colleague and took on some of      Ms. Nelson's cases after her death. To those who want to      focus on the future, I would like to emphasize that today      that the British government still has the opportunity to      avert another tragedy. But it must make sure that it learns      the lesson from past errors and uses them to correct a system      that has completely failed to protect its citizens against      police abuse.                             iv. conclusion       Lasting peace cannot take hold in Northern Ireland until      the British Government demonstrates the willingness and      ability to secure justice for the families of Rosemary Nelson      and Patrick Finucane and a commitment to creating a      representative and accountable police force for Northern      Ireland's future. Thank you.                                  ____           Why Failing to Implement the Patten Report Matters                     (By Professor Brendan O'Leary)     The present political position in Northern Ireland       The Belfast Agreement of April 10, 1998 was a major      achievement (O'Leary 1999a). Novel institution-building was      flanked by peace and confidence-building processes involving      cease-fires by paramilitary organisations, the release of      their incarcerated prisoners, and commitments to protect      human rights, entrench equality, demilitarise the region,      assist in decommissioning by the proxies of paramilitaries,      and the reform of the administration of justice and policing.       Implementing the Agreement was always going to be      difficult. But as I deliver this testimony just four items,      all in the domain of confidence-building, await full or      effective beginnings in implementation. These are:       1. Decommissioning by republican and loyalist      paramilitaries;       2. The reform of the system of criminal justice;       3. Demilitarization; and       4. Policing reform.       These items are inter-linked. Full demilitarization and      full decommissioning are mutually interdependent.      Decommissioning--the timetable for which has been postponed      by the agreement of the parties who made the Agreement--is      seen in republican circles as conditional on the UK      government fulfilling its public promises to implement the      Patten Report. A specific promise is said to have been given      to that effect in Spring 2000--amidst negotiations that      linked police reform, decommissioning and the lifting of the      suspension of the Agreement's institutions unilaterally      imposed by the UK Secretary of State in February (a measure      that in many eyes breached international law).       The UK government states that it is implementing the Patten      Report in full. Indeed its Prime Minister, the Secretary of      State for Northern Ireland, and the Explanatory Notes issued      by the Northern Ireland Office accompanying the Police Bill      currently before the UK Parliament, flatly declare their      intention to give effect to the recommendations of the Patten      Commission. That has not been true, and is still manifestly      not true.       In contrast the UK government often implies, usually in      off-the-record briefings, that it cannot implement the Patten      Report in full because of the `security situation'. This more      honest position, albeit in dissembling contradiction with its      official one, would have credibility if the necessary      preparatory legislative and managerial steps to implement      Patten in full when the security situation is satisfactory      had been taken. They have not.     Why the Patten Report was necessary, and its recommendations       Policing has been so controversial that the parties to the      Agreement could not concur on future arrangements (McGarry      and O'Leary 1999). The former Irish prime minister, Dr.      Garret FitzGerald, has described policing in Northern Ireland      as having the status of Jerusalem in the Israeli-Palestinian      peace process (FitzGerald 2000). The parties did agree the      terms of reference of an Independent Commission on policing,      eventually chaired by Christopher Patten, a former      Conservative minister in the region and now a European      Commissioner.       To have effective police rooted in, and legitimate with,      both major communities was vital to the new settlement. It      would persuade all citizens that law enforcement     would be applied impartially, help extirpate that species of      paramilitarism that is becoming an exclusively criminal      enterprise, and foster a law-abiding climate in which to      conduct business.       Eight criteria for policing arrangements were mandated in      the Belfast Agreement. They were to be:       1. Impartial;       2. Representative;       3. Free from partisan political control;       4. Efficient and effective;       5. Infused with a human rights culture;       6. Decentralised;       7. Democratically accountable `at all levels'; and       8. Consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Belfast      Agreement.       The Patten Commission engaged in extensive research and      interaction with the affected parties, interest groups and      citizens, and published its report in September 1999. It did      not, and could not, meet the hopes, or match the fears, of      all; but the Commissioners, a distinguished and      representative array of domestic and international personnel,      undoubtedly met the terms of reference of the Agreement      (O'Leary 1999b).       The Patten Report was a thorough, careful and imaginative      compromise between unionists who maintained that the existing      RUC already met the terms of reference of the Agreement and      those nationalists, especially republicans, who maintained      that the RUC's record mandated its disbanding. The Report was      not, however, simply designed to address the concerns of      policing Northern Ireland. It applied state-of-the-art      managerial and democratic thinking in its recommendations      (O'Leary 1999b).       The UK Government welcomed the Patten Report and promised      to implement it. However the Police Bill presented to      Parliament in the Spring of 2000 was an evisceration of      Patten, and condemned as such by the SDLP, Sinn Fein, the      Womens' Coalition, the Catholic Church, non-governmental and      human rights organizations, such as the Committee on the      Administration of Justice. It was also criticized by the      Irish Government, the U.S. House of Representatives (H. Res.      447, 106th Congress), and a range of Irish Americans,      including apparently, President Clinton.       To demonstrate the veracity of the critics' complaints let      me briefly compare some of Patten's recommendations with the      original Bill.       Impartiality: Patten recommended a neutral name, the      Northern Ireland Police Service. The Royal Ulster      Constabulary was not a neutral title so it was recommended to      go, period. Patten also recommended that the display of the      Union flag and the portrait of the Queen at police stations      should go--symbols in his view should be `free from      association with the British or Irish states'. These      recommendations were a consequence of Patten's terms of      reference, and of the Agreement's explicit commitment to      establishing `parity of esteem' between the national      traditions, and the UK's solemn commitment to `rigorous      impartiality' in its administration.       The original Bill proposed that the Secretary of State have      the power to decide on the issues of names and emblems, and      thereby ignored Patten's explicit recommendations.       Representativeness: Patten recommended affirmative action      to change rapidly the proportion of cultural Catholics in the      police, and envisaged a programme of at least ten-years. Even      critics of affirmative action recognized the need to correct      the existing imbalance--in which over 90 per cent of the      police are local cultural Protestants.       The original Bill reduced the period in which the police      would be recruited on a 50:50 ratio of cultural Catholics and      cultural Protestants to three years, requiring the Secretary      of State to make any extension, and was silent on      `aggregation', Patten's proposed policy for shortfalls in the      recruitment of suitably qualified cultural Catholics.       Freedom for partisan control. Patten proposed a Policing      Board consisting of 10 representatives from political      parties, in proportion to their shares of seats on the      Executive, and 9 members nominated by the First and Deputy      First Ministers. These recommendations guaranteed a      politically representative board in which neither unionists      nor nationalists would have partisan control.       The original Bill introduced a requirement that the Board      should operate according to a weighted majority when      recommending an inquiry. Given known political dispositions      this was tantamount to giving unionist and unionist-nominated      members a veto over inquiries, i.e. partisan political      control, and therefore a direct violation of Patten's terms      of reference.       Efficient and effective policing. Patten avoided false      economies when recommending a down-sizing of the service,      advocated a strong Board empowered to set performance      targets, and proposed enabling local District Policing      Partnership Boards to engage in the market-testing of police      effectiveness.       The original Bill empowered the Secretary of State, not the      Board, to set performance targets, made no statutory      provision for disbanding the police reserve, and deflated the      proposed District Policing Partnership Boards--apparently      because of assertions that they would lead to paramilitaries      being subsidized by tax-payers.       Human Rights Culture. Patten proposed that new and serving      officers should have knowledge of human rights built into      their training, and re-training, and their codes of practice.      In addition to the European Convention, due to become part of      UK domestic law, the Commission held out international norms      as benchmarks: ``compliance . . . with international human      rights standards . . . are . . . an important safeguard both      to the public and to police officers carrying out their      duties'' (Patten, 1999, para 5.17). Patten's proposals for      normalizing the police--through dissolving the special branch      into criminal investigations--and demilitarizing the police      met the Agreement's human rights objectives.       The original Bill was a parody of Patten. The new oath was      to be confined to new officers. No standards of rights higher      than those in the European Convention were to be incorporated      into police training and practice. Responsibility for a Code      of Ethics was left with the Chief Constable. It explicitly      excluded Patten's proposed requirement that the oath of      service `respect the traditions and beliefs of people'.      Normalization and demilitarization were left unclear in the      Bill and the Implementation Plan.       Decentralization: Patten envisaged enabling local      governments to influence the Policing Board through their own      District Policing Partnership Boards, and giving the latter      powers `to purchase additional services from the police or      statutory agencies, or from the private sector', and matching      police internal management units to local government      districts.       The original Bill, by contrast, maintained or strengthened      centralization in several ways. The Secretary of State      obtained powers that Patten had proposed for the First and      Deputy First Ministers and the Board, and powers to issue      instructions to District Policing Partnership Boards; and      neither the Bill nor the Implementation Plan contained clear      plans to implement the proposed experiment in community      policing.       Democratic Accountability. Patten envisaged a strong,      independent and powerful Board to hold the police to account,      and to replace the existing and discredited Police Authority      (Patten, 1999:para 6.23), and recommended an institutional      design to ensure that policing would be the responsibility of      a plurality of networked organizations rather than the      monopoly of a police force. The police would have      `operational responsibility' but be held to account by a      powerful Board, and required to interact with the Human      Rights Commission, the Ombudsman and the Equality Commission.       The Bill radically watered down Patten's proposals,      empowering the Secretary of State to oversee and veto the      Board's powers, empowering the Chief Constable to refuse to      respond to reasonable requests from the Board, preventing the      Board from making inquiries into past misconduct, and      obligating it to have a weighted majority before inquiring      into present or future misconduct. Astonishingly this led the      existing discredited Policing Authority, correctly, to      condemn the Bill, a response that no one could have predicted      when the UK Government welcomed Patten.       Matching the Agreement? Patten was consistent with the      terms of reference and spirit of the Belfast Agreement. The      original Bill was not, being incompatible with the `parity of      esteem' and `rigorous impartiality' in administration      promised by the UK Government. Manifestly it could not      encourage `widespread community support' since it fell far      short of the compromise that moderate nationalists had      accepted and that Patten had proposed to mark a `new      beginning'.       Waiting for Explanations. What explains the radical      discrepancy between Patten and the original Bill?       The short answer is that the Bill was drafted by the      Northern Ireland Office's officials under Secretary of State      Peter Mandelson's supervision. They appeared to `forget' that      the terms of reference came from the Belfast Agreement, and      that Patten's recommendations represented a careful and      rigorous compromise between unionists and nationalists.      Indeed they appear to have treated the Patten Report as a      nationalist report which they should appropriately modify as      benign mediators.       Even though Patten explicitly warned against `cherry-     picking' the Secretary of State and his officials believed      that they had the right to implement what they found      acceptable, and to leave aside what they found unacceptable,      premature, or likely to cause difficulties for pro-Agreement      unionists or the RUC.       The Bill suggested that the UK government was:       Determined to avoid the police being subject to rigorous      democratic accountability,       Deeply distrustful of the capacity of the local parties to      manage policing at any level, and       Concerned to minimise the difficulties that the partial      implementation of Patten would occasion for First Minister      David Trimble and his party, the Ulster Unionists, by      mininising radical change and emphasising the extent to which      the `new' service would be a mere reform of the RUC.       Under pressure the UK Government has retreated: whether to      a position prepared in advance only others can know, but      skilled political management is not something I shall      criticise it for.       From Evisceration to `Patten Light'. Accusing its critics      of `hype', `rhetoric' and`hyerbole' the UK Government      promised to `listen' and to modify the Bill. Mr. Mandelson      declared that he might have been too cautious in the powers      granted the Policing Board. Indeed the Government was      subsequently to accept over 60 SDLP-driven     amendments to bring the Bill more into line with Patten.      This, of course, demonstrated that its original `spin' had      been a lie. Since the Bill was so extensively modified--as      the Government now proudly advertises--it confirms that the      original Bill was radically defective in relation to its      declared objectives, for reasons that remain unexplained.       The Bill was improved in the Commons Committee stage, but      insufficiently. The quota for the recruitment of cultural      Catholics is now better protected. The Policing Board has      been given power over the setting of short-run objectives,      and final responsibility for the police's code of ethics.      Consultation procedures involving the Ombudsman and the      Equality Commission have been strengthened, and the First and      Deputy First Ministers will now be consulted over the      appointment of non-party members to the Board. The weighted      majority provisions for an inquiry by the Board have gone,      replaced by the lower hurdle of an absolute majority.       Yet any honest external appraisal of the modified Bill must      report that it is still not the whole Patten. If the first      draft eviscerated Patten, the latest version of presents a      mostly bloodless ghost. The modified Bill rectifies some of      the more overt deviations from Patten, but on the crucial      issues of police accountability and ensuring a `new      beginning' it remains at odds with Patten's explicit      recommendations.       As the Bill is about to recommence its progress through the      Lords, the UK Government has started to shift its public      relations. The new line is that the `full Patten' would      render the police less effective, e.g., in dealing with      criminal paramilitarism. The implication is that anyone who      disagrees must be soft on crime (and its paramilitary      causes). The new line lacks credibility: Patten combined `the      new public management' and democratic values in a rigorous      formula to ensure no trade-off between effectiveness and      accountability.       Let me identify just some of the outstanding respects in      which the modified Bill fails to implement Patten.       Oversight Commissioner. Patten recommended an Oversight      Commissioner to `supervise the implementation of our      recommendations'. The UK Government has--under pressure--put      the commissioner's office on a statutory basis, which it did      not intend to do originally, but has confined his role to      overseeing changes `decided by the Government'. If Mr.      Mandelson and his colleagues were committed to Patten they      would charge the Commissioner with recommending, now or in      the future, any legislative and management changes necessary      for the full and effective implementation of the Patten      Report. That he refuses to do so speaks volumes. In addition      the Commissioner's role currently remains poorly specified.      Since the Commissioner is a former US policeman. American      government pressure might appropriately be directed towards      explicitly giving his office the remit that Patten envisaged.       Policing Board. Patten recommended a Policing Board to hold      the police to account, and to initiate inquiries into police      conduct and practices. Mr. Mandelson has prevented the Board      from inquiring into any act or omission arising before the      eventual Act applies (clause 58 (11) of the Bill). I believe      that this is tantamount to an undeclared amnesty for past      police misconduct, not proposed by Patten. Personally I would      not object to an open amnesty, but this step is dishonest,      and makes it much less likely that `rotten apples' will be      rooted out, as promised.       The Secretary of State will now have the extraordinary      power to prevent inquiries by the Board because they `would      serve no useful purpose', a power added at the Report stage      in the Commons--needless to say not in Patten. The only      rational explanation for this power is that the Government      has chosen to compensate itself for the concessions it made      in the Commons Committee when it expanded the Board's remit      to be more in line with Patten. So what it has given with one      hand, on the grounds that it had been too cautious, it has      taken away with two clumsy feet.       The Secretary of State will additionally have the authority      to approve or veto the person appointed to conduct any      inquiry (clause 58 (9)). And he intends having power to order      the Chief Constable to take steps in the interests of      economy, efficiency, and effectiveness, whereas Patten      envisaged this role for the Board.       The UK Government suggests its critics are petty. Its line      is `Look how much we have done to implement Patten, and how      radical Patten is by comparison with elsewhere'. This `spin'      is utterly unconvincing. The proposed arrangements would      effectively seal off past, present and future avenues through      which the police might be held to account for misconduct;      they are recipes for leaving them outside the effective ambit      of the law, and of managerial scrutiny.       And be it noted: Patten is not radical, especially not by      the standards of North America. Canada and the USA have long      made their police democratically accountable and socially      representative. Patten is only radical by the past standards      of Northern Ireland.       Ombudsman. Patten recommended that the Ombudsman should      have significant powers (Patten, 1999, para 6.42) and should      `exercise the right to investigate and comment on police      policies and practices', whereas in the modified Bill the      Ombudsman may make reports, but not investigate (so it is not      a crime to obstruct her work). The Ombudsman is additionally      restricted in her retrospective powers (clause 62), once      again circumscribing the police's accountability for past      misconduct.       Name and Symbols. Patten wanted a police rooted in both      communities, not just one. That is why he recommended that      the name of the service be entirely new: The Northern Ireland      Police Service.       The Bill, as a result of a Government decision to accept an      amendment tabled by the Ulster Unionist Party, currently      styles the service `The Police Service of Northern Ireland      (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary)'. The Secretary      of State promised an amendment to define `for operational      purposes'--to ensure that the full title would rarely be      used, and that the parenthetic past generally be excluded. He      broke this commitment at Report Stage.       Secretary of State Mandelson has been mendaciously      misleading in declaring that he is merely following Patten's      wishes that the new service be connected to the old and avoid      suggestions of disbanding. This line is a characteristic      half-truth: Patten proposed an entirely new and fresh name,      and proposed linkages between the old and new services      through police memorials, and not the re-naming proposed by      Ken Maginnis, MP, Security Spokesman for the Ulster Unionist      Party.       Patten unambiguously recommended that the police's new      badge and emblems be free of association with the British or      Irish states, and that the Union flag should not fly from      police buildings. The Bill postpones these matters.       Why do these symbolic issues matter? Simply because the      best way to win widespread acceptance for police reform is to      confirm Patten's promised new beginning by following his      proposed strategy of symbolic neutrality. Full re-naming and      symbolic neutrality would spell a double message: that the      new police is to be everyone's police, and the new police is      no longer to be primarily the unionists' police. This      symbolic shift would mightily assist in obtaining      representative cultural Catholic recruitment and in winning      consent for the new order amongst nationalists as well as      unionists. Not to follow Patten's recommendations in these      respects would also spell a double message: that the new      police is merely the old RUC re-touched, and remains a police      linked more to British than Irish identity, i.e. a recipe for      the status quo ante.       Consuequences of Failing to Implement Patten in Full.      Unless the UK Government makes provision for Patten to be      fully implemented, there will be grave consequences.       Disaster may come in two forms. Its weakest form is taking      shape. The SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Catholic Church are most      unlikely to recommend that their constituents consider      joining the police, and may well boycott the Policing Board      and District Policing Partnership Boards. That will leave the      police without Patten's promised `new beginning', lacking      full legitimacy with just less than half of the local      electorate, an institutional booby-trap.       We must not forget that over three hundred police were      killed in the current conflict, but we must also not forget      that the outbreak of armed conflict in 1969 was partly caused      by an unreformed, half-legitimate police service, responsible      for seven of the first eight deaths.       In its strongest form disaster would de-couple nationalists      and republicans from the Agreement, and bring down its      political institutions. Failure to deliver Patten will mean      that Sinn Fein will find it extremely difficult to get the      IRA to go further in decommissioning. The argument will be:      `The UK Government has reneged on a fundamental commitment      under the Agreement so why should republicans disarm and      leave people to be policed by an unreformed service?' In turn      that will lead to unionist calls for the exclusion of Sinn      Fein from ministerial office, and to a repeat of Mr.      Trimble's gambit used earlier this year: `decommission now or      I'll resign now'.       The day before I flew to Washington I was in Northern      Ireland and watched Mr. Trimble in effect repeat this threat      in the Assembly under challenge from his hard-line unionist      opponents. If decommissioning does not happen because of      Secretary of State Mandelson's failure to deliver fully on      Patten, the SDLP will not be able or willing to help      prioritize decommissioning, unless it prefers electoral      suicide. The IRA will find it difficult to prevent further      departures to the Real and Continuity IRAs, except by      refusing to budge on arms. In turn that will at some stage      prompt a resignation threat from the First Minister. In      short, a second collapse of the Agreement's institutions      looms.       This vista and worse can and must be avoided.     Final thoughts and answers       It may be thought: ``Is this analysis partisan?''; and ``Is      not Mr. Mandelson's conduct designed to help Mr. Trimble who      is in a precarious position?''       My answer to the first question is `no'. I have a long      record of advocating bi-national resolutions of the conflict      that are fair to both nationalists and unionists.       The answer to the second question must be a very qualified      `yes'. `Saving David Trimble' may account for Mr. Mandelson's      tampering with Patten's proposals on symbolic matters. But it      does not account for his evisceration of the efforts to have      a more accountable and human-rights infused service--here the      Secretary of State has succumbed to lobbying by security      officials.       Another answer to the second question is more      straightforward: Mr. Mandelson must not unilaterally abandon      or re-negotiate the Agreement or the work of Commissions sent      up under the Agreement at the behest of any party.       A third answer I would propose is that pro-Agreement      unionists can, eventually, accept the full Patten, because      they know that a legitimate and effective police is necessary      to reconcile nationalists to the continuation of the Union--     the reason they signed the Agreement.       Lastly, I believe that the Patten Report is not only what      Mr. Mandelson should fully implement under the Agreement as      proof of rigorous impartiality in his administration, but      also what he should implement even if there were to be no      Agreement.
