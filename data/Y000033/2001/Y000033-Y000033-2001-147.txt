Mr. Chairman, this is especially for a point of clarification.  The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) was asked a question about section 108, and the implication was that only passengers and bags would be screened.  Section 108 in the gentleman's substitute requires screening of all cargo and also the mail. Also in section 131 on page 75, that section requires private plane owners to screen their passengers and bags if the plane is more than 12,500 pounds.  So I just want to make it perfectly clear for the record that the answer the gentleman from Minnesota gave to the gentleman who asked it was incorrect.
