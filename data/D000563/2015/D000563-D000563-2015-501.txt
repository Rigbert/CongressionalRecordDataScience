President, I am proud to introduce a bill today along with Senator Baldwin that will help veterans and the men and women who care for them. Called the CaregiversExpansion and Improvement Act, it would open the VA Family Caregivers Program to all eligible veterans who were severely injured while serving our country.  I introduced legislation creating the Family Caregiver Program in 2009 so caregivers of severely injured veterans could take care of our heroes at home. The program provides home health training, peer support, and a small financial stipend to caregivers of severely injured veterans. The caregivers also have access to mental health support and enrollment in the VA's Civilian Health and Mental Program, if they are not already eligible.  When the Caregivers Program was created, we had to limit eligibility for the program to post-9/11 veterans. It has been wildly successful. Twenty thousand veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan participate in the program today. This is more than five times the number the VA originally estimated would sign up. The program helps caregivers, who shoulder the cost of homecare, know they are not alone.  Since introducing the Caregivers Program 6 years ago, I have gotten to know many caregivers in my State. One family who lives in Chicago, Dan and Trish Sylvester, made a lasting impression on me. Trish, a veteran of the Iraq war, is 100 percent disabled due to severe PTSD. It can be triggered by anything from a backfiring car to simply a bad thought running through her head. Dan, who is a veteran himself, graduated from DePaul Law School last year and now practices law part time.  Today, as he did all through law school, Dan takes care of Trish, making sure she stays on top of all her medications and going with her to counseling appointments. Trish's symptoms first took hold in February 2011, and she was hospitalized multiple times.  The Sylvesters' found out about the Family Caregiver Program shortly after it was launched and applied with the help of a Jesse Brown VA employee named Erica. They use the Caregivers stipend to pay for counseling services that are not provided by the VA. The money also helped them avoid having to take out more in student loans than they had to and kept Dan from having to add a part-time job to his already full plate when he was a student. Dan says the resources available to him through the program are lifesavers.  Both Trish and Dan showed courage in serving our country. Their sacrifice didn't end after their deployments. They continue to show great courage every day that they work together on Trish's recovery.  The bill Senator Baldwin and I are introducing today would allow eligible veterans from all wars to apply for the VA Family Caregivers Program. The VA has estimated that as many as 88,000 additional veteran caregivers could qualify for the program under this bill.  Not only does the program allow veterans to stay in their homes with their families, it is a money-saver for taxpayers. The VA spends an average of $332,000 per veteran per year in VA nursing homes. It spends an average of $88,000 per veteran per year in community nursing homes. It also spends about $45,000 a year in per diem payments to veterans in State Veterans Homes. Through the Caregivers Program, the VA cost per veteran per year is about $36,000. This includes the stipend, which averages between $600 and $2,250 a month, based on the level of care and the geographic location, and services provided to the caregiver. It is an enormous savings to the VA, when you consider the cost of the alternative, full-time, institutional care. And it's a tremendous comfort to the veterans and the caregivers who look after them.  I commend each of the caregivers who have made the decision to care for our heroes. These veterans sacrificed their health and well-being for their country, and their caregivers have sacrificed much of their own lives, careers, school, retirement, to care for them upon their return home. We owe each and every one of them a great debt of gratitude. We want to make sure all qualified family caregivers are enrolled in this program.  With this bill, we are on the way to helping many families in need. We can finally provide assistance to the caregivers of Veterans of all eras on an equal basis.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 657       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
