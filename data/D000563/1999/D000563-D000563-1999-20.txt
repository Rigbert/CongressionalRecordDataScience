At juvenile justice facilities across America, whether in the courts or in the correctional system, we will generally find the kids who are there dropped out of high school. Having dropped out, with time on their hands and no skills to get a job, many of them veered toward drugs and crime and a life that is not productive.  We end up paying for that over and over and over and over again. The old saying about an ounce of prevention is true. The Senator from Nevada has been a leader on this, telling the Nation we have to look at high schooldropouts not just as a sad reality but as a challenge to all to do better.  I look at some of the things I have learned recently about the American workforce. When I visited Dell Computer in Austin, TX, last week and talked to their officers and leaders in their company, they said they hired some 6,000 people in the previous 3 months to work for Dell Computer in Austin and Nashville, TN. I find their complaint or request similar to those I have heard in Illinois. We can't find enough skilled workers. That says to me that our educational system has to be better, it can't let any child fall behind and be forgotten. We have to address dropouts. We have to address skilled training. We have to address the kind of educational reform that goes way beyond the question about who wears a uniform to school and who doesn't. But we haven't done it in this Congress.  I am glad the Senator from Nevada has been a leader on this issue of dropout.
