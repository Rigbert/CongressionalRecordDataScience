I pledge to work with you on all matters affecting our Nation and my home State of Alaska.  I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues, and the United States Postal Service (USPS), which receives a certain level of federal funding for forgone revenue due to free and reduced rate mail under the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Title of the appropriations package, an issue that is critical to safe and stable passenger air service in Alaska.  Alaska is unique in comparison to other States within our Union in that we have special mail service to provide roughly the equivalent of universal postal service, on par with the rest of the country, to remote Alaskan communities throughout my State which are not connected to the U.S. road system. By way of aviation, vital ``bypass'' mail service is provided via air carriers to towns and villages all over Alaska. This service is critical to the State of Alaska and to my constituents. USPS has jurisdiction over this program and, from time to time, has implemented its interpretations that diverge from Congressional intent of the Rural Services Improvement Act (RSIA)--a law that I helped develop with my former Senate colleague Ted Stevens, and which governs the USPS mail-delivery system for Alaska.  The intent of RSIA is very similar to the intent of the USPS funding included in the Financial Services appropriations bill--to ensure that rural postal delivery is maintained at prior year levels and to prevent the closure of important rural post offices.  There is only one airline in Alaska that now delivers mail and passengers ``from the first to the last mile'' to the far reaches of the State--to Native communities, to communities on the Aleutian chain, and the northern-most towns and villages in the State. This airline, Ravn Air, has been disadvantaged by the USPS's interpretation of RSIA that does not grant the air carrier the status as an ``existing mainline carrier'' under the statute. This status will help further ensure that viable passenger service and mail delivery is maintained throughout the State.  From time to time, it is fair and appropriate for USPS to objectively reevaluate its interpretation of RSIA to provide an updated application of the law and to consider Ravn for this status.  I intend to follow up with USPS and its new Commissioners regarding this request. The entire Alaska Congressional Delegation has previously written USPS on this matter and I will continue to reach out to my Senate Colleagues for review of this with USPS in light of changes within USPS itself, and changes in the airline industry and marketplace in Alaska.  I thank my colleagues and with that I will vote for passage of the Financial Services bill as part of the final FY '19 Appropriations package.                          ____________________
