Speaker, on May 21 of this year human rights advocates in Russia and all over the world marked the 80th'' anniversary of the birth of celebrated scientist and human rights advocate, Dr. Andrei Sakharov.  As a Soviet scientist and citizen of the world, Andrei Sakharov combined a brilliant intellect with a deep concern for humanity. He was the youngest member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. After World War II, Sakharov worked as a theoretical physicist and received the Soviet Union's highest award three times for his scientific accomplishments in the field of thermonuclear weapons development.  By the late 1960s, however, his protests against nuclear testing and calls for greater intellectual freedom had made him a pariah to the Kremlin. The publication of his seminal essay, ``Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom,'' brought him international attention and respect. In 1970, Sakharov and fellow activists Valery Chalidze and Andrei Tverdokhlebov founded the Moscow Human Rights Committee to help Soviet citizens secure the rights theoretically granted to them under the Soviet Constitution. As journalist David Remnick wrote recently, ``his modest apartment on Chkalova Street in Moscow seemed the moral center of an immoral empire.''  In 1975, as a result of his human rights advocacy and his work toward genuine detentebetween the West and the Soviet bloc, Dr. Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In the words of the Chairman of the Nobel Committee:       Sakharov's fearless personal commitment in upholding the      fundamental principles for peace between men is a powerful      inspiration for all true workers for peace. Uncompromisingly      and with unflagging strength Sakharov has fought against the      abuse of power and all forms of violation of human dignity,      and he has fought  True to form, Moscow would not allow Dr. Sakharov to travel to Oslo to receive the honor. Dr. Elena Bonner, his energetic wife and partner in the human rights struggle, accepted the prize in his stead and delivered his Nobel lecture, ``Peace, Progress, and Human Rights.'' Ironically, on the same day that Dr. Sakharov was receiving by proxy the Noble Peace Prize, December 10, 1975, the recipient himself was in Vilnius, Lithuania attending the political trial of Sergei Kovalev, a fellow scientist and colleague in the struggle for human rights.  By 1980, the Kremlin and KGB had decided that this soft-spoken scientist who kept talking about human rights violations and political prisoners, as well as criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, could no longer be allowed to speak his mind freely and to meet with foreign journalists. He was picked up on the streets of Moscow and, without a shred of judicial process, sent into ``internal exile'' in the city of Gorky about 300 kilometers east of Moscow. Even at this distance he could not be silenced, although the KGB did its best to harass him. Through Dr. Bonner, Dr. Sakharov continued to appeal for justice for the victims of human rights violations and to call on the international scientific community to work together for peace and disarmament.  By the late 1980's, however, Soviet authorities understood that the Soviet system could not compete with the rest of the world by repressing its best minds and criminalizing dissent. In December 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called Dr. Sakharov and invited him to return to Moscow ``to resume his patriotic work.'' What Gorbachev had in mind is unclear. Nevertheless, in April 1989, in the first genuinely contested national elections since Lenin dissolved the Constituent Assembly in 1918, Sakharov was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies where he resumed his ``patriotic work'' advancing the ideas of liberty and human rights for the Soviet people.  Mr. Speaker, at one point during a session of the Congress of People's Deputies, General Secretary Gorbachev turned off Dr. Sakharov's microphone in an effort to silence his arguments against the privileged position of the Communist Party under the Soviet Constitution. At that time, as Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I compared Dr. Sakharov's actions with those of former President John Quincy Adams who, as a Member of the United States House of Representatives, absolutely refused to be silenced on the subject of slavery despite the existence of the so-called ``gag rule.''  Tragically, Dr. Sakharov succumbed to a heart attack on December 14th, 1989, eight months after his election to the Congress of People's Deputies.  Some 50,000 people, along with foreign dignitaries and fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies, gathered at the Palace of Youth to say farewell to their hero and colleague. And, yes, the KGB was also in attendance. Chairman Kryuchkov filed a report to the Party leadership that can now be found on the Internet.  Mr. Speaker, through the kindness of Dr. Elena Bonner, today Dr. Sakharov's papers are available to researchers and the public at the Sakharov Archive at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. This archive is an invaluable contribution to world literature on human rights and international peace, and I hope that it will find generous support from the American people.  May Dr. Sakharov's example inspire us in the years to come.                          ____________________
