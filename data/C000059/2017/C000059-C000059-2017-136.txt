Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona in Riverside County, California are exceptional. On Thursday, January 19th, Cyndi Monroe will be honored as the Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce.  Cyndi is the founder of Christian Arts and Theatre (CAT), a non-profit performing arts education program for children. For more than 17 years, thousands of children have participated in CAT's award-winning program. The CAT Ambassadors Program encourages young members of our community to share their incredible talents at community events, such as Chamber of Commerce gatherings, concerts in the park, and various holiday festivals.  In addition to giving back to the community through CAT, Cyndi is an active member and Past President of Soroptimist International of Corona. Cyndi is a tireless advocate for Corona and fostering partnerships that bring people together to better serve our community. As an author, playwright, and inspirational speaker, Cyndi has enriched the cultural opportunities for every Corona family.  In light of all that Cyndi has done for the community of Riverside County and the city of Corona, it is only fitting to honor her as Citizen of the Year. Cyndi has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and a constituent of the 42nd Congressional District. I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Cyndi Monroe on being named Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce.                          ____________________
