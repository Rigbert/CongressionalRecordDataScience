Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to rise today to honor the Futures Academy of the Benton Harbor Area Schools in Benton Harbor, Michigan. This organization is dedicated to providing education, guidance and new opportunities for students in my hometown.  Now, more than ever, as random acts of violence in our schools terrorize our schools, we must look to our communities for creative ways to keep kids on the right path, giving them a hopeful, bright future.  For two years now, this highly successful program has given students a chance to learn many of life's essential lessons that cannot always be taught in the classroom. In weekly discussions, they meet to discuss morality, values, and responsibility.  They learn respect for each other, respect for the community, and respect for themselves. In short, the skills and lessons they will need for the future. If the future is in the hands of these young adults, I think we are all in good hands.  They are visiting Washington, D.C. this week to learn more about their government and civic responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues here in the House to take notice of this great organization. By working together, Benton Harbor has put in place a successful program that is helping children grow from students into responsible, motivated young adults. It is formula that I would encourage my colleagues to promote in their own districts and communities.  These are really terrific kids. I am so impressed to see how they have dedicated themselves and agreed to work hard toward some very very important goals. Again, Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the Futures Academy of Benton Harbor.                          ____________________
