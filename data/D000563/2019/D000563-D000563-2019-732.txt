President, I want to take a moment to thank a leader who has worked for nearly 60 years to create a strong economy built on pride, progressive values, and shared prosperity for all Americans.  Ronald Powell is the legendary president of Local 881 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. He is also a vice president on the UFCW International Union and a vice president of the Illinois State AFL-CIO. He is retiring this month after an astonishing 58 years as a proud union member and leader.  You may not be familiar with the initials UFCW, but you almost surely benefit from the good work of its members. The men and women of the UFCW include grocery store workers and bakery clerks, hospital and nursing home employees--even barbers and beauty shop employees.  When Ron Powell joined the United Retail Workers union, a forerunner to Local 881, in 1961, the union had fewer than 5,000 members. Fifty-eight years later, UFCW Local 881 represents more than 34,000 working men and women in Illinois, northwest Indiana, and parts of Missouri and Kentucky. The growth of Local 881 in an age when the labor movement is under relentless attack and many unions are losing members is a testament to Ron Powell's leadership and his commitment to dignity and fairness for working people.  Ron Powell became president of UFCW Local 881 in 1983, just 2 years after the local was chartered. Strength, vision, and compassion are the hallmarks of his service. Illinois' working families and our State's economy have both benefited from his progressive and innovative leadership.  In addition, under Ron Powell's leadership, Local 881 Ron has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, with the hope to find a cure. It has also raised funds for the Jackson Park Hospital in Chicago and for the Little City Foundation, which helps Chicago-area children with developmental disabilities.  My old friend, Senator Paul Wellstone, liked to sum up his definition of good economic policy by saying, ``We all do better when we all do better.''  Ron Powell believes in that same, proven plan for economic growth and justice. Working families in my, State of Illinois and far beyond are better off because of his decades of service on their behalf. I am honored to join those families in honoring Ron Powell on his distinguished career, and as a former member of UFCW's early unions, I wish him the very best as he begins the next chapter in his remarkable life.                          ____________________
