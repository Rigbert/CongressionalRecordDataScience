Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kate Wagoner, a 13-year old resident of Eugene, Oregon. Ms. Wagoner, an eighth grader at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, recently won an essay contest held in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  The theme of the essay contest was how Americans can be peacefully patriotic, even as the clouds of war loom on the horizon.  In her insightful essay, Ms. Wagoner notes that peaceful change can begin with one individual or one family who cares about others and acts on that compassion. However, she goes on to write that it is equally important for such individuals to influence the decision-making of those in power in order to guarantee a lasting peace.  As Ms. Wagoner concludes, if the United States dedicates itself to helping feed, clothe, house, and educate the needy around the world, then we may be able to achieve the ``nonviolent'' coexistence of which Dr. King spoke, rather than the ``violent co-annihilation'' of which he warned.  I would encourage my colleagues and others to read Ms. Wagoner's essay, which I've included at the end of my remarks.                   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Essay       Almost 40 years ago, on April 14, 1967, Dr. Martin Luther      King said, ``the greatest 17 purveyor of violence in the      world today (is) my own govenment.''       Dr. King's statement is still a powerful message because      America continues to use violence around the world. President      Bush is pushing for a war in Iraq, while nations like North      Korea, South Korea, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Israel, and      Palestine suffer from U.S. foreign policy decisions.       How can Americans be peacefully patriotic while our      govemment gives the U.S. military more and more to do around      the globe? To repeat one of my mother's favorite quotes,      ``Never believe that a few caring people can't change the      world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have.'' (Margaret      Mead, American anthropologist).       During the holidays, my family gave money to an      organization that helps hungry people all over the world feed      themselves. The families we help receive donations of goats,      sheep, llamas, honey bees, geese, oxen, and other farm      animals so they can be more self-sufficient and live      healthier lives. Peaceful patriotism is like this donation.       Around the world, kids like me are starving. Around the      world kids like me are soldiers and suicide bombers. Around      the world kids like me get sick from drinking dirty water,      get shot by soldiers, and step on land mines. Around the      world, kids like me struggle to survive. Americans, as      peaceful patriots, can help change some of these kids' lives.       Americans have a right to be proud of their country. This      is a nation where people can be and do great things. However,      imagine a world where America is also known as a nation that      helps people around the globe be and do great things. When      the richest and most powerful nation in history dedicates      itself to making sure people everywhere are well-fed, housed,      clothed, educated, and have hope for the future, peaceful      patriotism will change the world.       It is not enough for my family to practice peaceful      patriotism or for your family to make that choice. We have to      have people in power making decisions about our relationships      with other nations who share our hope for the future of      America and of the world. We can each live as peaceful      patriots and help many people now, but if we work together to      create a nation of peaceful patriots tomorrow, we can make      all the world safe; and secure for kids like me.       The message I want quoted in the future because it descibes      America is, ``The greatest purveyor of peace in the world      today is my own govemment,''                          ____________________
