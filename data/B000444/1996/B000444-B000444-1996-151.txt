 President, I yield myself 60 seconds on the bill. I have two responses.  My distinguished and able colleague has mixed up apples and oranges here. The section he read from the wiretap statute related to emergency wiretaps that do not require a court order at the front end.  What we are talking about are wiretaps where they want to go in and we want to prove they have probable cause to get the wiretap in the first case.  Second, I agree with everything that he says about the good parts of the bill. They were in the same bill I introduced, most of those things. I am for them. But the problem is, he mentioned there are 1,500 terrorists out there, or whatever the number. Under the bill now we create a new crime relating to providing material support for terrorists, if you send money to Hamas and provide material support or an automobile or a train ticket or whatever it is, and it is not a crime. It is a Federal crime now, but one for which you cannot get a wiretap. That seems to make no sense to me and that is why I have introduced this amendment.  I yield the floor to my friend from Massachusetts.
