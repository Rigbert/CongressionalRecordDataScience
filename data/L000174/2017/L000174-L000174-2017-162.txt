President, yesterday I spoke at length about my fear that Senator Sessions' would not have the ability to act as an independent Attorney General. The Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. He or she is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. And he or she must faithfully serve all Americans. Even if Senator Sessions could demonstrate independence from President Trump, my review of his extensive record leaves me unconvinced that he is capable of serving and protecting all Americans.  In 1986, Senator Ted Kennedy called Jeff Sessions a ``throwback'' because of his conduct on civil rights issues. I regret to say that, since the JudiciaryCommittee's bipartisan rejection of Senator Sessions' nomination to be a district court judge in 1986, Senator Sessions has not allayed our concerns. In his 20 years in the Senate, he has not shown a commitment to protecting the most vulnerable in our communities. Time and again, when the rights of women, LGBT individuals, and disenfranchised communities have been debated here in the Senate, Senator Sessions has not sought to protect their civil and human rights. Too often, he has been the one standing in the way.  That is why National Nurses United has written to me to express their opposition to Senator Sessions. They wrote: ``We provide the best care we possibly can, without regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic. That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public servant.'' I ask unanimous consent that their full letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. That is why my friend John Lewis testified before the Judiciary Committee in opposition to Senator Sessions. Congressman Lewis stated that, ``When faced with a challenge, Senator Sessions has frequently chosen to stand on the wrong side of history.'' Senate Republicans should be listening to these concerns and those of protesters in our streets and airports standing up for our Constitution. We should not subject those concerns to a gag rule.  Yet Senator Sessions and his supporters have painted a different picture of his record. They have argued that he has a strong record on civil rights. So I asked Senator Sessions in written questions to identify areas in which racial inequalities persist. He could have talked about sentencing or about areas where the Civil Rights Division has found patterns and practices of police departments violating people's rights or about the kind of voter suppression efforts that an appeals court found ``target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Senator Sessions did not identify a single example of racial inequality in modern America. That is astonishing. No one can uphold the rights of all Americans if he is unwilling to pay attention when those rights are being violated.  Some have suggested that Senator Sessions' record on civil rights has been criticized unfairly and he is held to a different standard because he is a conservative from the South. I disagree. When the Judiciary Committee rejected Senator Sessions' district court nomination in 1986, one of the votes against him came from Senator Heflin, who was a conservative from Alabama. Moreover, I and most other Democrats just voted to confirm as U.N. Ambassador another conservative Southerner: Nikki Haley. In 2015, then-Governor Haley made the decision to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds. She said, ``[I]t should never have been there'' and that she ``couldn't look my children in the face and justify it staying there.'' When Senator Sessions was asked about this and other efforts to remove the Confederate flag from public buildings, he argued that such efforts ``seek to delegitimize the fabulous accomplishments of our country.'' It can come as no surprise that the civil rights community is concerned by his nomination.  But I will speak to my own experiences with Senator Sessions' views on civil rights laws. In 2009, Senator Sessions opposed expanding hate crime protections to women and LGBT individuals, groups that have historically been targeted based merely on who they are. He stated, ``I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't see it.'' Thankfully, a bipartisan majority of Senators saw it, and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act is now law. These protections are needed now more than ever. According to recent FBI statistics, LGBT individuals are more likely to be targeted for hate crimes than any other minority group in the country.  Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, wrote a letter last month opposing Senator Sessions' nomination. She was concerned not just by Senator Sessions' opposition to the law that bears her son's name, but by how Senator Sessions viewed such hate crimes. She wrote:       ``Senator Sessions strongly opposed the hate crimes bill--     characterizing hate crimes as mere `thought crimes.'      Unfortunately, Senator Sessions believes that hate crimps      are, what he describes as, mere `thought crimes.'       ``My son was not killed by 'thoughts' or because his      murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten      with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol, tied him to a fence,      and left him to die in freezing temperatures because he was      gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish the life-     changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes      Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the      true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this      same person is now being nominated as the country's highest      authority to represent justice and equal protection under the      law for all Americans.''  But that was not all. Senator Sessions also said that ``the hate crimes amendment . . . has been said to cheapen the civil rights movement.'' I asked him about this comment and whether he still felt that way at his hearing, but he did not respond to the question. I asked him a second time, in a written follow-up, what he meant by that comment. He replied that ``Those were not my words,'' but again did not explain what he had meant by that remark. So I asked him a third time. The third time, he finally conceded. He wrote to me that ``it is not correct to say it cheapens our commitment to civil rights.'' If it is not correct to say that, then why did Senator Sessions quote it in the first place--and why did it take him three tries to acknowledge the error?  Senator Sessions also opposed the 2013 Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate with support from a majority of Republican Senators. During his hearing, and again in written questions, Senator Sessions refused to commit to defend this important law's constitutionality. He said only that he ``will carefully study'' it to discern whether it is ``reasonably defensible.'' His refusal to voice support for VAWA is all the more troubling in light of reports that the Heritage Foundation's budget blueprint, which is reportedly being relied on by the new administration, calls for eliminating all VAWA grants. I asked Senator Sessions to commit to stand up for victims and preserve these critical programs. Again, he refused.  Amita Swadhin, who appeared before the Judiciary Committee and bravely shared her story of being raped as a child, explained why this issue is so important: ``We need an Attorney General who will continue the progress we have made since the initial passage of VAWA, someone committed to improving and enforcing our laws to ensure the most vulnerable victims of crime can come forward to seek accountability and to access healing.'' This law and these grants are a matter of life and death to many people across the country. We need an Attorney General who understands that. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, which has never before taken a position on an Attorney General nomination, wrote to the Judiciary Committee because they do not believe Senator Sessions understands that. The letter states:       ``Senator Sessions' senate record of strenuous objection to      protections for historically marginalized populations,      coupled with his record of selective prosecutions,      demonstrate his unwillingness to protect marginalized      victims' access to justice and disqualify him from holding      the position of Attorney General of the United States, a      position charged with the responsibility of securing justice      for all.''  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Senator Sessions and his supporters have tried to minimize his opposition to the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill by pointing out that he did vote in committee for the Republican substitute amendment. Let me explain what that amendment would have done. It would have cut authorization levels by 40 percent, hampering efforts to prevent violence and provide services to victims in need. It would have removed all provisions intended to ensure that victims can receive services, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would have removed important provisions to let tribal justice systems reach the many criminal and civil cases that fell through the cracks. That amendment would have gutted core elementsof the VAWA reauthorization that go to the heart of what VAWA does. A vote for that amendment hardly demonstrates a commitment to victims.  Another issue that concerns me is criminal justice reform. For years, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. These sentences have created perverse disparities within our justice system. Racial minorities still receive nearly 80 percent of them. Our bipartisan effort has had the strong support of the Justice Department and many others in law enforcement, but not Senator Sessions. In recent years, no one in the Senate has fought harder against even modest sentencing reform than he has.  I am also concerned about Senator Sessions' commitment to ongoing civil rights litigation. I asked whether he would maintain the Justice Department's position in certain important cases. He would not commit to maintaining the Department's position, even in voting rights cases where courts have already found that certain voter ID laws are discriminatory.  Senator Sessions would not commit to even maintaining cases that are already at the Supreme Court. Last month, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioner, arguing that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires states to provide more than de minimis educational benefits and in fact ``give eligible children with disabilities an opportunity to make significant educational progress.'' Even though it would be extraordinary for the Justice Department to take a new position after oral argument has already been heard, Senator Sessions would not commit to maintaining the Department's position in this case.  I pointed to a lawsuit the Justice Department filed last year in Georgia alleging that Georgia's treatment of students with disabilities violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. In this lawsuit, the Justice Department noted that some of the facilities used by students with disabilities ``are located in poor-quality buildings that formerly served as schools for black students during de jure segregation.'' I asked Senator Sessions whether he would continue to pursue this case, and bring others like it where States are in violation of the ADA. He refused to commit to continuing this case. The ADA also contains a waiver of State sovereign immunity, which is a critical tool for enforcing that landmark law. Twice during the Bush administration, the Justice Department argued, and the Supreme Court agreed, that the waiver was a valid exercise of Congressional power under section V of the 14th Amendment, but Senator Sessions would not commit to defending the constitutionality of that provision.  Senator Sessions' record on disability rights is also of concern because of the way he spoke about students with disabilities. He once argued that mainstreaming causes a ``decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over America.'' As with my hate crimes amendment and VAWA, the problem is not just that Senator Sessions has opposed protections for the most vulnerable, it is also the language that he uses when opposing them, which denigrate those the laws seek to protect. That is why a group of 18 disability rights organizations have written to Senate leadership expressing their strong opposition to Senator Sessions' nomination.  Senator Sessions has also demonstrated a shockingly brazen attitude when I asked him about the offensive rhetoric used by some of his political associates. I asked him whether he would condemn certain remarks by David Horowitz, Frank Gaffney, and others. Senator Sessions received awards from these individuals. He regularly attended their conferences. He has given media statements in support of their organizations and the views they put forth. Yet, when Senator Sessions was directly asked to respond to some of their statements, he effectively shrugged his shoulders. These included comments: referring to Muslims as ``Islamic Nazis'' who ``want to kill Jews, that's their agenda''; alleging that President Obama ``is an anti-American radical and I'm actually sure he's a Muslim, he certainly isn't a Christian. . . . He's a pretend Christian in the same way he's a pretend American''; alleging that two Muslims members of Congress have ``longstanding Muslim Brotherhood ties''; arguing that a Muslim member of Congress should not be allowed to serve on the House Intelligence Committee because of his ``extensive personal and political associations with . . . jihadist infrastructure in America''; claiming that married women by definition cannot be raped by their husbands; calling for ``railroad cars full of illegals going south; and calling President Obama a traitor.  Senator Sessions responded that he does not hold those views. That is fair enough. But he did not explain why he chose to associate with such individuals. When someone accuses President Obama of treason, it is not at all enough to say, ``I do not hold that view.'' That is why, last month, Muslim advocates and 36 other civil rights organizations, including the Leadership Conference on Civic and Human Rights and the NAACP, wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing strong concern that ``Senator Sessions has closely aligned with anti-Muslim hate groups, accepted their awards and accolades, and publicly praised their leadership. Senator Sessions' appointment will only embolden these groups and activists and serve to further fan the flames of anti-Muslim bigotry already burning in this country.'' If Senator Sessions cannot condemn David Horowitz and Frank Gaffney, who the Southern Poverty Law Center has repeatedly called ``extremists'' who run hate groups, for calling President Obama a traitor, it is fair to ask whether he will have the courage to stand up to the President of the United States, as Sally Yates did.  The Attorney General is charged with enforcing the laws that protect all Americans. No one can fulfill that obligation who is not clear-eyed about the threats facing the most vulnerable in our communities. We need an Attorney General who will aggressively confront those who appeal to hate and fear. I do not believe that person is Senator Sessions. The Senate and the Judiciary Committee have heard from a multitude of civil rights, civil liberties, and domestic violence organizations, as well as nurses and numerous faith leaders, who oppose this nomination. This Senator stands with them.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       National Nurses United,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We write on behalf of the more than      150,000 registered nurse members of National Nurses United to      urge you to vote against the confirmation of Senator Jeff      Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Attorney      General. Much has been said by many others against      confirmation of this nominee, so we will be brief.       Our members work as bedside healthcare professionals in      almost every state in the nation. We work in every hospital      setting, from small rural facilities to large urban public      health systems, in prominent research hospitals affiliated      with prestigious public and private universities, as well as      Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. We care for Americans      on every point of the demographic spectrum, at their most      vulnerable. We provide the best care we possibly can, without      regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio      economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic.      That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is      not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public      servant. And to vote in favor of confirming him as the chief      law enforcement officer of the United States would abdicate      your responsibility to provide the oversight necessary to      ensure that basic legal rights are enforced evenhandedly and      for the protection of all people.       As Senate colleagues, you no doubt know Senator Sessions'      record as a lawmaker, as well as his record as the U.S.      Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as the      Alabama Attorney General. It was, of course, his record in      the U.S. Attorney's office and his many publically verified      racially insensitive comments that resulted in a majority of      the Senate Judiciary Committee voting against confirmation      for his nomination to be a U.S. District Court judge in 1986.      This `no' vote happened while the Judiciary Committee was      majority Republican. Even Senator Howell Heflin, a fellow      Alabamian, voted against him, citing ``reasonable doubts''      over whether he could be ``fair and impartial.''       Senator Sessions has oft asserted that his comments over      the years were taken out of context, or intended as humor.      But his record tells the truth. Early in his career he     charged civil right leaders (``the Marion Three'') with      voting fraud related to their efforts to assist African      American voters. The fact that the defendants in that case      were acquitted didn't deter Mr. Sessions. Later, as Attorney      General of Alabama, he initiated another voter fraud      investigation involving absentee ballots cast by black voters      that, again, resulted in findings of no wrong doing. During      that same timeframe, he was criticized for declining to      investigate church burnings, and he ``joked'' that he thought      Ku Klux Klan members were ``OK, until [he] learned that they      smoked marijuana.''       Against that background, Senator Sessions aggressively      interrogated Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first      nominee of Latino heritage. Further betraying a deep belief      in natural division between racial groups, he grilled Justice      Sotomayor about whether she could be fair to white Americans,      despite her 17-year record as a jurist and having received      the American Bar Association's highest rating. And he      expressed grave concerns that she would engage in judicial      ``empathy'' on the high court, favoring persons of certain      races or ethnicities over others. He then voted against her      confirmation.       Senator Sessions' prejudices are not only against people of      color. As an organization representing a predominately female      profession we are compelled to express our outrage that      Senator Sessions defended Donald Trump's statements about      grabbing women by the genitals, by saying that such conduct      would not constitute sexual assault. The fact that he took a      different position during his Committee hearing is of no      comfort. It only shows that he will say whatever he believes      will help land him in the seat of power to determine whether,      and against whom, to enforce our laws. His comments last fall      dismissing President-elect Trump's despicable treatment of      women is consistent with his vote in 2013 against the      Violence Against Women Act. As nurses, we see close up the      devastating effects of domestic violence against our      patients, and we are disturbed by Senator Sessions' alleged      concern that the protection of that statute should not extend      to victims of violence on tribal lands.       Moreover, confirming Senator Sessions to the job of the top      prosecutor would exacerbate our national crisis over race      issues in policing and our criminal justice system. He      personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act,      a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Sens. Charles Grassley (R-     Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and      Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The fact that law      enforcement leadership throughout the nation supported the      reform effort made no difference to Senator Sessions. And      unfortunately, his actions as U.S. Attorney for the Southern      District of Alabama only further illustrate his indifference      to this crisis. For example, drug convictions made up 40      percent of his cases when he served in that position--twice      the rate of other federal prosecutors in Alabama.       Despite the current trend of focusing resources on violent      crime, and away from out-dated drug war policies, Senator      Sessions continues to oppose any attempts to legalize      marijuana and any reduction in drug sentences. As Attorney      General, he could direct federal prosecutors throughout the      country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even      low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate      our national record of incarcerating non-violent offenders--     the vast majority of whom could be successfully treated, at      far lower cost to society, with appropriate healthcare      treatment.       Nor should Senator Sessions be trusted to ensure equal      access to voting rights. He has publically called the Voting      Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and has insisted that its proactive      protections of racial minorities were no longer necessary.      This is especially disturbing as Senator Sessions voiced      public support for voter-ID laws, while his home state      recently tried to close over thirty DMV offices, many in      majority-black areas, shortly after instituting strict voter-     ID requirements. We are reminded of the words of Coretta      Scott King in her letter opposing Jeff Sessions' nomination      to the federal district court in 1986: ``The irony of Mr.      Sessions' nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given      a life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the      local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and      cattle prods.''       We will not attempt to address all the positions Senator      Sessions has taken that are out of step with the reality of      the difficult times we are in, but as nurses we must include      our grave concern that as Attorney General he would not be      vigilant in enforcing environmental protections. In a July      2012 Senate hearing on climate science, Senator Sessions      dismissed the concerns about global warming expressed by 98%      of climate scientists, and asserted that this is ``[a] danger      that is not as great as it seems.'' These positions are      frightening. Climate change is a public health issue that      cannot be overstated. As nurses we have been seeing for some      time increases in the frequency and severity of respiratory      diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, as well      as an increase in cancers and aggravation of cardiovascular      illness. The effects of air pollution are particularly acute      in pediatric patients. They have higher respiratory rates      than adults, and consequently higher exposure. Our elderly      patients are also especially vulnerable. Respiratory symptoms      as common as coughing can cause arrhythmias, heart attacks,      and other serious health impacts in geriatric patients. As      global warming progresses, we are seeing sharp increases in      heat stroke and dehydration, both of which are sometimes      fatal.       In our disaster relief work through our Registered Nurse      Response Network, we have been called upon to assist the      victims of Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy--events      that many scientists believe would not have been of the      magnitude they were if not for rising temperature.       Current and future generations cannot afford to have a fox      minding the hen house on the important issues of civil and      criminal protections under the control of the Attorney      General. We urge you to set aside your personal loyalty to      Senator Sessions and evaluate honestly his record and fitness      for this critically important job. We urge you to vote      against his confirmation.           Sincerely,                                               Deborah Burger, RN,                             Co-President, National Nurses United.                                                    Jean Ross, RN,     Co-President, National Nurses United.                                  ____         National Task Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence       Dear Member of the Judiciary Committee: We, the steering      committee of the National Task Force to End Sexual and      Domestic Violence (NTF), a coalition of national, tribal,      state, and local leadership organizations and individuals      advocating on behalf of victims of sexual assault, domestic      violence, dating violence and stalking, write to express our      opposition to Senator Jeff Sessions' nomination for Attorney      General of the United States of America. We have arrived at      this position based upon a review of his record as a state      and federal prosecutor, during which he applied the law      unevenly, and as a U.S. Senator, during which he supported      laws that would afford only some members of our society equal      protection of the law. The role of Attorney General requires      a demonstrated commitment to providing equal protection under      the law--particularly to people who face discrimination      because of their race, religion, gender, gender identity,      sexual orientation, disability or other identities. We      respectfully submit that Senator Sessions' record speaks for      itself and that his history of differential application of      the law carries with it the potential to harm victims and      survivors of gender-based violence, particularly survivors      from historically marginalized communities. Thirty years ago,      this Committee rejected Senator Sessions' nomination to the      federal bench due to well-justified concerns regarding his      problematic record on civil rights and troubling history of      making racially insensitive statements. These aforementioned      concerns, combined with his equally troubling comments on the      nature of sexual assault and other concerns raised below,      make Senator Sessions an unqualified choice to serve as U.S.      Attorney General.       The position of Attorney General of the United States of      America, created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, bears the      responsibility of representing the United States in all legal      matters in which the country has an interest. Chief among      those interests is the affording of equal protection under      our criminal, civil and civil rights laws to all members of      our society. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 503, the President's      appointment of an Attorney General must be with the ``advice      and consent of the Senate.'' The process ensures that the      person holding the post of Attorney General is one fit for      such duty, a person with the intellectual, moral and      steadfast ethical capacity to uphold the laws and interests      of the United States and to apply the laws equally to all      members of society.     Failure to Speak Up for Victims of Violence and Discrimination       A threshold qualification for the position of Attorney      General is a deep understanding of the laws s/he is sworn to      uphold. Of critical relevance are Senator Sessions' recent      comments on the nature of sexual assault in response to the      release of a 2005 video in which President-Elect Donald Trump      describes grabbing women's genitalia without their consent.      When asked whether he would characterize the behavior      described by President-elect Trump as sexual assault, Senator      Sessions responded, ``I don't characterize that as sexual      assault. I think that's a stretch. I don't know what he      meant--.'' Federal statutes enacted prior to Senator      Sessions' tenure as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District      of Alabama criminalize ``abusive sexual conduct.'' The      applicable definition for conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2244 is clearly stated: ``the intentional touching,      either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia,      anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person      with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or      arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' Thus,      the Senator is either unaware that abusive sexual contact is      illegal under federal law, or he feigned ignorance of the      laws he was sworn to uphold as an officer of the court for      the sake of political expedience.       The Department of Justice has the exclusive authority to      enforce the United States' criminal statutes, including 18      U.S.C. Sec. 2244. The Department of Justice also has      exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of domestic and      sexual violence in the District of Columbia, most sexual      assaults perpetrated in Indian Country, and concurrent      jurisdiction over domestic violence offenses committed in      Indian Country. Any candidate for Attorney General of the      United States, particularly a former U.S. Attorney, should      possess     a thorough understanding of the legal definition of sexual      assault under federal law and under the laws of the      jurisdictions in which the Office of the U.S. Attorney has      prosecutorial responsibility. The National Task Force has      worked collectively for decades to ensure that legal      definitions in the U.S. Code and under state and local laws      make it absolutely clear that sexual assault is a crime. The      job of the Attorney General is to enforce the law without      fear or favor. Thus, we expect the Attorney General to      enforce federal laws addressing sexual assault without      introducing nonexistent ambiguity, because of the      perpetrator's identity. Senator Sessions' cavalier statement      about sexual assault leaves us fearful that he will not      vigorously prosecute sexual assault crimes, a practice      unbefitting of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.       Additionally, Senator Sessions' poor history with respect      to fighting for fairness and equity has us justifiably      concerned that he will not step in to vindicate the rights of      survivors of campus sexual assault and other victims of      discrimination. The Justice Department has jurisdiction to      enforce a myriad of civil rights statutes, including Title VI      of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education      Amendments of 1972. These statutes bar discrimination in      education based on race, color and national origin and sex      (respectively) by educational institutions that receive      federal funding. On college and university campuses alone, we      know that 20 percent of women are victimized by sexual      assault. Absent an Attorney General's commitment to ensuring      that educational institutions root out bias and violence and      hold perpetrators accountable, victims of discrimination,      harassment or violence based on sex, race and/or national      origin will be unable to pursue their education in an      atmosphere of educational equity. Teachers surveyed since the      election have described thousands of incidents of ``bigotry      and harassment,'' stemming from incidents involving ``racist,      xenophobic or misogynistic comments,'' and/or ``derogatory      language directed at students of color, Muslims, immigrants,      and people based on gender or sexual orientation.'' It is      imperative that the person nominated to the position of      Attorney General possess a demonstrated record of work and      support for these impacted communities, including people of      color, immigrants, Muslims and religious minorities, members      of the LGBT community, and people with disabilities.       Regrettably, Senator Sessions' career is replete with      actions taken and statements made in opposition to equitable      educational access. While Attorney General of Alabama,      Senator Sessions fought equitable educational access for      poor, minority and disabled students in Alabama even after      being ordered by a federal court to remedy the yawning      financial disparities between Alabama's richest (and whitest)      and poorest school districts. Additionally, his      mischaracterization of the Individuals with Disabilities in      Education Act as creating ``special treatment for certain      children,'' and being responsible for ``accelerating the      decline of civility and discipline in classrooms across      America,'' is appalling. In light of these remarks, we are      concerned not only about the Senator's willingness to use the      civil rights statutes to protect survivors of both campus      sexual assault and other forms of harassment and violence in      the education context, but also his commitment to ensuring      equal access and safety under certain programs in the      Violence Against Women Act for victims of sexual and domestic      violence who have disabilities.                        Fair Application of Law       We have additional concerns regarding the Attorney      General's role with respect to the fair, even and unbiased      application of the law. Victims and survivors come from all      racial or ethnic backgrounds, faith practices, sexual      orientations, and gender identities: 33.5% of multiracial      women have been raped, as have 27% of American Indian and      Alaska Native women, 15% of Hispanic, 22% of Black, and 19%      of White women. Additionally, 53.8% of multiracial women and      39.3% of multiracial men experience intimate partner physical      violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate      partner stalking in their lifetimes, as do 46.0% of American      Indian and Alaska Native women, 45.3% of American Indian and      Alaska Native men, 19.6% of Asian and Pacific Islander women      (data for Asian and Pacific Islander men is not available),      43.7% of Black women, 38.6% of Black men, 37.1% of Hispanic      women, 26.6% of Hispanic men, 34.6% of White women and 28.2%      of White men. We know firsthand that many survivors from      vulnerable populations hesitate to contact law enforcement or      do not trust the court system to address their victimization      because they fear, based on prior experience, that any      justice system response may not help them. We expect anyone      who serves as Attorney General to create a Justice Department      accessible to all; the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S.      Constitution demand no less.       Senator Sessions' well-documented prosecutorial record, as      U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as      Attorney General for the State of Alabama, demonstrate his      propensity to inequitably apply the law to the disadvantage      of historically marginalized populations. Senator Sessions'      history leads us to question whether he will vigorously seek      to ensure that all victims and survivors of gender-based      violence, particularly vulnerable populations and those at      the margins of society, have access to vitally needed      services and legal protections.Senator Sessions' Opposition to Protections for the Immigrant and LGBT                               Communities       We are concerned that the positions that Senator Sessions      has taken on immigration and LGBT individuals pose grave      threats to vulnerable victims of gender-based violence. His      consistent support of immigration policies that increase the      barriers to safety for undocumented victims of sexual and      domestic violence victims pushes immigrant victims further      into the shadows and harms families and communities by      allowing perpetrators (batterers and rapists) to abuse,      traffic and assault with impunity. During the consideration      of two major comprehensive immigration reform bills, as well      on various other occasions, Senator Sessions has sponsored      amendments and stand-alone legislation to limit the      availability of critical safety net assistance for immigrants      and increase barriers to protections from abuse and      exploitation by penalizing local jurisdictions that fail to      engage in immigration enforcement activities. He has made no      subsequent statement that indicates that he would rethink      these punitive policy positions were he to be confirmed.       His failure to support, and sometimes active opposition to,      progress and protections for the LGBT community leave us      gravely concerned that if confirmed, he would not stand up      for the rights of the LGBT community generally, and      particularly with respect to LGBT victims of violence. He      opposed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes      Prevention Act, which is of particular concern as we witness      a spike in harassment of minorities and bias crimes over the      last several months. Additionally, he supported a      constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He also      opposed the repeal of ``Don't Ask Don't Tell.'' Senator      Sessions' record sends the message to marginalized survivors      that their experiences will not be understood, nor will their      rights be protected, if he is confirmed as the Attorney      General.              Opposition to the Violence Against Women Act       We are also concerned that the nominee voted against the      Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization of 2013.      Seventy-eight out of one hundred senators supported the      bipartisan bill; Senator Sessions was in the distinct      minority. The 2013 Act addresses the gaps in law that were      uncovered through outreach to and surveys of programs and      service providers and domestic and sexual violence victims      themselves.       Our analysis revealed that many survivors were not able to      access services and justice to the extent they needed. Of      particular note, we found that LGBT survivors often lacked      access to justice and support based on their gender identity      or their sexual orientation. We also learned of the      deplorable lack of access to justice faced by survivors of      domestic violence and sexual assault on tribal lands. VAWA      2013 included provisions that removed one of many barriers      that prevent access to justice for American Indian and Alaska      Native domestic violence survivors. The 2013 statute's      provisions expand and ensure that immigrant survivors can      access VAWA protections, allowing survivors to come out of      the shadows, help hold batterers and abusers accountable, and      enable law enforcement to protect community safety. VAWA      2013's goal of ensuring equal protection of the law was      rejected by Senator Sessions, who cast the bill's      advancements toward inclusion and equal protection as      political maneuvering and, in that light, voted against the      bill. The Attorney General is tasked with ensuring that      VAWA's protection and programs are available and accessible      to all. Senator Sessions' opposition to the VAWA protections      and his prosecutorial record leave us gravely concerned that      he would not vigorously or consistently apply these      protections.                               Conclusion       The 14th Amendment provides the inalienable right that      every person receive equal protection under the law. Senator      Sessions' senate record of strenuous objection to protections      for historically marginalized populations, coupled with his      record of selective prosecutions, demonstrate his      unwillingness to protect marginalized victims' access to      justice and disqualify him from holding the position of      Attorney General of the United States, a position charged      with the responsibility of securing justice for all.      Selective application of the law and outward hostility      towards victims of sexual and domestic violence in      historically marginalized populations has a chilling effect      on their willingness and ability to seek services and      protection. It drives sexual violence, domestic violence,      dating violence and stalking underground, something we have      made great strides to avoid. The Attorney General of the      United States must be an individual committed to protecting      the inalienable right of equal protection under the law to      all within United States' jurisdiction. Moreover, his      minimizing comments about the nature of sexual assault call      into question his dedication to enforcing the law and      providing justice to victims of this serious crime.       In short, we oppose Senator Sessions' confirmation as      Attorney General of the United States and we ask you, as a      member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to ask him direct      questions regarding the concerns raised in this letter, and      to advise the President, pursuant to the prescription of 28      U.S.C.     Sec. 503, that Senator Sessions' is unqualified to hold this      post.           Yours truly,      The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.
