 President, I yield myself 10 minutes.  I rise in support of the McCain amendment. I first got involved in the sugar program when the last remaining West Coast sugar refinery came into my office to essentially say they were in the process of being put out of business by this program because they could not buy enough sugar on the world market to refine it. That refinery is C Sugar. I found that the sugar program is little more than a system of import restrictions, subsidized loans, and price supports that benefit a limited number of sugar growers.  Recently, Congressman George Miller and I asked the GAO to take a look at the sugar program. A week ago, they put out this report entitled ``Sugar Program: Changing the Method For Setting Import Quotas Could Reduce Costs to Users.'' In short, the GAO found that the USDA's policy has allowed too little sugar to be imported into the country. This has increased costs to consumers and restricted our domestic refineries' access to sufficient quantities of sugar.  The GAO found:       USDA has continued to target the same stocks-to-use ratios      for determining annual tariff-rate quotas, despite the fact      that the resulting quotas have maintained domestic market      prices that are 2 or more cents higher than necessary for      avoiding loan forfeitures. This imposes unnecessary costs on      U.S. sugar users--about $400 million annually.  They also found that:       USTR's current process for allocating the sugar tariff-rate      quota does not ensure that all sugar allowed under the quota      reaches the United States market.  This finding is particularly troubling to me. By limiting the amount of raw cane sugar available for production, 40 percent of the jobs in the sugarcane refining industry have been lost in this country. Since 1982, 9 out of 21 cane sugar refineries in the United States have been forced out of business by this program. Those that have remained open are struggling to survive under onerous import restrictions.  I first became involved in this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, the president and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, informed me his refinery was forced to temporarily close because it had no sugar. This 93-year-old refinery is the Nation's largest, and the only such facility on the West Coast. C refines about 15 percent of the total cane sugar consumed in the United States.  C requires in excess of 700,000 tons of raw cane sugar to meet its sales demand. Hawaii is C's sole source for its domestic raw cane sugar needs. But Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for over 10 years. This has meant that C is forced to cover over half of its annual consumption through imports from other countries.  The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C to pay an inflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. This is just plain wrong. Even more devastating, however, the quota system limits the amount of sugar available to the refinery. Simply put, C has been unable to get enough sugar to refine, and it has been forced to close its doors on several occasions. This is as a result of the sugar program.  In a letter to me, Mr. Koncelik notes:       The C Sugar refinery in Crockett, California, was forced      to close from November 8 to November 15 because it ran out of      raw sugar. This closing is extremely costly. Other competitor      refineries, Savannah and Domino, have had similar      experiences. The Government-imposed shortage is forcing up      the market price for raw sugar to levels that are bankrupting      refiners.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Senator Feinstein: The USDA is unnecessarily      disrupting operations and injuring the nation's cane sugar      refining industry by failing to increase the annual sugar      import quota to adequate levels.       The C Sugar refinery in Crockett, California was forced      to close from November 8 to November 15 because it ran out of      raw sugar. This closing is extremely costly. Other competitor      refineries, Savannah and Domino, have had similar      experiences.       The Government-imposed shortage is forcing up the market      price for raw sugar to levels that are bankrupting refiners.      The tight import quota is keeping the price of raw sugar well      above the Government support level, and well above the level      at which Government loan forfeitures might occur. The      increase in the cost of raw sugar since 1994 has cost the      refining industry in excess of $80 million.       The structure of the market is such that refiners cannot      cover these increase costs in the refined sugar market. As a      result, C and all other refiners are losing money, and some      have for three years.       In addition, the deplorable condition of the refining      industry has triggered justifiable concern within the food      processing industry over the sugar supply. In the absence of      a viable refining industry, which accounts for over 50      percent of refined sugar sold in the United States, the      specter of temporary food plant closing is real and not      imagined.       There is an urgent need for an immediate and, this time,      meaningful increase in the sugar import quota. I would      appreciate it if you would discuss this matter with Secretary      Glickman and Ambassador Kantor.           Sincerely,                                                   David Koncelik,                                                President and CEO.
