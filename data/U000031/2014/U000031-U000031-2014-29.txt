Speaker, first I want to commend Republicans and Democrats for getting the policy right. This is a tough nut to crack. It was 51-0 in our committee, led by Joe Pitts, Dr. Burgess, the Doc Caucus, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Dingell, and Mr. Pallone. We worked long and hard to get the policy right, and we worked with the other committees to do it as well.  The difficulty we always knew was going to be on the pay-for. I would suggest this: we want to work with the Senate; we want to get this thing done; pay-for is the toughest part, but let's go to conference. Let's work with the Senate to get a pay-for that can work.  Now, we know that there is a deadline coming up at the end of this month. As we look to try and find a pay-for, let me go through some of the other delays that this administration has already done:  Individual mandate delay, Americans with canceled coverage due to ObamaCare; delayed.  Individual mandate, deadline for purchasing coverage; delayed.  Individual mandates for non-ACA compliant plans; delayed by the administration.  Annual limit requirement; delayed.  MLR requirement; delayed.  MA cuts through demo bonus money; delayed.  Employer reporting; delayed.  Employer mandate; delayed.  Subsidies only in State-run exchanges; delayed.  High-risk pool closure; delayed.  Out-of-pocket waiver for group health plans; delayed.  Verification of eligibility for exchange subsidies; delayed.  Reinsurance fee for some unions; delayed.  Nondiscrimination requirement for employer coverage; delayed.  Subsidies only through the exchange; delayed.  Shop employee choice delay; delayed  Shop online purchasing; delayed.  Numerous HealthCare.gov technical; delayed.  This was never ready for prime time. We have said that from the start. If the administration has decided to delay all these things, almost two dozen, why not delay this, too? And why not use the savings then not only to help the physicians, we have to think about the seniors.
