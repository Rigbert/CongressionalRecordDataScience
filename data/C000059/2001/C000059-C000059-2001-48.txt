Speaker, on behalf of my constituents, I wish to extend to President Chen Shui-bian of the Republic of China on Taiwan my congratulations on the occasion of his first anniversary in office on May 20, 2001.  In his inaugural address, the president mentioned two key points: his hope that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland could resume their dialogue on reunification and that Taiwan would continue to strengthen its good relationship with the United States.  Twelve months later, while President Chen continues to hope for a breakthrough in Taiwan's evolving relationship with the Chinese mainland, Taiwan's relationship with the United States is certainly becoming ever stronger. Bilateral trade between Taiwan and the United States topped $64.8 billion last year, and Taiwan was the United States' eighth largest trading partner. Last year, nearly 30,000 students from Taiwan were enrolled in United States colleges and universities. And the United States, outside of Asia, is the number one destination for Taiwan travelers. Clearly, Taiwan's people like the United States, as Taiwan and the United States share many values in common such as attachment to freedom, democracy, and human rights.  To President Chen Shui-bian of the Republic of China, I say ``Good luck and good fortune. You have done a good job for your country.'' Last but not least, America welcomes President Chen to make a brief stopover in New York City as he travels to Central America.                          ____________________
