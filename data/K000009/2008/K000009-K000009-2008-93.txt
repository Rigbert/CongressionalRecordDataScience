And at seven, that child had such measure, just like an adult. And he faced, as your daughter did, something that we, as adults, wonder if we could face. And we never forget them because they hold us up in our own work with their strength and their courage. We need answers. We need answers for our children. We need to stem this disease, and we need to prevent and we need to cure.  I want to thank Congresswoman Pryce for her years of service and doing what is so wrenching, to continue after the loss of someone who is so much a part of yourself and helping us better ourselves as a country. I thank you for this exceptional piece of legislation.  I thank Chairman Pallone. I thank Congresswoman Capps and those who have supported you in this effort. And I thank you for, most of all, sharing Caroline with us as a most beautiful, beautiful memory and tribute to her and to you.
