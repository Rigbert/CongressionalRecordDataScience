Chairman. This tremendous turnover calls into question whether the traditional use of these lands for forestry and for outdoor recreational activities will continue. We are fortunate that the present owners of these valuable lands are offering an opportunity to secure their lasting protection and productivity. I, along with Senator Snowe, support these efforts through funding from the Forest Legacy Program and the Forest Service's land acquisition program and hope we can work together during this appropriations process to take advantage of the opportunity afforded us at this time.
