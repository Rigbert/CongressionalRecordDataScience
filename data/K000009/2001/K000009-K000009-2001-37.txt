Speaker, today we are preparing to send a letter to the President of the United States expressing the displeasure of many Members and genuine concern about the administration decision to send a delegation from our countries to the World Trade Organization's fourth ministerial conference in Qatar. That is to occur next week.  We are writing to express our deep reservations about the appropriateness of that venue in light of recent actions by the monarchy in Qatar, not to mention the obvious security concerns for our citizens.  We are deeply disappointed by the failure of the Qatari monarchy to support U.S. military action in Afghanistan. In fact, the President of the United States has said Nations should choose sides. Well, Qatar has chosen the wrong side. Indeed, in this war against terrorism, Qatar has decided to sit on the sidelines, and at worst to condemn U.S. military action; so why are we sending a delegation there?  Indeed, the government of Qatar has condemned the air campaign against the Taliban and refused to make its airports and infrastructure available to U.S. forces. On October 23, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin-Jassem bin-Jabr al-Thani condemned, and that is a quote, the allied attacks on Afghanistan and called them unacceptable.  What is unacceptable is the notion that Doha, Qatar is an appropriate site for the World Trade Organization ministerial.  Mr. Speaker, we will be asking the President to prevail on the WorldTrade Organization officials to move the ministerial to another location in light of the government of Qatar's opposition to the war on terrorism.  The government of Qatar should be made to understand that its failure to support the coalition in the campaign against terrorism has consequences, and it is not business as usual.  In the Financial Times today, there is an article indicating that Vice President Cheney disregarded fears over the WTO choosing the venue of Qatar for this meeting. In fact, it says that the White House disregarded security concerns among top U.S. trade officials this month by committing Washington to sending a delegation to the meeting of the World Trade Organization previously scheduled for Qatar.  It mentions that U.S. Government security experts on Friday warned business lobbyists planning to accompany the delegation that there were substantial risks in attending the meeting in the small Gulf state.  One delegation member was very concerned about Mr. Cheney's call and said, ``I think this is a momentously bad call based upon what we have learned about security risks there.''  It is no secret this organization calls itself the World Trade Organization, and when those two Trade Towers came down in New York, those were the Twin World Trade Towers. There is a message here, and it is a pretty important one.  For the Record, I will be including information on Qatar's policy of denying its own people fundamental rights. In fact, the government officially prohibits such things as public worship by non-Muslims. Our own CIA Fact Book indicates that the people of Qatar do not even have the right to vote, and freedom of speech is severely limited. I could not be giving this speech in Qatar.  In addition, like the Taliban, the rulers of Qatar oppress women, and women occupy a strictly subservient role inside that society.  I think it is fair to say that trade has failed to bring freedom to Qatar. In fact, the U.S. State Department calls oil the cornerstone of Qatar's economy, accounting for more than 70 percent of total government revenue in that country. Starting in 1973, oil production there increased dramatically, but freedom certainly has not followed.  We are constantly told how freedom takes root in unfree countries if we simply trade, whether it is Vietnam, China or Qatar. That logic is simply not true. Despite billions upon billions of dollars worth of engagement between Western commercial interests and Qatar, the people of Qatar have no freedom of speech, no freedom of assembly, no freedom of religion, no freedom of association.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the Bush and Cheney administration to seriously review the decision that they have made to send a delegation to Qatar and to find a location that is safer in view of these very troubled times.  The material previously referred to is as follows:               (From the Financial Times, Oct. 31, 2001]                Cheney Disregarded Fears Over WTO VenueVice-president pledged US participation despite efforts to move Mideast                                 meeting    (By Guy de Jonquieres in London and Edward Alden in Washington)       Dick Cheney, the US vice-president, disregarded security      concerns among top US trade officials this month by      committing Washington to sending a delegation to next month's      ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Doha,      Qatar.       Mr. Cheney pledged US participation even though US      intelligence officials are seriously concerned that its      delegation--due to include Robert Zoellick, the US trade      representative, Don Evans, commerce secretary, and Ann      Veneman, agriculture secretary--cannot be protected      adequately in Doha, according to congressional and business      representatives who have been briefed by the administration      on security plans.       Intensive efforts are being made to launch a global trade      round at the five-day WTO meeting, which starts on November      9. The Gulf state was the only WTO member to offer to host      the talks, after riots marred the last meeting, in Seattle,      two years ago.       US government security experts on Friday warned business      lobbyists planning to accompany the delegation that there      were ``substantial risks'' in attending the meeting in the      small Gulf state.       Mr. Cheney gave his assurances by telephone 10 days ago to      the emir of Qatar, despite efforts by Mr. Zoellick to      persuade other countries to move the meeting to Singapore,      according to accounts by diplomats from several countries      that were not contradicted by US officials.       The vice-president's intervention came after strong      diplomatic pressure from Qatar, which told the US and other      WTO members that shifting the meeting would offend Islamic      countries that have supported the US-led anti-terrorism      coalition.       ``I think this is a momentously bad call based on what we      have learnt about security risks there,'' said one US      delegation member. Mr. Cheney's office did not return      telephone calls seeking comment yesterday.       The US team in Doha was originally due to include about 30      congressmen. But Washington has decided to cut its delegation      by more than half.       Mr. Zoellick said he was keeping his delegation ``as small      as possible for their safety'', adding that the situation in      Doha ``is not exactly the happiest in terms of overall      security''. He said that while every effort was being made to      ensure a safe meeting ``there is undoubtedly risk''.       The US is worried that Islamic extremists or others with      ties to al-Qaeda, the organisation headed by Osama bin Laden,      may have penetrated Qatar's security.                                  ____   State Department Condemns Qatar; USTR Ignores Human Rights Abuses       Qatar would be a poor example of the argument that ``trade      brings freedom.'' However, the United State Trade      Representative has continued to push for the next World Trade      Organization (WTO) trade ministerial to be held in Qatar.         Fact No. 1. QATAR DENIES ITS PEOPLE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS       The people of Qatar don't even have the right to vote.      According to the CIA Factbook, the government of Qatar has      granted its people suffrage for municipal elections only      (which likely indicates that municipal offices lack any real      power). The people of Qatar do not enjoy any of the freedoms      that we espouse. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has criticized      the selection of Qatar as the venue for the next WTO meeting      because the government does not recognize a right to freedom      of assembly.       The U.S. State Department has formally noted severe      restrictions on the freedom of speech, assembly and      association. Although Qatar is the home of the free-wheeling      al-Jazeera satellite television station that Osama bin Laden      frequently uses as a loudspeaker to the global village,      otherwise freedom of speech is severely limited.       The government has banned political demonstrations. The      government does not allow political parties, or membership in      international professional organizations that might be      critical of the government (or any other Arab government).      Private social, sports, trade, professional and cultural      societies must be registered with the government, and      government security forces monitor the activities of such      groups.       The government officially prohibits public worship by non-     Muslims. So if our trade negotiators go there next month,      they won't be able to attend church, go to Mass or synagogue      or participate in any other form of worship unless they are      Muslim.    fact no. 2. like the taliban, the rulers of qatar oppress women       As in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, women occupy a      strictly subservient role in Qatar. This is taken from the      U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights:       ``The activities of women are restricted closely both by      law and tradition. For example, a woman is prohibited from      applying for a driver's license unless she has permission      from a male guardian. This restriction does not apply to      noncitizen women. The Government adheres to Shari'a in      matters of inheritance and child custody. While Muslim wives      have the right to inherit from their husbands, non-Muslim      wives do not, unless a special exemption is arranged. In      cases of divorce, Shari'a prevails; younger children remain      with the mother and older children with the father. Both      parents retain permanent rights of visitation. However, local      authorities do not allow a noncitizen parent to take his or      her child out of the country without permission of the      citizen parent. There has been a steady increase in the      number and severity of complaints of spousal abuse by the      foreign wives of local and foreign men. Women may attend      court proceedings but generally are represented by a male      relative; however, women may represent themselves.       Women largely are relegated to the roles of mother and      homemaker, but some women are now finding jobs in education,      medicine, and the news media. Women appear to receive equal      pay for equal work; however, they often do not receive equal      allowances. These allowances generally cover transportation      and housing costs. Increasingly, women are receiving      government scholarships to pursue degrees at universities      overseas. The Amir has entrusted his second wife, who is the      mother of the Heir Apparent, with the high-profile task of      establishing a university in Doha. In 1996 the Government      appointed its first female undersecretary, in the Ministry of      Education. Although women legally are able to travel abroad      alone, tradition and social pressures cause most to travel      with male escorts. There also have been complaints that      Qatari husbands take their foreign spouses' passports and,      without prior approval, turn them in for Qatari citizenship      documents. The husbands then inform their wives that the      wives have lost their former citizenship. In other cases,      foreign wives report being forbidden     by their Qatari husbands or in-laws to visit or to contact      foreign embassies.       There is no independent women's rights organization, nor      has the Government permitted the establishment of one.''         Fact No. 3. TRADE HAS FAILED TO BRING FREEDOM TO QATAR       The U.S. State Department calls oil ``the cornerstone of      Qatar's economy,'' accounting for more than 70 percent of      total government revenue. Starting in 1973, oil production      increased dramatically, bringing Qatar out of the ranks of      the world's poorest countries and providing it one of the      world's highest per-capita incomes. But freedom did not      follow.       Accordingly to the State Department, ``Qatar's heavy      industrial projects . . . include a refinery with 50,000      barrels-per-day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and      ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these      industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between      European and Japanese firms and the state-owned Qatar General      Petroleum Corporation. The U.S. is the major equipment      supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies      are playing a major role in North Field gas development.'' So      here we see Qatar's commercial sector and government-     controlled oil industry directly engaged with outside      interests--the European Union, Japan and the United States.       We are constantly told this is how freedom takes root in      unfree countries--whether it's China, or Vietnam, or Qatar.      It is not true. Despite billions upon billions of dollars      worth of engagement between Western commercial interests and      Qatar, the people in Qatar have no freedom of speech, no      freedom of assembly, no freedom of religion, no freedom of      association. And women are still subjected.                          ____________________
