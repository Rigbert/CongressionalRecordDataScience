If funding is made available, the Sensor Research/University of Maryland team will examine mercury emissions from several combustion sources and will compare a new family of mercury vapor sensors to state-of-the-art continuous monitoring devices in order to determine the efficacy and fidelity of the newer technology. I understand that these new ``Surface Acoustic Wave'' senors offer the promise of low cost/extremely-high reliability monitoring that can better determine the origin of and transport mechanisms involving this family of pollutants.  I thank the Chairman for his consideration of this proposal and ask that he and Senator Mikulski make this a top priority in Conference.
