 President, a few moments ago, the Senate voted to renew sanctions against one of the worst regimes in the world, the regimethat runs Burma. The situation in Burma is dire. Suu Kyi and the other NLD prodemocracy leaders remain in prison; a crackdown on democracy activists continues; and the SPDC's--that is the name the military thugs who run the country have given themselves--inhumane policies of child and forced labor, rape as a weapon of war, narcotics, human trafficking, and the use of child soldiers remains unchanged.  The swift passage of this resolution, which we did a few moments ago, matches words of support for freedom in Burma with concrete actions. It is past time to judge the military regime in Burma not by what it says but by what it does. The junta misled governments throughout the region into thinking that the May 17 constitutional convention would be a step forward in the reconciliation process, but it was not. The convention was nothing more than a summer camp for the sycophants of the military regime.  I am pleased our allies are increasing pressure on the junta. The European Union recently cancelled the Asia-Europe meeting because of Burma. It is an important step in the right direction. The EU should consider additional sanctions against the military regime.  More must be done. The U.N. Security Council should take up Burma for a discussion and for sanction and ASEAN should abandon the outdated policy of noninterference in member states' affairs.  One common subject must remain and that is the full and unfettered participation of Suu Kyi and the NLD, her political party, and ethnic minorities in a meaningful reconciliation process. I have two words for the regional neighbors of Burma: ASEAN 2006. That is the year Burma takes over chairmanship. That is 2 short years from now, which would result in a tremendous loss of face for that association.  Despite their worst efforts over the past 14 years, the SPDC has failed to smother the flames of freedom in Burma. I continue to be inspired by reports of activists who bravely and nonviolently defy the junta's illegitimate rule, like the handful arrested last month for distributing pamphlets in several Burmese townships marking the 1-year anniversary of the Depayin massacre.  It would be wise for the SPDC to accept the time-tested fact that Suu Kyi and the NLD are not going anywhere. They, and the ethnic minorities, are an integral part of the solution to the Burmese problem.  To wit, the NLD and their supporters made the courageous and correct decision to boycott the sham SPDC-orchestrated constitutional convention last month. I am pleased that international condemnation by the United States, United Nations, European Union and regional neighbors of the hollow convention was rightly aimed at the SPDC. The generals in Rangoon made any number of assurances to foreign diplomats that the process would be inclusive. It clearly was not.  This only underscores the imperative to judge the SPDC not by what it says but by what it does.  The convention turned out to be nothing more than a summer camp for SPDC sycophants. According to the Washington Times, the junta required their handpicked delegates to ``bathe at reasonable times, avoid junk food and live in self-contained camps where they can enjoy karaoke, movies and golf.''  Import sanctions by the United States alone will not help facilitate a meaningful reconciliation process in Burma. We need the U.N., E.U., and regional neighbors to fully commit to the cause. This was made clear by the NLD in a recent plea to U.N. General-Secretary Kofi Annan to ``take this matter to the Security Council''.  The U.N. should help the NLD and the people of Burma by examining the clear and present danger Burma poses to the region. This must include narcotics production and trafficking, the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the region, the gross human rights violations of the SPDC, the plight of Burmese refugees and IDPs, and alarming reports of the junta's interests in North Korean missiles and Russian nuclear technology.  The E.U. should help the NLD and the Burmese people by examining its sanctions regime and imposing further punitive measures against the junta. I am pleased that our allies in the E.U. recently canceled the upcoming Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, dialogue in Brussels over the attendance of the SPDC. The junta has no place at this multilateral table.  Regional neighbors should help the Burmese people buy reconsidering the Association of Southeast Asian Nation's, ASEAN, outdated policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of member states.  Asian leaders must recognize the regime for what it is, wholly illegitimate to the people of Burma, the international community and the region. The SPDC's export of illicit drugs and HIV/AIDS is, literally, burying the children of Asia. All of Asia's youth, not only those in Burma, face a future that is undermined by Burmese-spread drugs and disease.  The region cannot ignore the fact of the junta's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006. There could be no greater loss of face for that association than being under the guidance of the SPDC.  Let me close by thanking all 53 of my colleagues who joined me in sponsoring the sanctions resolution. I want to recognize in particular the efforts of Senators Feinstein and McCain and their respective staffs to support freedom and justice in Burma. The Burmese people have no greater friends in the Senate, or in Washington. I also appreciate the efforts by Senators Grassley and Baucus and their respective staffs to expedite consideration of the legislation.  I would be remiss if I did not note the words of support of the NLD made by former Mongolian Prime Minister Tashika Elbegdorj, the Same Rainsy Party in Cambodia, and the cross-party Burma Caucus formed by Malaysian parliamentarians. Although they are engaged in their own efforts, and, in some cases, struggles, for democracy and human rights in their respective countries, they stand in solidarity with the people of Burma.  I encourage other neighbors to find their voice in support of the Suu Kyi and the NLD during these troubling times.  I thank the 53 cosponsors of this resolution, in particular Senators Feinstein and McCain. Burma has no better friends in Washington than Dianne Feinstein and John McCain.  I also appreciate the efforts of Senators Grassley and Baucus and their respective staffs to move the bill in an expeditious manner.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary of State Colin Powell indicating the State Department's support for the continuation of the sanctions we earlier today imposed with our vote in the Senate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       The Secretary of State,                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2004.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on          Appropriations, United States Senate.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to reaffirm the State      Department's support for the continuation of the restrictions      on imports from Burma, as I stated in my testimony before the      Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations on      April 8. Our sanctions represent a clear and powerful      expression of American disapproval of the developments in      Burma. This action is a key component of our policy in      bringing democracy and improved human rights to Burma, as      well as supporting the morale of Burmese democracy activists.       I support wholeheartedly passage of the Joint Resolution      you introduced along with Senator Feinstein. Thank you for      your leadership on this issue.           Sincerely,                                                  Colin L. Powell.                               ____________________
