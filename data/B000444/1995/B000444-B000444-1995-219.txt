 President, I am introducing a bill today that I do not much like. It involves the so-called Dole-Molinari rules of evidence which the Congress included last year in the 1994 crime law. This provision made a radical change in the Federal Rules of Evidence. It took the unprecedented--and in my mind absolutely unwise and unwarranted--step of allowing unproven allegations of prior crimes to be used against a defendant at trial.  These new rules--which apply in sexual assault and child molestation cases--were added to the crime law over my strenuous objections. My objections were twofold, one substantive and one procedural. I will detail what I believe are the serious substantive problems with the new rules in a moment. First, I must point out that the way these rules were adopted by the Congress contravenes--indeed flaunts--the procedures we have used, with certain modifications, since 1948 for making alterations in the Federal rules.  I am talking about the Rules Enabling Act. That act allows for a thoughtful, inclusive process for considering any changes to the Federal Rules of Evidence--rules which have been on the books for many, many years and which have been relied upon by judges and litigants in countless cases. The Enabling Act process gives the Judicial Conference of the United States, the organization of America's Federal judges, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court a first cut at any proposed changes. The conference, through its various committees, solicits the views of judges, lawyers, and academics who have studied the rules, worked with the rules, and identified any problems with them. The process ensures that the public is given the chance to comment about proposed changes, and guarantees that these comments be considered by the rule-makers.   It is at that point--after the careful, detailed and encompassing review and drafting efforts of the conference--that the U.S. Supreme Court makes recommendations to the Congress for our acceptance or modification. This mechanism is designed to head off unwarranted changes and avoid unintended consequences. And it ensures that decisions about changes in the rules are made in a deliberative, cool-headed way, rather than in the heat of a political moment. Passing as we did the Dole-Molinari rules last year--in a whirlwind rush to bring crime bill negotiations to a close--we thumbed our noses at this most important and worthy process.  I did succeed in structuring the rule change in the crime law to ensure that we would have the benefit of the Judiciary's view, albeit after the fact. The provision was drafted to delay the implementation of the rules to allow the Judicial Conference to weigh in on the issue. This is how it works: The Dole-Molinari rules will go into effect unless we in the Congress repeal them outright or adopt the Judicial Conference recommendations.  I, for one, would prefer a complete repeal. And, I may point out, the Judicial Conference agrees with me. The Judicial Conference itself unanimously voted to oppose the new rules. They have called on us to reconsider our actions and change our minds. They, too, favor a repeal. But they are also pragmatic. So they have sent over a proposal--a most modest of proposals, in my view--to make the rules clearer, cleaner, and a little bit fairer. I am pragmatic as well, and I know that I stand no chance of having the rules repealed, so I am introducing the Judicial Conference recommendations today.  But before we discuss these modest recommendations, I would like to take a minute to talk about the Dole-Molinari rules, and why I believe they are such a bad idea. Here is the way these rules will work. A defendant is on trial for sexual assault. He claims he did not do it. He says that the complaining witness has fingered the wrong man. Under the Dole-Molinari rules, the prosecutor in this case will be able to go out and rummage around for any witness who will testify that, some long and blurry time ago, the defendant was sexually aggressive toward her.  It will not matter that this alleged prior event happened some 20 years ago. It won't matter that the woman never reported the incident to the police. It will not matter that the defendant was never charged or convicted of the crime. It won't matter that the evidence is highly unreliable.  No, none of that will matter. The only thing that will matter to the jury, when it hears this sort of evidence, is that this guy is bad news. And the jury will be able to make the following leap of logic: ``Well, since he did it once, he probably did it again.'' Jurors will also be able to say to themselves something like this: ``I'm not so sure he committed this particular crime that he's now charged with. But he's a bad guy--he hurt that other women, so it's OK for me to convict him today--he has it coming.''  But wait a minute. It is a cardinal tenet of Anglo-Saxon criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution must prove that the accused committed the specific crime for which he now stands accused--not some other bad act and not merely that he is a lousy or wicked person. Or put another way: an accused must be tried for what he did--not for who he is.  Over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court in the case of Boyd versus United States, underscored the importance of the rule against character or propensity evidence. In that robbery case, the court said that evidence of earlier robberies--       Only tended to prejudice the defendants with the jurors--to      draw their minds away from the real issue, and to produce the      impression that they were wretches whose lives were of no      value to the community.  Let us be honest about this. The whole point of these new rules is to increase the number of convictions in sexual assault and child abuse cases. And I believe, without a doubt, that they will do just that. But at the risk of stating what should be obvious: More convictions are not necessarily a good thing. What we want is more convictions of the guilty. If any of those who are convicted under the new rules are actually innocent--and I believe that this is precisely the danger at hand--there is cause only for horror, not celebration.  As Professor Wigmore--one of the preeminent evidence gurus of all time--has said about this sort of evidence: It is the natural tendency of the jury to give the evidence excessive weight--and either to allow it to bear too strongly on the present charge, or to see it as justifying a condemnation, irrespective of the accused's guilt of the present charge. This type of evidence has less to do--in my view--with the search for the truth, than with a blind desire for vengeance.  Now remember, I'm the guy who authored the Violence Against Women Act. It has been my crusade for the past 4 years to have violence against women taken seriously. I have increased the penalties for rape. I have talked to anyone who will listen about the epidemic of violence against women, and about our obligation--our urgent obligation--to put a stop to it now. I devoted an entire Judiciary Committee report to how the criminal justice system is not aggressive enough in its pursuit of rapists and other criminals who make women their targets. I, too, want to see more rapists and child abusers put behind bars. But not at the price of fairness. And not at the expense of what we know in our hearts to be right and just.  And let me clear up one more matter. Evidence of prior uncharged crimes is admitted into evidence frequently. But it is admitted for a legitimate purpose--to help prove, for instance, a pattern of conduct, preparation, identity, plan, intent, or purpose. What we're talking about here is admitting evidence for what in my view--and which for hundreds of years has been considered--a patently illegitimate purpose.  But that's where we are. And the bill I'm introducing today--the Judicial Conference recommendations--doesn't change that. Like the Dole-Molinari rules, the Judicial Conference proposal makes a dramatic aboutface from current practice--and allows for the introduction of propensity or character evidence in sexual assault and child molestation cases.  But the Judicial Conference did make a few very modest changes--which the conference itself describes only as correcting ambiguities and possible constitutional infirmities while still giving effect to Congress' intent. Indeed, this proposal is so modest--and is so in keeping with the intent of the original rules' sponsors--that I will be very interested to hear what possible substantive objections anyone could have about them.  Here are the changes proposed by the Judicial Conference:  The proposal makes it clear that the rules are subject to the other Rules of Evidence. This is totally unremarkable. As everyone knows, all evidence introduced under a particular rule is subject to the other rules--like the rule against hearsay, and the rules allowing judges to balance the prejudicial impact of evidence against its probative value.  What is remarkable is that the Dole-Molinari rules were drafted in such a way as to seem mandatory--they could be read to require a judge to admit the evidence, regardless of whether its prejudice outweighs its probative value, and regardless of whether any other rule would be violated.  That would be wholly unprecedented. The rewrite simply makes it clear that these new rules will work just like all the others. And let me add: The sponsors of the new rules have consistently maintained that the rules are not meant to be mandatory rules of admission, and that the general standards of the Rules of Evidence will apply. This proposal by the Judicial Conference simply makes clear what the sponsors of the rules have forthrightly said is their intention.  The proposal itemizes the different factors that a judge should weigh in deciding whether to admit the evidence. Again, this is an unremarkable idea. It merely gives judges, who are having to completely change how they look at this evidence, some guidance.  It tells them: When you're deciding what to do about this evidence, here are some signposts to consider--like when the uncharged act took place; its similarity to the charged misconduct; the surrounding circumstances; and any relevant intervening events. Again, there is nothing in this idea--simply to give judges some guidance--which would rub against the grain of the sponsors' intentions.  The Judicial Conference proposal would also allow the defendant to use similar evidence in rebuttal. The Dole-Molinari rules, as currently drafted, are unbalanced: under the rules, a defendant can't, in rebuttal, use prior specific instances of conduct to prove that he did not have a propensity to commit the charged crime.  Say, for example, a child testifies under the new rule that his father, the defendant, sexually assaulted him 5 years ago. The father can't put his other kids on the stand to say that he had not assaulted them--to help show that he does not have a propensity to assault children. The Judicial Conference proposal simply gives the defendant the same evidentiary rights as the prosecution.  The Judicial Conference proposal also makes a number of small minor changes. It consolidates the new rules into one--this is simply a clearer, cleaner drafting approach. The proposal also streamlines the definitions--without making any substantive changes--and makes the notice provisions a bit more flexible, and more in keeping with other notice and discovery provisions elsewhere in the rules.  As is by now clear, this is a very unassuming proposal. It allows for the introduction of propensity evidence. It doesn't require that the prior bad act have resulted in a conviction, or even that it have been the subject of a complaint or charge. It doesn't even require that the evidence of the prior uncharged act be particularly reliable.  In fact, had this rule been proposed last year, I would have opposed it. I would have opposed it because I believe that propensity or character evidence should not be admitted into trial. Period. But I can count. And I know that I'm nearly alone on this one. That is why I am introducing this bill--the Judicial Conference recommendations--which only make a handful of modest, but important changes to make the bill clearer and a little bit fairer. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1094       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of      Representatives of the United States of America in      Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
