R. 258, the Five Cent Coin Design Continuity Act. This legislation will allow the U.S. Mint to move forward with a nickel redesign to commemorate the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The bill will also allow the Mint to observe Thomas Jefferson's 260th birthday and honor his many contributions to the founding of our great Nation. I would like to commend Senators Allen and Johnson for their support and commitment to this outstanding effort to honor our history.  Thomas Jefferson's visionary decision to make the Louisiana Purchase opened the North American continent to the expansion of the frontier. Lewis and Clark's adventurous spirit provided the example for many brave pioneers to follow as they explored and settled west of the Mississippi. Thomas Jefferson's foresight and the courage of the members of the Lewis and Clark expedition presaged a legendary time in our Nation's history that emboldened the American spirit.  This period in history truly merits commemoration on our nickel coin. It is important to celebrate these accomplishments and recognize the achievements of individuals who have had such an impact on our Nation's history. I am pleased that the Banking Committee and the Senate could move expeditiously to pass this legislation and I thank Senators Allen and Johnson for their support.
