 Madam President, yesterday, when we were finally allowed to proceed to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, we began making real progress. Ten amendments were offered during the course of the day, four amendments were adopted, and six remain pending. I believe, had we not stopped voting at 5 o'clock, we could have finished the bill and passed it last night. As things stand, we hope to dispose of the six remaining amendments through the course of this morning. We should complete Senate consideration of the bill without further delay.  I should note that the number of Senators who have cosponsored this bill continue to grow--now at 17 Senators. Most of the Senators who offered amendments yesterday praised the underlying bill. I think we have only one pending amendment that regards the underlying bill; only one that actually directly relates to it. Senator Grassley will speak to that amendment. Most of the amendments that have been offered, almost all the remaining amendments pending, aren't within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, they are within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee, and I look forward to the leadership of that committee--the committee of jurisdiction--with respect to guidance on those amendments.  In my view, it would have been better if Senators had withheld their amendments and waited to offer them on the housing and banking legislation that is going to be considered next week by the Senate.
