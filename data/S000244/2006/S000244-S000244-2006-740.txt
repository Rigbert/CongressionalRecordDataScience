SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO PROSECUTIONS                    UNDER SECTION 2422(B) OF TITLE 18, UNITED                    STATES CODE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) a jury convicted Jan P. Helder, Jr., of using a      computer to attempt to entice an individual who had not      attained the age of 18 years to engage in unlawful sexual      activity;       (2) during the trial, evidence showed that Jan Helder had      engaged in an online chat with an individual posing as a      minor, who unbeknownst to him, was an undercover law      enforcement officer;       (3) notwithstanding, Dean Whipple, District Judge for the      Western District of Missouri, acquitted Jan Helder, ruling      that because he did not, in fact, communicate with a minor,      he did not commit a crime;       (4) the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in United States v.      Jeffrey Meek, specifically addressed the question facing      Judge Whipple and concurred with the 5th and 11th Circuit      Courts in finding that ``an actual minor victim is not      required for an attempt conviction under 18 U.S.C.      2422(b).'';       (5) the Department of Justice has successfully used      evidence obtained through undercover law enforcement to      prosecute and convict perpetrators who attempted to solicit      children on the Internet; and       (6) the Department of Justice states, ``Online child      pornography/child sexual exploitation is the most significant      cyber crime problem confronting the FBI that involves crimes      against children''.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) it is a crime under section 2422(b) of title 18, United      States Code, to use a facility of interstate commerce to      attempt to entice an individual who has not attained the age      of 18 years into unlawful sexual activity, even if the      perpetrator incorrectly believes that the individual has not      attained the age of 18 years;       (2) well-established caselaw has established that section      2422(b) of title 18, United States Code, criminalizes any      attempt to entice a minor into unlawful sexual activity, even      if the perpetrator incorrectly believes that the individual      has not attained the age of 18 years;       (3) the Department of Justice should appeal Judge Whipple's      decision in United States v. Helder, Jr. and aggressively      continue to track down and prosecute sex offenders on the      Internet; and       (4) Judge Whipple's decision in United States v. Helder,      Jr. should be overturned in light of the law as it is      written, the intent of Congress, and well-established      caselaw.     SEC. 403.

The      Attorney General shall make all reasonable efforts to cause      such a State to assume such responsibility. If,      notwithstanding such efforts, neither such State will assume      such responsibility, the Attorney General shall place the      person for treatment in a suitable facility, until--       ``(1) such a State will assume such responsibility; or       ``(2) the person's condition is such that he is no longer      sexually dangerous to others, or will not be sexually      dangerous to others if released under a prescribed regimen of      medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment;     whichever is earlier.       ``(e) Discharge.--When the Director of the facility in      which a person is placed pursuant to subsection (d)      determines that the person's condition is such that he is no      longer sexually dangerous to others, or will not be sexually      dangerous to others if released under a prescribed regimen of      medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, he      shall promptly file a certificate to that effect with the      clerk of the court that ordered the commitment. The clerk      shall send a copy of the certificate to the person's counsel      and to the attorney for the Government. The court shall order      the discharge of the person or, on motion of the attorney for      the Government or on its own motion, shall hold a hearing,      conducted pursuant to the provisions of section 4247(d), to      determine whether he should be released. If, after the      hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence      that the person's condition is such that--       ``(1) he will not be sexually dangerous to others if      released unconditionally, the court shall order that he be      immediately discharged; or       ``(2) he will not be sexually dangerous to others if      released under a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric,      or psychological care or treatment, the court shall--       ``(A) order that he be conditionally discharged under a      prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological      care or treatment that has been prepared for him, that has      been certified to the court as appropriate by the Director of      the facility in which he is committed, and that has been      found by the court to be appropriate; and       ``(B) order, as an explicit condition of release, that he      comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric,      or psychological care or treatment.     The court at any time may, after a hearing employing the same      criteria, modify or eliminate the regimen of medical,      psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment.       ``(f) Revocation of Conditional Discharge.--The director of      a facility responsible for administering a regimen imposed on      a person conditionally discharged under subsection (e) shall      notify the Attorney General and the court having jurisdiction      over the person of any failure of the person to comply with      the regimen.

The court shall, after a      hearing, determine whether the person should be remanded to a      suitable facility on the ground that he is sexually dangerous      to others in light of his failure to comply with the      prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological      care or treatment.       ``(g) Release to State of Certain Other Persons.--If the      director of the facility in which a person is hospitalized or      placed pursuant to this chapter certifies to the Attorney      General that a person, against whom all charges have been      dismissed for reasons not related to the mental condition of      the person, is a sexually dangerous person, the Attorney      General shall release the person to the appropriate official      of the State in which the person is domiciled or was tried      for the purpose of institution of State proceedings for civil      commitment. If neither such State will assume such      responsibility, the Attorney General shall release the person      upon receipt of notice from the State that it will not assume      such responsibility, but not later than 10 days after      certification by the director of the facility.''.

Section 2258 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      striking ``Class B misdemeanor'' and inserting ``Class A      misdemeanor''.                 TITLE VI--CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION     SEC. 601. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The effect of the intrastate production,      transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and      possession of child pornography on interstate market in child      pornography.       (A) The illegal production, transportation, distribution,      receipt, advertising and possession of child pornography, as      defined in section 2256(8) of title 18, United States Code,      as well as the transfer of custody of children for the      production of child pornography, is harmful to the      physiological, emotional, and mental health of the children      depicted in child pornography and has a substantial and      detrimental effect on society as a whole.       (B) A substantial interstate market in child pornography      exists, including not only a multimillion dollar industry,      but also a nationwide network of individuals openly      advertising their desire to exploit children and to traffic      in child pornography. Many of these individuals distribute      child pornography with the expectation of receiving other      child pornography in return.       (C) The interstate market in child pornography is carried      on to a substantial extent through the mails and other      instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, such as      the Internet. The advent of the Internet has greatly      increased the ease of transporting, distributing, receiving,      and advertising child pornography in interstate commerce. The      advent of digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well      as videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of      producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive      computer equipment with the capacity to store large numbers      of digital images of child pornography has greatly increased      the ease of possessing child pornography. Taken together,      these technological advances have had the unfortunate result      of greatly increasing the interstate market in child      pornography.       (D) Intrastate incidents of production, transportation,      distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child      pornography, as well as the transfer of custody of children      for the production of child pornography, have a substantial      and direct effect upon interstate commerce because:       (i) Some persons engaged in the production, transportation,      distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child      pornography conduct such activities entirely within the      boundaries of one state. These persons are unlikely to be      content with the amount of child pornography they produce,      transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess. These      persons are therefore likely to enter the interstate market      in child pornography in search of additional child      pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the interstate      market in child pornography.       (ii) When the persons described in subparagraph (D)(i)      enter the interstate market in search of additional child      pornography, they are likely to distribute the child      pornography they already produce, transport, distribute,      receive, advertise, or possess to persons who will distribute      additional child pornography to them, thereby stimulating      supply in the interstate market in child pornography.       (iii) Much of the child pornography that supplies the      interstate market in child pornography is produced entirely      within the boundaries of one state, is not traceable, and      enters the interstate market surreptitiously. This child      pornography supports demand in the interstate market in child      pornography and is essential to its existence.       (E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, transportation,      distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child      pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of custody of      children for the production of child pornography, will cause      some persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease      all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and demand      in the interstate market for child pornography.       (F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the      production, transportation, distribution, receipt,      advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as      the intrastate transfer of children for the production of      child pornography, is essential to the effective control of      the interstate market in child pornography.       (2) The importance of protecting children from repeat      exploitation in child pornography:       (A) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions      today involve images contained on computer hard drives,      computer disks, and related media.       (B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under      the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited.       (C) The government has a compelling state interest in      protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and      this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child      pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.       (D) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography      represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims      and a repetition of their abuse.       (E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband,      and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child      pornography defendants or their attorneys.       (F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child      pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated      violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government      makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing,      and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting      a criminal defense.
