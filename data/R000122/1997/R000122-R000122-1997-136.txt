President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of Mercymount Country Day School of Cumberland, RI, which was recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School.  As I think all in this chamber know, it is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School, since these schools represent some of the cream of our educational crop. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the State level and continuing through a Federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of the very best public and private schools in the Nation are identified as deserving of this honor. These are schools that are particularly effective meeting local, State, and national goals. But, Mr. President, this honor is not about determining who is best, it is about learning what works in educating today's children--the leaders of tomorrow.  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. At the Mercymount Country Day School in Rhode Island, partnerships between parents and teachers have made an enormous difference in the education of their students. They have understood that the quality of education depends not only upon the efforts of schools and government; it also depends upon the ideas and innovation of parents and community. At Mercymount, parent-teacher cooperation has brought computers into the classroom, and their ``Pull the Plug'' on TV initiative has helped students get away from television sets and into reading and other challenging activities. Mercymount has also developed a wonderful fine arts program, and as research has shown, the pursuit of education in the arts at an early age improves a child's cognitive ability. Again, Mercymount is making a huge difference in the lives of its students.  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students, and the techniques that can be replicated in all schools to help all students learn. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like Mercymount Country Day. Under the leadership of its principal, Sister Martha Mulligan, its capable faculty, and its improved parents, Mercymount will continue to be a shining example for years to come.                          ____________________
