Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. John Gabriel Smith, a constituent in St. Mary's County, Maryland, whose courage broke barriers and advanced the cause of integration and equality in our country. This Saturday, he will be honored at the homecoming game at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, DC, where he made history in 1954 as its first African-American graduate.  Along with his two sisters, Gabe--as he is known to his family, friends, and neighbors in St. Mary's County--learned hard work and diligence from his parents amid the turbulent times of Jim Crow as he grew up in the 1940's. He found comfort and calm in the teachings of his Catholic faith and in fellowship at St. Peter Claver Church in Ridge, Maryland. There, he served as an altar boy and met the Jesuit priest who would become his mentor, Father Horace McKenna. Under the guidance of Father McKenna, Gabe developed a deep desire to find God and pursue the priesthood. Asking his spiritual guide what he would need to do, he learned that he would first have to study Latin. However, none of the segregated schools in Southern Maryland offered Latin courses.  From Father McKenna, though, Gabe also learned that Gonzaga College High offered Latin and all the other subjects prerequisite to prepare for the priesthood--and then-Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle had ordered the desegregation of the schools within the Archdiocese of Washington in 1948. Thus, in 1951, Gabe walked into Gonzaga College High as its first African-American student, bravely breaking the color barrier and preparing the way for the more than 1,100 African-American Gonzaga College High students who have followed him.  At Gonzaga College High, Gabe witnessed less of the abusive conditions of segregation that he had encountered in Southern Maryland, and many of his classmates stood with him in solidarity against bigotry outside the school walls. But as a member of the school's Purple Eagle football team, he had to face opposing teams from still-segregated schools whose players and fans directed their ignorance and hatred in his direction. His coach, Joe Kozik, stood by him throughout and presided over a team that rallied around Gabe. He would never forget the support he found among his peers and from Coach Kozik, who became as much a mentor to him as Father McKenna had been.  When Gabe became the first African-American student to graduate Gonzaga College High in 1954, the Supreme Court reached its historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education and required the complete integration of America's public schools. Gabe and others who had already been trailblazers inspired other young African-American students around the country to be the first in their communities to desegregate their local schools as our nation struggled to achieve full enforcement of the Brown decision in the years that followed.  While Gabe never ended up becoming a priest, he nonetheless rooted his life strongly in faith and built a career as a pharmacist upon the foundation in Latin and the sciences that he studied first at Gonzaga College High and then later at Howard University. He worked in the field for more than four decades, retiring this past spring. For many years now, Gabe has been an active member of the Mt. Ennon Baptist Church's Men's Ministry, helping to inspire others to achieve and pursue their own dreams as he did his. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Gabe on his retirement after a long and productive career serving the community in St. Mary's County and on being honored this weekend at his alma mater. I wish him and his wife of fifty years--Mrs. Jeanette Graves Smith--and their entire family well on this happy occasion.                          ____________________
