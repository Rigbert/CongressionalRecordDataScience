 For 50 years, the Jesse White Tumblers troupe has delighted audiences in Illinois and beyond and opened doors of opportunity for thousands of young people.  Jesse White, the man who gave the team its name, is probably best known today as Illinois' secretary of state and the first African American ever elected to statewide office in the ``Land of Lincoln.''  As a child, Jesse White was studious and well behaved. He was also a phenomenal athlete. His passion for sports won him a scholarship to Alabama State University, where he was all-conference in baseball and basketball for all 4 years.  After college, Jesse White served 2 years in the U.S. Army as a paratrooper.  Then sports opened another door for him. Jesse White was able to fulfill what for many of us is only a dream. He played professional baseball for the Chicago Cubs Triple-A farm team.  Returning to Chicago after his baseball days, Jesse White decided to become a Chicago Public Schools teacher. He also worked nights as a physical education teacher for the Chicago Park District.  In 1959, the park district asked him to create an acrobatic show. The result was so impressive that the troupe began performing on a regular basis. Its mission was--and remains--to keep children in school, off of drugs, and out of gangs in the Chicago area. And it has been a huge success.  A half century later, more than 11,000 young people have participated in the Jesse White Tumblers. Becoming a Jesse White Tumbler is no easy task. Thousands of young people apply every year but only a fraction are chosen. To make the team, members must stay in school and maintain at least a C average. They have to obey the law and stay out of gangs and away from drugs and alcohol. In exchange, the young athletes get to experience the excitement and glory of performing before appreciative fans. They also receive tutoring and college scholarship opportunities, performance fees, and a chance to travel and perform around the world.  The power of the Jesse White Tumblers to transform young lives and open new doors may be best illustrated by the story of three brothers. They performed together with the Tumblers, but at some point they decided together to drop out and join a gang. One of the brothers was murdered by a rival gang. The second brother, seeking to avenge his brother's death, killed an innocent man by mistake and ended up going to jail for murder. Instead of following in his brothers' footsteps, the third brother decided to rejoin the Jesse White Tumblers. The direction and discipline he received helped him not only avoid the pitfalls of his siblings but helped him earn a college education and eventually a law degree from the University of Notre Dame.  Multiply that story hundreds or even thousands of times and you begin to understand the importance of the Jesse White Tumblers.  The Jesse White Tumblers have earned their reputation as an icon in the State of Illinois. The program has done wonders, and I wish it another 50 years of continued success.                          ____________________
