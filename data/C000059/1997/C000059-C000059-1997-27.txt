Chairman, due to previously scheduled commitments in my district, I am unable to make the final two votes on H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act. I strongly support the bill, and have voted today for many amendments to strengthen the bill. I oppose the motion to recommit with instructions because such a move would strip the bill of the very provisions which make it good legislation. Thus, I support final passage of the bill. I hope that the Senate will take up this measure quickly and that the President will sign the Juvenile Crime Control Act as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are cases of juvenile crime where Federal prosecutors need the authority to try juvenile offenders as adults. This legislation would grant that authority and make available block grants to restore the effectiveness of State and local juvenile justice systems. This is good legislation which all Members of the House should support.
