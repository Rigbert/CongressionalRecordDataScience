 SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. After making this argument a week or so ago, the American Trial Lawyers Association said there could be some circumstances under which the defendant himself engaged in criminal behavior. So I modified this amendment to include, if the victim of terrorism himself were convicted of a crime in connection with that event, then punitive damages would lie because that would warrant punishment.
