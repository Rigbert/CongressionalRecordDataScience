 I thank the Chair.  Let me briefly summarize. I sincerely believe that the only way to afford victims of violent crime standing under the Constitution to be able to assert a right that is provided is by amendment to the Constitution. I don't use my judgment. This is the judgment of the most distinguished legal scholars.  I know there are strong forces at work in this in front of the scenes and behind the scenes. I know there are some people who believe what we are trying to do is weaken defendants' rights. That is simply not correct. Defendants' rights, as I see them, are basically rights that do not come into collision with the rights we would afford the victims. They are totally different rights. If there is a collision, our view is that the judge then provides the balancing mechanism. This gives the victim a standing in law to assert the right that, in a sense, can't be trusted.  This issue goes down--let me be very candid--on one phrase. That one phrase is the addition of language that would say nothing in this Constitution would abridge the right of a defendant as provided by this Constitution.  That is a paraphrase of what it is.  The Department of Justice insists on that language. We will not get administration support, I believe, without that language. The victims movement believes they would not have sufficient standing in these rights to really assert them in a meaningful way unless they were able to be balanced against the rights of the defendant.  The question I wanted to ask my friend and colleague, Senator Kyl, is I think our challenge in proceeding may be how we could reconcile this with the very real concern of victims that they once and for all--albeit for a limited right but nonetheless real rights--have standing for those rights in a court of law.
