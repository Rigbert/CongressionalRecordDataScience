Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby was indicted a few weeks ago, charged with perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Valerie Plame affair. Everyone is aware of it now. Joe Wilson, former Ambassador, sent to Africa to determine whether assertions by the administration about yellow cake uranium coming from Africa to Iraq were true, reached the conclusion they were not. When he published that conclusion, he was attacked in the press by Robert Novak in a column where Mr. Novak said two White House sources had told him that Joseph Wilson's wife Valerie Plame was a CIA agent.  In fact, she was an undercover agent whose identity was being protected. But the White House, in an effort to discredit its critics and to silencethem, attacked Joe Wilson's wife Valerie Plame and, in the process, disclosed the identity of a CIA agent. There is a question raised as to whether that violates the law. The fact that people work in covert activities and risk their lives for America is something we should never take for granted. The law is designed to protect them. But the White House decided, for political reasons and in order to protect against the disclosure that they were manufacturing intelligence to justify the war, they would attack Joseph Wilson's wife Valerie Plame. For that action and for the statements he made to the FBI and the grand jury, Mr. Libby was indicted. The investigation continues.                          ____________________[Pages S12880-S12881]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         LEWIS LIBBY INDICTMENT
