Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my offending words.  And to the gentlewoman, I do apologize. I get very defensive about my State. We have gone through these battles for the last, actually, 45 years, and we are a State. I have my people to represent, as you do yours. I do apologize for my statement. I recognize it was out of order, so I hope you accept my apology.  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska?
