Speaker, today my colleague Ben Cardin, and I mourn the loss of a gentleman known to many of you in this House and in the international community. For almost 20 years, Sam Wise guided the work of the Helsinki Commission and advanced the cause of human rights around the world.  Ambassador Wise joined the Commission in 1977, the year following its creation, and served with distinction until his untimely death last month. We had the privilege of working with him for more than a decade, and can state without qualification that Sam Wise was the preeminate expert on the Helsinki process and an adept facilitator of its guiding principles. Ambassador Wise participated in every meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and its successor, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. His keen negotiating skills and calm demeanor earned him the respect and trust of the entire OSCE community and substantially enhanced the effectiveness of the Commission in the international arena. He was well known and liked in virtually every European capital.  Ambassador Wise brought to the Commission a wealth of experience from a distinguished career as a Foreign Service officer. During his years with the Commission, that experience and in-depth knowledge of the Helsinki process guided our work and advanced U.S. interests. His efforts helped to shape the policy and institutions which moved the process forward and demanded the world's attention to the plight of those struggling against tyranny and oppression. We believe the Helsinki process was a driving force in bringing an end to the cold war. Ambassador Wise's contribution to that effort is immeasurable.  Mr. Speaker, the death of Ambassador Sam Wise saddens us all and leaves a void in the OSCE and the international human rights community that cannot be filled. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Wise and the family. Know that you are in our thoughts and our prayers, and know that Sam's life of superb accomplishment and dedication to liberty and human dignity is a legacy that will inspire and guide generations to come.                          ____________________
