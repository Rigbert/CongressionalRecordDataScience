 President, on May 27 I sent a letter to President Clinton.  In it, I expressed opposition to the possible nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to fill the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon.  He would be the Deputy Secretary of defense, and it's a big job.  I told the President why I would oppose this nomination--if it's ever made, and I'll give my reasons in just a moment.  But 2 days after writing this letter, the Washington Post ran a story about my opposition to the nomination.  Mr. Hamre was also interviewed.  He attempted to respond to my criticism.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter and the newspaper article be printed in the Record.
