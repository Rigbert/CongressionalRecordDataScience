Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3288 and urge swift passage of this bipartisan bill. H.R. 3288 corrects technical errors in the recently enacted State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, legislation. This important legislation extended the availability of State S-CHIP allotments from prior years to allow States to use this money to continue to provide health care coverage for children. The bill also permitted certain States that had previously covered children with higher incomes through their Medicaid program prior to the creation of S-CHIP to use a small portion of their S-CHIP allotments to pay for the costs associated with covering these children.  Unfortunately, a definition included in the new S-CHIP law inadvertently excluded a number of States. As a result, New Mexico, Maryland, Hawaii, and Rhode Island were barred from being able to use their allotments to pay for the expenses of their kids with higher incomes.  It was always the intent of the sponsors of the S-CHIP legislation that these States would be allowed to use their money in this way. For that reason, my chairman, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), introduced H.R. 3288, which amends the definition of eligible States to correct the technical error.  I would urge all Members to unanimously support this bipartisan bill, which would allow these States to use a portion of their S-CHIP allotments to provide health coverage for their low-income children.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
