Speaker, last week in Columbus, Ohio, thousands of American retirees gathered to demand Congress act.  Pension plans for more than 1 million retirees and union workers are in danger of collapse if something is not done soon. More than 60,000 Ohio workers alone could be impacted, and millions across our Nation face cuts in their earned retirement benefits.  Retirees traveled from as far as Utah to Columbus as the Select Committeeon Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans held a field hearing to hear from retirees and employers. Their jobs ranged from coal miners to truck drivers to candymakers.  As Perry Rapier from Pennsylvania said at the rally: ``We've worked and sweat and toiled into this position, and we've earned that pension; and now to know that somebody that's sitting behind a desk is willing to take that from us, we're going to stand up and fight for that.''  Retirement security is an American value. Workers' pensions must be protected. Congress must find a solution to their earned pensions and give security to the retirement years of millions of hardworking Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I urge this Congress to act before this Congress ends.                          ____________________
