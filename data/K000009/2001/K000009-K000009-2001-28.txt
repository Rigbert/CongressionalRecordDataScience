Speaker, the gentleman knows that members of our subcommittee have been concerned about food safety, and we know that contaminated food products cause an estimated 76 million food-borne illnesses annually in our country. Seafood represents more than 10 percent of the documented illnesses in the United States.  The conferees have accepted report language offered by the other body that calls for the Food and Drug Administration to report by January 1 regarding implementation of regulations by the General Accounting Office with respect to the compliance of seafood producer with HACCP, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.  That language concluded by calling for the development of food safety technologies that could ensure constant safe temperatures of seafood throughout the food chain. As a point of clarification, since some might construe the phrase ``food chain'' in a fashion different than we intend, would the chairman agree with me that our intent is to review the development offood safety technologies through the food supply chain?
