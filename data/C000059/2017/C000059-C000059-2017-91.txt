Chairman, as I mentioned at our full committee markup, I understood that my colleague, Dr. Harris, was offering his amendment to address local concerns from his residents with respect to the visibility of offshore turbines. With all of these offshore projects, many varying viewpoints need to be taken into account. I appreciate that we have been able to discuss many of these views and concerns here today.  It is my hope that we can work with the authorizing committees of jurisdiction, the administration, and all interested stakeholders to identify some better solutions as we move forward through the fiscal year 2018 process.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Tipton). The Chair understands that amendment No. 14 will not be offered.        Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 printed in House Report 115-297.
