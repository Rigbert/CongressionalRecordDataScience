Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2299, the Department of Transportation and Related Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.  I first want to again to congratulate the gentleman from Kentucky (Chairman Rogers) for his excellent work on this legislation. He has done an outstanding job in making difficult choices with very little money and finding the funds to ensure the Nation's transportation infrastructure needs are met.  While I may not agree with every choice made in the legislation, I do recognize his leadership and hard work, and it has resulted in an excellent bill. I want to congratulate him for the work well done in his first term as chairman of the subcommittee.  At the beginning of this Congress, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and I began a process of improving communications between our two committees, and I am hopeful that we can continue to work together to improve our communications and cooperation.  I also would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) for reporting a bill that generally honors the funding guarantees contained in both the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, and the Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century, AIR-21.  However, I still have several concerns about the legislation. First, I have made it clear from the beginning of my term as chairman of Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that I am going to ensure that the guaranteed funding provided by TEA-21 and AIR-21 are respected. These funds are essential to maintaining and improving our ground and aviation transportation systems.  The formula adopted by Congress under TEA-21 and AIR-21 guarantees that our promises are kept to the taxpayers who pay the taxes on fuels for the purpose of improving and maintaining our highways and airports.  A major guarantee of TEA-21 is that as the revenue from taxes increases, those revenues would automatically be distributed to the States through a process called Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, or RABA. Unfortunately, section 310 and section 323 both redistribute RABA funds for NAFTA-related spending in violation of the guarantee provided in TEA-21.  While I do support the object of the funding, strict safety inspections of Mexican trucks, I am concerned that opening up RABA to other purposes is not the appropriate manner in which to solve this problem. For that reason, I will object to this change in the law contained in bill.  The bill was reported with actually 50 legislative provisions that fall within this jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I am not objecting to the majority of these provisions, either because the appropriate consultation with my committee has taken place or because we are able to reach an agreement on the merits of certain actions. However, there will be a number, as I mentioned before, of other provisions that I will object to and raise a point of order that the committee has legislated in an area that is under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.                              {time}  1500  Finally, I want to express my strong support for the amendment to be offered by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo). His amendment is needed to address the significant shortfall in the appropriation to the Coast Guard. It was my understanding that the Committee on the Budget had provided a sufficient Function 400 to cover all the needs of the Coast Guard. Unfortunately, that allocation was not passed along in the Subcommittee on Transportation, which now makes this amendment necessary.  Again, I want to thank the Subcommittee on Transportation of the Committee on Appropriations for its consideration and cooperation. I want to commend the excellent staff of the gentleman from Kentucky (Chairman Rogers) and the staff of the Subcommittee on Transportation for their hard work and willingness to work with my staff.  I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman through this appropriation process to produce the best transportation appropriation bill possible.
