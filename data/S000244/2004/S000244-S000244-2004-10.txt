2873, which contains five noncontroversial items that affect the operations of certain Federal courts. These provisions have been thoroughly scrubbed and will assist the affected judicial districts in their work. I urge the House to pass the measure.  Mr. Speaker, the contents of S. 2873 are as follows:  First, the bill designates Cleveland, Mississippi, as a place of holding federal court. This is necessary because Cleveland is the site for a local prison that houses Federal inmates who cannot be incarcerated elsewhere based on a shortage of Federal facilities in the area.  The provision will allow a federal judge who resides in Cleveland to process the Federal cases there rather than commute to Greenville along with the prisoners. There is no need for building construction or leased space.  Second, the bill designates Texarkana, Texas, and Texarkana Arkansas, as places of holding Federal court. The provision allows the Western District of Arkansas and the Eastern District of Texas to hold court anywhere within the Texarkana courthouse that straddles the border between the two States. This will allow the judges to coordinate their workloads and move their dockets more efficiently.  Third, the bill designates Plattsburgh, New York, as a place of holding court. This provision was part of H.R. 3632, an anticounterfeiting bill, that the House passed earlier this year by voice vote. The Plattsburgh designation will assist the U.S. Customs Service and the Department of Justice in prosecuting criminal activity on the Canadian border and Lake Champlain region.  Fourth, the bill designates Colorado Springs, Colorado, as a place of holding court. This was also part of H.R. 3632. Colorado Springs is home to a number of Federal prison facilities, including one which houses terrorists. The nearest Federal court is 70 miles away. The Marshals Service is especially concerned about transporting terrorists over this expanse.  And fifth, the bill extends an existing authorization to permit the Southern Judicial District of Iowa to hold court in Rock Island, Illinois. The courthouse in Iowa is undergoing renovations which are not yet completed, thereby necessitating the extension.  To conclude, I emphasize that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts endorses this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the other body and our committee in a bipartisan fashion have reviewed these items and we find them meritorious. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2873.  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
