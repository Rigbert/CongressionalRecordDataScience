 We need to pivot to our next task at hand: funding the Department of Defense. This puts financial resources behind all of the policies we just approved today.  Our military leaders have told the Armed Services Committee over and over again--and I have repeated this several times--that stable, predictable, on-time funding is the most important way Congress can support our national defense. It is now 2\1/2\ months into the new year, and we got it done.  To all of my fellow Members here, I thank you again for your support of the national defense authorization bill.  Merry Christmas.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
