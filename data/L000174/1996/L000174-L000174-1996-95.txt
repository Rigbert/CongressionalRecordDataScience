President, let us go on with this debate, as we will. As I said, I support the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona. But let us understand that there are issues here beyond what might be in the applause line at a town meeting back home or at a service club meeting when you say, ``By God, we are taking the money away from those foreigners and putting it right here in America.'' We are not doing that really. When we cut back on all our programs for development and for democracy around the world, we cut back on the potential of American jobs in export, we cut back our own security, we increase the potential that our men and women will be sent into trouble spots worldwide, but also we ignore our moral responsibilities as a country with 5 percent of the world's population using over 50 percent of the world's resources.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
