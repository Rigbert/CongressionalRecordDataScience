President, since the first edition in 1818, the Farmers' Almanac has become an American institution, an informative and entertaining mix of weather, agriculture, humor, and common sense. With the 2017 issue now in print, it is a pleasure to recognize the 200th edition of this venerable publication and to celebrate Maine's remarkable Geiger family that makes it possible.  For its first 137 years, the Farmers' Almanac was published in Morristown, NJ. In 1955, Ray Geiger, who became the almanac's sixth editor in 1934, moved operations to Lewiston, ME, believing--quite correctly--that my State's New England heritage better reflected the publication's guiding ethic of sustainable, simple living.  Ray Geiger led the Farmers' Almanac for 60 years, its longest serving editor. Upon his passing in 1994, his son Peter took the reins after 15 years as associate editor. That same year, Sandi Duncan was named managing editor, the first woman almanac editor in American history.  Under this leadership team, circulation has grown from 86,000 in the 1930s to more than 4 million today. In addition, the almanac's timeless qualities have stepped into the age of technology with an engaging, interactive website and a Facebook page with more than 1 million followers.  Readers enjoy the Farmers' Almanac for its humorous essays, trivia, and advice on everything from gardening to relationships, but the long-range weather forecasts remain its hallmark. The time-tested, highly secret mathematical and astronomical formula produces 16-month forecasts for seven different U.S. climate zones with a significant record of accuracy. In fact, the CEO of a major airline recently confirmed that Farmers' Almanac forecasts are factored into his company's winter contingency planning.  From the first edition to today, Farmers' Almanac editors have worn the honorary title of Philom--for Philomath, a lover of learning. That is an apt title for readers as well as editors, as every edition of the almanac is a mini-encyclopedia of American history, natural science, and a host of other disciplines.  It is a particularly apt title for Peter Geiger, a great champion of education who founded the Adopt-A-School movement in Maine in 1988 and who launched a successful program with Maine elementary and middle schools to encourage and develop young writers. His company provides college scholarships to Maine students, and Peter serves as a member and former chairman of our State's board of education. In 1991, he was named the 618th of President George H. W. Bush's 1,000 Points of Light.  The Geiger family and their company advance the Maine business tradition of service to others by supporting a wide range of civic and charitable endeavors, from the arts to health care to homeless youth. The New Beginnings Ann Geiger Center in Lewiston, ME, named in honor of Peter's mother, provides vital education and skills-development opportunities for homeless and neglected youth. Ray Geiger Elementary School in that same city recognizes the family's many contributions.  The special 200th edition of the Farmers' Almanac includes a celebratory section of vintage articles that take readers through nearly two centuries of American lore, from how to quiet a fussy baby with molasses and feathers to the art of kissing and maintaining household tranquility. Just as important, it stands as proof that hard work, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a commitment to giving back are the key ingredients of success. I congratulate the Geiger family and the Farmers' Almanac for this milestone achievement and wish them all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
