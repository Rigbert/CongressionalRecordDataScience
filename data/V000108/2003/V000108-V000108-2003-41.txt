Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate and honor one of Northwest Indiana's most caring and dedicated citizens, Mr. Wallace Riley. Wally has served on the Lake Station City Council for 24 years and his many contributions to Northwest Indiana will be recognized on November 30, 2003, during a celebratory event at the Lake Station Veterans of Foreign Wars Facility.  Wally began contributing to his community at a young age. In 1947, not long after graduating from Hobart High School in 1944 and working at his mother's grocery store, he began building the Liverpool Paint and Hardware building. Within a year and a half he opened the building for business with his wife, Betty Lou Ele and ran the company for 43 years. Wally also served in Civil Defense for two years, and then was named Civic Defense Director for another two years. In 1948, he joined the Liverpool Volunteer Fire Department as a director, and was then made an honorary fireman of the East Gary (now Lake Station) Fire Department in 1974, and still serves as an active member today. He also donated his garage building to the East Gary Fire Department Battalion for 15 months.  Wally has selflessly contributed to Northwest Indiana in many ways including serving as a Democratic Precinct Committeeman for a total of 13 years, as well as directing and sponsoring the building of a new sidewalk in front of Evans School in Lake Station. He also worked with various Lake County Councilmen to pave many local streets, to widen 35th Avenue, and he has participated in many local projects in Lake Station as a volunteer. He joined the East Gary Chamber of Commerce and served as Director, Vice President, and President during his tenure with the organization.  Although Wally has served on numerous committees and has donated his time throughout his entire life to his Northwest Indiana Community, he has never neglected to provide support and love for his family. Wally and his wife Betty Lou, have four children, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, Wally Riley has given his time and efforts selflessly to his community and has provided leadership and dedication to all of Northwest Indiana. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Mr. Wallace Riley on his outstanding accomplishments throughout his life. His career of service to his community is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
