Chairman, this is a critically important amendment that I offer on behalf of the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest], the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Castle], myself, and all the Members, I believe, of the delegations of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This is obviously a Central to South Atlantic problem.  Mr. Chairman, our amendment seeks to address a growing environmental and health problem in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and throughout the Atlantic seaboard. Many of my colleagues may be familiar with the microscopic organism called Pfiesteria. While this organism has been in the environment for millions of years, current conditions in the waterways have triggered the cell to move into at least 24 different stages, some of which are toxic.  Mr. Chairman, in the past few years, several of these stages have become lethal to fish and cause adverse effects to humans who come in contact with it. While North Carolina has previously witnessed a fish kill on its shores in the billions, in late August Maryland experienced a prolonged fish kill on the lower Pocomoke River in the district of the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest].  Mr. Chairman, just yesterday I spoke with Maryland Governor Glendening, who informed me of yet another fish kill, which my colleagues read about today in the Washington Post.                              {time}  1500  This elusive microscopic organism has been blamed for killing over 30,000 fish in the Pocomoke River alone this summer, as well as causing adverse health effects, and this is a critical point, to humans, including skin lesions, respiratory problems, memory loss, and immune system depression.  All of the States from Delaware to Florida are concerned by this organism and its effects on human health, tourism, and the economy. In Maryland, it has already begun to take a tremendous toll on the seafood industry.  Our amendment, Mr. Chairman, will appropriate $7 million to the Centers for Disease Control to address the emerging issue of human health effects from exposure to Pfiesteria. Specifically they will develop and implement a multistate disease surveillance system that will identify and monitor health effects in people who have been exposed to waters likely to contain this organism.  The CDC, Mr. Chairman, is well-equipped to work with State health departments and university laboratories, and these funds will be used to develop a multistate response which will focus on waters in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
