 President, finally, our tax fairness bill ensures that military families receive comparable tax treatment for child care expenses. Most American workers are permitted to exclude from income $5,000 of employer-provided child care expenses. A separate blanket exclusion is provided to the military for all benefits. The provision, however, does not specify the treatment of military-provided child care expenses and some confusion has resulted. Our bill confirms this exclusion from military personnel. This ensures that military-provided child care is not treated less favorably than employer-provided child care or other military-provided benefits.  Increased focus on national defense no doubt renews our deep appreciation for the members of our military. These men and women make tremendous sacrifices, and in some cases, risk their lives to protect and defend our freedom. It is a perfect time to ensure that men and women in service are treated fairly under our country's tax laws. In closing, I would like to thank those who continue to serve in the United States military and protect the freedoms that we so frequently take for granted. I thank my colleagues and urge them to vote for this important tax fairness measure.
