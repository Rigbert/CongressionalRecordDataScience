  Hanford is the biggest, most toxic defense nuclear facility in the United States. Its recent annual budgets have cost American taxpayers almost $2 billion per year. Hanford is home to 80 percent of this Nation's spent plutonium. Its radioactive and other toxic materials are being stored in dangerous conditions and/or are already seeping into the ground water, toward the Columbia River. In other words, Hanford is a costly mess.  Earlier this year, Senators Johnston and Murkowski introduced their vision of how to improve cleanup at Hanford. In S. 871, which this amends, they suggest abandoning the environmental agreement between the Federal Government and the State of Washington and allowing the Department of Energy to establish its own cleanup agenda and environmental standards. We cannot support that approach because we believe the people of the region must have a say in the way cleanup is conducted. The people of the Tri-Cities proudly built Hanford; they deserve a role in restoring Hanford.  So, we take a different approach and offer a comprehensive bill addressing many issue impacting the cost and speed of cleanup at Hanford. The most fundamental and sweeping concept of the bill is its emphasis on increasing the role of the State in regulating cleanup. We create a single regulator primarily applying a single law: The State assumes jurisdiction of CERCLA, or Superfund. The amendment also reaffirms the Tri-Party Agreement, ensuring the people of the Tri-Cities and Washington State continue to have a voice in Hanford cleanup and restoration.  Anther important aspect of this amendment is its emphasis on the adjacent community and its stability. The people of the Tri-Cities have worked hard to help America win the cold war. They have sacrificed their environment and given of their working lives. This amendment encourages new companies to provide a continuity of benefits and preferential hiring to former site employees. It urges private contracts to be let to companies based in the area. It also encourages greater privatization and commercialization of new technologies in order to attract new businesses to the area--and then keep those companies there after cleanup is completed.  The amendment contains several other concepts I would like to emphasize. It streamline decisionmaking by giving a presidentially-appointed site manager significantly more authority to make decisions, transfer money, negotiate contracts, waive duplicative regulations, manage personnel, and select cleanup remedies. The amendment also establishes a land use council to help define cleanup objectives and standards for areas on the Superfund national priorities list. Finally, it urges a stable level of funding for cleanup to allow long-term planning.  I want to conclude by saying that this truly is a bipartisan amendment. We elected officials, Democrats and Republicans representing both State and Federal Government, put our energy together to find solutions to the problems facing Hanford. We worked long and hard and none of us got everything we wanted. Had I been the sole author of this amendment, it would have been a different bill. However, I strongly support most of this amendment and believe it will hasten cleanup and benefit the people we represent--and the people who elected us and this Nation's taxpayers. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate and with Representatives Hastings and Dicks, Governor Lowry, and Attorney General Gregoire to push this amendment and make it the law.                          ____________________
