President, I join as an original cosponsor of the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997.  One of the most important rights that we can safeguard for crime victims is the right to be heard in connection with sentencing decisions for the perpetrators of the crimes that changed their lives. When I was privileged to serve as State's attorney for Chittenden County, I tried to inform crime victims of the status of cases and to involve them, not only as witnesses at trial, but during the sentencing proceedings as well. Lawyers call this a right of allocution. To victims, it is a right to be heard. A similarly important right for victims is the right to witness the trial of the accused.  Congress has addressed a victims' right of allocution and right to witness trials several times in recent years. In 1990, Congress passed the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act, commonly known as the victims bill of rights. This legislation expressly provides that crime victims shall have the right to be present at all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial.  In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress included several provisions granting victims the right of attendance at trials and allocution in sentencing hearings. For instance, the legislation provides for a specific right of allocution by amending rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, thereby requiring Federal judges at the sentencing for a crime of violence or sexual assault to address the victim personally if the victim is present at sentencing and to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement or presentation. The legislation also authorizes courts to hear victim impact testimony at capital sentencing proceedings, and requires courts to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement or present any information in relation to the sentence.  Finally, last year, Congress enacted the Televised Proceedings for Crime Victims Act as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Responding to the difficulties created for victims of the Oklahoma City bombing when the trial was moved to Denver, the statute was designed to provide a closed circuit feed back to the victims and their families in Oklahoma City.  The Supreme Court has also ruled that victim impact statements are permissible in death penalty cases. In the 1991 case Payne versus Tennessee, the Supreme Court said that a sentencing jury in a capital case may consider victim impact evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the victim's family. The Court made clear that it is an affront to the civilized members of the human race to say that at sentencing in a capital case, a parade of witnesses may praise the background, character, and good deeds of the defendant, but nothing may be said that bears upon the character of, or the harm imposed upon, the victims.  Although Congress and the Supreme Court has made progress over the last 20 years in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have more to do, especially with regards to a victim's right of allocation and right to witness trials. Although I spoke of the need to do more with regards to these issues last year when Congress enacted the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, this need was highlighted by the recent district and appellate court rulings on motions in the Oklahoma City bombing cases. The courts ruled that the victims are categorically excluded from both watching the trial and providing victim impact statements. Thus the victims are faced with the excruciating dilemma of having to choose between attending the trial and testifying at the sentencing proceedings. If they sit outside the courtroom during the trial, they may never learn the details of how the justice system responded to this horrible crime. On the other hand, if they attend the trial, they will never be able to tell the jury the full extent of the suffering the crime has caused to them and to their families.  The law as it is, has been written by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court does not thrust this painful choice upon the victims. However, the recent district and appellate court rulings on motions reveal the need to clarify existing law. In this regard, let me specify what the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 would and would not do.  The law would:  Clarify that a court shall not exclude a victim from witnessing a trial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, make a victim impact statement.  Clarify that a court shall not prohibit a victim from making a victim impact statement solely because the victim had witnessed the trial.  Just as importantly, the law would not:  Eliminate a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's testimony that creates unfair prejudice, confuses the issues, or misleads the jury.  Attempt to strip a defendant of his or her constitutional rights.  Overturn any final judicial rulings.  The defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case have argued to the court that, despite the victims' rights laws, the court has the responsibility to safeguard against any identifiable risk that emotion could overwhelm reason when the victims provide their victim impact testimony. According to the defendants, the only way that the court can meet this responsibility is to provide the victims with the Hobson's choice of witnessing the trial or providing victim impact statements. However, to paraphrase Justice O'Connor's eloquent statement in the Payne versus Tennessee case, the possibility that evidence may in some cases be unduly inflammatory does not justify a prophylactic, constitutionally based rule that this evidence may never be admitted.  It is for this reason that I am joining my cosponsors to clarify what rights victims in this country should and do have. There is more that needs to be done in this regard, but with this bipartisan legislation, we are taking an important and timely step in the right direction.                          ____________________
