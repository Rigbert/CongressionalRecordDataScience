 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach], and the other Members who have risen in opposition to this amendment. But in all due respect, what this amendment is about is one very, very simple fact. That is, whether the Members of the House of Representatives will exercise their constitutional responsibility and vote on issues of enormous consequence to the people of this country.  It makes no sense that we debate endlessly on $1 million appropriations, and then absolve ourselves of the responsibility of debating and voting on legislation and on an appropriation that could cost the taxpayers of this country $20 billion.  What this amendment is about is that when we go home, we will tell our constituents that we have the guts to deal with the tough issues; we will have the guts to say that if another bailout is requested, we vote it yes or we vote it no, but we did not duck the issue.  So for all of those people in the House who think that we have got to stand up and be counted, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
