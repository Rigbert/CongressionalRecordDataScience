Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his consideration and also the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Mollohan], the ranking member.  The fiscal year 1997 House report and conference report on Justice Department appropriations included language urging the Department of Justice within funds available for Byrne grants to give favorable consideration to funding for the community security program of the Local Initiative Support Corporation. As a result, Justice is now working with LISC to form partnerships in a number of communities in which local community-based organizations are willing to work with law enforcement officials to promote a more livable neighborhood. Using funds from private philanthropic organizations and corporations, LISC has had great success in promoting local community security efforts in New York and Seattle. There is great interest in this program in my State, and I am particularly pleased that LISC is working in Toledo, OH. It is my hope that Justice will once again be asked to give proposals from LISC favorable consideration.
