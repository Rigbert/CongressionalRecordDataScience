The point I want to get across is that according to EPA figures--this was true back in the previous administration also--70 percent of those cleanups are paid for by the polluter. It is inaccurate to imply that they are not doing it. When you let a tax expire, as they did in 1995--again, this is not a partisan thing because that happened during the Clinton administration--that is a tax on businesses that has nothing to do with polluters. These are not polluters who are paying this tax. They could be anyone out there. But the fact is that this administration is making the request for $1.38 billion and the fund is there.  You can talk about Florida all you want. I ask my friend from Florida if he is aware that the most devastating Superfund site in America is in my State of Oklahoma. No one else is even close.
