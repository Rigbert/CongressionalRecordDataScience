 President, at the end of this year, Dr. Eileen Schmitt, a friend and fixture in our Wilmington community, is retiring, and I want to share her inspirational story because there is much all of us can learn from her.  As we debate health care, again, and again, and again in this Chamber, Dr. Schmitt has lived the life Mother Teresa called for when she said: Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.  A talented medical doctor who rose to become president and chief executive officer of St. Francis Hospital, she walked away from her fancy title and big desk in 2001 to do her true calling, healing the poorest in our community. She became the medical director for the St. Clare Medical Van, making her rounds in a mobile van to provide free health care to those who have no insurance.  The van pulls up, and there may be 20 people waiting--some earn minimum wage, some don't have a job, some are homeless, many are children--and she asks for no money, no insurance. She just sees to their medical needs.  As part of her work, she arranges for doctors to donate their time, and launched drives to create a pharmaceutical fund for prescription medicines for her patients. If funds are low or a patient needs something right away, she buys it herself. That is the type of person she is.  And in her spare time, you can find her teaching her patients English, and bringing clothes to the families she visits.  When someone asked her why she does it, she explained:       When I first went into medicine, I wanted to do missionary      work. I think getting back to taking care of people--     especially people who don't have the means to get medical      care--helps to fulfill my initial calling.  The acts of love and compassion she provides every day may seem small in our prosperous country of 300 million people, but America would be much less of a Nation were it not for Dr. Schmitt.  Her patients call her their angel, and indeed she has been one to them. But she also is an inspiration to all Americans, reminding us that small acts, one person at a time, touch and change our neighborhoods.  I know Senator Carper, Congressman Castle, and all my colleagues thank Dr. Schmitt and wish her happiness and health as she retires.                          ____________________
