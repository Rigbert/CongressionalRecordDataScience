Speaker, let me say that I support the traditional definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, but I believe, like Vice President Cheney, that this is an issue that should be regulated by the States, as it has been throughout the history of this great Nation.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) stated on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal and I quote, ``The Federal marriage amendment would do more harm than good were it to be enshrined in our charter.'' That is the statement of the chairman of their policy committee.  Through their legislatures and courts, the States have proven quite capable of determining the legal definition of marriage. I believe the proper venue to consider decisions affecting this issue is in State courts and legislatures, and yes, with the people of the individual States. Thus, I oppose this constitutional amendment which is, at its core, based on intolerance and is a patently obvious effort to energize a part of the Republican Party's base and inflame the passions of others.  None of us should ignore the Republican majority's real intent here today. This constitutional amendment represents the perfect marriage of raw political cynicism and distraction. Everyone in this Chamber understands that this amendment is not going to pass. In fact, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) said again in the Wall Street Journal, ``The Federal marriage amendment is more symbol than substance given the near impossibility of a two-thirds vote.''  Even the majority leader himself acknowledged as much this week, telling Congress Daily, ``I think it is really important to put Members on the record, particularly before an election.'' Orval Faubus would have agreed with that; George Wallace would have agreed with that; Lester Maddox would have agreed with that.  The majority leader's decision to move this amendment to the floor just 7 months after stating that it was unlikely to be considered this year is more than ironic, it is patently political. The purpose in bringing this amendment to the floor today, just 4 weeks before the election, is to create the fodder for a demagogic political ad that appeals to voters' worst fears and prejudices rather than, as we should do, to their best instincts.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, given that this amendment is not going to pass, it is nothing short of amazing and irresponsible that we are spending time debating this issue on the floor today.                              {time}  1500  Again as our colleague from California (Mr. Cox) pointed out, there have been more than 130 amendments to the Constitution proposed in our history regarding marriage. The gentleman from California pointed out not one of those amendments has ever been voted on in either House because the leadership in those houses over those years thought those 130 amendments did not belong on the floor. How sad it is that we do not have that kind of leadership today.  At midnight tonight, my colleagues, the new fiscal year begins. How many of 13 must-pass appropriation bills have passed? One. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority's legislative malfeasance is on full display today. The appropriations process is in meltdown. This Republican Congress has failed to enact a budget, failed to enact intelligence reform, failed to enact energy reform, failed to enact the reauthorization of the highway bill, failed to enact the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The list goes on and on. Yet with all that outstanding legislation, with all of America's business bottled up and pending, we consider a constitutional amendment that the chairman of the policy committee on the Republican side says will not pass. How patently political today is.  Mr. Speaker, this Republican majority has failed. The American people deserve better. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
