President, about 15 minutes ago I was handed this stack of paper. It is not uncommon for us to receive bills of great consequence and great moment only a few minutes before we are asked to vote on them. We rely on good staff work and hope they give us some insight into what the legislation means.  This piece of legislation, of course, represents the proposed tax bill--457 pages. I will hazard a guess that very few Members of the Senate will have a chance to study it or reflect on it or even ask for a response from others before we are asked to vote in a very few minutes. That is not unusual.  I don't want to suggest that this is an extraordinary situation, but it is extraordinary in this respect: What we are being asked to vote on in this tax bill will literally have an impact on America for 10 years, long after many of us have gone from the scene. Long after this President has finished his tenure in the White House, the impact of this bill will still be felt. So it is important for us to pause and reflect on what we are doing. We are being asked to sign onto a tax cut proposed by the White House, originally, and now crafted by the leaders in the House and the Senate, which will have a dramatic impact on the economy of this country.  It is a tax bill which doesn't affect just next year but in fact goes into effect sometimes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years from now. Someone noted that the marriage tax penalty provisions, which I believe under the new bill go into effect in 2009 or 2010, will go into effect after many currently married couples are no longer married; many who are contemplating marriage will have been married and perhaps will no longer be married.
