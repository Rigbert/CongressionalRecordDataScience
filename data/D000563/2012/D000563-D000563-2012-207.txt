I am stuck because I have a child or a spouse with a problem. The real world of human experience tells us this happens all the time. It makes me wonder sometimes. There are 8 or 9 million Americans--almost one out of three Americans--not covered by this Romney plan. How does this solve any problems? If we are not going to have health insurance we can count on when we need it, it is worthless. It is a subsidy the insurance company doesn't pay off when the family needs it.  I didn't mean to interrupt the Senator from Iowa, but I wanted to make that point very strongly.
