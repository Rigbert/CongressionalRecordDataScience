I have some very substantial reservations about age increase. Particularly--it was in the Ryan bill--it doesn't get you any money in the next 10 years so it will not help us get to that fiscal crisis.  What I have said, and I'll repeat, is you have the right to put everything on the table; we have a right to put everything on the table. If you're going to have an honest negotiation, we ought to consider everybody's point of view. That's what I've said.
