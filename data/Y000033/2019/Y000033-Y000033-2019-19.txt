Chair, I also insert in the Record a letter in strong opposition to this bill signed by over 20 entities, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Consumer Energy Alliance.                                                September 5, 2019.     U.S. Congress,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: We rely on American made energy to      power our daily lives, communities and to grow a more      prosperous future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable,      abundant and affordable energy so that our families,      communities and businesses can all share the opportunities      American energy creates. Our country cannot afford to block      access to new energy supplies and risk losing our energy      advantage. That's why we ask you to oppose legislation being      considered by the U.S. House of Representatives next week      that would slow scientific surveys and prevent access to new      sources of American offshore energy in the Outer Continental      Shelf.       For more than seven decades, energy development in the Gulf      of Mexico has worked collaboratively alongside tourism,      fishing and Defense Department training activities. But H.R.      205 would permanently extend the eastern Gulf of Mexico      moratorium on oil and natural gas activities. The      Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates that      this could cost taxpayers $400 million in revenue over the      next 10 years. Similarly, H.R. 1941 would block offshore      energy development in the Pacific and Atlantic planning      areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy resources in the      Alaskan Coastal Plain.       Congress should support progress. Modern energy      technologies have enabled an impressive record of      environmental stewardship and innovation. But when the      government chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close off      areas to exploration and potential development, we simply      increase our dependency on foreign sources. This reality is      visible in places like California and Massachusetts. Despite      abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, California      imports 57 percent of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent      of which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, to meet energy      needs each winter, Massachusetts imports liquefied natural      gas from Russia.       American energy is produced with a smaller carbon footprint      under significantly stronger environmental protections than      energy produced anywhere else in the world. We ask you to      embrace these homegrown opportunities that benefit American      families, create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy      and protect our environment.       Next week, the House of Representatives is expected to      consider legislation undercutting domestic energy security      and economic opportunity by limiting American energy access.      We urge you to reject these bills and instead stand up for      energy produced in America, by American workers for the      benefit of American families.           Sincerely,       American Chemistry Council, American Council of Engineering      Companies, American Forest & Paper Association, American Gas      Association, American Iron and Steel Institute, American      Petroleum Institute, American Pipeline Contractors      Association, Consumer Energy Alliance, Distribution Pipeline      Contractors Association, Energy Equipment and Infrastructure      Alliance, Independent Petroleum Association of America.
