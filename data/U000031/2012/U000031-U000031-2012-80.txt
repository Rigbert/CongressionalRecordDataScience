I appreciated your input during your phone call to me last week back in Michigan when the Senate passed this amendment. Our committee has focused on this issue, and you have been an outstanding partner with Congressman Ed Whitfield and Congresswoman Bono Mack on this.  When used properly, we know that these medications provide needed therapies for those suffering from pain. However, the abuse of some of those products has devastated communities and destroyed families across the country. So, as we move forward on this bill in our discussions with the Senate, I hope that we can continue the partnership and be able to work this issue out.  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of my time be controlled by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).
