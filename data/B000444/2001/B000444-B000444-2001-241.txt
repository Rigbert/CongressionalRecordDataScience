 President, I listened with great interest to my friend from Wisconsin when he talked about showering money by special interests. Yesterday, he and I voted on a bill on ergonomics where the outfit that most wanted that bill not stripped away was the labor community which, if we take his definition broadly, showered money on everyone here. I don't even accept PAC money. Yet I did not hear anybody stand up yesterday and say the reason we voted for ergonomics was that labor showered money upon this body. I find it somewhat unusual that there is such selective judgment about how money is showered on this body.  I wish the Senator was still here. I am also interested in what he constantly refers to as the arbitrary nature of this bill. It seems to me the definition of arbitrary is whatever the Senator from Wisconsin doesn't like, because such an arbitrary bill as this passed with 70 votes last year, and it has been improved even further than last year. It passed with 306 votes just a couple of days ago over in the House of Representatives. It must mean that two-thirds of the Senate last year--and I realize it has changed by several votes on this side now--and 306 of 435 Members over there are obviously very arbitrary. This bill is supposedly so partisan that it has had broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.  I also point out that, having been involved with President Clinton relative to his veto of the bill last year, the single most important thing the President wanted done through the help of Senator Schumer--and, through the leadership of Senator Schumer, it was done in this bill--was that he was very concerned about a provision that possibly would allow someone who had violated the so-called FACE--that is, bomb an abortion clinic or do physical damage to the building or to persons working in there--to then come along and declare bankruptcy on the grounds that they should not have to pay the civil judgments against them. That meant a great deal to President Clinton, to me, and to a lot of other people.  That was the primary reason President Clinton vetoed this bill last year. That provision is no longer exempted from this bill. It is part of the bill. One of the nondischargeable debts under bankruptcy in this legislation is for someone who has a judgment against them for violating the rule. That is called the FACE law, relating to intimidating or doing damage to abortion clinics or persons who work in them.  I also find interesting one thing the Senator said. I think he is correct. He pointed out that mothers filing bankruptcy even though their husbands are gone must still count their husbands' income.  That is not what was intended in the bill. I will give you an example. On the section from which the Senator from Wisconsin read, there was a drafting error here in all the provisions save one that I am aware of. It says:       . . .if the current monthly income of the debtor, or in a      joint case the debtor and the debtor's spouse. . . .''  That means that if the debtor is all by herself and has not filed for bankruptcy jointly, then you do not count the husband's income. That was not intended. But there is a section where it is written differently and could be read differently. That is in section (7), on page 17 of the bill.  Section 7, in subsection (2) says:       . . . if the current monthly income of the debtor and the      debtor's spouse combined, as of the date of the order for      relief when multiplied by 12, is equal less than. . . .  It should read: if the current monthly income of the debtor, or in the case of a joint filing by the debtor and their spouse. . . .  It is my intention, as one of the people who supports this bill, to see that it is changed in the managers' amendment, so it reads as it was intended.  But after that, what I heard added up to an awful lot of--how can I say this--well, I will not characterize it. I do not think it was particularly accurate. So since this is the first time I have spoken to this bill on the floor, let me go into a little more detail. But I am going to go into a great deal of detail on each of these amendments that are about to be offered.  First, the idea of a fresh start is absolutely fundamental to the American way of life. Bankruptcy must remain available for those who really need it. And it does. Let's put in perspective what we are talking about. If you listened to the critics of the bill on the floor, it would sound as if we are eliminating bankruptcy. The only issue at stake here is whether or not someone files bankruptcy in chapter 7 or chapter 13. Right now, I might point out toyou, bankruptcy judges are supposed to lay out in chapter 7--chapter 7 is one of those places where you eliminate all your debt. Chapter 13 is where you say: I want to eliminate most of my debt, but I can pay back some of it. I can pay back some small percentage of it. And they set out a schedule to pay back some small percentage of it.  What we are talking about is a situation where someone who files in chapter 7, who is able to pay some of their debt, and should be filing in chapter 13 right now--a bankruptcy judge or a master must, in fact, look at that circumstance and say: This is an abusive filing. He really should be filing in chapter 13. But guess what. There is no uniform standard nationwide. It is left up to every bankruptcy judge to determine what is abusive and what is not abusive.  So what are do we doing here? The essence of what we are doing is laying out the standard at which a bankruptcy judge must look to determine whether or not the filer is abusing the system going into chapter 7 as opposed to chapter 13.  Why are we doing that? We are doing that because a lot of the very people I represent, and that my friend from Wisconsin and others talk about all the time--working-class folks--are getting hurt by the way bankruptcy is abused now. Because what simply happens is, all those debts that they incur--and they never filed bankruptcy before--cost them more money. It costs them more money at Boscov's when they go buy a $100 item because people have declared bankruptcy who could be paying back something. It costs them more money.  The average person in America, the person who really is in a crunch, is hurt the most because interest rates go up, the cost of financing, buying the new bed or refrigerator goes up.  You don't have to just listen to me about this. Unnecessary and abusive bankruptcy costs everyone. The Clinton administration's own Justice Department concluded that our current system costs the economy $3 billion a year. And they made the pursuit and prosecution of bankruptcy abuse a high priority.  This is not an imaginary problem. It is not going away. This week we are taking up a bill that is identical to the conference report that enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate--70 in the Senate and 308 in the House. During the debate, we have already heard from some of my colleagues who claim that they support the general idea of eliminating abuse in bankruptcy, but they oppose the particulars.  Now, again, this costs every single solitary consumer. If you are making $300,000 a year, you don't have to buy your sofa bed on time. If you are making $300,000 a year, you don't have to buy your refrigerator on time. Where I come from--my family --you buy them on time. And it costs them money. It costs them money--a lot more money--because these folks do not write off this debt and say: I didn't get paid. I didn't get paid back for all that was owed me here, so forget it. I will just take it out of my bottom profit line. They say: No. I have to make it up.  So what do they do? They charge my mother and father more money to buy the refrigerator because they can't buy it other than buying it on time.  So I am having it about up to here with how this is hurting so many poor people. I will get to that in just a minute.  During this debate, we have had raised many charges against the legislation. I think it is fair to say that the concerns I have heard so far--and over the last 4 years that we have been dealing with this legislation--I find it fascinating my friend from Wisconsin and others have said that we were going to bring this bill right to the floor. The reason it did not get brought to the floor is yours truly, me. I made it clear they would get none of my support, no one would get my support on this bill if, in fact, it did not go back through the committee system, if it did not go back to the Judiciary Committee, if it did not go through the normal procedure.  As I said, this is the same bill, by and large, with a couple improvements, that passed with 70 votes last year. The biggest charge you hear is this is antiwoman and antichildren who depend on child support, and that it is unfair to low-income families which need the full protection of chapter 7 or straight bankruptcy. I want to briefly address both of these concerns. And I will go into more detail when my colleagues want to come and debate this issue.  First, I want to point out a significant achievement reached in the Judiciary Committee on the question of those who have tried to hide in bankruptcy from the penalties imposed on them for violating the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Senator Schumer, as I mentioned earlier, first brought this issue to our attention. We finally reached an agreement in the committee with this major step forward. The compromise that we put forward is part of the bill that no one--no one--who violates the FACE Act, the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act, can, in fact, avoid their responsibility in bankruptcy.  Now as to those specific charges of unfairness. First, there is the claim that the bill will leave women and children who depend on child support worse off than they are today. This is perhaps the easiest charge to refute because the legislation before us today has the endorsement of the National Child Support Enforcement Association. The National Child Support Enforcement Association--they are all the folks in all of our States who sit there behind counters, working for the State, who are trying to collect support payments and child support from deadbeat husbands. These are people on the side of the women and children who need their support payments made to them. They support this bill.  The National District Attorneys Association--and specifically because of the important new protection for women and children who depend on family support payments--and other professionals whose job it is to enforce family support payments every day, from the California Family Support Council to the Corporation Counsel for the City of New York, have endorsed these new protections as well. That is because there are new specific protections for family support payments in this bill.  Let's go through how it currently works. One thing the Senator said is correct: Bankruptcy is a complicated issue. Hopefully, the vast majority of Americans will never have to become acquainted with it.  Under current law, we tell creditors they can't collect debts owed them starting right away, as soon as someone files bankruptcy. Put another way, I go in and file bankruptcy. I owe child support and support payments. I file for bankruptcy. In the vast majority of States, immediately all creditors have to back off, including mom and the kids. That means a woman owed alimony or child support can't collect either.  I am one of the authors of the deadbeat dad legislation to put more pressure on States to go after deadbeat dads. All of a sudden, once somebody files bankruptcy, in most States in America now, mom is out, the kids are out. Bankruptcy stays the proceeding.  All those hard-working folks in the family court in Delaware trying to see to it that Johnny and Mary and Alice get something to eat and mom gets a support payment, they can do nothing. They have to stand back, instead of bringing that deadbeat dad in and arresting him and garnishing his wages. That is why the national child support agencies support this bill. That is why they want it. It improves the plight of women and children who, by the way, can't wait 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 10 weeks, 5 months while the bankruptcy is proceeding, as they have to now.  This bill gives child support and alimony the first and highest priority among any claim able to be made in bankruptcy. Do you know where they are under present law, the law my friend seems to love so much? They rank No. 7, S-E-V-E-N. This bill says you have to be fully paid up on child support and alimony before you can be released from bankruptcy. You have to be fully paid up or you don't get out of anything via bankruptcy. A woman collecting child support or alimony must, under section 219 of this bill, be notified of the full array of family support enforcement rights and available options to her under Federal law, including the kind of wage attachments that will trump every other claim in and out of bankruptcy.  So there is an affirmative requirement under this bill. If a woman did not know she had additional rights, she is required, under this law, if we pass it--and I am confident we will--to be notified by the bankruptcy court: By the way, you have these additional rights, and we will help you attach this deadbeat's wages.  All other parties to bankruptcy, from her spouse's creditors to the court that monitors the bankruptcy plan, are notified that the full force of the Federal support enforcement law is part of the bankruptcy proceeding, which it is not now. Under this bill, the fact that other creditors with perhaps deeper pockets might be looking for repayment from her spouse is an asset, not a liability. Those other creditors must provide her and the support enforcement officials this bill recruits, by the way, to assist her with the last known address of her spouse who owes her the support and payments.  I used to be a family court lawyer. Do you know how it works now? The court can't find where Charlie Smith is. The woman is going into court day after day. Charlie Smith has a job. Everybody knows Charlie Smith has a job, but they can't find him. So Charlie Smith files bankruptcy in another State, another place, another time. What happens now? Nothing. What happens under this bill? The creditors who go in saying, I want to repossess Charlie's car, I am going to take Charlie's house, I am going after Charlie's bank account because he owes me money, have to notify the spouse.  Give me a break. No protections? It doesn't exist in present law.  These are concrete, positive steps from start to finish, and even beyond bankruptcy, to assure that payments are made to those who need them. These are real, tangible improvements over the current bankruptcy and child support laws. My friends who talk so much about child support ought to go practice it as I did. They ought to go back home and check, go sit in that family court and find out how it works right now.  Against them we will hear the vague assertion that those payments will compete with ``more powerful creditors.'' The fact is, in actual practice now, and more certainly under this bill, those payments will be accomplished by wage attachments and could not be reached by any other creditor during or after bankruptcy, no matter how powerful or how devious the creditor is.  I heard a little flip on this. I may hear from my friend from Wisconsin and others: Even though that is true, even though in this bankruptcy proceeding you can go out and attach the wages of this deadbeat father, what is going to happen is the devious creditor will still win. Do you know why? Because the deadbeat father will quit his job to spite payment. Then the creditor that repossesses the automobile or goes after whatever debt he has will be ahead of the mother because bankruptcy is over. Come on. If a father is going to do that, he ``ain't'' paying anybody anything. Those payments come out of the deadbeat dad's paycheck before he even sees it. He cannot be forced to choose between child support and other debts. He doesn't have the choice. Those payments are made automatically, straight from the employer to the woman and children who need them. Those who claim otherwise are simply ignorant of the way Federal family support law currently operates. Some of them simply misrepresent the way this legislation protects family support payments in bankruptcy.  Next, we have the assertion that this legislation unfairly locks the door of chapter 7--liquidation or so-called straight bankruptcy--for those low-income families that need it the most. Let's get a few things straight about how the current code operates.  Today, bankruptcy judges are required as a matter of Federal law to dismiss petitions for chapter 7--that is straight bankruptcy--for substantial abuse, particularly if the debtor really has the ability to pay his bills. This reform legislation will provide those judges with specific criteria for determining if the debtor can, in fact, pay some of the bills he or she is asking to be forgiven. If the debtor can pay some of those bills, at least $10,000 or 25 percent of those debts--that is the threshold--then asking for chapter 7 is presumed to be an abuse of the system and you get bumped into chapter 13.  I will bet that most Americans would be very surprised that there is no systematic way for asking the basic question about the ability to pay, no actual means test that exists now under the current code, and it is up to every different bankruptcy judge to decide how he or she wants to make that judgment. That is how our sentencing laws used to be until I wrote and we passed the Sentencing Reform Act. Every judge could have a different sentence.  What did we find out there? We found out that black folks who committed the same crime that white folks committed went to jail longer because there was no standard.  We have national sentencing guidelines and other standards that guide the decisions of judges. This bill simply tells judges how they should go about making the decision that current law requires them to make.  But won't that means test disadvantage those of limited means who truly need and deserve to fully get a chapter 7 liquidation?  Look at the facts. First, this bill will affect, at most, 10 percent of the people who currently file under chapter 7, and only those who have a demonstrable ability to pay.  One of the main reasons for that small number--10 percent--is the means test in this bill would not even apply to anyone who earns less than the median income in his or her State, and for those with less than 150 percent of the median income, there is only a cursory calculation on the ability to pay.  Let's go through what that means. Mr. President, in my State of Delaware, a family with a $46,000 income would not even be subject to the means test--you got that?--not even subject to the means test. They are out. They can immediately go to chapter 7, no questions asked, nothing--even if they had the ability to pay.  That is exactly as it is today. In California, a family with a $43,000 income will have the exact same access. In Massachusetts, a family with $44,000 in income will have no change in access to chapter 7; Illinois, $46,000; in Wisconsin, $45,000, no change. That is because this legislation, I might add, at my insistence and that of Senator Torricelli, contains a safe harbor for those people. Only if you have more than 1\1/2\ times the median income in your State will you be subject to a serious examination about your ability to pay. And even then, if you face what the bill calls ``special circumstances,'' that reduces your income or increases your regular expenses. You will still enjoy the full protection of chapter 7. Specifically--I don't know how many times I have heard this on the floor--if you have ongoing medical expenses, that means you don't have any money left over to pay creditors, you can go straight to chapter 7.  One of the most basic misunderstandings about this bill is that folks with medical bills will have their circumstances ignored, as my friends are saying on the floor here. That is just flat wrong. The standard this bill uses for calculating someone's ability to pay under the means test specifically includes not just medical bills but health insurance, and it even includes union dues.                            Amendment No. 13
