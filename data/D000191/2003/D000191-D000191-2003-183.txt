Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall) for his leadership on this issue.  The tragedies are not unique to Colorado. We have had similar tragedies in the Pacific Northwest, and I think it raises very, very severe questions about whether these vans should be on the road at all. And I certainly would encourage the continued study and action on the safety of these vehicles.
