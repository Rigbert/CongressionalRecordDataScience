 President, it is with some reluctance that I rise this afternoon to speak of the tragic occurrence, where two fine officers were gunned down here in the Capitol. The reason I say it is with reluctance is because, like many of us in this Chamber, I know from personal experience that when a wife or husband or son or daughter is taken from a family as a consequence of a totally unexpected violent event, that there is little that anyone can say or do, no matter how well intended we may be, that can in any way ease the pain of the family members who survive--the children, the spouses, parents.  So I debated with myself today whether or not to say anything at all. Much has been said about the heroism displayed in the performance of duty, and much more will be said about the lives that these two men, in giving theirs, probably saved. All that need be said, but none of that in any way is likely to produce any sense of relief on the part of the children of the officers, on the part of their spouses, on the part of their families. As a matter of fact, it is likely to produce, initially, a sense of anger; a feeling of ``Why my father?'' a feeling of ``Why did it have to be my husband?''  So, in a few moments each of us in our own ways will, as we attend the memorial service, demonstrate our high regard for and pay respects to the families as well as the deceased officers. But I also note one other thing from personal experience. Notwithstanding the fact nothing that we say today can ease that horrible void that seems to occupy the chest of the family members who can't fathom why this occurred to their father or to their husband--nothing we do will make them feel any better today--but, as time goes on, they will find a sense of comfort knowing that so many people held their father, their spouse, in such high regard. It will not occur for months, but it will occur. It will occur. And when it does, it will at that time help ease, ever so slightly, that sense of loss. The pain will never go away. The sense of loss will never be completely abated. But it will become easier to live with. So, as I said, although a lot of us in this Chamber know from similar experiences the feeling, it is hard when you are going through it to know one other thing that occurs and that is that time, time will not erase the pain, but time will make it livable.  At this moment, I expect, family members feel that nothing--nothing--nothing that will happen to them from this point on will make life as worth living as it has been for them. But, again from personal experiences, all of us know, who have gone through similar things, that the time will come when the memory of J.J. or John, the memory of their father or husband, will bring a smile to their lips rather than a tear to their eyes. My only prayer, on behalf of my wife Jill and me--we talked a lot about this morning before I came down--my prayer for the family members is that moment will come sooner than later. It will come. It will come. But that it will come sooner than later.  We ask a lot of those who serve this Nation. But few of us, few of us ever have to give what these two officers gave. Even fewer family members have to live with the sacrifice they have made, the void that is created and the pain that will endure for some time, like the families of the two fallen officers. So, again, I have no illusions that my words, as inadequate as they are, or the words of any of us, will at this moment give much comfort. But in time, in time I hope they will find some refuge in what has been said, in the outpouring of respect, the outpouring ofemotion, the outpouring of just simple, plain gratitude on the part of the staff, the Senators, and all Americans for what these two men did.  They did their duty. They did their duty. And, in doing so, they clearly saved the lives of other innocent people. That is no comfort now, but it will, in time, be some comfort.  Let me close by saying, once again, in time the pain will ease. In time, when they think of their father, when they think of their husband, they will, in fact, smile rather than cry. All that we can hope is that time will come sooner than later.  I yield the floor.          TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS JOHN GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT.
