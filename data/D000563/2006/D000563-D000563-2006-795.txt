President, I rise to oppose the confirmation of Richard Sticker as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety. I also ask the Senate to send a message of confidence and hope to the miners across America that we in the Senate are no longer willing to put coal industry executives that care more about profits than lives in charge of their safety.  How many of us recall the recent news stories coming out of Kentucky and West Virginia--heartbreaking stories--where lives were lost and families waited expectantly aboveground praying that those miners would be found and be brought back safely, and how many times that was not the case.  What brings about safety in these coal mines, so deep in the Earth?
