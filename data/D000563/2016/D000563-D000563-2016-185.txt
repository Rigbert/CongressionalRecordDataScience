We have had votes on both of those measures. After San Bernadino, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California came forward and asked the Senate to vote on the simple proposition that if someone's name appears on a terrorist watch list, they would not able to buy firearms, and her effort failed. Similarly, a bipartisan measure by Senators Manchin and Toomey to close the loopholes so that there will be background checks failed as well.  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut--and I know his response--why would we revisit two issues that have already been voted on in the Senate?
