 President, I say to my friend from Alaska, I am quite sure I can accept this amendment 2065, but I would like to not do it at the moment. I want to make sure I run the ``traps'' with my counterpart on the Armed Services Committee and to make sure it is right.  Secondly, I must tell him, as a former chairman of an authorizing committee and now a ranking member of an authorizing committee, I am heartened and my soul is soaring to hear a chairman of the Appropriations Committee say, ``First get an authorization.'' That is, all by itself, reason to be excited about this.
