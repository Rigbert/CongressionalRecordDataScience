Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce, along with the Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, James Oberstar, theWater Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chairman, John J. Duncan, Jr., and the Ranking Member of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, Peter DeFazio, the Water Resources Development Act of 2002.  Every two years, Congress makes it a high priority to meet our Nation's water resources needs by enacting a Water Resources Development Act. Through this legislation, Congress authorizes the Corps of Engineers to carry out its primary missions of providing navigation improvements at harbors and waterways, flood damage reduction in our communities and coastal areas, and environmental restoration along the Nation's rivers, and lakes. These projects have a profound impact on the economy of this Nation by reducing transportation costs, saving lives, homes, and businesses from the ravages of flooding, and improving our quality of life. The standard of living for every American has been positively affected by the work the Corps does with its local partners.  Under authorities enacted in Water Resources Development Acts, the Corps of Engineers constructs harbors and navigation channels. Over 13 million American jobs are depended on trade, making our ports and waterways vital to our economic, as well as national, security. Our harbors currently handle over 2 billion tons of cargo a year, and that volume is projected to double by 2020. We need to be ready to handle the larger ships that will carry that cargo or face potential loss of trade. Our inland navigation system is critical to our transportation system. Inland waterways cover 12,000 miles and carry \1/6\th of the Nation's inter-city freight, at a cost per ton-mile that is \1/2\ that of rail and \1/10\th that of trucks. We need to keep transportation of goods on our inland waterways efficient to keep our farmers competitive in the world market.  The Water Resources Development Act of 2002 helps our Nation stay competitive by authorizing or modifying over 50 projects, studies, and policies relating to navigation improvements, as well as related projects and policy changes to improve the management of dredged material.  Water Resources Development Acts also authorize the Corps to protect towns and cities from the ravages of floods. Over the past 10 years, flood damage reduction projects built by the Corps with local partners have prevented more than $208 billion in damages.  Water Resources Development Act of 2002 continues to provide this protection by authorizing or modifying over 75 projects and studies relating to flood damage reduction, and nearly 20 related projects for shoreline protection.  Since 1990, environmental restoration also has been a primary mission of the Corps. These projects range from small aquatic ecosystem restoration projects to multi-billion dollar projects like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.  The Water Resources Development Act of 2002 continues this mission by authorizing or modifying over 40 environmental restoration projects and studies.  In this legislation, we also recognize that there are other water resources challenges that face this Nation where the Corps' expertise could help--particularly since needs for water supply, water quality, and navigation often are interrelated. The Water Resource Development Act of 2002 provides additional opportunities for the Corps to lend its technical expertise where a community or a region has decided to address water resources matters on a watershed or river basin basis.  There are some who believe we do not need a Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. Some say it openly, and propose to eliminate funding the Corps. Others are more subtle and instead are trying to convince Congress to add so many procedural hurdles that a single person could have the ability to stop a water resources project, no matter how important the project is to the safety of our citizens or the strength or our economy. I have a different view of the Corps and a different vision for its future.  First, I believe that this Nation needs an Army Corps of Engineers. Most members of the House of Representative agree. We have received request from nearly 200 members for over 400 separate water resources projects, studies, and modifications to projects. These requests are generated at the local level, and are tailored to meet local needs. No matter what some may say here in Washington, back home people want and need a vital and continuing civil works program.  Second, I support the Corps process for formulating water resources projects. Under the Corps planning process, all projects must be in the Federal interest and must be economically justified and environmentally sound, but the details of a project are developed through a close interaction between the Corps and the local communities that share in the cost of the project. This is a bottom-up process that allows projects to be designed to best meet local needs.  Deciding where investments in water resources are warranted is a complex task often involving sophisticated economic analyses. While there has been some criticism of how the Corps has attempted to do these analyses in certain projects, the fact is no other Federal agency requires its projects to go through a similar benefit cost review.  There have been some individual cases where the economic analysis of a project has been flawed. This is a personnel and management problem, not a problem with the Corps' statutory authorities. The Chief of Engineers is taking steps to address this issue through improved training and establishing centers of expertise. We in Congress also have many oversight tools that give us the ability to investigate the merits of a project, and we have demonstrated that we are not hesitant to use these tools to scrutinize controversial projects.  After reviewing all of the requests from members, it is clear to us that the House of Representatives supports changes to the Corps civil works program to speed the delivery of projects, not changes that will lengthen the Corps' process and add costs. For example, we have received over 40 requests from members asking that their local project sponsors be allowed to move ahead of the Corps and receive credit for work they begin on projects, while the Corps' lengthy study and review process in underway. Other members of Congress requested statutory language directing the Corps to expedite its planning process and deliver needed projects more quickly. No member of Congress has asked the Committee to add more procedural hurdles, more delay, and more costs to their projects.  The Corps civil works program is nearly unique. The Corps is a Federal agency that partners with local agencies to solve local problems. The needs are identified at the local level and the solutions are developed through a bottom-up process--they are not thrust upon a community as top-down mandates. I am proud to say that the Water Resources Development Act of 2002 continues in this tradition.                          ____________________
