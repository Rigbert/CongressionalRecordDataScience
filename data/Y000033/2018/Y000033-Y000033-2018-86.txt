The parliamentarian, I think, made a mistake, but they have a right to do that, as others Members do, but that is the way it goes.  Mr. Speaker, let's not kid ourselves. If you listen to the presentation, it has nothing to do with a fish bill. This is a procedural trick to delay passage of this bipartisan legislation. And I keep saying this is a fish bill that has been in existence for many years, since 1976, and it has been a success, and then we come up with a recommit motion that has nothing to do with this bill.  The prize is fish communities, sustainable yields, domestic seafood industry, and a job creation bill.  With all due respect, I strongly urge a rejection of the motion, and I yield back the balance of my time.
