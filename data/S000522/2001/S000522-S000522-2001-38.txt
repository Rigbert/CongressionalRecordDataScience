Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2540, the Veterans Compensation Rate Amendments of 2001, is a clean bill providing a cost-of-living adjustment to disabled veterans and surviving spouses. Most of the changes to other benefit authorities that were part of the bill when it passed the House will be taken up as part of the compromise agreement to H.R. 1291.  Upon enactment of this vital legislation, all veterans or qualified survivors of veterans who receive disability compensation payment will receive a 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment beginning on December 1 of this year. This increase, which matches the Social Security COLA, will raise payments to disabled veterans by more than $400 million in the first year. In all, compensation payments will be increased by more than $2.5 billion over the next 5 years. For more than 170,000 veterans who are permanently and totally disabled, the average annual increase is $738.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank every Member who contributed to this bill. I especially want to thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), who is the chairman of our Subcommittee on Benefits, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), who is the ranking member, for their excellent work on H.R. 2540.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
