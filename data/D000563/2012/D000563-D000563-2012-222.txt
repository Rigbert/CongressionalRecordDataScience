And I quote Senator Whitehouse from page S5720 of the July 31 Congressional Record:       Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been the completely      unwitting victim of a long-term and extensive cyber      intrusion. Just last year the Wall Street Journal reported      that a group of hackers in China breached the computer      defenses of the U.S. Chamber, gained access to everything      stored in its systems, including information about 3 million      members, and they remained on the U.S. Chamber's network for      at least 6 months and possibly more than a year.
