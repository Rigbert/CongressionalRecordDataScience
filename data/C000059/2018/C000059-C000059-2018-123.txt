Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to James ``Jim'' Robinson, who passed away on Tuesday, December 4, 2018. Jim was an active and influential leader in Riverside County throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  Jim was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he developed asthma at a young age. To help provide him some relief, Jim's family moved to California for drier air and a warmer climate. He graduated from San Bernardino High School and earned his bachelor's degree from California State Los Angeles. While in college, Jim enlisted in the Army National Guard, earning the Distinguished Cadet Honor and obtained the rank of Staff Sergeant. Jim continued his education throughout his career, obtaining his graduate degree from Southern Methodist University. Jim later completed Stanford University's Financial Management Program in 1983 and the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Executive Program in 1987.  Jim launched his career in banking as a messenger for Security First National Bank which later became Security Pacific National Bank. He entered the bank's management training program and upon graduation oversaw the operations of a series of larger bank branches in the Inland Empire. During his career with Security Pacific National Bank, Jim would serve as a Regional Manager and a Division Manager before deciding to retire from the bank in 1992. He was then immediately hired as the President and CEO of Riverside National Bank, at which he served as an executive until again retiring in 2003. In 2005, Jim and a group of regional leaders formed Security Bank of California, a new community bank headquartered in Riverside. Jim served as the Chairman and CEO until the bank was sold in 2016 and he retired for the last time. During his career, Jim felt it was important to give back to the communities he served and sat on numerous boards in the regions he worked, including in Fresno, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.  Jim was preceded in death by his first wife Shirley Wilkins Robinson and his daughter Kristen Robinson Olsen. He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Barbara Robinson, his son Jamie Robinson, Jr., Jamie's wife Melissa and their two daughters, Grace and Gabrielle, as well as son-in-law Craig Olsen and granddaughter Mallory Olsen. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Robinson family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Although Jim may be gone, the many contributions he made in Riverside County will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
