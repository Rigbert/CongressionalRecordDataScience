 President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy Technical Corrections Act of 1996. This bill will correct technical errors in the bankruptcy code resulting from the 1994 Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 as well as pre-existing technical errors. I am introducing the bill with support of Senator Heflin, my good friend from Alabama and the ranking minority on the Courts subcommittee.  Mr. President, with one exception, this bill makes purely technical changes in the Code. It is my hope that the bill will pass this body quickly and by unanimous consent.
