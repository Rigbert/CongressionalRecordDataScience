President, today I am pleased to introduce a joint resolution with Senators Jeffords, Gregg and Smith to allow the States of Vermont and New Hampshire to implement an interstate public water supply compact. Both States have enacted this compact through their State legislature, and the affected towns are currently awaiting congressional approval so that they can move forward in their partnership.  Most members are familiar with compacts since they have become common tools to address local problems. Like all compacts, this one is a binding agreement between States established for the purpose of addressing problems shared by those States. This particular compact allows Vermont and New Hampshire to construct and maintain joint public drinking water systems.  According to the compact in this Senate joint resolution, Vermont and New Hampshire municipalities are granted the authority to apply jointly for federal financing and raise appropriate revenue for the creation of drinking water facilities. The agreement also allows for joint management and maintenance to help cut costs while still meeting minimum health standards for drinking water. While public water projects will be carried out according to eight common guidelines stipulated in the joint resolution, this joint resolution does not create a new governmental authority and does not supersede any existing laws or agreements of member states. Finally, the States of Vermont and New Hampshire initiated and drafted this compact cooperatively and enactment was pursued voluntarily by each legislature.  This compact carries on a tradition of cooperative efforts to meet interstate objectives between Vermont and New Hampshire. These two States currently implement the New Hampshire-Vermont interstate sewage and waste disposal facilities compact. In addition, both States are members of the broader New England interstate water pollution control compact and the Connecticut River Valley Flood control compact. On a national level, literally dozens of compacts have been considered and approved by Congress to address water issues. The Vermont-New Hampshire Public Water Supply compact reflects the principles of previous compacts which have effectively addressed interstate concerns.  We are introducing this bill today in order to satisfy article 1, section 10 of the U.S. Constitution. Article 1, section 10 mandates that ``No state shall without the consent of Congress enter into agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power.'' The courts have established two reasons for Congressional consent. One is to prevent undue injury to the interest of noncompacting states, the other is to protect the Constitutional interests of the federal government against interference from the states. I believe that this compact serves the interests of the two member states well, does not affect other states, and protects the constitutional interests of the federal government. It is in this spirit that I introduce this joint resolution for the consideration and approval by the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
