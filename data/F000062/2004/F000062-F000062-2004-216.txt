 President, this is amendment No. 2753, on behalf of Senators Hollings, Breaux, Dodd, Corzine, Schumer, Biden, Mikulski, Murray, Graham of Florida, and Collins.  This amendment does not cost. It is a sense of the Senate, and it essentially would allow large ports that need to produce security to do this through multiyear contracting or letters of intent. There is a real problem in going year by year with budget funds for port security. The port of Los Angeles-Long Beach is 15 miles long. They are the second and third largest ports in the Nation. It simply cannot do what is necessary to be done to secure the port unless there is some form of multiyear funding agreement. This amendment would allow that to take place, at least in terms of voicing the Senate's view.  I thank the Chair.
