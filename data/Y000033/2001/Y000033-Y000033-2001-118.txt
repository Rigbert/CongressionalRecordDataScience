Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the words of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and his role and his dedication to security. I too want to move this legislation as quickly as possible. I do compliment him on the motion to instruct, because we all want to get this job done.  Unfortunately, I cannot control everything that happens in this House, although I would like to. I will tell my colleagues that up front. I cannot control what the other body does. But I intend myself, personally, to see if we cannot expedite this process, and that means going to conference and working with the Senate conferees, with them hopefully having an open mind to the proposal which passed this House overwhelmingly last week.  I am confident that that can occur. I hope it will occur very rapidly. It is our intent to draft the perfect legislation for the security of the traveling public in the United States.  Again, we are doing what we can do in this House. I cannot speak for the other body, but we will do our job. With the working relationship I believe we have, we will be able to accomplish that.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
