 At a time when the rich are getting richer, when the middle class is shrinking, and poverty is increasing, the wealthiest 1 percent get more in tax breaks than do the bottom 60 percent.  There is another point that needs to be made, and I do not think it was covered very well this afternoon. And that is we should ask ourselves how did we get into the position of having a $4.7 trillion national debt? How did it happen? I think everybody in this room understands that in the 1980's the national debt took off. It went from $1 trillion to over $4 trillion.  What our friends in the Republican Party forgot to mention is that between 1981 and 1992, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population received $1.5 trillion in tax breaks. Let me say it again. Between 1981 and 1992, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population received $1.5 trillion in tax breaks. Between those tax breaks, between increased military spending, the country in fact ran up a large national debt.  It seems to me that the way you solve the problem is not to give more tax breaks to the people who are primarily responsible for causing the national debt in the first place, and it seems to me to be grossly unfair to be going after the working people and the low income people whose incomes have significantly declined over the last 18 years. So this continues the Robin Hood proposal in reverse. We take from working people and low income people and we give to the rich. I think that is the essence of what this proposal is about.
