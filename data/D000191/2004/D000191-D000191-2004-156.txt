Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the City of Cottage Grove, Oregon. Located in my congressional district at the southern end of the beautiful Willamette Valley, Cottage Grove recently won its second All-American City award.  The Kalapuya Indians first enjoyed the riches of the southern valley, and the Oregon Trail opened the territory to other settlers in 1848. In 1863, gold was discovered in the mountains south of Cottage Grove, and mining activities continued into the 1920s, when the lumber industry became the economic engine. The City celebrates its exciting history every summer during Bohemia Mining Days. Today, this community of not quite 9,000 is blessed with a wealth of community spirit and ``can do'' attitude.  Cottage Grove is a vital community dedicated to possibilities. This town is not afraid to take and share responsibility for creating a better future. In fact, in Cottage Grove there is a strong sense of obligation to making dreams come true. The 1968 and 2004 All-American City Awards honor the community's commitment to excellence, cooperation, and creativity.  Only ten communities earn All-American City status each year nationwide. Cottage Grove is being saluted for a variety of accomplishments and three major projects--the new Cottage Grove Community Hospital, the formation of the Economic & Business Improvement District, and the recently completed Cottage Grove High School facility.  American anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, ``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.'' Cottage Grove embodies this great notion, with friends, neighbors, government, businesses, and service agencies working together to get things done, and done well.  I am proud to represent Cottage Grove, and thank you for the opportunity to highlight ``the little city that could.''                          ____________________
