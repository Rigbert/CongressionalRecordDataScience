Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Denis and Carolyn Ribordy of Ogden Dunes, Indiana. Denis and Carolyn were honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to our community on April 7, 1999. Their praiseworthy efforts were recognized at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts as they received the 1999 Distinguished Citizen's Award, sponsored by the Calumet Council of Boy Scouts of America. The Distinguished Citizen's Award is given to worthy recipients who demonstrate their dedication and outstanding service to the community.  Denis and Carolyn Ribordy, longtime residents of Northwest Indiana, hale from East Chicago and Indianapolis, respectively. After both graduated from Butler University College of Pharmacy, they returned to Northwest Indiana, and have made our area their permanent home. In 1955, the Ribordy's opened their own pharmacy, Ribordy Drugs, Incorporated. Denis Ribordy served as the founder and President of the 26-store retail drug chain in Northwest Indiana until Ribordy Drugs was sold to Walgreens in 1985.  While the Ribordys have dedicated considerable time and energy to their work, they have always made an extra effort to give to the community. Denis is very involved in several organizations including: Chicago Motor Club, Hunter Corporation, Lake County Easter Seal Society for Crippled Children and Adults, Incorporated, Mercantile National Bank, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, Northwest Indiana Forum, and Trade Winds Rehabilitation Center, Incorporated. Additionally, he serves as a trustee for Butler University andMethodist Hospital of Gary, Indiana. Carolyn serves as an elder at the Ogden Dunes Presbyterian Church and was a past recipient of the Robert Anderson Award for Exceptional Commitment to Community Service.  Though the Ribordys are dedicated to their career and community, they have never limited their time and love for their family. The Ribordys have raised four children; Cheryl, 41; Scott, 39; Nancy, 36; and Mark, 33, of whom they are immensely proud.  Mr. Speaker I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Denis and Carolyn Ribordy for receiving the 1999 Distinguished Citizen's Award. Their dedicated service to Northwest Indiana is commendable and admirable. Indiana's First Congressional District is proud to count two such dedicated, conscientious citizens, Denis and Carolyn Ribordy, among its residents.                          ____________________
