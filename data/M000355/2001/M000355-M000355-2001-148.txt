 President, the Senator from Iowa voted against nonseverability yesterday. After Senator McCain and Senator Thompson and others went through this painful compromise of working out an appropriate hard money increase that only had 16 votes against it, the Senator from Iowa wants to come in here at the last minute and unravel that compromise. I thought we were past that on this bill, I say to the Senator from Arizona. I thought we were down to a few wrap-up items. This amendment ought to be defeated overwhelmingly, and we should stick with the compromise that was so painstakingly worked out the other day.  I yield the floor.
