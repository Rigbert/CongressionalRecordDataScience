Mr. Speaker, during the 1960's, I was honored to be a part of the civil rights movement--a movement that changed the face of our Nation. People from throughout our Nation--old and young, black and white, rich and poor--joined the nonviolent revolution that made our country a better, fairer, more just Nation. I was fortunate to get to know Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his partner in the movement--Dr. Abernathy.  Dr. Abernathy was an inspiring and committed leader from the earliest days of the movement. When Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to stand in the back of the bus while there were empty seats in the ``white'' section of the bus, she inspired the Montgomery bus boycott. As ministers of the two leading black churches in Montgomery, AL, Dr. King and Dr. Abernathy worked together to organize and sustain that boycott. Thus began the strong bonds of friendship and commitment that would last as long as the two men lived.  Dr. Abernathy had a lifelong commitment to securing and protecting basic civil rights for all Americans. I marched with him many times throughout the South, including Selma and Montgomery. After the assassination of Dr. King in 1968, Dr. Abernathy assumed leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and worked to carry on the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. After Dr. King's death, Dr. Abernathy continued to organize and lead marches and other events, included the Poor People's Campaign, a massive demonstration to protest rising unemployment, held in Washington, DC.  The Reverend Dr. Abernathy passed away, too young, 6 years ago. Today, I am introducing a resolution authorizing the construction of a memorial to the Reverend Dr. Abernathy and the Poor People's Campaign on the National Mall. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort. The monument will celebrate the achievements of the past, commemorate those who marched alongside us many years ago, and pay special tribute to the sacrifices and the contributions of Dr. Abernathy and others who participated in the Poor People's Campaign. Thousands of people participated. Some has small roles, others large roles. The Reverend Ralph David Abernathy had many roles, often at the same time. He was a teacher, a leader, an organizer, a soldier, and a friend. Many were inspired by his good humor, and his guidance. Today, I Invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating his legacy and his life.                          ____________________
