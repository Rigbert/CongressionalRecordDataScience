Our beloved ``once and ways'' Mayor Harry Kessler, who symbolized honest and dedicated leadership in the public realm, has passed from this life.  He set a community standard that endures. His tenure as Mayor from 1971 through 1977 brought growth and vitality to a struggling city, and his imprimatur is everywhere. He followed his Mayoral leadership by holding other elected offices for two decades after he decided to retire as Mayor. Few have defined the Mayor of Toledo as did Mayor Harry Kessler. A beloved father for our City, he lived and breathed his life to better our city and region. His kind and gentlemanly manner, his eternal smile, and his deep commitment to integrity, learning and libraries, community service, and athletics have left permanent legacies to future generations.  Mayor Kessler was a builder, a healer, a leader who knew how to bring our community together not just for today but for tomorrow. We can each learn much from him as we emulate his life of service to us, in the private sector, in public office, and so many other community ventures. His deep love for our City that he always called home inspired us all. He did all he could to make our place on earth a finer and more humane place in which to live.  We extend deepest sympathy and gratitude to his soulmate and partner for over half a century, Mary Lou, his children and extended family. We wish them strength and peace as, together, we adjust to his passing from life with us. May God rest his soul and place him in a leading role in the City beyond stars to watch over our earthly pursuits.                          ____________________
