Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, this proposed stimulus package is not good for the economy. It is not good for unemployed workers and their families. It is not good for America. This bill is only good for the big contributors to the last Bush campaign, big companies like Enron, a top contributor to President Bush and the Republican Party.
