President, before he leaves the floor, I commend the distinguished Senator from Illinois for his statement and want to make sure the body recognizes that it has been Senator Sanders who has championed this cause relentlessly, making the case that, dollar for dollar, there is no better investment in American health care than these community health centers. I was going to spend my time talking about the opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to continue to team up on this health reform issue. I think it is worth noting that Senator Sanders, who has championed this effort in this bill, is actually picking up on work that a number of the most influential Republicans in this country have been interested in for years.  President George W. Bush was a great champion of community health centers. Bernie Sanders, now in this bill, is making sure we get a very significant increase so that there will be many new clinics across the country.
