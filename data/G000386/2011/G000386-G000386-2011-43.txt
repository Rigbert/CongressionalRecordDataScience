 President, I would like to alert my colleagues that I intend to object to any unanimous consent agreement for the consideration of S. 1793 or its companion, H.R. 2076, the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2011. Unless changes are made to address my concerns with the legislation, I will continue to object.  I oppose S. 1793/H.R. 2076 in its current form because it would expand the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by giving it authority to conduct investigations of State crimes, and I believe that that is a bad precedent to set. The FBI should not be turned into a roving national police force.  I do believe in allowing Federal law enforcement agencies to assist State and local agencies, when requested. Agents providing assistance should be afforded civil liability protection.  Unfortunately, the bill excludes all other Federal law enforcement agencies that routinely provide law assistance to local law enforcement when requested. For example, local police believed the Secret Service possessed the expertise they needed to assist in their investigation of the Boston ``Craigslist Killer.'' As a result of this expert assistance, the killer was captured. There is no reason to limit States and localities to the assistance of the FBI alone, when other agencies may have the particular expertise that is needed.  Too many people think that only the FBI helps local law enforcement. That's simply not true. State and local officers develop positive relationships with their Federal law enforcement counterparts. When a violent crisis occurs, they often request assistance from the Federal agents they already work with.  I support the idea behind the legislation: to allow State and local agencies to request the assistance of Federal law enforcement to address serious State and local crimes. But that should apply to all agencies, and should be done without expanding the authority of any Federal law enforcement agency to conduct investigations of State and local crimes on its own, at the expense of other State, local, and Federal law enforcement agencies.  The bill as reported also contains an ill-advised requirement that the Bureau cannot provide assistance to State or local law enforcement agencies unless three persons have died. Given that the bill purports to permit assistance in the case of attempted mass murder, a requirement that three people have died before assistance can be provided, is flawed. Moreover, there have been serious crimes involving mass shootings in which, fortunately, no one has died. No assistance could be provided to investigate such crimes under the bill in its current form.  Until these concerns are addressed and further changes are included in the bill, I support holding this legislation on the Senate floor.                          ____________________
