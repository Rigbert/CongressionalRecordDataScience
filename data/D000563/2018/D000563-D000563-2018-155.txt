President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3272       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti and Armenia      Reforestation Act of 2018''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to      support and seek the protection of forests around the world,      which provide a wide range of benefits by--       (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and      terrestrial resources of Earth;       (B) providing habitats for almost \2/3\ of all species on      Earth, including species essential to medical research and      agricultural productivity;       (C) contributing to the livelihood of more than      1,600,000,000 people through access to food, fresh water,      clothing, traditional medicines, and shelter;       (D) ensuring environmental services, such as biodiversity,      water conservation, soil enrichment, water supply management,      and climate regulation; and       (E) absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, as deforestation      accounts for approximately 12 percent of the global      anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to      global warming;       (2) while forests cover a little less than \1/3\ of the      land area on Earth, approximately 85 percent of Earth's      original primary forests have been destroyed, degraded, or      fragmented;       (3) in Haiti--       (A) the destruction of forests began centuries ago, when      17th century colonists cut down trees for lumber, fuel, and      furniture;       (B) the 18th century plantation economy resulted in      hillsides near towns being stripped of trees;       (C) after gaining independence, deforestation continued as      Haiti rebuilt its local economy by growing coffee and      exporting timber;       (D) in 1923, more than 60 percent of the land was forested,      but by the 1940s and 1950s deforestation was accelerating as      an increasing population put more pressure on forests;       (E) in recent years, urbanization has expanded      exponentially and growing cities have depended on charcoal      produced by cutting down trees in the countryside;       (F) poor forestry and land use policies by the Government      of Haiti has exacerbated deforestation, and by 2014, forest      cover had decreased to approximately 9 to 11 percent of the      country; and       (G) between 2000 and 2016, 5,430 hectares of forest cover      were lost, equal to 6.3 percent of Haiti's tree cover;       (4) in Armenia--       (A) while archeological data indicated that approximately      35 percent of the country was originally forested--       (i) less than 12 percent of the country was covered in      forest in 1990; and       (ii) less than 6 percent of the country was covered in      forest by 2016; and       (B) in August, 2017, a fire caused significant damage to      the Khosrov Forest, which is among the world's oldest      protected areas, engulfing more than 2,733 hectares in flames      and causing substantial harm to hundreds of unique plant      species;       (5) economic pressures, resulting from more than 60 percent      of the population of Haiti living below the poverty line and      29.8 percent of the population of Armenia living below the      poverty line--       (A) are factors contributing to the deforestation of Haiti      and Armenia; and       (B) are manifested particularly through the cutting of      areas of forest for conversion to agricultural and commercial      uses, where wood and charcoal produced from cutting down      trees accounts for a major supply toward Haiti's and      Armenia's energy sectors;       (6) forests provide cover to soften the effect of heavy      rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the soil with tree      roots;       (7) a significant effect of the deforestation in Haiti and      Armenia is soil erosion, which has--       (A) lowered the productivity on the land due to the      leaching of nutrients in topsoils;       (B) worsened the severity of droughts and the effects of      landslides and floods;       (C) led to further deforestation due to slash and burn      practices when eroded areas are no longer productive;       (D) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees      in Haiti and Armenia; and       (E) significantly decreased water quality and the quantity      of freshwater and clean drinking water available to      populations;       (8) research strongly suggests that deforestation increases      the risk of infectious diseases, including malaria, dengue      fever, SARS, Ebola, Hantavirus, and Zika--       (A) by depriving insect and animal carriers of habitat; and       (B) by directly increasing their rate of exposure to human      populations who are susceptible to zoonotic pathogens;       (9) both Haiti and Armenia have faced natural disasters in      recent years, the effects of which have been exacerbated by      deforestation, such as--       (A) flooding in Armenia that has swept away or damaged      thousands of homes, schools, health clinics, and other      institutions, partly because of damage to forests through      illegal logging, landslides, and soil erosion;       (B) hurricanes in Haiti that have killed thousands and      displaced hundreds of thousands more, partly because the      clearing of large hillsides enabled rainwater to run off      directly into settlements located at the bottom of slopes,      causing severe flooding; and       (C) the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which destroyed      much of the infrastructure of Port-au-Prince, reduced      hillside stability and increased the likelihood of mudslides,      soil erosion, and flooding factors, which negatively impacted      the water supply and heightened concerns for the spread of      waterborne diseases;       (10) economic benefits for local communities from      sustainable uses of forests are critical for the long-term      sustainable management of forests in Haiti and Armenia;       (11) Congress appropriated funding for fiscal years 2015,      2017, and 2018 to support market-based reforestation programs      in Haiti, which have resulted in successful agroforestry      activities that have increased crop production, profits, and      tree cover; and       (12) reforestation efforts would provide new sources of      jobs, income, and investments in Haiti and Armenia by--       (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling      programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable      agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber      harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services;      and       (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income      through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of      which exist on small scales.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide      assistance to the Government of Haiti and the Government of      Armenia to develop and implement, or improve, nationally      appropriate policies and actions--       (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, and      improve forest management and natural regeneration;       (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and      reforestation in a sustainable, measurable, reportable, and      verifiable manner;       (3) to restore social and economic conditions for the      environmental recovery of the forest cover of Haiti and      Armenia to at least 7 percent of total land mass in Haiti and      12 percent of total land mass in Armenia (as determined under      section 302(a)) not later than 10 years after the date of the      enactment of this Act; and       (4) to improve sustainable resource management at the      watershed level.
