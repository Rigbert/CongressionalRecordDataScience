President, I can still recall the first briefing I had as a Member of Congress on something called HIV/AIDS. I didn't know much about it. I heard the words, but I didn't understand them until this briefing brought to mind and brought to light the serious threat this was to the health of thousands of people in the United States and around the world. It was a frightening moment. The information we received led us to believe quite honestly that this was the public health crisis of our time.  There was a response that I was surprised by. Despite all the controversy around all the values and issues, President Ronald Reagan and his Surgeon General Koop stepped forward and showed real leadership.  Some argued that President Reagan waited too long. I am going to put that argument aside. The day came when the Surgeon General sent a letter to every American family telling them the threat of this public health crisis. It was the right thing to do. We dealt with it in an honest, forthright way. We appropriated massive amounts of money for treatment research, and we have come a long way in saving the lives of many who were threatened by this deadly disease.  It is rare when a President of the United States steps up and says to the American people: We have a public health crisis. Because it is so rare, we should take it very seriously.  In February of this year, President Obama made that plea to Congress about a new public health crisis involving the Zika infection. Zika, of course, is borne by mosquitoes. There is evidence in countries around the world that when these mosquitoes bite someone and infect them, it has a negative health consequence, particularly on pregnant women and the babies they carry.  President Obama came to Congress in February of this year and in a rare moment announced that we had an emergency, a public health crisis that needed to be addressed. He asked for $1.9 billion to eradicate the mosquitoes and also to develop a vaccine to protect innocent Americans.  I took that seriously. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in Congress did not. It wasn't until May, some 3 months later, that the Senate passed a response to the President's request for this public health emergency called Zika. We passed a bill that had about $1.1 billion in it--not what the President asked for but a substantial investment toward his goal of protecting America and developing a vaccine, and we passed it with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Some 89 Senators from both parties voted for it in May of this year. That, of course, was 4 months ago.  What happened after the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote responded to the President's request for emergency funding for a public health crisis involving Zika? What happened to this bill after it passed the Senate? It went to the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, that is where it took a bad turn. Instead of passing the obvious bipartisan bill in response to the President, the House Republicans insisted on delaying it further and adding provisions that were politically controversial and really were unnecessary to our goal of protecting America from this crisis.  They added a provision that said that if you were a woman seeking family planning so that your pregnancy was not compromised by the Zika virus, you could not use the Planned Parenthood agencies for those family planning consultations. Why would they pick Planned Parenthood? Because the Republican Party is at war with Planned Parenthood. They are willing to stop even their family planning functions.  Two million American women went to Planned Parenthood last year. They count on them for professional services they can trust and afford. The Republicans want to close it down. They have voted repeatedly to do that. So they chose this Zika emergency public health crisis bill to do that again.  They took $500 million slated for the Veterans' Administration to expedite the consideration of claims by our veterans and eliminated that money in the VA--put it toward the Zika virus.  Third, they decided to suspend the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency when it came to monitoring and overseeing the chemicals that would be sprayed to kill these mosquitoes.  Finally, in the ultimate political act, they put in a provision that eliminated the prohibition against displaying a Confederate flag at a U.S. military cemetery. That is what happens when legislation that starts off as very simple, pointed, and direct runs amok and becomes a political freighter, carrying all of these issues.  That is what happened and, of course, the Republicans in the House knew what would follow. The bill would run into resistance, and the Senate would be bogged down. Instead of taking the simple funding bill the Senate passed overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote, the Republicans complicated the situation dramatically and brought the whole conversation to a stop.  So here we are today. The President's request was in February; we are now in September. Congress has yet to send the President the resources he asked for. At what cost? Well, we know the cost. At this point we estimate that by the end of the year in Puerto Rico, 25 percent of the people on that island will be infected with the Zika virus, including presently about 1,000 women in Puerto Rico. We know that they are in danger and that the babies they give birth to will have serious life-threatening birth defects because of that infection--an infection that might have been slowed down or even avoided had this Congress under Republican control responded to President Obama's request for emergency public health funding for this Zika epidemic.  As of last week there were 20,870 reported cases of Zika in the United States and its territories. That included 1,897 pregnant women, and in Illinois there are 70 of these women. We estimate about 700 or 800 women in America in the continental United States have been infected by this virus, with another 1,000, as I mentioned, in Puerto Rico.  If we had responded quickly in a responsible bipartisan way when the President made his request, I don't know whether some of these families and women and their babies could have been spared. We will never know, butwe do know this for sure: The Republican-led Congress ignored the President's request, refused to send the money he asked for, and we are paying a heavy price as a nation--not as heavy a price as these women who sadly have a tragedy on their hands that maybe could have been avoided if Congress had responded in a timely fashion.  Seven months without congressional action for an emergency public health crisis called Zika is shameful. Let's not wait another day before we leave here to go back and campaign, before each party returns home to brag about what they have achieved or can achieve. Let's do our job when it comes to this Zika crisis. Let's make sure the continuing resolution that keeps the government's lights on also turns on the lights at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the National Institutes of Health so that we start reducing the number of people infected and also developing a vaccine to protect innocent families across the United States and perhaps around the world. That is something we desperately need to do.                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities  Mr. President, the for-profit college and university industry is the most heavily federally subsidized profitmaking private business in America, bar none. Most of these for-profit colleges and universities, like the University of Phoenix, Kaplan, and others, have decided they want to tap into our Federal Treasury for anywhere up to 90 or 95 percent of all the revenue that comes through their universities and schools.  There is no other business in America so dependent on Federal subsidies as for-profit colleges and universities. What happens? The Federal Treasury sends money to the students who apply to these schools in the form of grants and loans. The money is then transferred to the school, and the student has a debt they have to cope with when it comes to the money that is borrowed from the Federal Government.  What happens in those circumstances where the school goes out of business? We saw it with Corinthian last year, one of the largest for-profit colleges and universities, and we just saw it 2 weeks ago with a group called ITT Tech. Here is what happens. Students have debt incurred at these for-profit schools like ITT Tech. They are approached by the Department of Education which offers them two options. The first option is, if you were a student at the school when it closed or you withdrew 120 days before it went out of business, you have a choice. You can keep your credit hours that you earned at ITT Tech and the debt incurred in earning them or walk away from both.  Also, if you happen to have been defrauded by these schools, you have something called defense to repayment. If they misled you about the courses you were going to take, how much they would cost, what kind of loans were available to you, what kind of job you may have after graduation, then you, too, can raise that as a defense and potentially have your federal student loan debt forgiven. That is an option that many ITT Tech students now have.  There is another aspect of this that we should not overlook. These schools do not just exploit students who are fresh out of high school or coming from some other place, unfortunately, they defraud veterans. Veterans using GI bill benefits at ITT Tech have been unfairly affected by this company's practices and now its closure and bankruptcy. For years, ITT Tech has been a major recipient of GI bill benefits. According to the 2014 report by Senator Tom Harkin's HELP Committee, ITT Tech was the third largest recipient in 2012 and 2013, receiving $161 million in GI bill funds.  When it closed earlier this month, an estimated 7,000 veterans were enrolled at the school that has now gone out of business. Not only have these veterans used up part or, in some cases, all of their limited GI bill education benefits, some of them relied on VA housing assistance to pay their rent and afford a place to live for themselves and their families.  Veterans can only receive this housing stipend if they are enrolled in a school that qualifies for GI bill benefits. So the closure of ITT Tech has put these veterans and their families at risk of being unable to afford their current housing, disrupting their lives. I support a bipartisan bill introduced by my colleagues Senators Blumenthal and Tillis, a bipartisan bill to reinstate GI bill education benefits in certain cases and give the Secretary of the VA the authority to temporarily extend housing benefits to vets, including those who attended ITT Tech.  This bill, called the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Education Relief and Restoration Act or VERRA, was included in a larger bipartisan VA reform package that I hope the Senate will still take up this year. But the closure of ITT Tech makes the need to pass VERRA urgent. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this common-sense, bipartisan legislation before we adjourn. I urge them to stop and reflect on the fact that these for-profit schools are exploiting students and families, members of the military and their families, and veterans across the United States.  Why, in good conscience, are we allowing this to continue? It is time for us to put some standards of conduct on this for-profit university industry that has taken so much money from our Federal Treasury, from $25 to $30 billion a year. These heavily subsidized, crony capitalist operations are a disgrace.  Ten percent of all students enrolled in postsecondary education attend for-profit colleges and universities. Forty percent of all the student loan defaults are from the students at these for-profit colleges and universities. Their tuitions are outrageously high, their diplomas are outrageously worthless, and many students and innocent people pay a heavy price.  I will close with a story about one of them I represent. Laura Cotton is one of those students who was misled by ITT Tech. She is a single mom in Oak Lawn, IL, working part time. She saw the come-on advertising of ITT Tech, had a lot of conversations with their recruiters about their great programs and the job she would get with an ITT Tech degree.  She said they never bothered to talk to her about what it was going to cost and how she was going to pay for it. She ended up enrolling in an online criminal justice program. According to Laura, most of the courses had nothing to do with her program of study. ITT Tech would just send her paperwork to sign, more loans, Federal and private.  She ended up dropping out of ITT Tech when she finally added up all of the money they had enticed her to borrow. Laura has a debt of $98,000 from ITT Tech and nothing--no degree, nothing to show for it.  In a letter she sent me, Laura wrote: ``My American dream of home ownership, purchasing a new car, giving my kids an education has suffered because my credit is now shot.''  I wish Laura's story was unique. I wish more Members of the Senate and Congress would sit down and talk to people just like her who have been victims of these for-profit colleges and universities. When are we going to accept our responsibility to clean up this shameful industry?  I yield the floor.
