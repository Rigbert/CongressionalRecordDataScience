President, I am only going to speak very briefly. I wish to shine a spotlight on a provision of Senator McCain's substitute that has not yet been discussed that actually raises constitutional issues.  All of us believe the labor force of the Postal Service is too large and unfortunately will have to be reduced, and we do that through a system of buyouts and retirement incentives through a compassionate means very similar to the way a large corporation would handle the downsizing of its employees. But Senator McCain's alternative takes a very different approach. It would have this new control board that would be created to impose on the Postal Service an obligation to renegotiate existing contracts to get rid of the no-layoff provision.  I will say I was very surprised when the Postmaster General signed the kinds of contracts he did this spring. The fact is Senator McCain's amendment--section 304 of which amends section 1206 of existing law--requires existing contracts to be renegotiated. That creates constitutional questions. The potential constitutional issue derives from the contracts clause of article I, which prohibits States from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. Of course, this provision does not apply to the Federal Government. The Congressional Research Service has explained in a memorandum to me on this topic in July of 2011 that the due process clause of thefifth amendment has been held to provide some measure of protection against the Federal Government impairing its own contracts. I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memorandum I just referred to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2011.                               MEMORANDUM     To: Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs Attention: Lisa Nieman.     From: Thomas J. Nicola, Legislative Attorney, 7 5004.     Subject: Congressional Authority to Alter Postal Service          Employee-Management Relations, Including Collective          Bargaining Agreements.       This memorandum responds to your inquiry regarding the      authority of Congress to alter Postal Service employee-     management relations, including collective bargaining      agreements. The employee-management authority that Congress      has granted to the United States Postal Service in the Postal      Service Reorganization Act of 1970, P.L. 91 375, is broader      than authority that it has granted to most federal entities.      Congress enacted the 1970 Act, codified in title 39 of the      United States Code, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to      operate more like a business than a government agency. Before      this statute became law, postal services were operated by the      Post Office Department, a cabinet level government agency.       The Act established the Postal Service as an independent      establishment in the executive branch of the United States      Government. While Congress applied to the Postal Service some      statutes including those relating to veterans' preference and      retirement that apply to federal agencies, it provided in 39      U.S.C. section 1209(a) that, ``Employee-management relations      shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of      this title [title 39 of the U.S. Code], be subject to the      provisions of subchapter II of chapter 7 of title 29[,]''      i.e., the National Labor Relations Act, which governs private      sector employee-management relations. By contrast, provisions      relating to those relations for federal agencies are codified      in chapter 71 of title 5 of the United States Code.       In section 1005 of title 39, Congress identified subjects      of Postal Service collective bargaining--compensation,      benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. This      scope of subjects differs from the scope for federal agencies      identified in chapter 71 of title 5, which is limited to      ``conditions of employment.''       Addressing the transition from the Post Office Department      to the businesslike U.S. Postal Service, Congress in 39      U.S.C. section 1005(f), as amended, stated, in relevant part,      that:       No variation, addition, or substitution with respect to      fringe benefits shall result in a program of fringe benefits      which on the whole is less favorable to the officers and      employees in effect on the effective date of this section      [enacted on August 12, 1970], and as to officers and      employees/or whom there is a collective-bargaining      representative, no such variation, addition, or substitution      shall be made except by agreement between the collective      bargaining representative and the Postal Service.'' (Emphasis      supplied.)       In section 1207 of title 39, Congress provided procedures      for terminating or modifying collective bargaining      agreements. It stated that a party wishing to terminate or      modify an agreement must serve timely written notice on the      other party. If parties cannot agree on a resolution or adopt      a procedure for a binding resolution of a dispute, the      Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service      must appoint a mediator. This section also provided authority      to establish an arbitration board under certain circumstances      and said that board decisions are conclusive and binding on      the parties.       A collective bargaining agreement is a contract between the      Postal Service and a recognized bargaining unit. Can Congress      affect a collective bargaining agreement through legislative      action? The power of Congress over employee-management      relations at the Postal Service, including these agreements,      may be divided into prospective authority versus authority      over existing agreements. Congress has authority to modify      the scope of bargaining prospectively. In the Postal      Reorganization Act of 1970, Congress granted the Postal      Service authority to bargain over compensation, benefits      (such as health insurance and life insurance, for example),      and other conditions of employment, but it could amend that      statute to limit the scope of bargaining subjects in the      future. It could, for example, provide that health insurance      no longer will be the subject of collective bargaining after      collective bargaining agreements that address that subject      expire.       A more difficult question is whether Congress could modify      agreement terms that the Postal Service and recognized      bargaining representatives have bargained collectively and      included in collective bargaining agreements before they      expire. Article I, section 10, clause 1 of the United States      Constitution, the Contract Clause, provides that laws      impairing the obligation of contracts shall not be passed,      but this prohibition applies to the states, not to the      federal government. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence under      this clause may help inform an inquiry regarding the power of      Congress to modify terms of collective bargaining agreements      while they are in effect.       In United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, the Supreme Court      said that, ``Although the Contract Clause appears literally      to proscribe `any' impairment, this Court has observed that      `the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read      with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.' '' It      added that:       The Contract Clause is not an absolute bar to subsequent      modification of a state's own financial obligations. As with      laws impairing the obligation of private contracts, an      impairment [of those obligations] may be reasonable and      necessary to serve an important public purpose. In applying      this standard, however, complete [judicial] deference to a      legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not      appropriate because the state's self interest is at stake. A      governmental entity can always find a use for extra money,      especially when taxes do not have to be raised. If a state      could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to      spend the money for what it regarded as an important public      purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at      all.       Based on the United States Trust Co. case, courts      subsequently developed a three-part test when assessing the      constitutionality of state action challenged as an impairment      of contracts--(1) whether the state action in fact impairs a      contractual obligation; (2) whether the impairment is      substantial; and (3) whether the impairment nevertheless is      reasonable and necessary to serve a public purpose.       Although the Contract Clause does not apply to the federal      government, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has      been held to provide some measure of protection against the      federal government impairing its own contracts, but the      limitations imposed on federal economic legislation by the      latter clause have been held to be ``less searching'' than      those involving the state legislation under the Contract      Clause. In two Depression-era cases, however, the Supreme      Court held that some statutes which impaired obligations to      pay purchasers of federally issued war risk insurance and      bondholders that Congress had enacted as economy measures      exceeded constitutional limits.       If a court should be influenced by the reasoning expressed      in these cases, it may strike down as a Due Process Clause      violation a statute it finds to impair a term of a Postal      Service collective bargaining agreement before that agreement      expires. If a court should wish to avoid deciding a case      involving whether such a statute violates the Due Process      Clause, a constitutional ground, it may uphold the statute,      but require the United States to pay damages for breaching a      term of the agreement. Alternatively, because the limitations      on federal impairment of contracts have been held to be      ``less searching'' than those that apply to state impairments      under the Contract Clause of the Constitution, which are      permitted if found to be ``reasonable and necessary,'' a      court may uphold a statute that impairs a term of a current      Postal Service collective bargaining agreement and not assess      damages against the United States.
