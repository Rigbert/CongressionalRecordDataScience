 President, I am satisfied, and I will send to the desk, if I may, with the permission of the chairman, a modification that has been agreed to by Senator Stevens and myself.  On behalf of Senator Stevens, I ask that a modification to amendment No. 2065 be sent to the desk. This adds one word to the amendment which I have cleared with Senator Stevens and with Chairman Helms. I want to state my understanding about this amendment before we adopt it, which I have also cleared with the Senator from Alaska.  First, this amendment does not affect the Partnership for Peace Program.  Second, I understand this to mean that NATO cannot incur NATO expansion costs for which the United States would be obligated to pay except through NATO's common-funded budgets unless specifically authorized by law. And with those understandings, the amendment, as modified, is perfectly acceptable to me.
