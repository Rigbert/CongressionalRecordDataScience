President, let me also commend Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin and Senator Alexander because I too am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I think it does represent a remarkably thoughtful and bipartisan approach to the problem of providing resources to local States and communities so they can carry out the very challenging issues of local governments. I am not surprised that Senator Alexander is a key element in this product. Both Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin deserve to be complimented. I thank them for their leadership.                          ____________________
