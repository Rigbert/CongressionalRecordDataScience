For every proposal like that, thank goodness there has been a reaction by the public and the medical profession and everybody else to say: Wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense. Again, it is an agenda-oriented board or commission or whatever that comes under the banner of rationing.  I have a wonderful chart I will show to you in the next colloquy in regard to the four rations--and one was just mentioned--and then ask me about IPAB. They are a little benign. I am going to have to change the caricatures. They are like the four horsemen of the apocalypse in regard to the health care system of the United States. As you look at each one of them and what they are doing, they are rationing care. They are rationing care.
