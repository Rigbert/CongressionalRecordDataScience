I presume and hope, and the Speaker hopes, I'm sure, and everybody who receives information from the intelligence community believes and hopes that it is accurate and is as good an assessment and as honest an assessment as can be given. Everyone hopes that. Mr. Hoekstra, who is on the floor, hopes that. Mr. Reyes, who is the chairman of the committee, hopes that. I hope it when I am briefed. I am sure you do as well when you are briefed. But if it's not, I don't hold myself culpable, you culpable, Mr. Hoekstra culpable or Mr. Reyes culpable.  So I continue to be confused that your focus is on the Speaker, not on the quality of the information.
