Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee and the manager of this bill. Let me say I agree with everything the Senator said. I thought we were going to finish it tonight, but if it is tomorrow, it is tomorrow. It is too significant not to finish it.  I appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts joining me in yielding back the remainder of our time. We are going to be ready to take a vote here shortly.
