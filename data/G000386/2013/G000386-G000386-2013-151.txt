 But right out of the box, right now, just on the third day, they want to subject our amendments to a filibuster-like 60-vote threshold. So I have to ask, who is obstructing now?  There is no reason, particularly in this first week at the beginning of the process, to be blocking our amendments with a 60-vote margin as required when you suppose there is a filibuster.  Let's at least start out with regular order; otherwise, it really looks as if the fix is in and the bill is rigged to pass basically as it is.  Bottom line: You should have seen how the 18 members of the Judiciary Committee operated for 5 or 6 days over a 2-week period of time. Everything was open. Everything was transparent. There was complete cooperation between the majority and the minority. There is no reason we cannot do that out here in the Senate right now, particularly at the beginning. This is a very provocative act.
