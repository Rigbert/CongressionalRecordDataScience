 President, tomorrow, the Senate will begin consideration of the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Senator Leahy and I will be here and ready for amendments. However, no votes will occur tomorrow. The next vote will be on Monday about 5:30 p.m. I anticipate the vote will be in relation to an amendment offered either Friday or next Monday to the Foreign Operations bill.  We are also attempting to clear some executive nominations, and a vote or votes may be necessary early next week on those nominations.                          ____________________[Page S8328]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
