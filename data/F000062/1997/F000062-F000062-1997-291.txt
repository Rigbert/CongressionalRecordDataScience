 President, on behalf of myself, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to reintroduce a Senate resolution acknowledging the achievements of NetDay and affirming NetDay's commitment to wire our local K-12 schools to the information superhighway. I wish to commend the organizers and volunteers of NetDay, a nationwide public-private partnership.  Last year, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than 100,000 Americans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their neighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of the schools came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout the Nation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install communications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their schools for the 21st century.  Their success was significant. Over 25,000 elementary, junior, and senior high schools were wired. Throughout the United States, volunteers climbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install the wiring infrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and secondary school classrooms with contemporary technology.  In recognition of the NetDay effort, I am very proud to submit a Senate resolution commending all of the more than 100,000 volunteers for their hard work and dedication to ensure that schools throughout America have the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century.  NetDay began in California on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by co-founders John Gage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading technology companies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public broadcasting station. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a day where hundreds of Californians came out to an old-fashioned barn raising for the modern technology age.  Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with neighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns, or community buildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of neighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay succeeded in 1 year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost effectively, establishing and improving our classroom information infrastructure up and down the State.  The NetDay effort is an important one to California. Despite the State's tremendous resources, opportunities, and wealth of technology companies, California still ranks at the bottom of States in funds spent per student on computers. The cost today of providing a computer for each student, from kindergarten to high school, is approximately $6 billion for 1,159,565 computers in California. NetDay activities are one way to ease some of the financial burden.  With our current budget deficit, we have been doing everything to encourage local, volunteer solutions to difficult problems. NetDay activities across America have and will continue to save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars in technology start-up costs by providing equipment, computer time, and training for teachers through the school's corporate partners. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers have been instrumental in making NetDay a successful reality.  But we should also note that NetDay was not just about saving money. The most valuable asset of NetDay was the commitment of thousands of volunteers who worked in their community schools. The relationships formed between schools and their communities will extend beyond 1996. NetDay volunteers have the continued goal of stimulating and facilitating communities in the United States to participate in their local schools. Parents and neighbors who had previously never visited or been involved in their children's school are now motivated to come back to the classroom and work to improve their child's learning environment.  NetDay organizers tell me that communities across the Nation are already planning to organize future NetDay activities, building and expanding upon earlier achievements. Further, in April of this year, NetDay organizers will be focusing resources on schools and communities that are often underserved.  We all agree our children deserve the finest preparation possible to face the demands of the changing information-based economy. We need to provide the next generation with the proper training for high-technology, well paying jobs. This will only happen if we include all our neighborhoods. NetDay will help meet these challenges, stressing educational opportunity for everyone by reaching out to rural and lower income communities where current technology may be inadequate or incomplete. Even if students don't have computers at home, at least students can have access at schools to explore, develop skills, learn, and grow. Congress should encourage these important goals.  With this resolution we can support the overall effort of ensuring that our classrooms are equipped with effective and constructive learning tools. As students move from elementary school to high school and then into college or the work force, it is imperative that these individuals are adequately trained to use contemporary technologies. This resolution will help motivate our communities, both volunteers and businesses, to provide donated resources, to build upon the success of the NetDay experience and to ensure that the children in all our towns and cities reap the benefits of an advanced learning environment.  I would also like to take this time to congratulate this administration for making the improvement of our classroom's technological infrastructure a priority. This administration deserves great credit for advancing education and technology. Last year, President Clinton and Vice President Gore joined thousands of Californian volunteers in fulfilling this goal. They also support the expansion of NetDay activities nationwide to increase the level of technology in our classrooms to enhance our children's ability to learn.  It is my pleasure to submit this resolution commending the NetDay co-founders, Michael Kaufman and John Gage, the dozens of corporate sponsors and business partners, and the thousands of students, teachers, parents, and neighbors working in community schools throughout California and the Nation. The success and commitment they have shown can serve as a positive model, this year and in future years.  My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate Information Technology Caucus, Senator John Warner joins me in cosponsoring this resolution. In addition, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my California colleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the advancement of educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. Together, we urge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support for preparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century.  In today's global economy, America's students will face challenges on an international scale. Students must graduate with the skills needed to face today's changing workplace. Computers and technology can enhance the educational experience of children and provide a valuable complement to traditional teaching tools. Technology is not the complete solution to our complex education needs, but it is an important area that needs both our attention and our support.  I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership effort.                          ____________________
