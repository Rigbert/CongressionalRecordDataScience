President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and also for the great job he has done in bringing this Defense authorization bill to the floor.  Mr. President, on early Thursday morning, about 5:30, my radio alarm went off and I heard the three words--al-Zarqawi is dead. I think that affected me by just hearing that. I sat up in bed, and I thought it did work. It is happening. I told the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that I have to go to Iraq.
