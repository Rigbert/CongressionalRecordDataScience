 President, on July 18 here in Washington, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology will be honoring its members who have won the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology. The honorees include the three Nobel Prize winners from the year 2000: Dr. Arvid Carlsson from Goteborg University in Sweden, Dr. Paul Greengard from Rockefeller University in New York City, and Dr. Eric Kandel from Columbia University in New York City. Also being honored is the 1970 Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Julius Axelrod from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Together, these Nobel Prize winners have helped us begin to understand how that most mysterious and important human organ, the brain, actually works.  The brain is a huge collection of nerve cells, connected to each other in complicated networks. Nerve impulses, which are the means of communicating information from the brain to the various parts of the body, are conducted from one end of a nerve cell to another by a form of electrical action. Dr. Axelrod's work set the stage for our modern knowledge of brain neurochemistry by establishing the important role of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that serve to transmit these nerve impulses from one nerve cell to another through a connecting region called the synapse. A key first step in understanding the brain was this discovery that, as nerve impulses move from nerve cell to nerve cell, they switch from an electrical conduction to a chemical conduction and then back again to an electrical conduction.  Dr. Carlsson started to fill in this general outline by discovering that the chemical dopamine was one of these important chemicals that transmits nerve signals from one nerve cell to another. Moreover, dopamine seemed to be very important in controlling body motions. Dr. Carlsson's work with experimental animals who were deficient in dopamine led to the seminal discovery that Parkinson's disease in humans, a disabling and progressive disease associated with tremors and impaired mobility, was directly related to a deficiency of dopamine in certain parts of the brain. This landmark finding led directly to the treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa, a drug that is converted to dopamine in the body. To this very day, the foundation for treatment of this illness is the use of medications that increase dopamine in the brain or mimic its action there.  Dr. Carlsson also discovered that the drugs used to treat schizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting thought processes, also seemed to work by affecting the action of dopamine in thebrain. In contrast to the situation with Parkinson's disease, in which administration of L-dopa seemed to work by increasing dopamine in the brain, the antipsychotic drugs such as thorazine, which are used to treat schizophrenia, seemed to work by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain. To this very day, medications that block the effects of dopamine remain the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Dr. Carlsson's work was instrumental in establishing the biological foundation of mental illness, which has led to our ability to target treatment of such disorders with medications based on their specific biochemical cause.  Dr. Greengard carried this line of work one step further, examining exactly how such neurotransmitters work as they transfer nerve impulses from one nerve cell to another through the connecting region called the synapse. He described in detail the cascade of chemical reactions that occurs as the neurotransmitter chemicals stimulate the next nerve cell in the nerve pathway, which results in conversion of the nerve impulse back into an electrical signal. Particularly important was the discovery of the different speeds at which these nerve signals are transmitted across the synapse. This framework enabled him to establish, on a molecular and biochemical level, the mechanism of action of various drugs that act on the central nervous system.  Finally, Dr. Kandel expanded the context of this research area by showing how such complex processes as memory and learning are directly related to the basic biochemical foundations outlined by Drs. Greengard, Carlsson, and Axelrod. In detailed studies in animals, Dr. Kandel showed that the process of memory was associated with specific changes in the shape and functioning of the synapse region that connects pairs of nerve cells. This research revealed that these connections between nerve cells, rather than being just passive junctions, are actually vitally important in the complicated processes of the nervous system.  The brain could be said to be the ultimate human frontier. As scientists pieced together the function of all the other organs in the body over the last few centuries, the brain remained an enigma. The work of Drs. Axelrod, Carlsson, Greengard, and Kandel starts to clear away some of the mystery that surrounds the brain, and this research has already led to practical, clinical advances to help millions of people with neurological and mental disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. This basic understanding of how the brain works is clearly necessary for understanding of the numerous brain disorders that affect many more millions of people worldwide, some of which are just starting to be elucidated. Moreover, these pioneering studies have opened the door to the development of targeted medications to treat such illnesses. I am particularly excited about the possibility that this research will unlock the key to the medical treatment of substance abuse disorders, whose social impact in our country is enormous. On behalf of the many people who stand to live longer and more fulfilling lives as a result of their discoveries, I extend my deepest congratulations to these esteemed Nobel laureates.                          ____________________
