This is no so-called private company. This is a firm run by the Russian Government. As the Senator from Texas goes through the litany of countries they are supplying, he is going through a litany of countries that have never in recent times had the best interests of the United States at heart. If the Russians, through their government company, want to supply Iran--which we know is an exporter of terrorism not only in the Middle East but around the world and in the United States--if they want to supply them, if they want to supply sniper rifles and arms to the Syrians to kill their own people--why in the world are we doing business with them? There ought to be a line we draw at some point. We have no moral obligation to do business with a firm that is, in fact, supplying those who are killing innocent people and our enemies around the world.  I thank the Senator from Texas for raising those points.
