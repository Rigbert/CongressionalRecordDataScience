Mr. Speaker, time is running out for us to stop mad scientists from cloning innocent human beings.  Infamous fertility specialist Severino Antinori is working with a team of scientists right now to clone humans. He recently told the BBC radio, and I quote, I think in 3 or 4 months we will have the first pregnancy. Asked whether he would have a cloned human being by September 2002, he said, I hope and I believe.  Columnist Charles Krauthammer is one of the many calling on the Senate to pass a human cloning ban. He recently said, and I quote, ``Sanity and prudence combined to produce a great victory on July 31 when the House of Representatives overwhelmingly defeated--the margin was over 100 votes--the legalization of early human embryonic cloning. But the fight is not over. The Senate needs to act as well.''  Our government, Mr. Speaker, cannot sit idly by as unethical scientists play God and redefine what it means to be a human. We cannot allow this violation of human rights, this crime against humanity, to take place on our watch.  We need a cloning ban and we need it now.                          ____________________
