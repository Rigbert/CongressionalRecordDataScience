 President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record a speech delivered on November 11 by the majority leader, Senator Frist, to the Federalist Society regarding the treatment of judicial nominations in the 108th Congress.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Remarks as Prepared for Majority Leader Bill Frist, MD, the Federalist                     Society 2004 National Convention       Wardman Park Marriott Hotel, Nov. 11.--Thank you all for      that warm welcome. You've succeeded at an almost impossible      task: you've put a doctor at ease in a room filled with a      thousand lawyers.       I take great pride in being a citizen legislator--someone      who sets aside a career for a period of time to serve in      public office.       Perhaps the most famous citizen legislator of modern times      was Jefferson Smith. Or, as he's better known: ``Mr. Smith''      in the classic American film, ``Mr. Smith Goes to      Washington.''       One of my favorite scenes in that movie is when Mr. Smith      takes the oath of office. He raises his right hand. And the      Senate President reads the oath.       Mr. Smith pledges: ``I do.'' Then the Senate President says      with a less than subtle touch of sarcasm: ``Senator, you can      talk all you want to, now.''       United States Senators do talk all they want. And, with      only one Senator and the presiding officer in the chamber      during many debates, you often see them talking just to      themselves.       It makes me think that I'd be a lot better prepared as      Majority Leader with 20 years of experience, not as a heart      surgeon, but as a psychiatrist.       The right to talk--the right to unlimited debate--is a      tradition as old as the Senate itself.       It's unique to the institution. It shapes the character of      the institution.       It's why the United States Senate is the world's greatest      deliberative body. And, as James Madison wrote in Federalist      No. 63, ``History informs us of no long lived republic which      had not a senate.''       From time to time Senators use the right to unlimited      debate to stop a bill. A Senator takes the floor, is      recognized, starts talking, and doesn't stop talking.       This brings Senate business to a halt. And it's called a      filibuster.       Senators have used the filibuster throughout much of Senate      history. The first was launched in 1841 to block a banking      bill. Civil rights legislation was filibustered throughout      the 1950s and 60s.       The flamboyant Huey Long once took the floor and      filibustered for over 15 hours straight.       When Senator Long suggested that his colleagues--many of      whom were dozing off--be forced to listen to his speech, the      presiding officer replied, ``That would be unusual cruelty      under the Bill of Rights.''       The current Minority has not hesitated to use the      filibuster to bring Senate business to a halt in the current      Congress.       I have grave concerns, however, about one particular and      unprecedented use of the filibuster.       I know it concerns you, as well. And it should concern      every American who values our institutions and our      constitutional system of government.       Tonight I want to share with you my thoughts about the      filibuster of judicial nominees: it is radical; it is      dangerous; and it must be overcome.       The Senate must be allowed to confirm judges who fairly,      justly and independently interpret the law.       The current Minority has filibustered 10--and threatened to      filibuster another 6--nominees to federal appeals courts.       This is unprecedented in over 200 years of Senate history.       Never before has a Minority blocked a judicial nominee that      has majority support for an up-or-down vote on the Senate      floor.       Never.       Now the Minority says the filibuster is their only choice,      because the Majority controls both the White House and the      Senate. But that fails the test of history.       The same party controlled the White House and the Senate      for 70 percent of the 20th Century. No Minority filibustered      judicial nominees then.       Howard Baker's Republican Minority didn't filibuster      Democrat Jimmy Carter's nominees.       Robert Byrd's Democrat Minority didn't filibuster      Republican Ronald Reagan's nominees.       Bob Dole's Republican Minority didn't filibuster Democrat      Bill Clinton's nominees.       Now there's nothing specific in the formal Rules of the      Senate that restrained those Minorities from filibustering.      They simply used self-restraint.       Those Senators didn't filibuster, because it wasn't      something Senators did.       They understood the Senate's role in the appointments      process. And they heeded the intent and deferred to the      greater wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution.       Then came the 108th Congress.       Majority control of the Senate switched hands. And one      month later--in February 2003--the Minority radically broke      with tradition and precedent and launched the first-ever      filibuster of a judicial nominee who had majority support.       That nominee was Miguel Estrada--a member of this society.       You know first-hand that Miguel Estrada is an extraordinary      human being.       He's an inspiration to all Americans and all people who      aspire to one day live the American dream.       Miguel Estrada immigrated to the United States from      Honduras as a teenager. He spoke little English.       But with a strong heart and a brilliant mind, he worked his      way up to the highest levels of the legal profession.       He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from      Columbia College in New York. He earned his J.D. from Harvard      Law School--where he served as editor of the Harvard Law      Review.       He clerked in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and for      Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He worked as a Deputy      Chief U.S. Attorney and as an Assistant to the Solicitor      General of the United States.       Miguel Estrada would have been a superb addition to the      D.C. Circuit court. He's considered to be among the best of      the best legal minds in America.       The American Bar Association gave him their highest rating.       But after two years, more than 100 hours of debate, and a      record 7 attempts to move to an up-or-down vote, Miguel      Estrada withdrew his name from consideration.       A sad chapter in the Senate's history came to a close. But,      unfortunately, it was just the beginning.       The Minority extended its obstruction to Priscilla Owen,      Carolyn Kuhl, William Pryor,       Charles Pickering, Janice Rogers Brown, Bill Myers, Henry      Saad, Richard Griffin and David McKeague.       With the filibuster of Miguel Estrada, the subsequent      filibuster of 9 other judicial nominees, and the threat of 6      more filibusters, the Minority has abandoned over 200 years      of Senate tradition and precedent.       This radical action presents a serious challenge to the      Senate as an institution and the principle so essential to      our general liberty--the separation of powers.       It would be easy to attribute the Minority's actions to      mere partisanship. But there is much more at work.       The Minority seeks nothing less than to realign the      relationship between our three branches of government.       The Minority has not been satisfied with simply voting      against the nominees--which is their right. They want to      require a supermajority of 60 votes for confirmation.       This would establish a new threshold that would defy the      clear intent of the Framers.       After much debate and compromise, the Framers concluded      that the President should have the power to appoint. And the      Senate should confirm or reject appointments by a simple      majority vote.       This is ``advice and consent.'' And it's an essential check      in the appointment process.       But the Minority's filibuster prevents the Senate from      giving ``advice and consent.'' They deny the Senate the right      to carry out its Constitutional duty.       This diminishes the role of the Senate as envisioned by the      Framers. It silences the American people and the voices of      their elected representatives.       And that is wrong.       This filibuster is nothing less than a formula for tyranny      by the minority.       The President would have to make appointments that not just      win a majority vote, but also pass the litmus tests of an      obstructionist minority.       If this is allowed to stand, the Minority will have      effectively seized from the President the power to appoint      judges.       Never mind the Constitution.       Never mind the separation of powers.       Never mind the most recent election--in which the American      people agreed that obstruction must end.       The Senate cannot allow the filibuster of circuit court      nominees to continue. Nor can we allow the filibuster to      extend to potential Supreme Court nominees.       Senators must be able to debate the merits of nominees on      the floor and have the opportunity to publicly and      permanently record a yes or no vote.       We must leave this obstruction behind. And we can--as an      aberration in Senate history and a relic of a closely divided      body during a challenging time for America.       The American people have re-elected a President and      significantly expanded the Senate majority.       It would be wrong to allow a Minority to defy the will of a      clear and decisive Majority that supports a judicial nominee.       And it would be wrong to allow a Senate Minority to erode      the traditions of our body and undermine the separation of      powers.       To tolerate continued filibusters would be to accept      obstruction and harden the destructive precedents established      in the current Congress.       With its judicial filibusters, the Minority has taken      radical action. Now the damage must be undone.       American government must be allowed to function. And      America must be allowed to move forward.       Senate rules and procedures have been shaped and molded      throughout the body's history.       They're not set in stone. They can be changed to fit the      governing climate, to respond to emerging challenges, and to      restore vital constitutional traditions.       So when it became clear that the Minority was intent on      abusing the filibuster in this       Congress, we proposed to reform the rules.       In May 2003, Senator Zell Miller and I--joined by every      member of the Majority leadership--proposed a new way to end      debate and move to an up-or-down vote on nominations over a      reasonable period of time.       A first attempt would require 60 votes, the next 57, the      next 54, then 51, and finally we could end debate by a simple      majority.       The Frist-Miller resolution went to the Rules Committee.      Senator Lott chaired a hearing and the committee approved it      in June.       For the remainder of 2003 and all of this year, Frist-     Miller has sat on the Senate calendar--facing a certain      filibuster by those who want to continue to filibuster      judges.       The Frist-Miller reforms would be a civil, constructive and      cooperative way to end the filibuster of judicial nominees.       The Senate now faces a choice: either we accept a new and      destructive practice, or we act to restore constitutional      balance.       We are the stewards of rich Senate traditions and      constitutional principles that must be respected. We are the      leaders elected by the American people to move this country      forward.       As my colleague, Senator Feinstein said, ``A nominee is      entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them down. . . . If we      don't like them, we can vote against them. That is the honest      thing to do.''       I fervently believe in the principles of the American      Founding.       And I know you do too. Because I serve and work closely      with 4 members of this society: Mitch McConnell, John Kyl,      Jeff Sessions and Orrin Hatch.       Let me say this about these Senators: there are no more      passionate defenders of America's founding principles      anywhere in our government. They are true patriots.       They know that the principles enshrined in our Constitution      have guided a miraculous experiment that has matured into the      most stable form of government in human history.       And if we truly desire lasting solutions to the challenges      of the 21st century, those same principles must guide us      today and in the future.       The filibuster of judicial nominees is about Senate      tradition. It's about the separation of powers. It's about      our constitutional system of government.       But, at the most fundamental level, this filibuster is      about our legacy as the leaders of the greatest people and      nation on the face of the Earth.       What will we accomplish over the next four years? What will      we do with the time and the trust that the American people      have so generously given us?       One way or another, the filibuster of judicial nominees      must end. The Senate must do what is good, what is right,      what is reasonable, and what is honorable.       The Senate must do its duty.       And, when we do, we will preserve and vindicate America's      founding principles for our time and for generations to come.                          ____________________
