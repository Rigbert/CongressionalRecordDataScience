 President, I rise today to recognize the career of Mr. Lee Todd, who is working hard to make Lexington, KY, a major stop on the information highway. Lee is president and CEO of DataBeam, one of the State's few high-technology companies.  Lee grew up in Earlington, KY, where at age 14 he became the best pool shooter in town. Lee credits his early years in the western Kentucky town with helping make him who he is today. In a recent article in Blugrass magazine, Lee says ``I think every kid needs something to feel good about, to develop self esteem. For some kids it was athletics. For me, it was pool.''  After graduating from high school, Lee attended Murray State University, but after 2 years he transferred to the University of Kentucky. After receiving his diploma, Lee moved to Boston and attended M.I.T., where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D in electrical engineering. It was also in Boston that he met his wife, Patsy.  The Todds returned home to the Bluegrass State after graduation. They settled in Lexington, and Lee got a job in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Kentucky. He taught at U.K. for 9 years, and during that time he was honored with several teaching awards, including the coveted U.K. Alumni Association Great Teacher Award.  Lee caught ``entrepreneur fever'' at M.I.T, where he was awarded with six patents for advancements in picture tube technology. These patents helped lead to the development of DataBeam. In 1993, DataBeam introduced FarSite, the first software-driven computer conference room system. This high-technology allows a document to be viewed at the same time on different computer screens at different locations throughout the country.  DataBeam, which was given the Outstanding Small Business Award in 1988, is currently focusing on partnerships. The company recently added software giant Microsoft to its list of partners, which already includes AT&T, MCI, and Motorola.  Lee believes that by improving education and by helping to create a high-technology industry, Kentucky will have a brighter future. He founded and chairs the Kentucky Science, and Technology Counsel, which developed a hands-on learning package for elementary schoolchildren. This program is now used in about 60 percent of the elementary schools across the State.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this outstanding Kentuckian for his many accomplishments. I am confident that Mr. Todd will continue to invest in the future of Kentucky, as he has done so graciously in the past.                          ____________________
