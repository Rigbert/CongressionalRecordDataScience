 President, I ask that a statement by the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding proportionate liability be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       SEC Chairman Levitt has been forceful about the need to      protect fraud victims in the insolvency situation, even when      it forces parties who are only partially responsible for the      harm to bear more than their proportionate share of the      damages. In 1994 House testimony, Levitt explained:       ``Since securities fraud cases often involve insolvent      issuers or individuals, however, some defendants in such      cases may not be able to pay their fair share of the damages      they have jointly caused. Advocates of proportionate      liability argue that joint and several liability produces an      inequitable result in such circumstances because it forces      parties who are only partially responsible for the harm to      bear more than their proportionate share of the damages. . .      .''       ``The response to this argument is that, although the      traditional doctrine of joint and several liability may cause      accountants and others to bear more than their proportional      share of liability in particular cases, this is because the      current system is based on equitable principles that operate      to protect innocent investors. In essence, as between      defrauded investors and the professional advisers who assist      a fraud by knowingly or recklessly failing to meet      professional standards, the risk of loss should fall on the      latter. Defrauded investors should not be denied an      opportunity to recover all of their losses simply because      some defendants are more culpable than others.''
