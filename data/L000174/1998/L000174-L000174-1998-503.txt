President, this really has been a long time coming, and I appreciate the effort of my friend, the chairman, who is on the floor, to support this nomination. I commend my good friend, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who has been indefatigable in this effort. She has worked and worked and worked. I believe she has spoken to every single Senator, every single potential Senator, every single past Senator, certainly to all the judges, and she has been at us over and over again to make sure that this day would come. She has worked with the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, and Republican and Democratic Senators alike. I appreciate all that she has done. We have all been aided by our colleague, Senator Feinstein. She has spoken out strongly for Margaret Morrow as a member of the Judiciary Committee and as a Senator.  I feel though, as Senator Boxer has said, that none of us would have predicted that it would take 21 months to get this nomination before the Senate. I know that we would not even be here now if the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished majority leader had not made the commitment before we broke last fall to proceed to this nomination this week.  I have spoken about this nomination so many times I have almost lost track of the number. I will not speak as long as I would otherwise today because I want to yield to the Senator from California. But I think people should know that for some time there was an unexplained hold on this outstanding nominee. This is a nominee, incidentally, who was reported out of the Judiciary Committee twice. This is a nominee who is the first woman to be the president of the California State Bar Association and a president of the Los Angeles County bar.  This is a nominee who is a partner in a prestigious law firm. This is a nominee who has the highest rating that lawyers can be given when they come before our committee for approval as a judge. This is a woman about whom letters were sent to me and to other Senators from some of the leading Republicans and some of the leading Democrats in California and from others whose background I know only because of their reputations, extraordinary reputations. I have no idea what their politics are. But all of them, whether they describe themselves as conservatives, liberals, moderates or apolitical, all of them say what an extraordinary woman she is. And I agree.  I have read all of the reports about her. I have read all the things people said in her favor, and the things, ofttimes anonymous, said against her. I look at all those and I say of this woman: If I were a litigant, plaintiff or defendant, government or defendant, no matter what side I was on, I could look at this woman and say I am happy to come into her court. I am happy to have my case heard by her--whether I am rich, poor, white, black, no matter what might be my background. I know she would give a fair hearing.  Now, finally, after 12 months on the Senate calendar without action over the course of the last 3 years, I am glad that the debate is beginning. I am also glad we can now look forward to the end of the ordeal for Margaret Morrow, for her family, her friends and her supporters.  Her supporters include the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and half the Republican members on that committee. The Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, calls her ``an excellent addition to the Federal bench.'' All of these people have praised her.  To reiterate, this day has been a long time coming. When this accomplished lawyer was first nominated by the President of the United States to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Central District of California, none of us would have predicted that it would be more than 21 months before that nomination was considered by the United States Senate.  I thank the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for fulfilling the commitment made late last year to turn to this nomination before the February recess. Fairness to the people and litigants in the Central District of California and to Margaret Morrow and her family demand no less.  I trust that those who credit local law enforcement and local prosecutors and local judges from time to time as it suits them will credit the views of the many California judges and local officials who have written to the Senate over the last several months in support of the confirmation of Margaret Morrow. I will cite just a few examples:Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block; Orange County District Attorney Michael R. Capizzi; former U.S. Attorney and former head of the DEA under President Bush, Robert C. Bonner; former Reagan Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division and former Associate Attorney General and current Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen S. Trott; and California Court of Appeals Associate Justice H. Walter Croskey.  I deeply regret that confirmation as a Federal Judge is becoming more like a political campaign for these nominees. They are being required to gather letters of support and urge their friends, colleagues and clients to support their candidacy or risk being mischaracterized by those who do not know them.  Margaret Morrow's background, training, temperament, character and skills are beyond reproach. She is a partner in the law firm of Arnold & Porter. She has practiced law for 24 years. A distinguished graduate of Bryn Mawr College and Harvard Law School, Ms. Morrow was the first woman President of the California State Bar Association and a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She has had the strong and unwavering support of Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein of California.  In light of her qualifications, it was no surprise that in 1996 she was unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1997 her nomination was again reported favorably, this time by a vote of 13 to 5.  Yet hers has been an arduous journey to Senate consideration. She has been targeted--targeted by extremists outside the Senate whose $1.4 million fundraising and lobbying campaign against judges needed a victim. As our debate will show today, they chose the wrong woman.  Lest someone accuse us of gratuitously injecting gender into this debate, I note the following: Her critics have gone so far as to deny her the courtesy of referring to her as Ms. Morrow. Instead, they went out of their way repeatedly to refer to her as ``Miss'' in a Washington Times op ed. Margaret Morrow is married to a distinguished California State Court Judge and is the proud mother of a 10-year-old son. It is bad enough that her words are taken out of context, her views misrepresented and her nomination used as a ideological prop. She is entitled to be treated with respect.  Nor was this reference inadvertent. The first point of criticism in that piece was her membership in California Women Lawyers, which is criticized for supporting parental leave legislation.  Senator Feinstein posed the question whether Margaret Morrow was held to a different standard than men nominees. That is a question that has troubled me throughout this process. I was likewise concerned to see that of the 14 nominees left pending at the end of last year whose nominations had been pending the longest, 12 were women and minority nominees. I did not know, until Senator Kennedy's statement to the Senate earlier this year, that judicial nominees who are women are now four times as likely as men to take over a year to confirm.  At the same time, I note that Senator Hatch, who supports this nomination, included two women whose nominations have been pending for more than a year and one-half, at last week's Judiciary Committee hearing. I also note that the Senate did vote last month to confirm Judge Ann Aiken to the Oregon District Court. So one of the four article III judges confirmed so far this year was a woman nominee.  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good work in this regard should not be punished but commended.  As part of those efforts Margaret Morrow gave a speech at a Women in the Law Conference in April 1994. That speech was later reprinted in a law review. Critics have seized upon a phrase or two from that speech, ripped them out of context and contended that they show Margaret Morrow would be an unprincipled judicial activist. They are wrong. Their argument was refuted by Ms. Morrow in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  This criticism merely demonstrates the critics own indifference to the setting and context of the speech and its meaning for women who have worked so hard to achieve success in the legal profession. Her speech was about how the bar is begrudgingly adjusting to women in the legal profession. How telling that critics would fasten on that particular speech on women in the law and see it as something to criticize.  Margaret Morrow spoke then about ``the struggles and successes'' of women practices law and ``the challenges which continue to face us day to day in the 1990s.'' Margaret Morrow has met every challenge. In the course of this confirmation, she has been forced to run a gauntlet. She has endured false charges and unfounded criticism. Her demeanor and dignity have never wavered. She has, again, been called upon to be a role model.  The President of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the President of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the President of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They wrote that: ``Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties.'' She ``is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.'' I could not agree more.  By letter dated February 4, 1998, a number of organizations including the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and women's lawyer associations from California likewise wrote urging confirmation of Margaret Morrow without further delay. I ask that a copy of that letter be included in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 4, 1998.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to express our concern over a      series of developments that continue to unfold in the Senate      that are undermining the judicial confirmation process. These      include calls for the impeachment of judges, a slowdown in      the pace of confirmations, unjustified criticisms of certain      nominees, and efforts to leave appellate vacancies unfilled.      Some court observers have opined that collectively these are      the most serious efforts to curtail judicial independence      since President Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court in      1937.       In the past year nominees who failed to meet certain      ultraconservative litmus tests have been labeled ``judicial      activists.'' While these charges are unfounded, they      nonetheless delay confirmations and leave judicial seats      unfilled. We note that of the 14 individuals whose      nominations have been pending the longest, 12 are women or      minorities. This disturbing pattern is in striking contrast      to those 14 judges who were confirmed in 1997 in the shortest      period of time, 11 of whom are white men. For example,      Margaret Morrow, a judicial nominee to the United States      District Court for the Central District of California, was      nominated more than a year and a half ago. Not only is she an      outstanding candidate, but her credentials have earned her      enthusiastic and bipartisan endorsements from leaders of the      bar, judges, politicians, and civic groups.       An honors graduate from Harvard Law School, a civil      litigator for more than 20 years, winner of numerous legal      awards, and the first female president of the California Bar      Association, Morrow has the breadth of background and      experience to make her an excellent judge, and in the words      of one of her sponsors, she would be ``an exceptionally      distinguished addition to the federal bench.'' Morrow has      also shown, through her numerous pro bono activities, a      demonstrated commitment to equal justice. As president of the      Los Angeles County Bar Association, she created the Pro Bono      Council, the first of its kind in California. During her year      as bar president, the Council coordinated the provision of      150,000 hours of previously untapped representation to      indigent clients throughout the county. Not surprisingly, the      American Bar Association's judicial evaluation committee gave      her its highest rating.       Republicans and Democrats alike speak highly of her      accomplishments and qualifications. Robert Bonner, a Reagan-     appointed U.S. Attorney and U.S. District Judge for the      Central District of California and head of the Drug      Enforcement Administration during the Bush Administration,      has said Morrow is a ``brilliant person with a first-rate      legal mind who was nominated upon merit, not political      affiliation.'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block wrote      that, ``Margaret Morrow is an extremely hard working      individual of impeccable character and integrity. . . . I      have no doubt that she would     be a distinguished addition to the Court.'' Other supporters      include local bar leaders; officials from both parties,      including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan; California      judges appointed by the state's last three governors; and      three Republican-appointed Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals      judges, Pamela Rymer, Cynthia Holcomb Hall, and Stephen      Trott.       Despite here outstanding record, Morrow has become the      target of a coordinated effort by ultraconservative groups      that seek to politicize the judiciary. They have subjected      her to a campaign of misrepresentations, distortions and      attacks on her record, branding her a ``judicial activist.''      According to her opponents, she deserves to be targeted      because ``she is a member of California Women Lawyers,'' an      absurd charge given that this bipartisan organization is      among the most highly respected in the state. Another      ``strike'' against her is her concern, expressed in a      sentence from a 1988 article, about special interest      domination of the ballot initiative process in California.      Her opponents view the statement as disdainful of voter      initiatives such as California's term limits law; however,      they overlook the fact that the article outlines a series of      recommended reforms to preserve the process. It is a stretch      to construe suggested reforms as evidence of ``judicial      activism,'' but to search for this members of the Judiciary      Committee unprecedentedly asked her to disclose her personal      positions on all 160 past ballot propositions in California.       Morrow's confirmation has been delayed by the Senate beyond      any reasonable bounds. Originally selected over nineteen      months ago in May 1996, her nomination was unanimously      approved by the Judiciary Committee that year, only to      languish on the Senate floor. Morrow was again nominated at      the beginning of 1997, subjected to an unusual second      hearing, and recommended again by the Judiciary Committee,      after which several Senators placed secret holds on her      nomination, preventing a final vote on her confirmation.      These holds, which prevented a final vote on her confirmation      during the 1st Session of the 105th Congress, where recently      lifted.       As Senator Orrin Hatch repeatedly said: ``playing politics      with judges is unfair, and I'm sick of it.'' We agree with      his sentiment. Given Margaret Morrow's impressive      qualifications, we urge you to bring the nomination to the      Senate floor, ensure that it receives prompt, full and fair      consideration, and that a final vote on her nomination is      scheduled as soon as possible.
