President, I want to bring up an issue that Senators Gregg, Snowe, and Smith and I have been working on during the consideration of the VA/HUD Appropriations bill. The report accompanying H.R. 2099 includes language regarding the waste disposal treatment of mercury-containing flourescent light bulbs. I think it is important to clarify some of the issues raised in the report and provide additional context for the rule.  The Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] has been considering a rule which would either conditionally exempt mercury containing lightbulbs from existing hazardous waste requirements or allow lamps to be treated under the universal waste rule. The report language does not reference the two options available. Is it the Chairman's understanding that the EPA does indeed face this choice in finalizing a rule?
