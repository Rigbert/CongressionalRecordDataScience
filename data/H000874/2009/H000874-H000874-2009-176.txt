 H.R. 3200 was a base bill that was put together by the committee Chairs, the committee staff, with input from others, as a mark. My expectation is that there will be a compendium that will be put together and we will probably have a new number on it. So I don't think H.R. 3200, which was a base mark, but you understand this was a bill, and, as you well know, in three committees, so there may well be a bill fashioned from the product of the three committees.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, so it would be a different number, but in essence the same bill.  Would the gentleman allow, before that bill is voted on on this floor when you come to the conclusion of where that bill ends up, would we be able to have the time to go back to the American public and, again, all of us have townhall meetings again for the transparency of saying this is the bill that would be voted on in the House?  I yield to the gentleman.
