 Mr. Chairman, this is not the same amendment that we voted on during the authorization. This deals both with small boat closures, small boat lifesaving closures, and the consolidation issues. It is paid for. It is budget neutral, which the Traficant amendment during the consideration of the authorization was not.  This whole attempt on the part of the Coast Guard to jam through these closures is going to cost lives around the country. It is not well thought out. They told us they took into account the cold water conditions of the Pacific Northwest. All those things were in the parameters.  No, they were not. When I asked for the data, in fact there were strangely some stations that met the parameters for closure but somehow fell off the final list. But mine were still on, as were others around the country. It is some politics going on here, folks. Politics are going to cost lives.  They said, ``Well, don't worry. Whenever we downsize or close something, we'll put people at adjacent stations.'' I have a 200-mile section of coast where every Coast Guard station is being reduced or closed. Oregonians are going to drown.  It happened in 1988 when the Bush administration closed those small boat stations. We had three deaths within a month. People are going to drown. You cannot tread water for 40 minutes in the North Pacific and live to wait for the rescue helicopter. We will pick up corpses with the rescue helicopters, not living citizens.  Vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Save lives and cut bureaucracy.
