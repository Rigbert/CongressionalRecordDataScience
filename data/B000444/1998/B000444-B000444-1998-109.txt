 Years ago I drafted a law which became law that requires certain background checks, for example, for people who wish to work in day-care centers with young children, to try to figure out and ferret out child predators.  Now, the way it works now is if, in fact, you are going to be hired at a boys' club, a girls' club or a day care center, and they--the day care center--say they want a background check, and you have to go through the FBI, the FBI now charges the person seeking employment the cost to run the background check.  I don't understand why, if we are going to say on a background check for an employee--where the employee is seeking a job but is required by that agency to have a background check to prove, in effect, they are not a child predator or do not have any sex crime history--why it is appropriate to charge the prospective employee and it is not appropriate to charge a person purchasing a gun. There is nothing exceptional about this.  My question to my friend is, Isn't this all about reneging on a commitment everyone said they are for, which was to have an instant background check, so there is no 7-day, 5-day or 1-day waiting period, so every single gun seller in America, when they go to sell you a gun, can push a button, tap into a computer, and have the computer say you can or cannot sell it? It seems to me this is about doing away with the instant check.
