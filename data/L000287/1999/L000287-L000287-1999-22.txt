Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are trying to ram through an $800 billion tax bill. The Republican tax bill does nothing to save Social Security, nothing to preserve or protect Medicare and nothing to reduce our national debt. The Republican tax bill provides huge tax breaks for America's wealthiest people while providing pocket change for American working families. Tens of thousands for the rich, pennies for working men and women. This is the Republican way. That is not fair, that is not right, that is not just.  Mr. Speaker, we have a chance to finally put our economic house in order, to pay down our national collected credit card. Just when we are in a position to do what is right, the Republican want to go on a shopping spree. The American people and this Congress should do what is right. We should reject the Republican tax bill.                          ____________________
