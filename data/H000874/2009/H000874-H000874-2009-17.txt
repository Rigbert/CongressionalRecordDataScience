We exercise what our Founding Fathers set up as a free democracy, where the people can speak through freely elected Representatives. And very frankly, we are that because we have brave men and women who are willing to serve us in the Armed Forces of the United States.  From time to time, they have an opportunity to visit with us. It is not, under the rules, appropriate to directly address people who are in our gallery, but it is always in order to pay honor to those who serve us and serve us so well.
