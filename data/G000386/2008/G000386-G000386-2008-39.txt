 In my 7 years as chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, I have worked to preserve the committee's jurisdiction over legislation amending the Social Security Act, as Senator Baucus is doing now. In this case, the CMS certification requirement for rural health clinic designations is governed by title XVIII of the Social Security Act, which, as the Chairman has noted, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required that rural health clinics be located in an underserved or shortage area that were designated or updated within the previous 3 years but the 3-year requirement has only been applied to new facilities seeking to be designated as rural health clinics. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently issued a rule proposing changes in the requirements for rural health clinics. One of the proposed changes would apply the 3-year designation requirement to all rural health clinics and decertify RHCs located in communities where the shortage area designation is more than 3 years old.  The Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, and most States update their shortage area designations every 4 years. We need to align the timeframes for HRSA and CMS shortage area designations so that CMS certifications of rural health clinic designations would be valid for a 4-year period, consistent with the 4-year period used for HRSA designations. Otherwise, many rural health clinics in Iowa and other States throughout the country could lose their RHC designation simply because their State is not able to comply with the new CMS 3-year timeframe for certification.  Under the CMS proposal, if an RHC loses its designation or the State has not renewed its shortage area designation within 3 years, the RHC must request an exception within 90 days or it will be decertified 180 days after the 3-year period ends. Unless the statutory 3-year CMS certification period is changed to 4 years, many RHCs could be subject to being decertified in the near future unless they are deemed ``essential.'' Rural health clinics should not be jeopardized with closure because a shortage area designation has not been updated in a timely fashion by the State or Federal Government.  CMS has estimated that approximately 500 of the 3,700 rural health clinics operating today no longer meet the existing location requirements for RHCs, either because they are not in an area designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as ``nonurban'' or they are not designated by HRSA as being located in an eligible shortage area. Others believe that this estimate is too low. The National Rural Health Association has estimated that the proposed changes to the location requirements could result in up to 45 percent of RHCs being ineligible to continue in the program unless they are granted an exception. If this estimate holds true for RHCs throughout the country, over 1,600 RHCs could be decertified. This would severely impact access to health care for those in rural and medically underserved areas where rural health clinics provide the only access to critical medical services.  We are most appreciative of the efforts of our colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, to amend H.R. 3343 to change the CMS certification period for shortage area designations from 3 to 4 years in order to align the CMS certification period for shortage area designations with HRSA's designation review period.                          ____________________
