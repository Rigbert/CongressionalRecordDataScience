Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Murrieta are exceptional. The City of Murrieta has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Raj Narayanan is one of these individuals. On July 20, 2013, Raj will be honored as the ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Murrieta Chamber of Commerce Annual Awards Celebration.  Raj is the epitome of the values that the Murrieta Chamber of Commerce holds true, with a focus on strengthening the local economy, providing networking opportunities, promoting the community, representing business and government, and political advocacy. Currently, Raj serves as a Board Member of the Chamber, where he will soon serve on the Ambassador and Membership Committees. He is a highly motivated community builder and hardworking professional with proven organizational abilities. During his time at the Chamber, Raj has proven to be an effective leader.  Raj's involvement and vision have grown during his time serving on the Murrieta Chamber Board. Raj has always been quick to accept a challenge, especially if it means betterment for the community. He is co-chair for both the Chamber Golf Tournament and Chamber Installation Dinner. While serving as co-chair for the Chamber Golf Tournament, Raj effectively rebranded the tournament as the ``Brew Masters Tournament'' and successfully raised more money than in previous years. His success does not stop there. As co-chair of the Installation Dinner, Raj has tirelessly worked to rebrand the event as the ``Awards Celebration'' hosted at the Pechanga Resort and Casino with the hope of growing it annually. Raj has always been eager to help new Chamber members and is an active volunteer in Chamber events, including the Murrieta Chamber Reverse Drawings and the Special Olympic Games Bocce Ball Tournament.  In addition to the Murrieta Chamber of Commerce, Raj is a member of many other community organizations whose programs help fundraise for businesses and organizations in the area. These organizations include the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Valley Young Professionals. He was recently appointed to the Advisory Council of the Assistance League of Temecula Valley. He has helped events come to life through multiple planning stages, including the Boys and Girls Club Annual ``Field of Dreams'' Dinner, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Walk which raised over $90,000, and the Reality Rally. Raj has also been a participant in the Murrieta Veteran's Day Parade, Field of Honor, Boys and Girls Club ``Our Kids Rock'' fundraiser, and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Walk/Run. He is also an active participant in the Temecula Noon Rotary Club where he serves as a member of the International Committee and is the Membership Co-Chair. For the Past three years, Raj has been committed to his title as ``Food Chair'' for the annual Rotary Taste of the World Fundraiser, which helped generate over $40,000 in 2013.  In light of all Raj has done for Murrieta, the Murrieta Chamber of Commerce named Raj their Citizen of the Year. His tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Murrieta and the surrounding area. He has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member and American. I know that many are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
