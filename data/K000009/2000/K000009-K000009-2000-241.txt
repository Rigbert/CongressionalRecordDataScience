Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of Block Communications, Inc. The Block family and its extended mass communications family celebrates this significant milestone on November 2, 2000.  Born in Lithuania, moving to Germany for a time until his family immigrated to the United States, Paul Bloch began working in the newspaper business at age eleven when the Elmira Telegram in Elmira, New York hired him. Through age twenty, Paul Bloch--who by now had Americanized the family name to Block--worked in every department of the Elmira Telegram learning the trade and becoming especially adept at sales. Then, in 1895 and with the encouragement of his employer, Paul Block made the move to New York City where he found employment selling advertising for newspapers across the country as a national representative for the A. Frank Richardson Company.  In 1900, Paul Block decided to venture out on his own, and by 1910 Paul Block and Associates was among the major national newspaper advertising representative firms. Further branching out, Paul Block organized a group of investors in order to purchase the Newark Star Eagle in 1916. Purchases of several other newspapers soon followed, and in ten years Paul Block owned the Detroit Journal, The Toledo Blade, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Paul Block struggled to keep his business alive through the decade of the Depression, and the company was again thriving upon his death in 1941.  The company continued in the Block family and eventually became known as Blade Communications Inc. Through the latter half of the century the company diversified to include cable and broadcast television, telecommunications, and Internet opportunities. Blade Communications Inc. holds fourteen communication companies today. To mark the company's centennial, the company's name was changed once more to Block Communications Inc.  The Block family remains a strong fixture in Toledo, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it still owns The Blade and the Post-Gazette. The Block imprimatur is evident in many of these cities' major projects and institutions, and the family remains an integral component of both communities. I join with many others as we salute one hundred years of Block family tradition in communications and community, and look forward to the next one hundred years.                          ____________________
