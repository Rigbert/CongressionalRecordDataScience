When it came to raising the minimum wage periodically, Senator Ted Kennedy, who used to sit back at that desk, led the effort. It would turn out to be a bipartisan vote to increase the minimum wage.  Over the years, that reflected a bipartisan consensus that if one is working for a living in America, they ought to be able to get by or at least have a little bit put away for their future.  We are finding more and more that people working for a minimum wage cannot get by. I listened to public radio over the break.
