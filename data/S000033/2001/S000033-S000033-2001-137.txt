 Speaker, let me conclude by saying that the proponents of this bill will tell us that they have dealt with this issue. They have not dealt with this issue. Disclosure is fine, but disclosure will not help millions of workers who have already seen their pensions cut and many more who will see their pensions cut. Please vote ``yes'' on recommit.
