President, I am going to make a brief opening statement because I know the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, would like to take the floor and has to go to a committee meeting. I am going to stay here to manage this bill while Senators Dodd and Shelby are off to a Banking Committee hearing with the head of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke.
