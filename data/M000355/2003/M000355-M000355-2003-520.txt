 President, I know the majority leader is about to take us out of session, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank him for his truly inspirational remarks about the events of today which I had an opportunity to hear over the last few moments and also to thank him for his extraordinary leadership of the Senate.  You make us proud every day; particularly you make us proud today.                          ____________________
