Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, and I support it.  The opioid epidemic has victimized countless Americans, including the most vulnerable among us--our children. We are all aware of the grim statistics surrounding prescription opioid abuse by teenagers. However, a young child who loses a parent to addiction is also a victim that needs our help.  I support this effort, which will promote family unity while holding certain offenders accountable and ensuring community safety.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
