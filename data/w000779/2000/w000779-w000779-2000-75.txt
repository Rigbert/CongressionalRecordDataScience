President, I ask that the following letter be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2000.     Senator Tom Daschle     Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: Two weeks ago, my private relief bill for      Marina Khalina, S. 150, was scheduled to come to the floor,      but other members objected to this bill coming to the floor      before their private relief bills came to the floor.       I agreed to let my bill be sent back to the Judiciary      Committee so that it and the other private relief bills could      be cleared for the floor together on June 15, 2000.       Now, I have been informed that the Immigration and      Naturalization Service (INS) somehow misplaced Ms. Khalina's      fingerprints and that her relief bill cannot be passed by the      full Senate until a new fingerprint record for Ms. Khalina      can be processed by the INS. Senate action on her bill should      not be delayed because of INS incompetence in losing her      fingerprints.       Since I am concerned that Ms. Khalina will miss her      opportunity for justice should these bills go forward without      S. 150, I am notifying you that I would object to a unanimous      consent request to move any private relief bills unless S.      150 is included with the package.       I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be included in the      record pursuant to the leaders request that such objections      be made public.           Sincerely,     Ron Wyden.                          ____________________
