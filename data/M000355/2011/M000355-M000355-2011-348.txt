 President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary accomplishments of two of the most dedicated and hard-working citizens of the Commonwealth, David and Irene Morris of Hager Hill, KY. Working as a team of husband and wife, David and Irene have worked tirelessly over the years to strengthen and improve the manufacturing industry in Johnson County and throughout the State through their work at the Atlantic India Rubber Company.  Although Irene and David's native roots are in Michigan, the couple moved to Kentucky when the Atlantic India Rubber Company, a 92-year-old company, moved its operations here from Illinois and Ohio in 2003. David and Irene were hired to oversee the day-to-day operations of the facility. Their son and one other employee joined them on their move, and the rest of their employees were hired locally.  David and Irene's decision to take on their responsibilities as manager and executive came at a time when the State's manufacturing job rate was on a steady decline. In recent years, Kentucky has lost too many of its manufacturing jobs, with some especially hard-hit counties losing as many as one-third of their manufacturing employers. But thanks to David and Irene, this was not to be in Johnson County. The couple lived in their warehouse while trying to establish the business, and had to have machines shipped from other locations since the local business community was geared more towards the coal industry than manufacturing, but they succeeded. As only one of nine manufacturing employers in the county, they have raised the local area's manufacturing employment rate, and have helped keep jobs from drifting overseas.  Last spring, after the couple had poured nearly 10 years of their lives into building the company, then-owner Jim Green announced that he would be retiring. With none of the interested buyers having ties to Johnson County, David and Irene knew what they had to do. Later that fall the couple announced they were the new owners of the Atlantic India Rubber Company.  Because of their purchase, the rubber parts used on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Arctic Cat snowmobiles, and Boeing jets would still be made in the heart of the Commonwealth, and eight hardworking people would still have their jobs. With combined help from the Southeast Kentucky Economic Development Corporation and the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, David and Irene secured a $1.3-million loan to buy the company and the location.  Irene once said that at first she was hesitant to take on her responsibilities at Atlantic India Rubber Company for fear of failure. Well, as she discovered, along with her employees and the residents of Johnson County, failure was simply not in the cards for the Morrises. It is people like them, who have extraordinary aspirations and faith in themselves and in Kentucky, that continue to make the Commonwealth a thriving and positive place to work and live.  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article highlighting the impressive careers of David and Irene, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was printed as follows:                   [From Kentucky.com, Jan. 29, 2011]    Johnson County Couple Buys Out Employer, Keeps Jobs in Kentucky                          (By Dori Hjalmarson)                   ky. manufacturing employment woes                Percent Change in Employment, 2005-2009       United States--16.8       Kentucky--18.6       Johnson Co.--11.6       --Kentucky Office of Employment and Training       Hager Hill.--Irene and David Morris could have packed up      and taken jobs elsewhere, maybe back home in Ohio or      Michigan, when the owner of the manufacturing company retired      and sold out. If that had happened, Atlantic India Rubber Co.      grommets and parts might be made in China now.       But the Morrises--working as manager and executive--decided      they'd poured nearly 10 years of their life into building the      factory in Johnson County.       They cared about their employees, all hired locally when      the 92-year-old company moved from Illinois and Ohio in 2003.      They cared that the rubber parts used on Harley Davidson      motorcycles and Arctic Cat snowmobiles and Boeing jets are      made in the U.S.A. They wanted to save their jobs. And      ultimately, Irene Morris said, the company survived ``one of      the toughest years ever'' for manufacturers, so ``we knew the      business was sound.''       So the couple, whose children are grown and whose only debt      was a mortgage and a car loan, borrowed nearly $1.3 million      to buy out their employer last summer.       ``When we came on board here, we ran it like it was ours.      We put a lot of ourselves into it,'' Irene Morris said.       ``I think we're proud of what we do here.''                     Kentucky's manufacturing slide       Many manufacturers haven't fared so well. Since 2005,      Kentucky has lost more than 18 percent of its manufacturing      jobs. Some counties have lost as many as a third of their      manufacturing employers and more than 60 percent of      manufacturing jobs, according to the Kentucky Office of      Employment and Training. The Morrises' purchase of Atlantic      India Rubber helped Johnson County buck that trend.       The company is one of nine manufacturing employers in the      county. Atlantic India's eight employees count for less than      10 percent of the 135-strong manufacturing labor force in the      county.       But since 2005, Johnson County's manufacturing employment      has grown by nearly 12 percent.       The rubber company has an old brand name, but before it      moved to Johnson County, it was really just a distributor.      Contractors made all the parts, Irene Morris said.       ``We were a start-up in the sense that for probably 30 or      maybe more years, it was maybe just a distribution center,''      she said. ``Distribution isn't all that much cost to set up;      manufacturing is because you've got all your presses.       ``Coming into this area, that was probably one of the      biggest challenges we've had. No one in this area had      experience.''       They brought two employees from Michigan, including their      son, who now manages a restaurant in Paintsville. But they      hired the rest of their employees locally.       The Morrises worked to improve the quality of their      products and relationships with customers. Atlantic India's      owner, Jim Green, was a former Johnson Countian who knew the      area but lived in Florida. He trusted Irene and David Morris      to run the business as though it were their own.       Irene Morris said her husband, who had served in Germany      and Spain in the Army, was the one who talked her into      pulling up her Michigan roots to move to Johnson County in      the first place.       ``I didn't have a lot of faith in my ability,'' Irene      Morris said.       She had gone to college to be a social worker but got a job      as a trimmer at another rubber company. She has learned the      business from the ground up over 20 years. She and David met      working for the same rubber company, before they were hired      by Atlantic India.       There were advantages to working in Johnson County: Their      boss knew the area and wanted to move; costs were lower than      those in factory-saturated Ohio and Michigan; the small-town      atmosphere and cost of living appealed to the couple.       But there were problems, too. The local business community      isn't geared toward manufacturing.       ``In Michigan,'' David Morris said, parts makers used to be      so plentiful ``you could just go around the corner and find      what you need.''       Now, the Morrises need a tool-and-die maker, for example,      but the market is so geared toward the coal industry, they      aren't sure where to start looking locally. Also, they are      pleased that one of their Oregon contractors might be opening      up facilities in Ohio, cutting travel and distribution costs.       When they first moved to Hager Hill, Irene and David Morris      lived in their warehouse while trying to establish the      business. They had to have machines shipped in and find      workers they could train to run them.       They still feel like outsiders in Johnson County, but local      leaders have welcomed them, Irene Morris said. She has a      relationship with the local chamber of commerce, the judge-     executive, state representatives. She said she personally      knows the local UPS and FedEx workers, as well as bankers and      suppliers.       ``They made us feel like a big deal, even though we were      small,'' Irene Morris said.                           Hands-on managers       The Morrises were managers, but they knew every job in the      business and were hands-on. They filled in for their workers,      and they trained a press operator to fill in for them. They      bought a house and two cars, and their son eventually moved      on to other jobs.       ``We're just ordinary people,'' Irene Morris said. She      didn't have aspirations to ``get rich'' or even to own her      own business until a couple of years ago, when her boss      decided to retire and sell.       There were interested buyers, but none with ties to Johnson      County. The economy was starting to slide, manufacturing jobs      nationwide were disappearing, and the Atlantic India brand      might have been valuable enough to those outside buyers      without keeping the manufacturing in Kentucky.       A few years earlier, a major Johnson County manufacturer,      American Standard plumbing parts, had sent hundreds of jobs      to Mexico. The Morrises feared Atlantic India would have had      a similar fate.       The couple made contacts with local government and non-     profit groups, as well as the state Cabinet for Economic      Development.       The Morrises are part of a trend, said Economic Development      Commissioner Erik Dunnigan.       In 2010, 84 percent of job growth and investment growth      came from existing local companies, as opposed to companies      new to Kentucky: ``That's redirecting our efforts,'' Dunnigan      said.       In September 2009, Atlantic India started talking with      Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, a      Berea non-profit. MACED and Southeast Kentucky Economic      Development, a London non-profit, began the year-long process      to help Atlantic India secure nearly $1.3 million in      financing to buy the company and the building they were      leasing.       Irene Morris had to write an application for the loan, a      three-year forecast, growth projections and a business plan.       She said she knew the manufacturing side of her work, but      she had to learn quickly about the financial side.       Half of the loan came from a federal Small Business      Administration program handled by SKED: the other half came      from MACED. If the couple defaults, the organizations would      seize the business and property.       The feeling, when they signed their names to the loan, was      both empowerment and trepidation.       ``We've never been that far ever in debt,'' David Morris      said.       But he believed in his wife. Irene Morris is officially the      51 percent owner, which gives the company a leg up in some      contracts because it can call itself a ``woman-owned''      business.       The fact that the Morrises know the business so well made      them good candidates for a loan, said Justin Maxson,      president of MACED.       Irene Morris said she might have given up trying to get the      loan if not for such encouragement from MACED and Southeast      Kentucky Economic Development.       When she's ready to retire in 20 years, Morris said, ``I      would like to see a couple of our employees be able to buy      the business.''                          ____________________
