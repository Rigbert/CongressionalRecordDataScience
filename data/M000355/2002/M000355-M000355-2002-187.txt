 President, we have ended up with a little more time on this debate than we earlier thought. As the principal opponent of the bill, I want to lock in a time for my final statement on the bill. Should cloture be invoked and we are in the 3-hour postcloture period, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to give my final statement at 2 p.m.
