 Mr. DeFAZIO. I think this was a question I asked very early on when I was contacted, when I filed my legislation to withdraw from NAFTA. They brought up all of these concerns about how it would further destabilize the economic situation. They said we are only cosigning, and I said, well, I understood if someone had impeccable credit they would not need a cosigner. Usually you get a cosignor because no one else wants to extend you credit, and they think maybe you would not be good for it. If Mexico's credit is so great, I suggest they go to the same Wall Street financiers who have made 20- to 50-percent interest, nice rate of return, and perhaps say, ``Look, you have been making a lot of money down in Mexico, how about extending some loans on favorable terms, maybe only 15-20 percent interest per year as opposed to what we have been paying you, still better than you can get generally in the United States stock market, S&P index, United States Treasury, better than you can get anywhere else.''  I would assume the Wall Street financiers, thinking there is no problem, if they want the Government to cosign, why do they not just do it directly. Why do not they do it themselves? They are telling us we will make money on this. The taxpayers might make money on it. Might lose $40 billion on it, but, this is a river boat gamble. We are river boat gamblers with $40 billion of assets of the United States of America that belong to the people of this country. I do not think so. That is not our role here. Let the people on Wall Street be the river boat gamblers, not the people on Main Street.
