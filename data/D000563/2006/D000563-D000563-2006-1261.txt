President, this morning the President of the United States held a press conference and announced the following: Prices at the pumps reflect our addiction to oil.  So it turns out it is our fault. It turns out it is the fault of the consumers. It is the fault of families and businesses and farmers that the prices have gone so high. I don't think so. I think the prices at the pump reflect the oil companies' addiction to greed.  Let me give you a case to consider. Lee Raymond, CEO of Exxon, recently retired. Did he get a gold watch for his service to Exxon? No. Mr. Raymond was given a severance package of $400 million. And the prices at the pumps reflect the consumers' shortcoming?  ExxonMobil recorded the highest corporate profits in the history of the United States of America. Money went straight from the credit cards of American families into the board rooms of ExxonMobil.
