 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an American political icon, patriot, war hero, and lifelong South Carolinian, Senator Strom Thurmond. While many will recall Senator Thurmond's half-century career on the political stage, I shall fondly remember the many kindnesses he extended to my family and me. He was a warm-hearted, gentle man, and I will count it as one of my life's honors to have served with him in the U.S. Senate.  I join my colleagues in extending my heartfelt condolences to his family who have lost a beloved husband, father, and grandfather. Strom was a legend in the Senate and touched many of us during his long career. In fact, I will always remember Senator Thurmond's 90th birthday party when he turned to the audience and said, ``If you all eat right, exercise, and don't drink whiskey, you'll be here for the 100th birthday party.'' Strom Thurmond was a remarkable American; I don't think we'll see another one like him for a long time, if ever.
