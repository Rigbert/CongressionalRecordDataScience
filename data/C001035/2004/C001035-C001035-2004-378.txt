We recognize that the current Director of the CIA cannot issue tasking, cannot require the collection of information, under this section of the law. That is why we took language recommended by Senator Roberts, included it in the bill that I believe the Senator from Ohio may have cosponsored, which strengthened that authority by adding the language, ``issue and manage collection and analysis tasking.'' That is not in current law.  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. I will have to go back and study this a little bit more.  I say to my colleague from Maine, I am happy with her answer when she responded to my question, can this be ordered, and her response, I believe, was yes. In other words, under her bill the NID could order the satellite to be moved. Because I think there is a problem.  The evidence is that in the past there have been some problems--I am not saying it is a problem that occurs all the time; it probably gets worked out most of the time--but there have been some problems and I think this needs to be a situation where there has been a problem or there might be a problem, be ordered, it has to be. So I certainly appreciate the response.  Let me ask another question, if I could. Moving to the area of signal intelligence, NSA, let us say the NID, under the Senator's bill, decided it was in our national interest to move the assets, move the resources, from listening to country X to terrorist Y organization. It is the same type of issue but again a real world issue. We are moving our assets; we have to make this decision very quickly in the real world. Could that person order that to be done?
