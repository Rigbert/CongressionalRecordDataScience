 Even if the process we talked about is not followed, once a hold comes to light in the form of an objection, someone will be required to own up to that hold. It will no longer be possible for a leader or their designee to object but claim it is not their objection. They can say on whose behalf they are objecting and why not.  We also require Senators placing a hold to give their permission to object in their name. Still, if a Senator objects and does not name another Senator as having the objection, and another Senator does not promptly comeforward claiming the objection, the Senator making the objection will be listed in the relative section of the Senate calendar as having placed that hold.  I yield, for a final conclusion, to the Senator from Oregon.
