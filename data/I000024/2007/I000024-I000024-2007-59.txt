President, today I introduce the NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007 with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. This bill provides a scholarship program for promising students who seek to pursue an education in a relevant field of study and commit to work for a branch of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, including the National Weather Service, upon graduation.  Few can contend with the fact that there is a shortage of American students devoting themselves to the study of science, math and engineering. However, the demand for trained individuals in these professions is rising. In order to achieve their missions, Federal organizations like NOAA require a cadre of young talent to enter the workforce with training in fields like meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography.  In my great State of Oklahoma, we know the importance of NOAA, and particularly the study of meteorology. Two weeks ago, I met with a group of Fire Marshalls who informed me that there are more declared natural disasters per capita in Oklahoma than inany other State in the Union. In May of each year, we experience an average of twenty tornadoes. In fact, the fastest wind speed ever recorded was in one of the May tornadoes to hit Oklahoma in 1999. As Oklahomans, we know that having accurate and timely reporting of atmospheric changes can mean the difference between life and death.  It is no surprise, then, that the University of Oklahoma, OU, has developed an exceptional program for the study of meteorology. The OU School of Meteorology is the largest meteorology program in the nation, with over 320 undergraduate students and 80 graduate students. It ranks first in the Nation in severe storms and mesoscale research and is among the top seven meteorology programs in the country. OU President David Boren, my predecessor in the Senate, targets the OU School of Meteorology to become the leading radar meteorology program in the world.  The OU School of Meteorology is fortunate to have a state of the art facility in the recently constructed National Weather Center. In this 244,000 square foot structure, federal, state, and OU organizations partner together to better understand weather events occurring in the atmosphere. The research that occurs in this center is truly groundbreaking. The scientists who work at NWC, many of them working with NOAA, have expertise in severe weather, local and regional climate, numerical modeling, hydrology, and radar meteorology. Their work is both abstract and tangible, using theory and advanced scientific research to improve the lives of individuals in Oklahoma and around the world.  The National Weather Center is the home of many notable achievements. NWC scientists were able to demonstrate that the Doppler weather radar can be useful in detecting tornadoes, hail, and other severe weather events. Using the Doppler radar, they have developed numerical forecasting models for government and industry applications. The scientists at NWC are also known for taking risks to discover new and improved ways of collecting data and making observations; for example, they can be credited with showing the effectiveness of rapidly deployable, truck-mounted radars that they drive into the middle of fierce storms.  It is with the first-hand knowledge of the important work of the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's research in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs that I introduce this bill. The NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007 will establish a scholarship program for promising students who desire to pursue an education in a relevant field of study and then serve as full-time employees of NOAA at the completion of their degrees. The students will be required to work for NOAA for 24 months in return for each academic year that a scholarship is given. This program will provide an opportunity and an incentive for students to develop scientific expertise that will continue to enable NOAA, at facilities like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma and elsewhere, to attain its mission.  On September 17, 2007, the House of Representatives passed identical legislation, H.R. 1657, by a vote of 360-16. I request that the Senate move quickly on this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2164       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``NOAA Scholarship Act of      2007''.     SEC. 2. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.       (a) Establishment of Program.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator is authorized to      establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to      award scholarships to individuals to recruit and prepare      students for careers in the National Weather Service and in      Administration marine research, atmospheric research, and      satellite programs.       (2) Competitive process.--Individuals shall be selected to      receive scholarships under the scholarship program through a      competitive process primarily on the basis of academic merit,      with consideration given to financial need and the goal of      promoting the participation of individuals described in      section 33 or 34 of the Science and Engineering Equal      Opportunities Act (42 U.S.C. 1885a or 1885b) in the      scholarship program.       (3) Service agreements.--To carry out the scholarship      program, the Administrator shall enter into contractual      agreements with individuals selected under paragraph (2)      under which the individuals agree to serve as full-time      employees of the Administration, for the period described in      subsection (f)(1), in positions needed by the Administration      in fields described in paragraph (1) and for which the      individuals are qualified, in exchange for receiving a      scholarship.

(c) Application Required.--An individual seeking a      scholarship under the scholarship program shall submit an      application to the Administrator at such time, in such      manner, and containing such information, agreements, or      assurances as the Administrator may require to carry out this      section.       (d) Eligible Academic Programs.--The Administrator shall      make publicly available a list of academic programs and      fields of study for which scholarships may be utilized in      fields described in subsection (a)(1), and shall update the      list as necessary.       (e) Scholarship Requirement.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator may provide a      scholarship under the scholarship program for an academic      year if the individual applying for the scholarship has      submitted to the Administrator, as part of the application      required under subsection (c), a proposed academic program      leading to a degree in a program or field of study on the      list made available under subsection (d).       (2) Duration of eligibility.--An individual may not receive      a scholarship under the scholarship program for more than 4      academic years, unless the Administrator grants a waiver.       (3) Scholarship amount.--The dollar amount of a scholarship      under the scholarship program for an academic year shall be      determined under regulations issued by the Administrator, but      may not exceed the cost of attendance, as described in      paragraph (4).       (4) Authorized uses.--A scholarship provided under the      scholarship program may be expended for tuition, fees, and      other authorized expenses as established by the Administrator      by regulation.       (5) Contracts regarding direct payments to institutions.--     The Administrator may enter into a contractual agreement with      an institution of higher education under which the amounts      provided for a scholarship under this section for tuition,      fees, and other authorized expenses are paid directly to the      institution with respect to which the scholarship is      provided.       (f) Period of Obligated Service.--       (1) Duration of service.--Except as provided in subsection      (h)(2), the period of service for which an individual shall      be obligated to serve as an employee of the Administration      shall be 24 months for each academic year for which a      scholarship under the scholarship program is provided.       (2) Schedule for service.--       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),      obligated service under paragraph (1) shall begin not later      than 60 days after the individual obtains the educational      degree for which the scholarship was provided.
