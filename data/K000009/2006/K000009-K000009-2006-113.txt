Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I would like to join my dear colleague from Ohio (Mrs. Schmidt) in saying that aquaculture is a growing business in Ohio. We want to keep all of our communities competitive.  I would say to the gentleman from Arizona, Ohio is really a shrimp in this. Arizona has a $4.2 million aquaculture designation in this bill. So we are really a shrimp compared to Arizona with your subsidized water and your Bureau of Land Reclamation incentives for your folks out there.  But I can tell you, when I was born we had 146 million people in this country. Today we have 300 million. The oceans are half depleted in fish. And the Great Lakes are in great competition with Canada. We have to put caps on what our commercial fishermen can fish. And this project has resulted in a 30 percent increase in juvenile perch, one of the most desired fish in the region. So we need more fish. The oceans are not providing. We have to do our job here. Life is important. Being competitive in the international aquaculture environment is important. And the gentleman's own State, though it costs more to do it there because you have all those irrigation costs, we are trying to do it using fresh water. I think this is a wonderful investment by the American people in their own self-interest.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).  The amendment was rejected.                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Flake
