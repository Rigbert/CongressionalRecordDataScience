Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Yes, the bill as passed out of committee by a large margin included these Federal facilities. They would have been subjected to the same laws as all other businesses or Federal facilities in America.  The situation that would be created here, first off, vessels were never a consideration, vessels were not part of this bill. So to bring out the red herring of the nuclear submarines or nuclear-powered carriers is a red herring. They were never included.  This is shore-based fixed facilities in the United States of America which have the potential to harm American citizens. That is what we are trying to regulate here, and in fact the situation would be created if this amendment is not adopted, in Idaho we would have two different Federal agencies regulating two different standards at Idaho nuclear propulsion laboratories, because part of the property is nuclear Navy, which will be exempt from all Federal laws, and part of the property is DOE and will be subject to Federal laws. So the situation we are going to create is bizarre, and to say it is a burden or it is going to create a national security risk when we are dealing with two bases that have already been closed, two that are closed and one that is being decommissioned, that is an absurdity to say somehow by subjecting two closed bases, which perhaps, you know, pose a daily threat to nearby citizens from the Clean Water Act is a threat to our national security. The gentlewoman is on the committee of jurisdiction.
