Some of the Senators complaining the loudest voted against having a bipartisan debate on an energy bill.  I guess they think the Congressional Record is written in disappearing ink; that we don't have a permanent record here of their votes. We do. We know where they have been. We know how they have voted.  I wish to say something else for the Senator from Washington, and I am sure she will agree. They come and argue that the Democrats are against domestic exploration for oil. That is not true. I don't know of a single Democrat, I don't know of a single Senator who is against domestic exploration and production of oil. In fact, as the Senator from Washington knows, we have 68 million federally owned acres that we lease to the oil companies for exploration and production of oil and gas.
