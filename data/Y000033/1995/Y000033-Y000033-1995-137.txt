Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the staff members that have worked on this and not individually by name but each one of them knows how much has been put into it. This legislation will go, in fact, over to the Senate side, and we will go to conference. But the ultimate goal of everyone in this room is to make sure that our fishermen and our fish can coexist for future generations.  This is a good and well-balanced bill. it should and will become law. It is time that this Congress acts in a positive fashion.
