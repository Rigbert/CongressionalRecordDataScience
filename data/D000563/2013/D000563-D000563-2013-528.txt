President, what is happening with Internet sales? They are growing dramatically. Listen to these numbers. In 2012 online sales accounted for $225 billion in sales in America. In the next 5 years it will double to $435 billion. It is an endeavor that has become part of our lives. What we are asking in this bill is that those selling on the Internet be treated the same as those selling on the corners of our streets, to make sure the brick-and-mortar businesses have a level playing field. That is all we are asking.  This bill contains no new Federal tax, no new State and local tax. What it does is collect taxes already owed. It simplifies the system by saying there will only be one taxing entity that identifies the taxes to be charged in every single State, one audit from each State. It tries to provide for the retailers the basic software they need to get the job done.  This is a fascinating bill. For those who follow the Senate, it is a rare opportunity for us to have Republicans and Democrats together on the floor supporting a bill that has the endorsement of business and labor and local officials all across the United States. It is clearly an idea whose time has come. I hope we can pass it with a good strong vote and encourage our friends in the House to take it up quickly.  I close by thanking my colleague from Wyoming. He has been a great partner in this effort. He came to it before I did. I replaced Senator Dorgan after Senator Dorgan's retirement and tried to keep this moving forward. Today is our day for a vote. I thank him for all of his hard work on his side of the aisle.  I yield the floor.
