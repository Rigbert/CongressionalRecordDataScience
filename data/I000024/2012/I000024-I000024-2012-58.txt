In my book I talk a little bit about that, but I don't believe it would be appropriate to mention it at this time. But at today's hearing, we talked about the IPCC.  When they were unable, through about five or six different bills, to get cap and trade through--keep in mind, cap and trade through legislation would cost the American people between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. But when that failed, we had something happen in December 2009.  The United Nations has this big party every year, and they invite countries from around the world to testify that global warming is happening and they are going to do something about it. One time in Milan, Italy, I saw one of my friends from West Africa. I said, What in the world are you doing here? You know better than this--in terms of global warming. He said, This is the biggest party of the year. Besides that, if we agree to go along with this, we in West Africa are going to get billions of dollars from the United Nations, from those countries in the developed nations.  Another big party was coming up in Copenhagen in 2009. I think Senator Kerry had gone over; Hillary Clinton had gone over. I don't believe Barack Obama was there. Nancy Pelosi was there and several others were there. They were telling all these countries: Don't you worry about it because we in the United States of America are going to pass cap-and-trade legislation this year. So I said I was going to go over as a one-man truth squad to let them know the truth, and I did. I went over and told the 191 other countries there: We are not going to pass cap and trade. It is dead. It is gone. They can't get one-third of the Senate to support it.  Before I left, one of my favorite liberals, Lisa Jackson--I really like her. She is Obama's appointee and is now the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Right before I went to Copenhagen, we had a hearing and she was a witness.  I said: Madam Administrator, I have a feeling that once I leave and go to Copenhagen, you are going to come out with an endangerment finding that will give you justification to start doing what they couldn't do by legislation through regulations. And I could see a smile on her face.  I said: When you do this, it has to be based on science. What science are you going to base this on?  She said: Well, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change would be the major thing. And, sure enough, that is exactly what happened.  I could not have planned it, but she made this declaration that we now are going to be able to do through regulation what we couldn't do through legislation because the people of America had spoken through their elected representatives in the House and the Senate and had denied the opportunity to do cap and trade, so they decided to do it on an endangerment finding.  What happened after that is what I call poetic justice. Climategate occurred. I had nothing to do with it when it happened, but all the speeches I had made in the previous 10 years on the floor of this Senate were speeches saying exactly the same thing: that they were cooking the science and what they were saying was not real.  I read several of the editorials that came out after climategate. The New York Times has always been on the other side of this issue. They said:       Given the stakes, the IPCC cannot allow more missteps and,      at the very least, must     tighten procedures and make its deliberation more      transparent. The panel's chairman . . . is under fire for      taking consulting fees from business interests. . . .  The Washington Post, which has also been on the other side of this issue, said:       Recent revelations about flaws in that seminal IPCC report,      ranging from typos in key dates to sloppy sourcing, are      undermining confidence not only in the panel's work but also      in projections about climate change.  Newsweek:       Some of the IPCC's most-quoted data and recommendations      were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures,      newspaper articles. . . .  Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph said of climategate, `` . . . the worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said: ``The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.''  A prominent physicist from the IPCC said: ``Climategate was a fraud on the scale I have never seen.''  Another UN Scientist, bails:       UN IPCC Coordinating author Dr. Philip Lloyd calls out IPCC      `fraud'--the result is not scientific.  Newsweek:       Once celebrated climate researchers feeling like used car      salesmen. Some of IPCC's most-quoted data and recommendations      were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures.  Clive Cook of the Atlantic Magazine, speaking of the IPCC, responds:       I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various      Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a      first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific      consensus.  So everyone is in agreement that this is what climategate was all about. And why I am spending so much time on this is because this is the science of all of these things that started since Kyoto.  By the way, the Senator, this morning on the floor, commented about the Kyoto Treaty. Let's keep in mind, the Kyoto Treaty was back during the Clinton-Gore administration. They were strongly in support of it. Vice President Gore went down to the summit they were having in Rio de Janeiro and signed the treaty, but they never submitted it to the Senate.  To become a part of a treaty, it has to be ratified by the United States. It never was, and people need to understand that there is a reason it never was submitted.  I would suggest a couple of other things in the remainder of the time that I have that I think are significant and worthy of bringing up. One would be the one-weather event. The thing that we are hearing more about than anything else is that it has been a very hot summer. On Monday, my wife called me up and said: In Tulsa it is 109 degrees today.  I was joking around with my good friend from Vermont--we disagree with each other, but he is a good friend. Sure, it is hot. But it is so important that people understand, weather is not climate.  Roger Pielke, Jr., a professor of environmental studies at University of Colorado, said:       Over the long term, there is no evidence that disasters are      getting worse because of climate change.  Judith Curry, chair of the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, has said:       I have been completely unconvinced by any of the arguments      . . . that attribute a single extreme weather event, a      cluster of extreme weather events, or statistics of extreme      weather events to anthropogenic forcing.  Myles Allen at the University of Oxford's Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics Department:       When Al Gore said . . . that scientists now have clear      proof that climate change is directly responsible for the      extreme and devastating floods, storms and droughts . . . my      heart sank.  I consider Rachel Maddow of MSNBC to be one of the outstanding liberals, and she is one of my four favorite liberals. I have been on her program, and I have enjoyed it. Bill Nye, the Science Guy, agrees that some of these weather events have nothing to do with global warming.  The other thing I made a note of that came up this morning was that they said there is no evidence on cooling. I think it is important to talk about that a little bit because a prominent Russian scientist said:       We should fear a deep temperature drop--not catastrophic      global. . . . Warming had a natural origin . . .      CO2 is not guilty.  U.N. Fears (More) Global Cooling Cometh! An IPCC scientist warns the U.N.:       We may be about to enter one or even two decades during      which temps cool.  I ask unanimous consent all of these be placed in the Record showing that a single weather event has nothing to do with climate.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Global Cooling Predictions       3. Paleoclimate scientist Dr. Bob Carter, James Cook      University in Austraila, who has testified before the U.S.      Senate Committee on EPW, noted on June 18, 2007, ``The      accepted global average temperature statistics used by the      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show that no      ground-based warming has occurred since 1998. Oddly, this 8-     year-long temperature stability as occurred despite an      increase over the same period of 15 parts per million (or 4%)      in atmospheric CO2.                            (andrew revkin)       4. Just months before Copenhagen, on September 23, 2009,      the New York Times acknowledged, ``The world leaders who met      at the United Nations to discuss climate change . . . are      faced with an intricate challenge: building momentum for an      international climate treaty at a time when global      temperatures have been relatively stable for a decade and may      even drop in the next few years.''
