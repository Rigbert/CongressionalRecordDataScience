 President, today the Senate will debate the motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, with the time equally divided until 5:30 p.m. At 5:30 p.m. we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to this bipartisan jobs and infrastructure bill. If all time is used the Senate will begin consideration of the bill at midnight tomorrow night. Once cloture has been invoked, it is my hope that Chairman Murkowski can work with Senator Cantwell to yield back time, get on the bill during the day tomorrow, and begin to process amendments under the regular order.  The Senate will be out of session on Wednesday and Thursday of this week to accommodate our respective conference retreats. We will return for consideration of the Keystone bill on Friday, and Senators should be working with the bill managers to get their amendments in the queue.                          ____________________
