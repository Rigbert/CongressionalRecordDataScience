Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and, of course, the people of Ohio also have shown extraordinary wisdom in returning her, for more years than I have been here, to the House of Representatives. The gentlewoman has been tremendous on this fight. Although we have been losing, the margin is getting closer and closer.  The gentlewoman will certainly remember that last fall, after an extraordinary effort by the Republican leadership in this House, the President and all his Cabinet and others, they only prevailed by a one-vote margin in getting through the fast track trade bill. A number of Members on that side had to change their vote, and voted reluctantly against interests of their district, particularly people from the South and textile States, and they got what are thus far some pretty hollow promises in return. Certainly the voters in those States are going to have to look to see what it is that their elected Representatives have wrought by proposing to do more and more and more of the same.  Under this legislation, Free Trade of the Americas Act would be one of the things negotiated, and we would go to a few of the very few countries in the Western Hemisphere, where the United States is currently running a trade deficit, where we do not have this kind of a perverted free trade agreement in place, and we would give them the opportunity to join most other nations on Earth who are running huge trade surpluses with the United States, notably Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. A very large economy in Brazil would fall under this new free trade authority, and Brazil is a major manufacturer of automobiles, certainly something close to the gentlewoman's heart, and other very sophisticated goods.  So we can fully expect that under this sort of an agreement that we would find those products coming from Brazil where labor is indeed much, much cheaper than it is in the United States.
