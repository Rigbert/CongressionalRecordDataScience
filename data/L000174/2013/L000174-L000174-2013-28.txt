 For Senators who may not be aware, Pro-Busqueda is a small organization devoted to locating Salvadorans who, as children during the civil war, were forcibly taken from their parents, some of whom were killed by Salvadoran military officers, and either ``adopted'' by those officers or sold to other families including foreigners. Pro-Busqueda works to support the Salvadoran birth parents who lost their children to these forced adoptions, and uses DNA technology to help family members find each other. Years ago, a member of my staff visited Pro-Busqueda's office in San Salvador, met the courageous staff and observed the research they were doing.  This deplorable attack on Pro-Busqueda followed the abrupt decision by San Salvador's Archdiocese to close Tutela Legal, the highly respected human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church which played an indispensable role in investigating and documenting violations of human rights during the war, including the assassination of Archbishop Romero. The office collected key testimony and other documentary evidence, and there is more of that work to be done.  The attack on Pro-Busqueda also followed the welcome but controversial decision by the Salvadoran Supreme Court to accept a case challenging the Amnesty Law, which has provided immunity from prosecution to former Salvadoran military officers implicated in atrocities during the war.  I join those who have expressed condolences to the staff of Pro-Busqueda, and urge the Salvadoran Government to conduct a thorough investigation and to punish those responsible. It is tragic that two decades after the signing of the peace accords that ended the war, attempts to determine the fate of kidnapped children elicits this kind of hateful, violent response. It illustrates how much remains to be done to fulfill the promise of the accords and overcome the painful and divisive legacy of that war.                          ____________________
