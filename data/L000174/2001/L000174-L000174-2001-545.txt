President, I just ask consent to speak for a moment before we go to the Senator from Missouri without it detracting from her time.  I am also delighted to see the Senator from Missouri here to offer and speak on her amendment. I want to add to what the Senator from Nevada said. He did his usual courtesy in providing for all Members on our side. The Senator from Missouri has been on the floor waiting to speak more today than has the Senator from Vermont as one of the managers. So it is only appropriate she proceed now. I commend the Senator from Missouri.  I yield the floor.
