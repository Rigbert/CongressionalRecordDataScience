Speaker, I am very grateful to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske) for yielding to me to continue a Special Order that I began last night during this 5-minute segment on the condition of the U.S. economy. I am very grateful for these few minutes just to continue, as I will every evening where I have a chance.  Mr. Speaker, this relates to America's great need for a new declaration of economic independence and my great disappointment at the debate that occurred in the Congress here in the House last week concerning the tax measures that were before us and then again today, where if we count up the cumulative total of all of these measures we are talking about $3 trillion over the so-called 10-year window. This is an enormous amount of money for a country that currently has over $5.6 trillion worth of debt that we have to pay back, and every year we are paying more and more in the way of interest on that debt.  This year alone we are projected to spend well over $450 billion just on the debt alone.  In addition to that, the United States has the worst-ever current account trade deficit amounting to over $500 billion last year, that essentially requires that we sell our assets or borrow $1.5 billion a day net from foreign interests. Now, the trade deficit is basically about more goods coming into our country than our goods going out. This essentially results from flawed trade agreements that have enabled countries like the People's Republic of China, that is now holding 24 of our military personnel, to gain perhaps a $100 billion advantageous this year from their net exports to this country versus our ability to export into that economy.  So what is wrong with the Bush tax and budget plan? First, the President's tax and budget plan does not pay down the overall debt. In fact, his budget is based on what I would call wildly optimistic, 10-year projections that, in fact, cause the debt to spiral, particularly when over $3 trillion is being returned in that period to a country that still owes $5.6 trillion.  Now, it is interesting that the 10-year window is used for projections when, in fact, the President is only elected for 4 years and we here in Congress only budget one year at a time. So we cannot use a 10-year window. If experience is a good teacher, as it surely should be, we know that projections in the past have been off by vast magnitudes, sometimes as much as 75 percent in one year.  Now major revenue hemorrhages are going to occur after the year 2005 because Social Security and medical care bills will rise as more people from the baby boom generation begin retiring. The administration budget risks ratcheting up what is already a spiraling debt burden, particularly after 2005. So his proposals threaten long-term economic growth and the long-term solvency of both Social Security and Medicare.  Moreover, the administration's budget is inherently unfair, because nearly half of the tax benefits go to people earning over $900,000 a year, only the top 1 percent of earners in this country. It is no question in my mind that the President's powerful allies are setting their own table for slashing corporate income tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent, as most corporations, many of them, do not pay taxes even now; none at all. I will be reading into the Record, when we return later in the month, the names of many of the corporations in our country that pay absolutely no taxes at all.  Many of these same interests want to cut the corporate capital gains tax, repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax and other technical changes like faster depreciation for faster write-offs. These corporate titans, the ones that are pushing us to make these changes here, saw their pay increases at over 535 percent over the last 10 years. Imagine that. Imagine your salary quintupling over the last 10 years. And now they want that to double again in the next decade.  Now, is there any doubt whatsoever that the measures that have been before us are truly lopsided? The shower of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations will dramatically increase the tax burden on millions of people in the middle class. All one has to do is look at the fine print of the bill. It does nothing for low-wage workers and literally leaves out over 12\1/2\ million families with children.  The President claims that the typical family of four would get a $1,600 tax cut. However, more than 85 percent of taxpayers will get tax cuts less than that amount and many will get nothing at all. One-third of families with children in our country will get nothing from the entire package. The basic tax grab for those at the top end, along with lowering rates for only some, does absolutely nothing to lift those in our society burdened by low wages and high taxes, largely payroll taxes.  We know that the regressive payroll tax has to be adjusted, but the plan that came before us did absolutely nothing about that.  So while the rich get richer, thanks to the Bush plan, the impact of his tax schemes will cut funding for the environment in half over the next 10 years; spending on veterans will be slashed; Justice programs such as the COPS program and in-schools and community policing programs all will be cut; agriculture will be cut; transportation will be cut by nearly one-fifth with our roads jammed and our air control towers not being the most modern in the world.  We are going to see cuts in Medicare and cuts in Social Security if that program is adopted by the other body.  Not only is the administration doing nothing to ease the California energy crisis, their budget cuts certain critical Department of Energy programs as much as 30 percent.  So America really does need a new declaration of economic independence because rising interest payments on the Federal debt are at a post-World War II record high, as American family savings rates move downward.                              {time}  1730  U.S. trade deficits are at record levels, with China now being the largest holder of U.S. dollar reserves, $100 billion more this year alone. The number of Americans who believe Social Security will be there for them when they retire is down, at the same time as we see so many families losing their 401(k) assets because of what has been happening in the stock market. The relative portion of taxes being paid by the middle class and poor Americans is going up. At the same time, the relative portion of taxes paid by American and foreign corporations making record profits in the United States as they ship jobs to the Third World is going down. Enforcement of antitrust laws is down.  So, Mr. Speaker, let me just say that the administration and its powerful allies will be back for more bites of our Republic's apple. I really do think that we need a responsible budget. We expect the President of our country to lead us to a higher calling. The future of our country and its stability should be our primary goal, not the gratification of powerful special interests that was so evident here during last week and, in fact, today.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa, who has been such a voice for attention to the problems of agricultural America, for yielding to me.
