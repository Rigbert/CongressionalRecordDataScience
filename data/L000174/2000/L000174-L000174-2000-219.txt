President, I rise today to give my support to the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. In a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, there are too many communities in this nation that are beleaguered by crumbling infrastructures and stagnant economies. This legislation will help attract capital, produce much-needed housing, and encourage private investment to communities most in need.  I am proud to join in cosponsoring this legislation and would like to thank Senator Robb for all his hard work in crafting this bill. Of particular importance to my home state of Vermont are increases in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Private Activity Bond cap.  Vermont is currently in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. Production has stalled and demand has risen. In Chittenden County, one of Vermont's most populated areas, residents face a rental vacancy rate of less than one percent. Housing costs are so expensive, middle income families are being forced into hotels, college dorms, homeless shelters, or left out on the street. Sadly, this is a situation that is being repeated nationwide.  As funding for other federal housing assistance programs has diminished, states depend more and more on the LIHTC and private activity bonds to finance affordable housing projects. The LIHTC has been extremely successful since its enactment as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Today, the LIHTC is one of the primary tools that states have to attract private investment in affordable rental housing. In Vermont, the LIHTC has made possible the production, rehabilitation, and preservation of over 2,600 affordable apartments since 1987. Unfortunately this credit has not been increased since its creation nearly fourteen years ago. Today, the demand for tax credits far exceeds their availability. This year in Vermont, over $2.5 million in credits were requested but only $718,000 were available.  I am pleased that this bill raises the annual per capita allocation of tax credits from $1.25 to $1.75 and indexes the credit to inflation. In addition to the increased per capita allocation, I hope to work a small state minimum. Such a floor would help to ensure that small states like Vermont have access to the resources they need to provide affordable housing for every resident in need.  Private activity bonds also play an important role in providing affordable housing for Vermonters. In 1986 the Federal Tax Reform Act limited the amount of tax-exempt bonds that each state could issue to no more than $50 per capita. There has not been an inflation adjustment to the cap since its inception. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) has issued over $1.25 billion in private activity bonds since 1974, bonds which have helped make the dream of home ownership a reality for over 20,425 Vermont households. I am pleased that this bill includes a cap increase from $50 to $75 per capita which will help Vermont's finance agencies continue this success.  Again, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill which will offer many households, businesses and communities new opportunities as we enter the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
