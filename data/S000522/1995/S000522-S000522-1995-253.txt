Today, I reintroduced two important bills which will have a direct and substantial impact on women, children, and families nationwide. These bills--the Omnibus Adoption Act of 1995 and the Health Care and Housing for Women and Children Act--both promote the joining of needy children and caring families through the loving option of adoption.  There is no doubt that there are children patiently and hopefully awaiting adoption. Over the past decade, between 50,000-60,000 children found adoptive homes each year. This figure is down from 89,000 in 1970; but that is not indicative of fewer needy children. In fact, over this same time period, the number of children in foster care increased to more than 407,000 and the number of children born out-of-wedlock increased three-fold to 1,165,000.  The National Council for Adoption [NCFA] estimates that between one and two million individuals and couples want to adopt. But there are obstacles in their way. Some of these obstacles are financial; some are merely education; some are cultural. The Omnibus Adoption Act of 1995 takes aim at these hurdles with the intention of leveling them.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that the benefits of adoption to birthmothers are overwhelmingly positive. In fact, some research indicates that those women who do choose to make an adoption plan for their children will be less likely to live in poverty, more likely to complete high school, and less likely to have additional unplanned pregnancies. We must provide Federal support to these pregnant women and all pregnant women who lack the means to pay for prenatal and maternal health care.  The centerpiece of the Omnibus Adoption Act is the means tested $5000 tax credit. According to the NCFA, the average cost of an adoption is $14,000 and it is not uncommon for this figure to reach upwards of $25,000. Often this includes prenatal care for the birthmother and child, counseling for the adoptive family, and legal fees. For a middle-income family already on a tight budget, this one-time up-front cost can be prohibitive.  The targeted tax credit would be available in full to families earning less than $60,000 and in part to families earning between $60,000 and $100,000. In this way, it is able to give as much help as possible to the families which need it the most. And while this tax credit has a limitless reward, it has a very modest cost. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee estimated last year that the adoption tax credit would cost $900 million over 5 years.  You may recognize this provision from the Republican Contract with America as well. I am pleased that this aspect of my bill has been included in the Contract's Family Reinforcement Act [H.R. 11].  Other provisions of the Omnibus Adoption Act are equally valuable and popular. For instance, the bill establishes a national advisory council on adoption to monitor the progress of the various adoption related programs which exist and which the bill institutes. The bill also establishes a national adoption data collection system. These two provisions will work hand-in-hand to further advance adoption options. As does a section stating the sense of Congress that every State implement and enforce uniform adoption laws ranging from detailed home studies for prospective adoptive families to health benefits for birthmothers and adopted children.  The Omnibus Adoption Act establishes a program of graduate study fellowships to encourage our best young minds to research and develop innovation in adoption programs. Additionally, the bill organizes a grant program within the Department of Education offering [[Page E452]]  grant funding to States which implement adoption education programs. The Boston Globe, in a editorial highly supportive of this bill in general and the tax credit provision in particular, noted that this was an idea that deserves close study.  Another provision in the Omnibus Adoption Act which the Globe thought worthy of closer study clarifies Federal and military employee adoption benefits. This would allow these families to use sick leave for adoption purposes. They would also be eligible for reimbursement through Federal health benefit plans for the prenatal and maternity care of the birthmother in their adoption plan. The bill specifically prohibits surrogate parenting arrangements with regard to this provision.  The final two provisions of the Omnibus Adoption Act are so critical to the promotion of adoption and the health of birthmothers and their children that I have introduced them as a separate bill as well--the Health Care and Housing for Women and Children Act. These provisions establish material health certificates and grants for rehabilitation of housing for use as maternity homes. Maternal health certificates could be used by low-income pregnant women who seek assistance in carrying their child to term at maternity homes. Here they could get housing, medical care, educational and vocational training, adoption counseling, and other supportive services. To ensure that maternity homes are available to these women, a grant program would be established to give non-profit organizations aid in rehabilitating old housing for use as maternity homes.  The American Enterprise in its January/February 1995 noted the central role which maternity homes once played in helping young, low-income women to carry their pregnancies to term and how that role has unfortunately diminished. Writer George Liebmann observed that:       Current American welfare policy is plagued by an ideology      of cash entitlement. What the poor really need today is not a      check but a powerful set of rehabilitative social services.      These should be offered by private community groups, without      any illusion of moral neutrality. Rescuing an underclass is      by definition a highly moralistic undertaking.  This is the historical mission of the maternity home. They provide therapy and support through the grouping of several young women in similar circumstances under one roof. They provide rehabilitation through education, vocational training, health care, and counseling. Furthermore, they offer discipline and supervision to women who have often lived on streets and in neighborhoods devoid of such backbone. This is crucial to the health and welfare of both mother and child. And it can all be provided by community groups with a commitment to care.  Over the past two sessions in which I have introduced these bills, they have enjoyed broad bipartisan support from more than one hundred Members. I encourage my colleagues to respond to the needs of homeless children and the families who long to help them by cosponsoring both the Omnibus Adoption Act and the Health Care and Housing for Women and Children Act.                          ____________________
