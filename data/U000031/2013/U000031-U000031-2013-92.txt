This approach really does build on last year's momentum to get the job done.  Consumers and taxpayers have paid over $15 billion--that's ``b'' as in ``big''--to find out whether Yucca Mountain would be a safe repository for civilian spent nuclear fuel and defense nuclear waste. They deserve an answer, yes, they do; and under this bill, they're going to get one.  I commend all the members of the Appropriations Committee for this. And I would urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this appropriation bill for FY 2014 so that we can make additional resources available to perform the critical work.  I yield again to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen).
