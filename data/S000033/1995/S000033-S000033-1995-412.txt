 I think the iron law of politics is that government will often try to get away with as much as they can until people stand up and say, sorry, you are not going to do that.  So I think I would speak for you and many Members of Congress who are saying to the American people, we have enough problems at home. We have a $200 billion deficit and a $4.6 trillion national debt. We do not think it makes a lot of sense within that context to be bailing out an authoritarian and unstable government and a very shaky economy in Mexico. I would very strongly urge the American people, write to the President, write to your Members of Congress and say, wait a second. We want you to stop this $40 billion bailout.  So I would hope that the American people would stand up and say, no, Mr. President, no Republican leadership, [[Page H968]] let us reinvest in America. Let us control our own deficit. I hope we do not take this lying down.  If people stand up and fight back, we can yet turn around this fiasco.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman.  I think these are an extraordinary couple of days in the history of this republic. The House of Representatives and the Senate did stop the bailout of Mexico or at least indicated that they were not willing to go along readily. That was great. But now we have seen an end run around the Congress of the United States with the creative interpretation of a statute and another way to send $40 billion out the back door that Congress would not let go out the front door. Yet again the Federal Reserve is going to meet tomorrow to try and visit another catastrophe on the American people, to raise interest rates, to banish the threat of inflation that does not exist.                              {time}  2130  There is a 30 year low in terms of inflation statistics to drive up unemployment. That is the policy of the Federal Reserve.  Did this Congress authorize the Federal Reserve to drive up unemployment? Are those the underlying laws and statutes in the United States, and is that the authority which extended to the Federal Reserve: You are charged with driving up unemployment because we do not want to see wages go up, we don't want people to make a better standard of living?  That is not what I got elected to do. I believe there are some extraordinary questions here, and they all seem to come back to the same very small influential group, the Federal Reserve, a few people on Wall Street and some people in the administration, some of whom used to work on Wall Street very recently, earning up to $26 million a year advising their company to invest $5.2 billion in Mexico, and now want to bail out Mexico.  These are extraordinary times, and the people should be very attentive to what is going on here.
