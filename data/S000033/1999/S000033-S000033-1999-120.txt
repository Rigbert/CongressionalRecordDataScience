 The bottom line is very simple. The taxpayers of this country have spent, appropriately, billions of dollars in research through the National Institutes of Health to develop very important anticancer drugs, anti-AIDS drugs and many other types of drugs. We have had a good result. What the outrage is, is that after the taxpayer pays for the development and the research of that drug, what we have right now is the government then simply gives over that product to the private pharmaceutical company which can charge any price it wants. So the taxpayer gets screwed twice. After you pay for the research, then you have to pay some outrageous price to purchase that product.  We are going to continue on that legislation, and we are going to bring it up as soon as we can on the floor of the House. But I want to mention another piece of legislation that we have recently introduced, and that is that given the reality of what goes on right now, that the price for American prescription drugs are sold in Canada and Mexico far, far cheaper than the United States, I have legislation which would do a very simple thing.  We are going to talk about trade in a minute, and a lot of the folks here think, oh, free trade is a great idea. You and I have problems with certain aspects of, quote-unquote, free trade. But here is something very interesting. If a prescription drug distributor in the United States wanted to do business with a distributor in Canada and wanted to purchase a prescription drug there at the same price that the Canadians are able to purchase it from American companies, that is currently illegal. The theory of free enterprise is that a businessperson can go shopping around and get the best price and the consumer benefits and everything else. It is a nice theory, I guess, except it does not apply, NAFTA notwithstanding, to prescription drugs.                              {time}  1845  So right now an American distributor cannot negotiate with a Canadian distributor to purchase a prescription drug at the same price as the Canadians are getting it. So we have very simple conservative legislation in that says: Let the free market work, and when you have exactly the same product approved by the FDA, let American prescription drug distributors get the best price, sell it to the pharmacist, and as the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) indicated a moment ago, the problem is not with the pharmacist in the United States; he or she is paying significantly higher prices than pharmacists all over the world, and we are saying: Hey, let us have a level playing field, let us have a little free trade when it comes to protecting the American consumers.  So this is a piece of legislation that we look forward to bringing to the floor of the House and passing.  Mr. DeFAZIO. In fact, in speaking further to that issue, some seniors in border States have actually formed little clubs and rented buses to go across the border to pick up their needed drugs, their lifesaving drugs, at an incredibly cheaper price, and now, of course, I understand the border patrol is starting to crack down on that.
