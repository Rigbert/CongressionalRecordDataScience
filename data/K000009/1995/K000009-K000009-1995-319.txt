They were built with private money, private-sector investments. They are investor-owned utilities. We have been trying to figure out [[Page H292]] a way to help reduce energy costs to our people, and it has been a heck of a problem for us to get our hands around, and we always get the door shut in our face. Well, maybe not shut in our face; people treat us very nicely when we talk to the Department of Energy and even the Vice President's office, but when it comes down to really getting help so we can maintain our manufacturing base and reduce these energy costs as a percent of doing business, we get absolutely no Federal help.  And I am so glad you brought up that point, because I would say that is the chief reason that we are losing jobs from our part of the country, because of power costs, and yet our own Government would not respond to us.  But within 1 week in this Capitol when Mexico needed help, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, who never comes out of the building, has been all over the Congress, has been up at the White House, up at the Treasury, the Secretary of the Treasury running all around here. It has been very interesting to see what it takes to get the attention of the top officials of this Government.  Kind of sad.
