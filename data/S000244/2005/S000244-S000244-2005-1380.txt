Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to correct the record.  There have been statements made on the actions of then-Governor George W. Bush of Texas. I would like to correct the record on this.  In 1997, then-Governor Bush vetoed an advanced directives bill precisely because it would have given specific legal sanction to such involuntary denial of lifesaving treatment. An effort in the Texas legislature to amend the bill to require treatment pending transfer to a health care provider willing to provide the lifesaving treatment had been defeated.  With no legal protections at all under Texas law, and ongoing programs in Texas hospitals denying treatment with no opportunity to even seektransfer, pro-life groups entered into negotiations with medical groups that finally resulted in the bill that, one, formalized more protections for in-hospital review; two, gave patients 10 days of treatment while seeking transfer; and, three, authorized court proceedings to extend the 10 days for reasonable additional periods of time to accomplish transfer. That is what the Governor signed.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).
