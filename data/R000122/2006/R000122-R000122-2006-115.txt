President, I yield myself 5 minutes.  I wish to take a few moments talking about H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Last year, the House overwhelmingly passed this bill, and I am pleased that the Senate will now finally consider this legislation. My colleague in the other body, Congressman Jim Langevin, has been a staunch advocate for stem cell research and has played a central role in advancing this legislation through the House of Representatives, and I commend him for that.  I hope to be able to stand on the Senate floor a few years from now to highlight the advancements that have been made in the treatment of spinal cord victims, children with diabetes, and Parkinson's treatment because of embryonic stem cell research. However, I fear that even if the Senate approves legislation, patients will only see further delays in promising stem cell research.
