Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation to expedite the cleanup of our Nation's waters. This bill, the National Clean Water Trust Fund Act of 1995, would create a trust fund established from fines, penalties, and other moneys collected through enforcement of the Clean Water Act to help alleviate the problems for which the enforcement [[Page E539]] actions were taken. This legislation is identical to a measure I introduced with bipartisan support in the last Congress, and it was the model for a provision I secured in last year's Clean Water Act reauthorization bill, H.R. 3948.  Currently, there is no guarantee that fines or other moneys that result from violations of the Clean Water Act will be used to correct water quality problems. Instead, some of the money goes into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury without any provision that it be used to improve the quality of our Nation's waters.  I am concerned that EPA enforcement activities are extracting large sums of money from industry and others through enforcement of the Clean Water Act, while we ignore the fundamental issue of how to pay for the cleanup of the water pollution problems for which the penalties were levied. If we are really serious about ensuring the successful implementation of the Clean Water Act, we should put these enforcement funds to work and actually clean up our Nation's waters. It does not make sense for scarce resources to go into the bottomless pit of the Treasury's general fund, especially if we fail to solve our serious water quality problems due to lack of funds.  Specifically, my bill would establish a national clean water trust fund within the U.S. Treasury for fines, penalties, and other moneys, including consent decrees, obtained through enforcement of the Clean Water Act that would otherwise be placed into Treasury's general fund. Under my proposal, the EPA Administrator would be authorized to prioritize and carry out projects to restore and recover waters of the United States using the funds collected from violations of the Clean Water Act. However, this legislation would not preempt citizen suits or in any way preclude EPA's authority to undertake and complete supplemental environmental projects [SEP's] as part of settlements related to violations of the Clean Water Act and/or other legislation.  For example, in 1993, Inland Steel announced a $54.5 million multimedia consent decree, which included a $26 million SEP and a $3.5 million cash payment to the U.S. Treasury. I strongly support the use of SEP's to facilitate the cleanup of serious environmental problems, which are particularly prevalent in my congressional district. However, my bill would dedicate the cash payment to the Treasury to the clean water trust fund.  The bill further specifies that remedial projects be within the same EPA region where enforcement action was taken. Northwest Indiana is in EPA region 5, and there are 10 EPA regions throughout the United States. Under my proposal, any funds collected from enforcement of the Clean Water Act in region 5 would go into the national clean water trust fund and, ideally, be used to cleanup environmental impacts associated with the problem for which the fine was levied.  To illustrate how a national clean water trust fund would be effective in cleaning up our Nation's waters, I would like to highlight the magnitude of the fines that have been levied through enforcement of the Clean Water Act. Nationwide, in fiscal year 1994, EPA assessed $35 million in penalties for violations of the Clean Water Act. These penalties represented 27 percent of all penalties assessed by EPA under various environmental statutes.  My bill also instructs EPA to coordinate its efforts with the State in prioritizing specific cleanup projects. Finally, to monitor the implementation of the national clean water trust fund, I have included a reporting requirement in my legislation. One year after enactment, and every 2 years thereafter, the EPA Administrator would make a report to Congress regarding the establishment of the trust fund.  My legislation has garnered the endorsement of several environmental organizations in northwest Indiana, including the Grand Calumet task force, the northwest Indiana chapter of the Izaak Walton League, and the Save the Dunes Council. Further, I am encouraged by the support within the national environmental community and the Northeast-Midwest Institute for the concept of a national clean water trust fund. I would also like to point out that, in a 1992 report to Congress on the Clean Water Act enforcement mechanisms, and Environmental Protection Agency workgroup recommended amending the Clean Water Act to establish a national clean water trust fund.  In reauthorizing the Clean Water Act, we have a unique opportunity to improve the quality of our Nation's waters. The establishment of a national clean water trust fund is an innovative step in that direction. By targeting funds accrued through enforcement of the Clean Water Act--that would otherwise go into the Treasury Department's general fund--we can put scarce resources to work and facilitate the cleanup of problem areas throughout the Great Lakes and across this country. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                          ____________________
