 President, I rise today on a personal note. I hadplanned to make these remarks as we passed the midnight milestone on our way to cloture on the appropriations bill, because, as the clock strikes twelve, and November 20 begins, my Committee colleague, our Ranking Member, Robert C. Byrd will celebrate a birthday. I wish my colleague a happy and productive 82nd year.  Senator Byrd has a wonderful and widely quoted sign up on his office wall: ``There are four things people in West Virginia believe: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Little Liver Pills, and Robert C. Byrd.'' I'd like to take a little literary license to suggest that there are four things that Robert C. Byrd believes in: God Almighty, his 62 year long love affair with his wife, Erma, his constituents and the Senate.  And, Senator Byrd is not just your run of the mill believer. I have listened many times to the wisdom and intensity of his words, words which flow from a faith that runs as deep as his West Virginia roots, as deep as the coal mines which seam the earth of Appalachia. His words are what have led many to see Senator Byrd as the faithful historian and effective guardian of the precedents and privileges, of the rules and Constitutional role of the United States Senate. But, Senator Byrd is more than an institutional advocate, he is a living history of the Senate and democracy. The Senator from West Virginia gives a clear voice both to our finest traditions and what he sees as his life long purpose, serving what he so nobly refers to as ``my people.'' His reverence and respect for the Senate are surpassed by the deep regard and abiding passion he has for the needs of his constituents.  He speaks of those needs virtually every week. Senator Byrd breathes life into images of each West Virginian he introduces to us in remarks on the floor--even those who have passed from the scene. When he describes a man who dies in a slate fall while mining West Virginia's coal, he speaks softly of a man, alone, who died in the dark. The illuminating power of this image flows from the passion of his commitment.  It is his commitment which crosses partisan lines and has earned Senator Byrd legendary respect. In the last week, I have been privileged to experience this commitment while working with him to protect our coal miner's from the predatory reach of an overbearing judge.  As Senator Byrd begins another year and the Senate another session, I will look forward to continuing our work together, succeeding in reversing the devastating consequences of a bad decision, and serving well our constituents.                          ____________________
