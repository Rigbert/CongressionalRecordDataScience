Speaker, the tragic death of a young soldier from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, who gave the ultimate measure of sacrifice in the global war on terror, saddens all of us. As we continue to fight this war, the loss of each and every service member is a tragedy.  Anne Arundel County, the state of Maryland, and our Nation lost a great hero when Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Swanson of Rose Haven was killed in Anbar on July 22.  More than 50 of Maryland's bravest have now died in the war in Iraq.  Christopher Swanson was completely dedicated to protecting his fellow troops. He wrote on his personal website, ``I would do anything for them even if it means giving my life to save theirs.''  Swanson was highly regarded in his family and community. As a teenager, he traveled on mission trips with members of the First Baptist Church in Upper Marlboro, providing the hope of a better life to gang members in West Virginia and Ohio.  He was the captain of his soccer team at Southern High School, where faculty remembered a ``happy go-lucky kid that was always lending a hand.''  In August of 1999, Sergeant Swanson enlisted in the Army, even as others tried to talk him out of it. He served in Kosovo as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division, and was part of the initial assault on Iraq in March of 2003, the first of three tours.  Sergeant Swanson was awarded two purple hearts, one after being injured by an improvised explosive device just weeks before he was killed. He persevered, telling his brother Kenneth that he would not be sidelined.  Christopher Swanson gave his life for all of us. As his representative in Congress, I am grateful for his patriotism and his sacrifice. The Fifth District of Maryland and all Americans join the Swanson family in mourning the loss of this fine young man, a real hero.                          ____________________
