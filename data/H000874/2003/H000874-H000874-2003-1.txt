Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and initially I would like to submit for the Record at this point in time my remarks with reference to the Office of Federal Detention Trustee.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Wolf, the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, for the opportunity to discuss the roles and authorities of the Federal Detention Trustee.  It is my understanding that the language in the report addressing the building of detention facilities by the Office of Federal Detention Trustee clearly indicates that the Office does not have the authority to solicit contracts to build a new detention facility and directs the Office to withdraw any solicitation for such activities.  While the language is report language and is not binding, I believe it is sufficient to prevent the Office of Federal Detention Trustee from going forward with its plans to solicit contracts to build a new detention facility.  Chairman Wolf has committed to working with me to ensure that the Detention Trustees abides by the clear intent of the Congress that contracting for a new facility is not an allowable use of funds.
