 It seems to me it is time we had such a vote. It is an opportunity to set aside the rancor that has occasionally occurred during the consideration of this underlying measure, both in the Appropriations Committee and since, and agree that the Armed Forces of the United States have performed brilliantly in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in, of course, Iraq.  Since October 7, 2001, when our Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition allies launched military operations in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, our soldiers and allies have removed the Taliban regime, eliminated Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure, and captured significant and also important and numerous members of al-Qaida.  Since March 19, 2003, when the Armed Forces of our country and its coalition allies launched military operations, designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, our soldiers have removed Saddam Hussein's regime, eliminated Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, ended Iraq's illicit and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and captured significant international terrorists.  During all of this time, during the heat of battle, our soldiers have acted with all the efficiency that wartime commands, but all the compassion and understanding that an emerging peace requires. They have acted in the finest tradition of U.S. soldiers and are to be commended by this Senate.                           Amendment No. 1795  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
