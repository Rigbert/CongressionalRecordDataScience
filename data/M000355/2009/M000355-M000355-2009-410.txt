 President, this week we commemorate National Police Week, recognizing the service and sacrifice of the men and women across America in law enforcement. We especially honor those peace officers who have been tragically killed in the line of duty while protecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy.  Over 25 years ago, I served as a county executive in Jefferson County, KY, which includes my hometown of Louisville. I got to work with the county's police force and witnessed up close their dedication and their professionalism. In Jefferson County, we pioneered new techniques for tracking down abducted children that met with much success--enough success that other jurisdictions adopted these techniques, eventually leading to Congressional establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Decades later, peace officers in Louisville are still proud to protect and serve, even with their lives in the balance. And those we have lost are not forgotten. I was moved to read in my hometown paper recently an article about a memorial ceremony in Louisville coinciding with National Police Week. Fellow officers and family members of fallen officers gathered to remember them and thank them for their service. Police forces across Kentucky reverently marked National Police Week as well. At a service in Richmond, Gov. Steve Beshear watched 120 police cadets march at the State Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, while flags were presented to family members of those lost in the performance of their duties. This Friday in Covington, officers will honor their fallen brothers at the northern Kentucky law enforcement memorial.  This Senate has the deepest admiration and respect for police officers in every community in the Nation. We recognize their work is both an honorable job and a dangerous one. They bravely risk their lives for ours, and America is grateful.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full articles about the recent ceremonies in both Louisville and Richmond.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, May 8, 2009] Fallen Police Officers Honored at Jefferson Square Service: Courage,                      Commitment to Duty Are Honored                          (By Jessie Halladay)       Sue Wells' eyes filled with tears as she stood next to a      wreath she helped lay at the law enforcement memorial in      Jefferson Square yesterday.       Her husband, Forest Hills Police Chief Randy Wells, was      killed in October 2007 while working an off-duty traffic      detail.       Yesterday, Wells joined other family members and friends of      officers killed in the line of duty to remember and pay their      respects during a service at Jefferson Square downtown.       ``It's wonderful that they remember,'' Wells said. ``It's      very heartwarming, but it's heart-wrenching too.''       Members of the city's fraternal order of police lodges for      several agencies helped plan the event, for which the      University of Louisville police union was host.       ``When their duty called, they laid down their life for      their community, for us,'' U of L Officer Russell Fuller said      during the ceremony. ``We will not let their actions fade      into history.''       Memorials of this type mean a lot to those families left      behind, said Jennifer Thacker, who spoke during the service.      Thacker's husband, Brandon, was shot in April 1998 while      working as an investigator for the Kentucky Department of      Alcoholic Beverage Control. Thacker now serves as national      president of the group Concerns of Police Survivors, or COPS.       She spoke to those attending about the value of always      being a member of the law enforcement family.       ``I found hope and courage through the support of others,''      she said.       Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert White attended      yesterday's ceremony because he said it's important to pay      respects and keep the memories alive of those who have died      in the service of their community.       He said these annual ceremonies serve not only as reminders      but as a renewed pledge of the commitment officers make to      their fellow officers and those officers' families.       ``It really reiterates the importance of maintaining honor      and respect for those men and women who have lost their lives      in the line of duty,'' White said.       Wells said while the service brings up many painful      memories, she is grateful for the support she has received      during her loss, which continues today.       ``If I need anything I know I could call in the wee hours      of the morning,'' she said.                                  ____              [From the Richmond Register, Apr. 28, 2009]            State Adds 28 Names to Law Enforcement Memorial                           (By Bill Robinson)       As a kilted bagpiper played and Gov. Steve Beshear watched      Monday morning, 120 Kentucky law enforcement cadets marched      in military fashion to a ceremony honoring two law officers      who died in the line of duty last year.       A bright spring sun flooded the state's Law Enforcement      Officers Memorial at Eastern Kentucky University with light      for the ceremony attended by officers and family members from      across the state.       In addition to the names of Harlan County Constable Joe      Howard and Bell County Deputy Sean Pursifull, the names of 26      other officers who died in the line of duty between 1862 and      1993 were added to the memorial's wall of honor.       American flags were presented to the families or      departments of each officer whose name was added this year.       Pursifull and his K-9 partner were killed Jan. 10, 2008,      when a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect hit their car.       Howard suffered a fatal heart attack while serving a      warrant on April 1, 2008.       Howard's son, Tim, an 11-year veteran of the Harlan County      Sheriff's Department, attended the ceremony with his wife and      8-year-old daughter.       In addition to eulogizing the fallen officers, Beshear      praised the cadets who ``knowing the dangers, marched with      their heads held high, undeterred from their goal of becoming      a peace officer.''       Today's law officers must be better trained than ever,      Beshear said, because criminals in the 21st century are more      sophisticated, methodical and organized.       However, ``The heart and soul required of you, our      protectors, never change,'' he said.       ``I pray we never have to engrave any of your names, or any      other peace officer, on this memorial.''       The 120 cadets who took part in the ceremony included      members of the current Kentucky State Police Academy class.       ``I'm proud to have protected this KSP Academy class from      budget cuts,'' the governor said, ``because I know how      important they will be to our state.''       The ceremony concluded with a 21-gun salute as a squad of      seven officers fired three rifle volleys and a bugler played      ``Taps.''                          ____________________
