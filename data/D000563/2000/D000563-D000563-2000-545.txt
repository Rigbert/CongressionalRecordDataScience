President, I rise today to pay tribute to the heroism and sacrifices of the sailors and marines who served in the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet.  The Asiatic Fleet established itself as one of the premier assets of the United States Navy during its years of operation. Officially commissioned by the Navy in 1910, The Asiatic Fleet's origins can be traced back to 1845, when the United States first established a naval presence in the Far East. The United States established the Asiatic Fleet to protect American interests in the western Pacific. The sailors and marines of the Asiatic Fleet ensured the safety of United States citizens and foreign nationals and provided humanitarian assistance in that region during the Chinese civil war, the Yangtze Flood of 1931, and the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities. The increasing risks faced by U.S. military personnel serving in this region were highlighted by the accidental bombings and sinking of a U.S. Navy gunboat belonging to the Asiatic Fleet, the U.S.S. Panay, in international waters by Japanese aircraft in 1937--four years before the U.S. entered World War II.  Following the declaration of war against Japan, the warships, submarines, and aircraft of the Asiatic Fleet singly or in task forces courageously fought many naval battles against a superior Japanese armada. General Douglas MacArthur evacuated most U.S. military personnel and equipment from the region to prevent them from being destroyed by Japan's military forces, leaving the Asiatic Fleet alone, without reinforcement, to do what it could to obstruct the Japanese advance. During these battles, the men of the Fleet discovered that much of their equipment was defective. It has been estimated that one in three of the Asiatic Fleet's torpedoes, and one fifth of its anti-aircraft ammunition, were duds. Forced to rely on World War I-era equipment, the Asiatic Fleet directly suffered the loss of 22 ships, 1,826 men killed or missing in action, and 518 men captured and imprisoned under the worst of conditions. Many of those who survived later died while being held as prisoners of war. The Asiatic Fleet ceased to exist as a cohesive fighting force on March 1, 1942, when its flagship, the U.S.S. Houston, was sunk by the Japanese near Indonesia.  Unfortunately, the heroism of the sailors and marines of the Asiatic Fleet are largely unknown to the American public. Today, March 1, 2000, the 58th anniversary of the Houston's sinking, I want to commend the bravery, resourcefulness and sacrifices of all who served in the United States Navy Asiatic Fleet from 1910 to 1942, especially those sailors and marines who put their lives in harm's way during the first few months of America's participation in World War II. No words can adequately express our nation's debt to its veterans, and it is essential that we provide them with the thanks and recognition they have earned. The American people should always remember the courage and determination displayed by the personnel of the Asiatic Fleet, honoring the sacrifices they made in defense of the United States.                          ____________________
