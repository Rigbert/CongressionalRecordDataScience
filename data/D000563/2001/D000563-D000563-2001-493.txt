What the President has said to America is--he arrived initially to find a good, strong economy and a big buffet of opportunities--let's eat our dessert first. You don't have to eat your vegetables; eat your dessert first. Let's have a tax cut and a big one.  A lot of us are saying: Isn't it better for America to have a sensibly sized tax cut that helps working families and middle-income families and not just the wealthy and one that also pays off our national debt and leaves money aside for important investments in our future? If we are going to have a plan for economic growth in America, the Senator from Nevada will agree with me that education ought to be the first item on the agenda.  The American people, interestingly enough, when you ask them what we should do with the surplus, do not say: Give me a tax cut. Their first response is: Do something to help our schools and our teachers.  When you look at these priorities and investments that can mean economic growth for a long period of time, we ought to start with education. As the Senator from Nevada says, if the President has his way, if the tax cut is too large, if it goes to the wealthiest people among us and doesn't help working families, we will squander the opportunity to invest in education, to invest in a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, to invest in Social Security and Medicare for the future. The American people understand that. If it sounds too good to be true, as the old saying goes, it probably is.  For the President to suggest we can have it all, we can give this tax cut of $2.6 trillion and take care of all of our other problems, really strains the credibility of his position.
