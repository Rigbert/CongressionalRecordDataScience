Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, the proponents of this bill have stated time and time again that courts have determined that those who file lawsuits against the firearms industry are doing so because they want to bankrupt the industry. They want to bankrupt the industry throughlegal fees, and even though they might not win their cases in court, there is no reimbursement for the defense costs that have to be run up once a lawsuit is filed.  Now, anybody who uses a firearm for illegal purposes, we should throw the book at. I certainly support what has gone on in Richmond in Project Exile, and I hope we can give the Justice Department enough money to extend Project Exile nationwide. I also strongly support the InstaCheck system that is designed to keep firearms out of the hands of people who have not been lawfully able to possess those firearms for over 70 years, convicted felons, adjudicated mental incompetents and some other people.  But we should not use the judicial process to bankrupt an industry that produces a legal product. If you do not like the product, introduce a bill here to make it illegal. I will vote against it, but at least you can deal with that directly through the democratic process, rather than going through the back door and trying to get the courts to do what legislatures and the Congress have failed to do.
