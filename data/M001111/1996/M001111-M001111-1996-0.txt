 President, I want to express my sincere pleasure that the Vancouver National Historic Reserve will be established as a result of the enactment of legislation by this Congress.  We have worked for several years in a bipartisan fashion to establish this important historic site in Vancouver, WA. This vision for cooperative management of the historic resources at Fort Vancouver began with the city of Vancouver and former Congresswoman Jolene Unsoeld. Congresswoman Unsoeld had the vision, leadership, and determination to develop a broadly supported plan to preserve and promote several chapters in the colorful history of the Pacific Northwest.  This proposal has been 10 years in the making. Throughout these years, the vision has been for a collaborative effort between the city of Vancouver, the Army, and the National Park Service. In recognition of the opportunity to coordinate the management and interpretation of the historic areas around Fort Vancouver, Congress in 1990 established the Vancouver Historic Study Commission to develop a plan for the area and make a recommendation to Congress. In 1993, the five members of the commission--representing the National Park Service, City of Vancouver, Army, State Historic Preservation Office, and the public-at-large--unanimously approved a strategy for the area. The commission's report called for the establishment of a Vancouver National Historic Reserve. The reserve would be cooperatively managed by the various public owners of the area through the Vancouver partnership. Key controversies such as the continued operation of Pearson Airpark were addressed and thoughtfully resolved.  Legislation to implement the commission's recommendations was introduced in 1994 by former Congresswoman Unsoeld but was unable to pass in the closing days of the 103d Congress. In an effort to maintain progress on the historic area, the city entered into a memorandum of agreement with the National Park Service regarding the operation of the area on November 4, 1995. Nevertheless, legislation was still needed to implement the MOA and the commission's recommendations.  During this Congress, we have worked with the city and the Park Service in a bipartisan fashion to address outstanding concerns and develop legislation to effectively establish the reserve. Senator Gorton and I, and Congresswoman Smith, introduced bills to establish the reserve. When the committee began to develop an omnibus parks bill, Senator Gorton and I worked to include the Vancouver Historic Reserve and were successful. The simplified version of our bill included in the omnibus measure raised concerns for the Park Service and was improved during the conference with the House.  As last-minute negotiations on this omnibus parks bill progressed, there was some miscommunication regarding the administration's support for the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. As is now clear, the administration fully supports the establishment of the reserve and supports it's inclusion in this omnibus measure. And so do I. I look forward to the development of the Vancouver partnership and the coordinated management it will bring to the historic treasures of Vancouver, WA. Treasures of the entire Pacific Northwest that must be preserved for future generations.  The Vancouver National Historic Reserve is truly ``Once Place Across Time''. From the Native American cultures and communities that lived and traded in the region for over 100 centuries to Lewis and Clark's expedition and the Hudson Bay Company's fur trade, the areas of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve are at the foundation of the history and the legacy of the Pacific Northwest and the great State of Washington. Our journey from these beginnings through the decades is also visible through Fort Vancouver, the Vancouver Army Barracks and Officer's Row, and Pearson Airfield.  The multiple layers of history tells us so much about our region and ourselves. I look forward to the sense of continuity the reserve will bring to the history of this place. The connection of people and places across the span of time will bring an improved sense of place to this wonderful area of our region and the Nation.                          ____________________
