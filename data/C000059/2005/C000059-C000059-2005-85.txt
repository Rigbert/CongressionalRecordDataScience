Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the late James E. Mizell II for his dedicated service to our country and community. Born in February 1948, in Bakersfield, Jim was a fourth generation Californian and remained devoted to the betterment of the state throughout his personal and professional life. Growing up in Taft, in the San Joaquin Valley, Jim developed an early appreciation for the importance of water resources to farmers and businessmen living in a desert. At the age of 14, he moved to Orange County and, soon after, met his future wife Pamela Mosier while attending Corona Del Mar High School.  After his marriage to Pam, Jim was deployed by the United States Navy to South East Asia aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway. After fulfilling his military duty, he returned to Orange Coast College, finished his Bachelor of Science in Economics at Loyola Marymount and received an MBA from the Anderson School of Business at UCLA. Jim's interest in California's growth led him to specialize in real estate development. Jim also leaves a legacy of balanced and practical environmental stewardship, business and financial acumen, as well as decade of leadership as an elected director of the Santa Margarita Water District.  Jim passed away on January 14th of this year while taking his morning run. He is survived by his wife and four boys.  Jim was fascinated by issues that shaped the future of ``his State''. He understood the complex issues which impacted Southern California's ocean, in which he loved to surf and sail, and the beauty of Northern California's wilderness where he hiked and skied. He understood California's vital farming communities, and the necessary growth of the housing market to a growing economy.  Jim was a man of integrity who believed in the goodness of people, and that most individuals are motivated by a sincere desire to accomplish positive results. However, he also believed man is limited by his ability to appreciate the opposing side of an argument. It is this dichotomy which Jim tried to bridge. His favorite adage was, ``No information is bad information.'' He urged those around him to embrace knowledge as friendly even if it was not ``good'' news, because the only bad information is no information at all. Jim could and would play ``Devil's Advocate'' to advance another's understanding of the other side of an issue, to move groups toward agreement. He always sought a compromise because he believed that there should be no ``loser.'' The example he set is one we can all learn from.  It was Jim's sincere desire that each of us contribute the best of ourselves today in order to prepare California for a better tomorrow. Jim Mizell served his family, country and his community with distinction and honor and I am truly proud to have called him a friend.                          ____________________
