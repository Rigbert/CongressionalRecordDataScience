Chairman, I want people to truly appreciate Mr. Hobson's dedication as a member of not only this subcommittee, and as chairman for 4 years, but as a member of the Defense Subcommittee when there was a similar proposal several years ago and he thought it was the incorrect proposal. He stopped what I think was incorrect public policy from taking place. He saved the taxpayers of this country money.  And the only reason today I believe we have even a 20-30 proposition from the administration as far as downsizing the complex, that I find totally unsatisfactory but at least it is a proposal, is because of the work that Mr. Hobson did. And I thank him for that very much, and do ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
