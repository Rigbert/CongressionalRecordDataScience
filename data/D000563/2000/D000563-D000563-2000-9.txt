There was a mistake made in drafting the language. Regardless, the intent of the original legislation, and the intent that can still be interpreted from the law as enacted, is to have the Customs Service re-liquidate the entries at the antidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his guidance and appreciate working with him on a bipartisan basis.
