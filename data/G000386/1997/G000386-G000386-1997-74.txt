 GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Pension Tools Act of 1997. Why pension tools? Because this legislation contains the components, or tools that will assist pension participants and retirees to understand the fundamentals of their pension plans, get them to think about their retirement for the long term, and when problems arise--help put in place a cost-effective conflicts resolution process.  This legislation is very important to today's retirees and workers. In June, the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, convened a hearing which highlighted the growing problem of pension mistakes. That's right, Mr. President. A pension mistake. The problem addressed at the hearing did not target intentional wrongdoing--but honest mistakes by employers which can lead to a cut in a monthly pension payment or a lump-sum payment a worker takes when leaving a job.  It's impossible to determine how big the problem is, but it is a growing concern. To try to document how big the problem could be, I asked the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] to provide me with data about a program they administer called the standard termination audit program. The program audits a sample of plans which have terminated--these are not plans which have gone bankrupt. The PBGC released a letter to my committee which showed that certain pension payouts have errors in the range of 8 percent. That number has increased since the program started back in 1986 when it was 2 percent. Many of these errors involve substantial sums of money. In fact, one in three people who were shortchanged, were shortchanged by at least $1,000.  Other pension experts and advocates would put the number of mistakes at a higher rate--in the range of 15 to 20 percent. But we just can't say what the number is because none of the agencies who regulate pensions audit whether or not the pensions and lump-sum payments that are made to the majority of workers and retirees are usually accurate. Most employers are doing their best to pay the right amount but mistakes do happen. The problem is that people are not aware that they really need to verify that their pension payouts are the right amount.  The hearing called attention to that very problem. Too many workers lack a full understanding of how their pension works and how much their benefit will be until just before retirement.  It is my hope that this legislation will be a vital part of our effort to educate people about the need to prepare for retirement. One of the components of good retirement preparation is tracking your employer-provided pension and knowing your pension rights.  Specifically, this legislation will give employees the opportunity to have benefit statements sent to them on a regular basis. In addition, the legislation clarifies that pension plan participants and beneficiaries should have access to plan documents which show how their pension benefit was calculated. That way, they can check the math and verify that their benefit is correct.  My bill will also address two other problems raised at the hearing. First, one problem faced by pension participants and beneficiaries is that employers are slow to respond to their requests for information. To address that problem, we will authorize the Secretary of Labor to assess a fine if an employer fails or refuses to provide information in a timely manner. The other problem that this bill will address is to clarify that a person who has been cashed out of a plan can still get information from the plan administrator if a problem arises after the person separates from employment.  Senator Breaux and I are also including a directive to the Secretary of Labor to draft model procedures for alternative dispute resolution. The enforcement option open to pension participants now--a lawsuit--is simply too costly for many people who are living on a fixed income.  Part of the problem we see is that pensions are very complex. It is hard for employers to administer pensions even with the expert advice of paid pension consultants. I am continuing to seek ways to alleviate some of the pressure on employers. We have already taken the first step of asking the General Accounting Office to review the changes in the law since the passage of GATT--this had an impact on interest rates--one of the areas where we see the most problems in pension errors. We are also looking into the usefulness of mandating that employers provide a summary annual report of the pension plan to participants every year. These summary reports are not user-friendly and do not provide the participants with information in an accessible way. Benefit statements and the use of education and outreach may provide a substitute for the annual mailing of summary annual reports to pension participants.  I am also submitting for the Record two letters of support for the legislation. The first letter is from the Pension Rights Center here in Washington, DC. The center has a long history as an effective advocate for participant rights. The second letter was submitted by the American Society of Pension Actuaries. This group strongly supports the idea of automatic benefit statements and we will certainly work with them to clarify language in the legislation.  While great strides have been made since the act went into effect, participants and beneficiaries still lack access to basic but vital information and tools to enforce their rights. Having a pension can make all the difference to people once they retire. The Pension Tools Act strikes the right balance to get people useful information about their pensions and help them enforce basic rights to that information. I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of Senator Breaux and myself to ensure that retirees and workers get every penny they have earned when the time comes to retire.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               American Society of                                            Pension Actuaries,                                Arlington, VA, September 16, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: The American Society of Pension      Actuaries appreciates your efforts to ensure that plan      participants and beneficiaries have sufficient information      about their plan benefits. ASPA believes that better informed      participants will become more active participants.      Particularly, ASPA strongly supports your proposals to      provide for participant benefit statements and benefit      calculations. This invaluable information will allow plan      participants to more accurately plan for retirement.       We agree conceptually with the other proposals outlined in      the ``Summary of Pension Tools Act of 1997,'' which was      provided to us by your staff. However, we are unable to more      fully endorse the entire bill until we have had an      opportunity to review the detailed legislative language.      Further, we would like to alert you about two general      concerns we have pertaining to two of the proposals outlined.       First, one of the proposals would treat participants who      have been ``cashed out'' of the plan as ``active''      participants for purposes of obtaining information about the      plan as allowed under the Employee Retirement Income Security      Act. Although we appreciate the general objective underlying      this proposal, we are concerned if the proposal would allow,      for instance, a former participant to request a benefit      calculation after ten years. Such a request would be a      tremendous hardship on the plan sponsor or plan administrator      since in most cases such records are not retained for a long      period of time. We would suggest giving participants a fixed      period of time--such as 18 months after they have received      their benefits--to request this information.       Second, another proposal would require the Secretary of      Labor to develop model alternative dispute resolution      procedures. We agree that such procedures can often be a more      efficient means for resolving disputes, and we also agree      with your conclusion to give plans the option of choosing to      adopt such procedures. The summary further indicates that the      Secretary of Labor would formulate a list of neutral experts      to serve as mediators. We are concerned that such a list      would become politicized. Consequently, we would suggest as      an alternative that the Secretary of Labor be tasked with      simply maintaining the list and that any pension professional      meeting objective qualification requirements be permitted to      be listed.       We hope these comments are helpful and we look forward to      working with you and your staff toward passage of this      legislation.           Respectfully,                                             Brian H. Graff, Esq.,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                        Pension Rights Center,                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1997.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, Senate Dirksen Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to express the Pension      Rights Center's strong support for the Pension Tools Act of      1997. Your proposed legislation will help assure that      employees will receive accurate and timely information about      their future pension benefits. It will also give retirees the      opportunity to check the accuracy of plan calculations, and      develop an inexpensive forum where they can challenge      improper benefit denials.           Sincerely your,                                                Karen W. Ferguson,                                                         Director.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr.         Wellstone):  S. 1186. A bill to provide for education and training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.                the workforce investment partnership act  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I have spent the last few years examining our Federal job training programs. During this examination, it has become clear to me as well as many others, that these programs are in dire need of reform. The status quo is just plain unacceptable.  What we are faced with today is a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly focused programs administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack coordination, a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, and the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize these services--those seeking the training, and those businesses seeking to hire them. Despite spending billions of tax dollars each year on job training programs, most Federal agencies do not know how their programs work and if their programs are really helping people find jobs.  Here is what we do know. Today's job training system is no system at all--it is a complex patchwork of numerous rules, regulations, requirements, and overlapping bureaucratic responsibilities. As a result, programs are largely ineffective. Frustration and confusion is widespread throughout the system--by program administrators and employers, and most important, by those seeking assistance. People have difficulty knowing where to begin to look for training assistance because there are no clear points of entry and no clear paths from one program to another.  This is frustration at the breaking point.  Frustration to the point that business community participation, which is absolutely necessary for success, is waning.  Frustration to the point that community activists, again whose participation is absolutely necessary for success, are becoming disenchanted.  Frustration to the point that we have begun to question our commitment to job training.  Fragmentation, duplication, ineffectiveness, and frustration--these are the words that describe the current Federal job training apparatus. That is the status quo. That is unacceptable. That is largely why reform is needed now.  There are other important reasons why reform is necessary. The economic future of our country depends on a well-trained work force. I have heard from employers at every level who find it increasingly difficult to attract and find qualified employees for high-skilled, high-paying jobs as well as qualified entry level employees. If we are going to remain economically competitive, we must address this growing shortage of workers.  Reform also is needed if the welfare reform bill Congress passed last year is going to have any chance of succeeding. We need to provide States with the tools necessary to develop a comprehensive system to assist people make work, not welfare, their way of life.  To achieve all of these goals, job training is the key.  The bill that I introduce today with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone represents a bipartisan belief that we can do better and we can achieve these goals. We can replace the current system of frustration and provide a framework for success.  By removing or reforming outdated rules and regulations, we can remove the barriers that have stymied reform in the past. We can empower States to boldly move forward, transforming the current patchwork of programs into a comprehensive system to make it easier for all consumers seeking assistance to receive assistance.  Just like we did with welfare reform, job training reform is about recognizing the leadership of States that have shown innovation and initiative over the last few years, even in the midst of numerous Federal barriers and obstacles. It is about allowing them and encouraging them to continue with the innovations they have implemented without Federal reform legislation.  We can establish a framework for a system that provides consumer choice. Individuals seeking assistance should have a say in where, how, and what training they will receive. At the same time, the Federal bureaucracy should not engage in micro-management by mandating vouchers or any other specific local delivery system. This is a decision that belongs to the States and localities. This bill takes the opposite approach--it provides States and localities the flexibility to develop training programs that meet the real needs of those seeking training. It is to the consumer that these programs should be tailored to, not Washington.  We can establish an accountable system. Training programs must demonstrate their effectiveness to be certified as eligible programs. This means proving that training leads to meaningful, unsubsidized employment--showing how many people were placed, at what cost, and how many people remained employed 6 months to a year later. We owe this to the individuals seeking assistance and to the American taxpayers who pays for these programs.  We can establish a framework that not only allows for business community involvement, but business community leadership. The private sector must outline their employment needs and assist in the design of training programs.  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act incorporates all of these principles. The programs incorporated in the legislation include job training, vocational education, and adult education. Additionally, it provides strong, mandatory linkages to welfare to work, Wagner-Peyser, Job Corps, Older Americans, Vocational Rehabilitation, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, veterans, Trade Adjustment Assistance, as well as other training related programs.  While separate funding streams will be maintained for each of the activities, in recognition of their function, States and localities will be empowered with the tools and the flexibility to implement real reform in order to provide comprehensive services to those seeking assistance.  Under this bill, States will have the ability to submit a unified plan for all of the programs incorporated in and linked to this legislation to the appropriate Secretary describing how they will coordinate services in order to avoid duplication.  Statewide and local partnerships, led by the business community, will be established to assist in the development of such a plan, set policy for training, and generally advise the appropriate elected official overseeing the system.  At the local level, all services provided must be accessible through a one stop customer service system. Consumers, both employers and job seekers seeking assistance, will be able to receive comprehensive information regarding the availability, eligibility,and quality of the programs. With this kind of system, we can remove the confusion and frustration inherent in the current programs.  Finally, training will be delivered under a framework of an individual training account which will be used to ensure the principle of consumer choice. The specific nature of the individuals training account will be determined by States and localities.  In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone, as well as the other members of the Subcommittee of Employment and Training for their cooperation and dedication in developing a piece of legislation that moves us forward. This has been a bipartisan effort from Day One. I believe that level of cooperation and leadership is essential if we are to have a chance to pass real reform.  There have been a number of orgnizations--both public and private--who have participated in an open and constructive process used to develop this legislation. Their input has been vital.  Again, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to address and reform the Federal Government's role in providing job training assistance to Americans. For too long, that role has been to foster confusion, frustration and complication. With this bill, we offer a new foundation, and a positive framework for success. Instead of rules that tie the hands of States and localities, this bill provides the tools to empower them to develop comprehensive work force investment systems that address the needs of job seekers and employers. This bill is a road map to a better system, and if we are to achieve the goals we have set--a stronger economy, a better-trained work force, and welfare reform--we need to begin that journey today.
