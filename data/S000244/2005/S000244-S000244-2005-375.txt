Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman this is a gutting amendment. It is a gutting amendment because it removes the constitutional hook that this Congress and the Federal Government have to prevent the abuses that have been sanctioned by Kelo, and that is the Federal funds that have been used for economic development.  The amendment strikes out all the penalty in the bill that would prevent the government officials from abusing eminent domain. No penalty, no tap on the wrist. We say you should not do it; but if you go ahead and do it, then you are not going to be penalized. Without these penalties in the bill, the government could take private property from one person and simply give it to a wealthy corporation. Because this amendment guts the entire bill, it ought to be opposed.  Under this legislation, there is a clear connection between the Federal funds that would be denied and the abuse that Congress is intending to prevent. The policy is that States and localities that abuse their eminent domain power by using economic development as a rationale for a taking should not be trusted with Federal economic development funds that could contribute to similarly abusive land grabs.  There is an entirely appropriate connection in the base bill between the Federal policy of protecting private property rights from eminent domain abuse and making sure that the Federal Government does not subsidize eminent domain abusers. The amendment should be defeated for these reasons.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
