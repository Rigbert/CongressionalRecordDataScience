There was nothing in this description here, from the agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was different than the interrogation rules of engagement which had already been spelled out--already spelled out.  So here is what we have. A letter sent to General Ryder almost a year ago, released under the Freedom of Information Act, with specifics related to the interrogation of prisoners which are consistent with the very rules of interrogation which Secretary Rumsfeld had approved in a memo.  So I do not believe that coming to the floor and disclosing this information is an element of surprise. The administration has known it for almost a year. I do not believe there is any question of falsification. The document was presented under the Freedom of Information Act. And it certainly is not, sadly, beyond the realm of possibility because the very techniques that were described in here were the techniques approved by the administration.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time of the Senator has expired.
