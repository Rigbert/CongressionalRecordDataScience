 Former President Bill Clinton said to a gathering of Senators, I am prepared to testify before that commission. I am prepared to cooperate with them completely. If there was any shortcoming or failing in my administration, so be it. It is more important that the American people know that we have done everything in our power to make this a safer nation.  That should be the attitude of all Members. We should swallow our political pride and say this is not about partisanship. If an error was made by any President, Democrat or Republican, which has put us in harm's way or endangered America's security, don't we deserve to know that? The fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee has drawn a line and said they are not going to even ask the question as to whether the intelligence was misused by any member of the Bush administration tells me they are being politically protective. They are protecting the political interests of the White House instead of the paramount concern, which should be protecting the American people.  I hope, frankly, there is an independent commission that asks hard questions of those in the Clinton administration and President George W. Bush's administration and any administration that might have some bearing on the intelligence capacity of America and on the protection of this great Nation. I thank the Senators who joined in on this important issue.                          ____________________
