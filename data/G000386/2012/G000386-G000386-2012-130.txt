 President, today I wish to honor the life of LTC Robert B. Shain, who passed away on Sunday, April 29, 2012. I would like to express my condolences to Lieutenant Colonel Shain's family, in particular his wife of 52 years, Sherry, his two daughters, Cynthia and Stephanie, his son, Michael, and his three grandkids, Bella, Jason, and Mia. He is also survived by his sister-in-law, Nancy, and many nieces and nephews.  Robert Shain had an honorable and extensive career which began upon his graduation from the Military Academy at West Point in 1959. He served in the US Army for 20 years as an infantry officer as well as a fixed-wing and helicopter pilot. He completed two tours of duty in Vietnam and was awarded the Legion of Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Bronze Stars, 27 Air Medals with V for valor, Meritorious Service Medal, Vietnamese Medal of Honor, and Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He served as commander of the Executive Flight Detachment and pilot of the presidential helicopter,Army One, for presidents Nixon and Ford from 1973 to 1976.  Following his retirement, he enjoyed a long professional career in the aeronautics industry. He was an active supporter of the National Rifle Association and a member of the Military Officers Association. However, I understand that his greatest joy in life was spending time with his loving family.  Bob Shain lived every aspect of his life whether service to his country, to his family, or to his business with unrivaled pride and dignity. The career of Lieutenant Colonel Shain serves as a reminder of the sacrifice and commitment that has carried our great nation through the toughest of times. His service to the people of the United States and the State of Iowa is worthy of much admiration and respect. I am grateful for his service and pay tribute to his patriotism.                          ____________________
