I know Senator Lieberman joins me in commending the Senator from Delaware for his active participation in our hearings. I believe the Senator from Delaware, as the Senator from Minnesota, made an extraordinary effort to be there, to question the witnesses, and all of us now quote the Senator from Delaware in various places and occasions, in reminding our colleagues that:       The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.  Those words have become inexorably linked to the debate on intelligence reform. We thank the Senator for that as well.
