 President, despite the previous stock option alternative in minimum tax relief enacted earlier, the IRS is still after the Speltz family. In fact, this past June, Ron and June received a notice from the IRS announcing their intent to levy certain assets. After stating that the IRS intends to levy any State tax refunds, the notice continued: ``In addition, we will begin to search for other assets we may levy.''  I think anyone would be terrified to receive something such as this in the mail, especially when the outstanding liability derives from income never actually realized, and Congress has already decided that it shouldn't happen.  In July, I sent a letter with 26 of my colleagues in the Senate and the House to IRS Commissioner Shulman asking that he use the discretion provided to him by effective tax administration to suspend collection efforts to collect incentive stock option alternative minimum tax liabilities in order to give us a chance to fix this problem once and for all. Commissioner Shulman gave us that chance by agreeing that the IRS would not undertake any collection enforcement action through the end of the fiscal year.
