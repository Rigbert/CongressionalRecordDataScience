Chairman, I came to Congress at the same time as Amo Houghton. I think Congress is diminished by his departure. He was a gentleman. He was a rare spirit who was willing to stand up for what he thought was right even when he had to confront leaders on the other side, whether it was his own party or leaders on our side of the aisle. He spoke from his conscience and I think represented his district well.  I just had the pleasure and opportunity to be with him again last weekend with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) to do the reenactment of the March For Bloody Sunday over the Pettus Bridge; and as usual, Amo was there in heart and spirit, and it was wonderful to see him again. So I am wholeheartedly in support of this; and I think everyone will be in support of that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).
