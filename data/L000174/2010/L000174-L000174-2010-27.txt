President, on November 19, 2010, the Senate passed the Bankruptcy Technical Corrections Act of 2010. This legislation makes many important technical changes to our bankruptcy laws.  Yesterday, on December 16, the House of Representatives passed this legislation again, with an amendment from the Senate. Senator Whitehouse, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, along with Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith of the House Judiciary Committee should be commended for their attention to these issues.  This bipartisan legislation makes numerous technical corrections to the Bankruptcy Code. These revisions are needed as the result in part of the major reforms that took place in 2005. Given the breadth of the 2005 reforms, and the highly technical nature of the code, it was not unexpected that some additional congressional action was needed to make some needed adjustments. Although purely technical, these changes will assist practitioners and judges adjudicate cases under the code more efficiently, and with a savings of judicial resources.  At a time in the United States when Americans are struggling under severe economic conditions and with millionsof Americans having lost their homes or in danger of foreclosure, it is especially important for the Bankruptcy Code to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.  I thank all Senators for their support of this legislation.                          ____________________
