  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will make some additional remarks which are so compelling, and as soon as the Senator from Kentucky desires, I will yield so that we can proceed with this vote. I know the Senator from Kentucky is very interested in concluding this legislation, as are the rest of us. Given the conditions in the world today, I argue this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will consider in the Senate.  Yesterday there was an article in the New York Times, parts of which I think are important to note.  It is titled ``Missile Test By North Korea: Dark Omen for Washington.'' Part of the article says:       The officials and arms experts said the test also suggested      that North Korea had made real progress towards building      Taepodong-2, which is reportedly capable of traveling 2,400      to 3,600 miles and could strike targets throughout Asia and      as far away as Alaska.       Henry D. Sokolski, the executive director of the      Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, said      the ability to build rockets in stages opened the door to      intercontinental missiles, which in theory have virtually      unlimited range.       ``We're entering a new era,'' Mr. Sokolski said.       Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on      Nuclear Arms Control, another research organization in      Washington, said the missile test was ``a clear sign'' of      North Korea's intent to develop nuclear weapons, despite its      1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for      energy assistance.       Mr. Milhollin said a two-stage missile was too costly to      build simply for delivering conventional weapons. ``It means      they plan to put a nuclear warhead on it or export it to      somebody who will,'' he said. ``The missile makes no sense      otherwise.''  Mr. President, these are important statements. Some argue that perhaps the North Koreans are just simply building a missile and they are not pursuing the acquisition of nuclear weapons.  As Mr. Milhollin said, it doesn't make sense. Why else would they be building a two-stage rocket without planning also to have that missile armed with a weapon of mass destruction?--from what we have seen in the past, most likely a nuclear weapon.  I don't want to go through the litany of my complaints about this agreement that was made with North Korea in 1994. I spoke at length on the floor of the Senate and with the media. I did not see any indication that the North Koreans were serious. I did see indications they were in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which they were signatories and that we were basically providing them with a bribe. I also believed and still believe that unless the North Koreans understand they have to pay a significant price, then they will continue in this most destabilizing activity.  The Florida Times Union on August 28 said:       An argument could be made that Pyongyang feels it must      renew its nuclear program to keep people warm, but it also      claims it cannot feed its people and has been begging      successfully for free rice. If it doesn't have enough money      to feed its people, how can it have enough money to build      expensive nuclear facilities and two-stage rockets? Pyongyang      presumably is taking money that would have been spent on food      and heat if not for western charity in building a nuclear      arsenal.       Unfortunately, the administration made it easy for      Pyongyang to cheat. The agreement does not require      inspections to verify North Korean compliance. Oddly enough,      Pyongyang threatened earlier this month to pull out of the      agreement over the U.S. failure to lift economic sanctions      quickly enough. It has also complained about the lack of      progress toward diplomatic ties. Those sound more like      excuses to me for cheating on an agreement rather than      reasons to break it. Not once since its inception in the      aftermath of World War II has North Korea proven itself      trustworthy. That makes it difficult for the United States to      continue making agreements based purely on trust.  Mr. Hoagland, probably one of the most respected, if not the most respected, individual commentators on the issues of national security, said:       The U.S.-negotiated agreement that froze North Korea's      nuclear weapons development in 1994 is coming apart.       With their economy in trouble, South Korea and Japan have      been having second thoughts about the high levels of economic      aid the deal mandates, and Congress has always been unhappy      about the fuel oil shipments the administration agreed to      make without congressional consultation. These concerns were      undermining the accord even before the discovery this month      that North Korea has been working on an underground secret      facility that almost certainly violates the accord.       That discovery could be the nail in the coffin of the      agreement, which pulled North Korea and the United States      back from a military confrontation that could soon resume.  Mr. President, Mr. Charles Krauthammer, a man whom I have great respect for, also wrote on August 30:       Consider North Korea. In 1994, it broke the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty and embarked on nuke building. How did      Clinton react? By agreeing to supply North Korea indefinitely      with free oil while the United States and allies build for it      two brand new (ostensibly safer) $5 billion nuclear reactors      in return for a promise to freeze its weapon program.       Now it turns out that while taking this gigantic bribe      North Korea was building a huge new nuclear facility inside a      mountain. The administration, inert and dismayed by such      ungentle manliness, refuses to call this a violation of the      agreement. Why? Because concrete has not been poured.  Today the Los Angeles Times editorial reads, ``Time to Rethink North Korea Policy'':       If ever there was a time for Washington to reappraise its      policy toward North Korea, it is now. In the midst of      meetings between American and North Korean negotiators in New      York, the Pyongyang regime fired a new, longer-range missile      across the Sea of Japan and over the Japanese mainland. That      provocative act constitutes a major setback in diplomatic      efforts to draw hostile North Korea into the world community.       The missile was discussed at Monday's meeting in New York,      which focused on implementation of a 1994 accord under which     the United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union      would help North Korea build two nuclear power reactors of no      military use in exchange for a freeze on nuclear weapons      development. U.S. representatives did not say Monday what, if      any, explanation was given by Pyongyang. On Tuesday, North      Korea declined to meet.                           *   *   *   *   *       U.S officials, curiously, said they were not surprised by      the test and had warned of it in advance. Military analysts      pointed to the range capability that North Korea has now      shown and said that chemical, biological and even nuclear      warheads could be put on such a missile. The test came only a      few weeks after U.S. intelligence satellites uncovered      activity at a huge, supposedly shuttled nuclear facility.       Perhaps Pyongyang fired the missile as a ploy to get      Washington to fully deliver on its pledge to provide 500,000      tons of fuel oil this year as part of the reactor deal. If      so, the tactic has backfired. Members of Congress who had      balked at paying for the fuel now are irate.       North Korea may have also been advertising its missile to      other renegade nations. Military sales are one of the few      money-making ventures left for the impoverished country,      which has been warning that it may have to restart its      nuclear weapons program. The episode smacks of blackmail, not      diplomacy. All the more reason for the Clinton administration      to reconsider its long, patient persuasion of Pyongyang.  Mr. President, on July 8, 1998, Secretary of State Albright said:       Regional security is another matter on which dialogue with      Beijing has enhanced cooperation and fostered progress. For      example, the People's Republic of China has consistently      supported the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Korea's      dangerous nuclear weapons program, and has urged the North to      continue complying with it.  Secretary Albright said, on March 4, 1998:       Our request this year includes $35 million for the Korean      Energy Development Organization. The Agreed Framework has      succeeded in freezing North Korea's dangerous nuclear      program. Now it has begun that program one step at a time--     having secured over 90% of the program's spent fuel, which      represents several bombs' worth of weapons-grade plutonium      after reprocessing.  Secretary Albright, on February 10, 1998:       We believe our FY99 budget request for $35 million for KEDO      is both necessary and justified to maintain U.S. leadership      within KEDO, ensure that KEDO continues to fulfill its      important mission, and secure continued DPRK compliance with      its nonproliferation obligations under the U.S. DPRK Agreed      Framework.  She said, on February 12, 1997:       Let me just say this is obviously a very complex subject,      but I believe that the framework agreement is one of the best      things that the administration has done because it stopped a      nuclear weapons program in North Korea.  Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal on Friday, August 21, said North Korea's nukes--       In essence, what was signed in 1994 was an arms-control      agreement that suffered from the central flaws common to all      such efforts: Even when verification is possible--and in this      case it was specifically excluded--there is no way to enforce      compliance. More to the point, there is no will to enforce      it. So much effort and face and prestige goes into getting      these deals signed that when something goes wrong, nobody      wants to admit it.                           *   *   *   *   *       North Korea is different only because Pyongyang openly      conducts foreign policy through blackmail. Earlier this year,      it threatened to resume its nuclear weapons program and      declared it would keep selling missiles to clients like Iran      and Iraq unless the U.S. lifted economic sanctions. It also      has demanded more fuel oil and more food for its hungry      population. A group of U.S. Congressmen in North Korea for a      whirlwind official famine tour this week came away convinced      that millions are near starvation and hundreds of thousands      of others have already died of hunger. As terrible as this      is, it is all the more horrifying when you consider that the      Stalinist regime is spending what little money it does have      building long-range missiles that will be able to hit the      United States, according to a commission appointed by the      U.S. Congress. Or on that giant new underground complex where      nuclear weapons production was ``frozen'' in 1994.       It may turn out that the complex is not a nuclear-weapons      plant after all. Even so, the administration's timely      retaliation in Afghanistan and the Sudan will have two      beneficial effects. It will signal the North Koreans that      America's patience is not unlimited, and that consequently      they may wish to rethink their current strategy of trying to      blackmail the U.S. into coughing up more aid by playing the      nuclear card.  Mr. President, the fact is that no one understands North Korea. No one understands what goes on inside that Orwellian country. And it is impossible to predict what the thinking is that would cause them to have a delegation in New York supposedly in serious negotiations and at the same time launch this two-stage missile. I cannot imagine the reaction of the American people if a foreign country launched a missile one stage of which hit on one side of Florida and the other one hit on the other side of Florida.  Mr. President, I think the American people would be incredulous and greatly disturbed over such an event. Well, that is what the North Koreans just did vis-a-vis Japan, a country that had pledged to provide the bulk of several billion dollars worth of construction of a nuclear powerplant.  This is a serious situation. Obviously, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them is one of the greatest challenges we face in this post-cold war era. We have to bring this threat to a halt. I hope that the administration, as the Los Angeles Times recommends, rethinks the North Korean policy. In the meantime, we cannot continue to fund any program that would provide any encouragement as well as financial assistance to a country that clearly has time after time after time broken its word and has committed acts of provocation and aggression.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. But, Mr. President, before I do that, I want to say that I would like to move this amendment as soon as possible, and hope that we can do so. I yield the floor.
