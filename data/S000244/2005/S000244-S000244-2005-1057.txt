Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1760 to designate the postal facility at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in Madison, Wisconsin, as the ``Robert M. La Follette, Sr. Post Office Building.''  A man of the people, Bob La Follette captured the hearts and minds of Wisconsin's citizens and rose to a place of distinction in the history of my State and this Nation. His storied political career began as a Republican when he was elected District Attorney of Dane County in 1880.  ``Fighting Bob,'' as he would become known, served right here in the House of Representatives from 1885 to 1891. Although he was defeated for re-election in 1890, Fighting Bob returned to his law practice and demonstrated the resilience for which he developed a sterling reputation.  After two failed attempts for the Governorship, La Follette was elected Wisconsin's twentieth Governor in 1990. During his three terms as Governor in the early 1900's, La Follette led the State out of debt and earned a reputation as a skilled orator and a champion of the people.  Fighting Bob returned to Washington in 1906 following his election to the U.S. Senate, where he served until his death in 1925 at 70 years of age. It is no accident that one of my State's two statues prominently displayed in Statuary Hall is dedicated to ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette. He served Wisconsin and the United States honorably. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Bob La Follette by supporting this resolution.
