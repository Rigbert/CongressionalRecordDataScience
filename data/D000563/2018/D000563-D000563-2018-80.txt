President, I agree with Senator Portman on stitching together this new statutory authority with existing managed care and waiver authorities to elongate patients' lengths of stay, as medically appropriate. I would once again like to thank all of my colleagues, including Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, Chairman Alexander, and Ranking Member Murray, for their help in getting this important policy across the finish line.
