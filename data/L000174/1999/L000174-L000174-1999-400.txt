President, as thousands of Kosovar Albanians flood across the Macedonian and Albanian borders, we are getting the first reports of refugee landmine victims. Last week, two refugees were killed and another seriously injured as they hurried to return to their homes in Kosovo.  Just put this in perspective. Some 25 people have been injured or killed by mines in Kosovo since the refugees began returning. It is a senseless loss of life and it is tragic, but it is predictable. It is predictable because tens of thousands of landmines were left behind by Serb forces. Others were put there by the KLA. They litter fields, roads, and bridges, and they have even been left in houses. They have been left in booby traps. As sad as anything, there are mass graves marking the atrocities that have occurred there. And as family members go back to try to find out if their loved ones are in those graves, even some of the graves have been booby-trapped by landmines.  These landmines are the greatest threat to people on the ground, including NATO forces, and the number of innocent victims--children playing, farmers plowing their fields, women walking along the roads--will continue to rise.  It is one thing to conduct an air war with the latest laser-guided technology and, thankfully, there were no NATO casualties, but it is another thing to face an invisible enemy on the ground. In Bosnia, most U.S. casualties were from landmines. In Kosovo, too, mines are the invisible enemy. They can't distinguish between friend or foe, soldier or civilian, adult or child.  A June 15 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled, ``A Strategy on Land Mines is Needed Now,'' described the problems mines pose in Kosovo, and they called on the international community to develop a comprehensive strategy for clearing the mines and aiding the victims.  Such a strategy is critical to promoting peace and moving forward with reconstruction and economic development. The United States, as the leader of NATO, will play a key role in designing and financing that strategy.  But the article neglects to address another key part of the problem--the continued use of mines. It is a bit similiar to trying to keep garbage out of a river. You can clean up the garbage, but if people keep dumping it into the river, you haven't solved the problem. You need to stop garbage from being dumped. We need to stigmatize antipersonnel mines so they arenot put into the ground in the first place by anybody, by any country, by any combatant, by anyone anywhere.  That is what most countries are trying to do. Now, 135 countries have signed the Ottawa Convention that bans the use of antipersonnel mines, and 81 countries have ratified it. That convention sets a new international norm outlawing a weapon that has caused enormous suffering of innocent people in some 70 countries.  Like booby traps, which are also outlawed, mines are triggered by the victim. They are inherently indiscriminate and the casualties are usually noncombatants.  Unfortunately, the most powerful Nation on earth, the United States, has not joined the convention. So despite the leading role the United States has taken in demining and helping victims, we, like Russia, China, and some other countries that manufacture mines, are standing in the way of the effort to outlaw this weapon.  Ironically, every member of NATO, except the United States and Turkey, has signed the Ottawa Convention. We not only weaken the convention by our absence, we also complicate joint military operations with our NATO allies.  Now, the United States can send deminers, those who remove the mines. We can give millions of dollars in aid to mine victims. The Leahy War Victims Fund does that every year in the sum of many millions of dollars. We can sit down with other nations to rebuild as many countries as there are conflicts. But the truth is, the only effective strategy to stop the carnage caused by landmines has three parts: Demining, victims assistance, and most importantly, banning their use today, tomorrow, and forever. That is what the Ottawa Convention does. Unless countries such as the United States, Russia, Pakistan, India, and China join, they invite others to keep using mines. It is in Kosovo today but somewhere else tomorrow.  The United States is not causing the landmine problem, but the United States is blocking a total solution because, without us, there is no solution.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Los Angeles Times article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 15, 1999]                 A Strategy on Land Mines Is Needed Now          (By Robert Oakley, Lori Helene Gronich, Ted Sahlin)       Tens of thousands of land mines will be left behind as Serb      forces withdraw from Kosovo, and nobody has a long-term plan      for removing them. The international community must begin      work together now to develop an integrated approach or      prospects for peace and economic recovery in Kosovo will be      thwarted.       Knowledge about the relationship between land mine      problems, peace settlements and rebuilding shattered      communities is scarce. Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq and      the stabilization of affairs in Bosnia are experiences that      can help shape effective planning for Kosovo. In northern      Iraq, there were recognizable phases to the refugee      operation. First, the military entered and secured the area.      Mines were removed from refugee reception zones and core      transportation routes. Then, international relief      organizations came forward and restarted their local      operations.       But the next step--taking these mines out of the ground--     did not take place. Despite the valuable mine location      information provided by area residents and some international      relief workers, land mines were treated as an acceptable, if      pernicious, danger to the population. Wise planners will      include the accounts of local residents and international aid      workers in Kosovo.       Large-scale mine removal normally occurs when the threat of      violence has receded, armed forces have departed, and local      governance has been restored. National and international      organizations then work with local leaders to develop long-     term aid plans and mine-removal programs.       In Bosnia, soldiers and civilians alike were aware of the      land mine threat. Allied military forces, after several      fatalities and traumatic injuries, made land mine awareness      among the troops a high priority. These troops, however,      primarily removed mines when it was necessary for force      protection. International companies, local contractors and      local forces tackled the larger mine problem, and they are      still at work today. Not only do they compete for funding,      they influence priorities as well. This is not a      comprehensive master plan.       All five components of mine action--awareness; surveying,      mapping and marking; removal; destruction; and victim      assistance--should be an integral part of any comprehensive      international operation. First, all minefield information      must be given immediately to allied leaders. Should any of      the combatants have only incomplete or inaccurate mine      records, their soldiers should show the entering forces      just where the mines have been placed. This will save      lives. It was not done in Bosnia, and it exacted a high      price. Human suffering remains, and economic output is      still less than half of what it was in 1990.       In the initial phase of the Kosovo peace, international      military forces will clear mines to protect themselves and      allow for the necessary freedom of movement to accomplish      their mission. This mine-clearing effort should also support      the rapid return of refugees and the swift resumption of      local commerce. Military mine-clearing and mine-awareness      training should be supplemented by mine-awareness education      for refugees and internally displaced persons. Assuring      adequate medical supplies and attention for mine casualties      should be a high priority.       Once the initial phase of a Kosovo deployment is completed,      the international protection force is likely to limit and      then stop its mine-clearance work. Civilian groups must then      take over. International experts often are brought in to help      training local residents in mine safety and removal. Local      security forces can also be trained and equipped to      participate. Despite the widespread belief that mine      clearance is an integral part of post-conflict peace-     building, economic revitalization and sustainable      development, there is no agreed model for addressing or even      coordinating these different needs and roles.       If the work in Kosovo is to be effective, international      planners must develop a comprehensive strategy now.      Otherwise, the fighting may cease, but the casualties will go      on.
