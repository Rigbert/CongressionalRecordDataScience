 GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. There is a bill we will be discussing later this year called McCain-Feingold, which seeks, in this Senator's judgment, to essentially shut down legislative-advocacy-type independent expressions and to make almost impossible the ability of outside groups to engage in independent expenditures.  My question to my friend from Washington is, given the fact that we have bills that go that far now, given this authority under this constitutional amendment to set ``reasonable limits,'' is it not possible that Congress might decide such expenditures should be shut down entirely, that there is nothing reasonable about them, and that those voices should be quieted altogether?
