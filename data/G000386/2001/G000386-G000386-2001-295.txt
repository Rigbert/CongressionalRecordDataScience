 President, this amendment delays the tax cuts until a certain level of funding for education is met. Everybody knows that education is a top priority of this Congress, as well as of President Bush. Hopefully, we will finish a major education reform bill this week in the Senate.  This tax bill contains over $30 billion of education tax incentives. There is no reason to delay other tax relief to accomplish something outside the jurisdiction of this bill.  I believe there is a germaneness issue here, so I ask the pending amendment be found not to be germane to the provisions of the reconciliation measure. I raise a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
