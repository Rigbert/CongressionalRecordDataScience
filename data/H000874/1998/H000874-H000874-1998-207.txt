Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. There is going to be a special order on behalf of my very good friend, Terry Sanford, led by the gentleman from North Carolina. Unfortunately, I cannot stay, but I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania giving me this opportunity to ask unanimous consent that my remarks be included in the record immediately following the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina.  Mr. Sanford, Governor Sanford, was a very close friend of mine. I was one of those young people that came into politics when he was one of our most significant leaders. He was the governor of North Carolina.  He was a courageous governor of North Carolina at a difficult time and brought great credit to his State and great credit to our Nation. And I am pleased to join my friends from North Carolina in honoring this courageous, committed American who, as I said, brought great credit to North Carolina, brought great credit to his country, and was a human being who represented the very best that America had to offer.  I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for giving me that opportunity.                          ____________________
