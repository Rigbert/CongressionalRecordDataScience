Speaker, because I am concerned about the number of railroad crossing accidents in northwest Indiana, today I am introducing legislation that will provide a more effective method of targeting available Federal funds to enhance safety at our most dangerous highway rail grade crossings. I am introducing this legislation with our colleague, Mr. Hostettler, and the entire Indiana congressional delegation, in a bipartisan effort to improve rail safety. This bill, the Highway Rail Grade Crossing Safety Formula Enhancement Act of 1996, which is the companion bill to legislation introduced in the Senate by Indiana's Senators, Richard Lugar and Dan Coats, is similar to legislation I introduced in the 103d Congress (H.R. 4855). This bill would improve the Federal funding formula to account for risk factors that identify which States have significant grade crossing safety problems. The factors considered in the bill include a State's share of the national total for public highway-rail grade crossings, its number of crossings with passive warning devices, and its total number of accidents and fatalities caused by vehicle-train collisions at crossings.  Under the proposed funding formula established by my bill, Indiana's share of rail crossing safety construction funds would increase by an estimated 33 percent annually, from $4.9 million to $6.6 million. In 1994, Indiana ranked sixth in the Nation for number of grade crossings--6,788--third for grade crossing accidents--263--and fifth for fatalities, 27. For the current fiscal year, Indiana received 3.4 percent of section 130 safety construction funding, while accounting for 6.1 percent of the Nation's accidents, 5.9 percent of fatalities, and 4 percent of crossings.  Currently, in the United States, several hundred people are killed and thousands more injured every year as a result of vehicle-train collisions at highway rail grade crossings. A significant number of these accidents occur in rail-intensive States, such as Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, California, and Texas. One quarter of the Nation's 168,000 public highway rail grade crossings are located in these five States. They accounted for 38 percent of deaths and 32 percent of injuries caused by vehicle-train collisions nationwide during 1991-93. Overall, about 24 States would receive an increase in section 130 funds for grade crossing improvements under my legislation.  Maximizing the return from Federal funds requires that they be targeted to areas with the greatest risk, like Indiana. In a 1995 report to Congress on the status of efforts to improve railroad crossing safety, the General Accounting Office [GAO] found anomalies among the States in terms of the funds they received in proportion to three key factors: accidents, fatalities, and total crossings.  Through this bill, we have a unique opportunity to maximize existing resources, improve safety at rail crossings, and save lives. The establishment of a new funding formula is an innovative step in that direction and will directly benefit northwest Indiana, which bears the lion's share of rail traffic in Indiana. By targeting funds to States based on accident rates and number of rail crossings, we can put scarce resources to work and use a common sense approach by allocating Federal dollars where the need is greatest.  Given the limited resources available for railroad crossing safety, it is crucial that available funds be targeted to the most cost-effective approaches. The first means to target our limited resources is to change the current method used to apportion section 130 dollars to the States. The legislation I am introducing today will accomplish that. I urge you and all of my House colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
