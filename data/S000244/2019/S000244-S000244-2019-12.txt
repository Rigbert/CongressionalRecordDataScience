Thousands of Americans from across our great country have made the pilgrimage to Washington to stand up for the protection of unborn children.  Ever since the Supreme Court's reprehensible ruling in Roe vs. Wade, the barbaric practice of abortion on demand has been rampant in our nation. Too often people erroneously conflate abortion with women's health care, presenting a false choice of caring for women or protecting life. It is possible to do both.  I stand firmly with the millions of Americans who believe that we must protect the lives of innocent children. I have long been a staunch advocate for pro-life issues. During my tenure as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I shepherded the ban on partial-birth abortion through Congress. It was one of my greatest honors to watch President George W. Bush sign it into law. I have fully supported every effort in Congress to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortions--both in the United States and abroad--and will continue to fight efforts to reverse this practice. I am inspired by all who have traveled to Washington to participate in the March for Life, especially those from Wisconsin, and am grateful for all who believe that every life is precious and must be protected.                          ____________________
