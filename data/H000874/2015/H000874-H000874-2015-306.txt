Speaker, I submit the following:                    remarks by peggy wallace kennedy       Montgomery, Alabama, a city that bears the scars of      struggle and the nobility of change. A city that sits on the      soil of shared sorrows for those that suffered and died for      equality. A place of repose. Monuments of stone that connect      us to each other. A place of hope and promise. A place to lay      our grief down and shoulder the burden of moving beyond the      sunset of despair to the place we call home.       All of us come to this moment and to this place on the road      of our own life's personal journey. We are diverse, both in      our experiences and our aspirations and our dreams. But we      are united in the common belief that a vision for a Just      America is worth the saving.       Stepping away from a painful past has not always been easy,      but it has always been right. None of us can be held      responsible for the circumstances of our birth, but each one      of us will be held responsible for who we have become.       When my son Burns was young, my husband and I took him to      the Martin Luther King Historic Site in Atlanta. As we moved      through the exhibits we came across the photographs of fire      hoses in Birmingham, the 16th Street Baptist Church, Governor      Wallace standing in the Schoolhouse Door and the Edmund      Pettus Bridge.       Burns stood still as the truth of his family's past washed      over him. He turned to me and asked, `Why did Paw Paw' do      those things to other people? I realized that at that moment      I was at a crossroad in my life and the life of my son. The      mantle had passed, and it was now up to me to do for Burns      what my father never did for me. It was the first step in my      journey of building a legacy of my own. I knelt down beside      my son, drew him close and said, `Paw Paw never told me why      he did those things, but I know that he was wrong. So maybe      it will just have to be up to me and you to help make things      right.'       Standing here before you today is yet another day for the      fulfillment of the promise that I made to my son. For today      and for all the tomorrows to come there are opportunities for      all of us to raise the call for justice in our lifetime.       Montgomery, Alabama, Dexter Avenue and the State Capitol      are enshrined in the annals of American history. A historic      place for historic times. But for me, it is much more      personal, for it brings to mind the events that shaped my      life.       It was here that I attended four inaugurations of my father      and one of my mother.       It was here that I heard my father say the words      ``segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation      forever.''       It was here that my father fought to support a culture of      exclusion, riding on the wings of fear rather than seeking      justice on the wings of eagles.       It was here that my mother Governor Lurleen Wallace lay in      state following her death at the age of 41 while thousands of      Alabamians both white and African American stood in line for      hours to pay their last respects.       It was here that my father met Vivian Malone for the second      time and told her that she was an icon of the civil right      movement.       It was at the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Church that my      father went to ask for forgiveness for his racist past. A      moment that could not rewrite his personal history but an      opportunity brought about by my father's own suffering that      allowed him to see the hurt of history in the eyes of African      American men and women who had been denied the right to live      the American Dream.       But on March the 25th of 1965, as Ralph Abernathy, Juanita      Abernathy, Martin Luther King and thousands more gathered in      the shadow of this Capitol, there was never an opportunity to      address their concerns or state their grievances to the one      person who could have changed the course of American History      then and there. For Governor Wallace watched through a window      in the privacy of his office, while others persevered and      changed the history of America without him.       Today, we must not allow others to make the right choices      for us. We must have courage each day to stand up for      equality and the rights of all Americans. We must lead by      example and live our lives with inspiration, always aspiring      to make the choices that lead us to higher ground, that      guides us to understanding and purpose of not just who we are      but who we can become. An opportunity for each of you, an      obligation for all of us, to see others, feel others and      celebrate others, respecting their humanity for who they are.       Working each day to inspire the nobility that lies in the      heart of each of us, Martin Luther King taught that there is      power in all of us to reach out, to support and stand firm in      the belief that all of our lives count for something. There      is no better time than now for Americans to hold hands,      rather than holding down, the inherent rights of the common      man.       One can never measure the true worth of a mended heart that      beats again because someone cared. How many more      anniversaries of the struggle for civil rights can we      celebrate by looking over our shoulder rather than standing      shoulder to shoulder to face the challenges that lay ahead?      How can Americans reach for higher ground if we do not      inspire others with what we do? We cannot expect the next      generation of Americans to do something to change the world,      if we aspire to do nothing to protect liberty and recognize      our individual obligations to service.       How can we teach future generations about positive social      change if we see injustice and turn our backs? For injustice      knows no death. It rises like a dark mist on the horizon,      laying low in the hearts of those that are unwilling to      accept the notion of unconditional love.       We must promise that when we say all men are created equal,      it means something, protects something and encourages us to      embrace the belief that the diversity among us has nothing to      do with equality, but has everything to do with strength.      Tolerance must be more than what we believe, it must be what      we live and leading by example is what we must do. Tolerance      does not always mean agreement, but tolerance always requires      understanding and compassion for others.       Very few of us will have monuments built to honor us after      we are gone, but ALL OF US can do monumental things each day      to help America be better. Those moments in Selma yesterday      will stand as a testament to all of our lives. For there is      power in moving forward, there is joy in an unburdened heart      and there is strength in stepping away from beneath the      shadows of your lives.       I sometimes wonder what my mother and father would think of      their daughter that stands here today, and my mind's eye      returns to a wood framed house on Eufaula Street in Clayton,      Alabama, when life was uncomplicated and happiness was      something you lived not something you just hoped for. And my      father would smile at me and say ``little girl, you're doing      just fine, I sure am proud of you.''       But for today, I am most thankful for the life and      inspiration of Congressman John Lewis.       Congressman Lewis, in March of 2009 you held my hand and      walked with me across the Edmund Pettus Bridge; the very      bridge where, as a young man, you were beaten by Alabama      State Troopers. That walk with you helped me understand the      power of forgiveness and gave me the courage to speak with my      own voice. Since that time I have looked for an opportunity      to return, in some small measure, the gift of love and      understanding you gave to me.       Fifty years ago, you stood here in front of your State      Capitol and sought an opportunity as a citizen of Alabama to      be recognized and heard by your Governor and he refused. But      today, as his daughter and as a person of my own, I want to      do for you what my father should have done and recognize you      for your humanity and for your dignity as a child of God, as      a person of goodwill and character and as a fellow Alabamian      and say ``Welcome Home.''                          ____________________
