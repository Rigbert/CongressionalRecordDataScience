Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in 2012 Congress authorized a National Mall Liberty Fund to establish a memorial on Federal land to honor the more than 5,000 slaves and free Black persons who served as soldiers and sailors or provided civilian assistance during the American Revolution.  Under the Commemorative Works Act, memorials must be recommended by the Government Service Administration for placement within what is known as Area I, which is generally the location around The National Mall in Washington. A recommendation may be issued if the Administrator finds a proposed memorial is of preeminence and of lasting significance.  On June 3, 2014, the GSA Administrator notified the Natural Resources Committee he found the proposed National Liberty Memorial to be of lasting significance. Under current law, once this notification is delivered, Congress has 150 days to concur with the finding. H.J. Res. 120 provides the necessary concurrence and allows this privately funded project to move forward. Again, I know of no Federal funds that will be used in this memorial.  I reserve the balance of my time.
