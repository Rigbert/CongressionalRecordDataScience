Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues from Connecticut and California for this tribute.  One of the rewards of public service is the friendships that you make. It has been my great fortune to make the friendship of Barbara Kennelly and her husband, Jim. These friendships extend beyond business hours when we have a chance to relax and get to know one another.  I came to know the Kennelly family; what a great legendary political family they are. Jim, who served with such distinction at the legislative level, was known to me when I worked at the State legislative level for his leadership not only in Connecticut but across the Nation. Then I came to meet Barbara and realized what she contributed to our country here in her service to the U.S. House of Representatives.  As the gentlewoman from Connecticut , [Mrs. DeLauro] said, Jim graduated from the role of speaker and legislative leader to the role of political spouse, not an easy burden to carry for many men, but he carried it so well. He respected Barbara's contribution. He was part of her decision process. He was supportive of her. All of us in public life depend so much on that support and he did such a great job.  I am sorry to hear of his passing. I extend my condolences to Barbara and the family, and I hope that this special order is an indication that Jim's contribution to Connecticut and the country will be long remembered.
