First, let me say, though I personally oppose abortion, and I would counsel a woman in my family to look for an alternative, or adoption, and help in any way I could, I believe we have to really make a special effort to protect the legality of the decision that a woman ultimately makes in this situation, when her life and her health are at stake--a decision that should be made by her, her doctor, her conscience, and her family, as the Senator said.  What I found 21 years ago, when I came to Congress with that belief, was the startling discovery that so many people who opposed abortion also opposed family planning. That, to me, seems totally inconsistent--that you would not give to a woman options so that she could avoid an unplanned pregnancy.  I want to ask the Senator from California this: Based on what she has seen, and what I have seen in almost 21 years on Capitol Hill, if those people are successful in the Senate and House and eventually overturn Roe v. Wade, can the Senator give me some indication of what she thinks is next when it comes to issues of family planning--issues that women value as much as their Roe v. Wade rights, but those issues as well? Have we not seen repeatedly in the Congress the same voices who are calling for the overturning of Roe v. Wade also limiting options for women to plan the size of their family--the frequency of children in their family?
