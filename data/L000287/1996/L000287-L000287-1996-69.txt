Mr. Speaker, Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole oppose an increase in the minimum wage. The Republican leader has said he will fight the minimum wage with every fiber in his being and the Republican whip has said in regard to families living on the minimum wage, they do not exist.  Today, the Republicans in this House are pulling one of the dirtiest and most despicable deceptions I have seen in my 10 years in this House. They say they support an increase in the minimum wage, but today they will vote to repeal the minimum wage for nearly two-thirds of the people earning that wage. That is right, repeal the minimum wage.  Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. Extreme in the extreme. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, Mr. Speaker, you ought to be ashamed.                          ____________________
