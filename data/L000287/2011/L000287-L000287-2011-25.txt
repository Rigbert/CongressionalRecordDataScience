Mr. Speaker, the two bills, H.R. 2681 and H.R. 2250, are an affront public health and to our environment.  When we take our air, waters and land for granted; when we show a simple lack of respect for nature and our environment, we unmake God's good creation. Over 40 years ago, Republicans and Democrats passed the Clean Air Act because they believed that every American child deserved to breathe clean air. They believed that every American child deserved an environment free from toxic pollutants that cause cancer and impair their ability to learn.  EPA standards, like the ones attacked in this bill, did not run our economy off the cliff. EPA standards did not drive us into debt, or stop the banks from extending credit. But here we are, ready to stop common sense protections are 11 years overdue. If enacted, these bills would make damaging changes to the Clean Air Act. We would stop future EPA standards from protecting our children and our families from mercury and toxic air pollution. 2,500 lives are lost for every year these pollution reductions are delayed.  There are protesters right outside this building, Mr. Chairman. They want us to take up the American Jobs Act. They want it passed. They don't need another attack on the Clean Air Act. They don't need another attack on the public's health. We're wasting their time, Mr. Chairman.  It is my strong belief that our country needs environmental protections and that real protections do not have to come at the expense of jobs or our economy. Whatever we do to the earth, we do to each other. I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          ____________________
