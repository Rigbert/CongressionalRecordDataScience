President, tomorrow we will take a vote on Senator Toomey's amendment and on cloture and final passage. There may not be time, as we are wrapping up the work on this bill, for me to pay tribute to some very valuable individuals who worked very hard on this bill; that is, the members of the staff on both sides.  I wish to particularly commend three members of my staff--John Kane, Katie Brown, and Betsy McDonnell--who have literally worked night and day to try work out amendments and procedure with a wide variety of staff on both sides of the aisle.  Our staffs are often the unsung heroes of this institution, and in this case I was receiving emails from my staff--for instance last night at 1:46 a.m.--giving me the latest updates. I just wish to publicly thank them, the floor staff on both sides, the HELP Committee staff, and everyone who was involved but particularly the three members of my staff, John, Katie, and Betsy, who have literally devoted countless hours to this bill. I know they will be very happy when we reach final passage tomorrow.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
