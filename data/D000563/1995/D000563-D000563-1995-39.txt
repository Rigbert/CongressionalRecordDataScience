Speaker, now we see the capstone of the Gingrich revolution. The Gingrich revolution started with the Contract With America. We debated 31 bills for 100 days. Three were signed into law.  Then, the Republicans were 1 month late with their budget resolution; late with their appropriation bills. We find ourselves with a stopgap spending bill going through, and then they pushed through the Medicare rate increase on seniors and the tax break for the wealthy and said to the President, ``Take it or leave it.''  Mr. Speaker, I am saying to the President, ``Leave it. Veto these Republican plans to raise Medicare premiums and provide tax cuts for wealthy Americans.''  We are now facing a shutdown of the Government because Speaker Gingrich's political strategy calls for this High Noon scenario. This is a complete abdication of responsibility by the leadership in this House of Representatives. It is shameful. It will penalize American families. If this is the Gingrich revolution, keep it.                          ____________________
