Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones) for her remarks. She is impossible not to include, Mr. Speaker. She is effervescent, ever-present and ever-ready; and we thank her for her participation.  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that today is the last day of Black History Month. It is appropriate that we look back on this history and we look back with our eyes wide open at the injustices committed on American soil. The stain on our history deserves no defense because it is simply indefensible, but let us take this opportunity today to look back and learn from those who led our Nation out of darkness through the strength of character, through the unbreakable human spirit, through the unending quest for freedom and human dignity and in the words of that great national anthem, ``facing the rising sun of their new day begun, let us march until victory is won.''  The inspiring lives of our colleagues teach rich lessons for all of us. The inspiring lives of great African Americans do so as well: George Washington Carver; Frederick Douglas; Sojourner Truth; Harriet Tubman; W.E.B. DuBois; Thurgood Marshall, from my own State; Jackie Robinson; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; and Shirley Chisholm, who served with such high distinction in this House. Mr. Speaker, that list of great African Americans could go on and on; and that list is continually growing.  If we take a look around this very body, Mr. Speaker, we will see a new generation of African-American leaders who serve the American people so ably, so proudly. It is important that we recognize their contributions and their service to the people of America.                              {time}  1415  It is important that we capture the rich lessons of their lives which inspire generations yet to come, not just of young African-Americans who will see them as role models, but young Americans and young people throughout the world who will see them as courageous human beings who have overcome great adversity, racism, in many instances, economic deprivation, cultural deprivation.  Some, have come from advantaged homes, but they have not forgotten that there is a struggle that continues.  To that end, Mr. Speaker, I have joined more than 40 of our colleagues in introducing a bipartisan concurrent resolution for the printing of a revised edition of the House document entitled ``Black Americans in Congress, 1870 to 1989.'' I introduced this because in the last 10 years now we have had many distinguished African-Americans join our ranks. I and my cosponsors want to make sure that they are remembered.  The latest edition of this work, published in 1990, contains biographies, photographs, and other important historical information about the 66 distinguished African-Americans who had served in either Chamber of Congress as of January 23, 1990. Since that time, an additional 40 distinguished African-Americans have served or are now serving.  As we celebrate Black History Month, therefore, I encourage my colleagues to support this important resolution, which directs the Library of Congress to revise and update this volume. It will be a tremendously important resource for Members, scholars, students, and others.  To appreciate history, we must recognize where we have been and how far we have come. When the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson in 1965, there were five African-Americans in Congress. Today there are 38, nearly eight times that number. Progress? Yes. But our work is far from finished. We cannot, rest on our laurels or that accomplishment. That, Mr. Speaker, as all of us in America know, became painfully clear during last November's national election.  Yesterday I participated in an important hearing on election reform convened by the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It is undeniable that the election problems and irregularities that arose not just in Florida, where we focused, but all across this land, contain a profound civil rights dimension.  It is a basic right of American citizenship to have the opportunity to vote. It is a fundamental responsibility of our democracy that we ensure that their everyone's vote is properly counted. In Atlanta's Fulton County, which uses punch card machines similar to those that gained so much notoriety in Florida, one in every 16 ballots for President was invalidated. In Cobb and Gwinnett Counties, two largely white neighboring counties that use more modern optical-scan equipment, the nullification rate was one in 200. Think of it. In the inner city, one in 16 ballots was thrown out. In the more affluent suburbs, which could afford better technology, only one in 200. What a stark contrast that is a 1,250 percent difference.  That is not acceptable in America, it is not acceptable in any democracy. In many Chicago precincts populated by African-Americans, one in every six ballots was thrown out. In contrast, neighboring DeKalb and Henry Counties, which are mostly white and use optical scan equipment had a spoilage rate of only three-tenths of a percent, one in six versus three-tenths in 100.  It is painfully clear today, Mr. Speaker, nearly 36 years to the day after the famous bloody Sunday civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, an event that awakened the Nation to rank injustice and led to enactment of the Voting Rights Act, that our work is not finished. Far from it. Those brave foot soldiers of the civil rights movement, including our beloved colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), marched in Selma and across our Nation for the most basic right in a democracy, fought for the right to vote.  Mr. Speaker, I will be marching across the Edmond Pettis Bridge on Sunday. I will be marching across that bridge with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and many others to commemorate that historic march which directly led just a few months later to the passage and enactment and signing by President Lyndon Johnson of the Voting Rights Act.  The right to vote alone is simply not enough. Even in a Nation as great as ours, we must redouble our effort to ensure that every single vote is counted, and that the integrity of our election system is never threatened.  It is startling, Mr. Speaker, that women were not able to vote in this country until the 1920s. African-Americans could not vote, not because legally they could not, but because they actually were discouraged. They were not empowered by being encouraged to register to vote. They were instead given literacy tests and other devices were used to preclude them from exercising what the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments said was rightfully theirs as citizens of this country.  As we conclude Black History Month, as many of us prepare, as I said, to join the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and others this weekend in a pilgrimage to the historic civil rights sites in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma, let us redouble our commitment to the spirit and righteousness of that historic Voting Rights Act and say, never again, never again will we accept an election system that fails to count every vote.  As Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and journalist who escaped from slavery, said so many years ago, ``The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to august claims have been born of earnest struggle. If there is no struggle, there is no progress.''  When we join the earnest struggle for human liberty, then and only then, Mr. Speaker, will we have learned the rich lessons that Black History Month helps us to teach. Then and only then will we honor the extraordinary Americans, African Americans, but Americans, committed to their country, chosen by their neighbors to serve in this Congress who have enriched this institution, enriched their fellow African Americans, and enriched this Nation by their service.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased in this special order to urge every one of my colleagues to support this resolution to reprint this fine publication to ensure that even the newest Members of this Congress who are African Americans are included in it, so that everybody in America can know of their background, of their service, and of their commitment.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), a distinguished former member of the Missouri Senate, the son of a distinguished former member of this body, William Clay, who chaired the Committee on Education and Labor for a number of years, who was a giant in speaking out for the education of every American child, white or black, yellow, brown, or red.  The gentleman's father is, I know, extraordinarily proud of his son, who has been selected by his Missouri neighbors to represent them here. No father can send a son here; only the citizens can do that.  I am pleased now to yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), the son of a great American, a great American himself, and the president of the House freshman class for the year 2000.
