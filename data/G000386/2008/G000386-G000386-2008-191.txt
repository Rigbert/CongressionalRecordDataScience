 President, starting last year, I started looking at the financial relationships between physicians and drug companies. I first began this inquiry by examining payments from Astra Zeneca to Dr. Melissa DelBello, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati.  In 2002, Dr. DelBello published a study that found that Seroquel worked for kids with bipolar disorder. The study was paid for by Astra Zeneca, and the following year that company paid Dr. DelBello around $100,000 for speaking fees and honoraria. In 2004, Astra Zeneca paid Dr. DelBello over $80,000.  Today, I would like to talk about three physicians at Harvard Medical School--Drs. Joseph Biederman, Thomas Spencer, and Timothy Wilens. They are some of the top psychiatrists in the country, and their research is some of the most important in the field. They have also taken millions of dollars from the drug companies.  Out of concern about the relationship between this money and their research, I asked Harvard and Mass General Hospital last October to send me the conflict of interest forms that these doctors had submitted to their institutions. Universities often require faculty to fill these forms out so that we can know if the doctors have a conflict of interest.  The forms I received were from the year 2000 to the present. Basically, these forms were a mess. My staff had a hard time figuring out which companies the doctors were consulting for and how much money they were making. But by looking at them, anyone would be led to believe that these doctors were not taking much money. Over the last 7 years, it looked like they had taken a couple hundred thousand dollars.  But last March, Harvard and Mass General asked these doctors to take a second look at the money they had received from the drug companies. And this is when things got interesting. Dr. Biederman suddenly admitted to over $1.6 million dollars from the drug companies. And Dr. Spencer also admitted to over $1 million. Meanwhile, Dr. Wilens also reported over $1.6 million in payments from the drug companies.  The question you might ask is: Why weren't Harvard and Mass General watching over these doctors? The answer is simple: They trusted these physicians to honestly report this money.  Based on reports from just a handful of drug companies, we know that even these millions do not account for all of the money. In a few cases, the doctors disclosed more money than the drug companies reported. But in most cases, the doctors reported less money.  For instance, Eli Lilly has reported to me that they paid tens of thousands of dollars to Dr. Biederman that he still has not accounted for. And the same goes for Drs. Spencer and Wilens.  What makes all of this even more interesting is that Drs. Biederman and Wilens were awarded grants from the National Institutes of Health to study the drug Strattera.  Obviously, if a researcher is taking money from a drug company while also receiving Federal dollars to research that company's product, then there is a conflict of interest. That is why I am asking the National Institutes of Health to take a closer look at the grants they give to researchers. Every year, the NIH hands out almost $24 billion in grants. But nobody is watchingto ensure that the conflicts of interest are being monitored.  That is why Senator Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. This bill will require companies to report payments that they make to doctors. As it stands right now, universities have to trust their faculty to report this money. And we can see that this trust is causing the universities to run afoul of NIH regulations. This is one reason why industry groups such as PhRMA and Advamed, as well as the American Association of Medical Colleges, have all endorsed my bill. Creating one national reporting system, rather than relying on a hodge-podge of state systems and some voluntary reporting systems, is the right thing to do.  Before closing, I would like to say that Harvard and Mass General have been extremely cooperative in this investigation, as have Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca and other companies. I ask unanimous consent that my letters to Harvard, Mass General, and the NIH be printed the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2008.     Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D.     Director, National Institutes of Health,     Bethesda, Maryland.       Dear Director Zerhouni: As a senior member of the United      States Senate and the Ranking Member of the Committee on      Finance (Committee), I have a duty under the Constitution to      conduct oversight into the actions of executive branch      agencies, including the activities of the National Institutes      of Health (NIH/Agency). In this capacity, I must ensure that      NIH properly fulfills its mission to advance the public's      welfare and makes responsible use of the public funding      provided for medical studies. This research often forms the      basis for action taken by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.       Over the past number of years, I have become increasingly      concerned about the lack of oversight regarding conflicts of      interest relating to the almost $24 billion in annual      extramural funds that are distributed by the NIH. In that      regard, I would like to take this opportunity to notify you      about five problems that have come to my attention on this      matter.       First, it appears that three researchers failed to report      in a timely, complete and accurate manner their outside      income to Harvard University (Harvard) and Massachusetts      General Hospital (MGH). By not reporting this income, it      seems that they are placing Harvard and MGH in jeopardy of      violating NIH regulations on conflicts of interest. I am      attaching that letter for your review and consideration.       Second, I am requesting an update about a letter I sent you      last October on problems with conflicts of interest and NIH      extramural funding regarding Dr. Melissa DelBello at the      University of Cincinnati (University). In that letter, I      notified you that Dr. DelBello receives grants from the NIH,      however, she was failing to report her outside income to her      University.       Third, the Inspector General for the Department of Health      and Human Services Office (HHS OIG) released a disturbing      report last January which found that NIH provided almost no      oversight of its extramural funds. But your staff seemed to      show little interest in this report. In fact, Norka Ruiz      Bravo, the NIH deputy director of extramural programs was      quoted in The New York Times saying, ``For us to try to      manage directly the conflict-of-interest of an NIH      investigator would be not only inappropriate but pretty much      impossible.''       Fourth, I am dismayed to have read of funding provided to      several researchers from the Foundation for Lung Cancer:      Early Detection, Prevention & Treatment (Foundation). Dr.      Claudia Henschke and Dr. David Yankelevitz are two of the      Foundation's board members. As reported by The New York      Times, the Foundation was funded almost entirely with monies      from tobacco companies, and this funding was never fully      disclosed. Monies from the Foundation were then used to      support a study that appeared in The New England Journal of      Medicine (NEJM) back in 2006 regarding the use of computer      tomography screening to detect lung cancer. The NEJM      disclosure states that the study was supported also by NIH      grants held by Drs. Henschke and Yankelevitz.       Regarding the lack of transparency by Dr. Henschke and Dr.      Yankelevitz, National Cancer Institute Director John      Niederhuber told the Cancer Letter, ``[W]e must always be      transparent regarding any and all matters, real or perceived,      which might call our scientific work into question.''       The NEJM later published a clarification regarding its      earlier article and a correction revealing that Dr. Henschke      also received royalties for methods to assess tumors with      imaging technology. There is no evidence that the      Foundation's tobacco money or Dr. Henschke's royalties      influenced her research. But I am concerned that the funding      source and royalties may have not been disclosed when the NIH      decided to fund Dr. Henschke.       Fifth, I sent you a letter on April 15, outlining my      concerns about a report on the National Institute of      Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). That report found 45      cases at the NIEHS where extramural grants had not receiving      sufficient peer review scores but were still funded. This      finding is yet another example that the NIH provides little      oversight for its extramural program.       Dr. Zerhouni, you faced similar scandals back in 2003 when      it came to light that many NIH intramural researchers enjoyed      lucrative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. It took      you some time, but you eventually brought some transparency,      reform and integrity back to NIH. As you told Congress during      one hearing, ``I have reached the conclusion that drastic      changes are needed as a result of an intensive review by NIH      of our ethics program, which included internal fact-finding      as well as an external review by the Blue Ribbon Panel.''       NIH oversight of the extramural program is lax and leaves      people with nothing more than questions--$24 billion worth of      questions, to be exact. I am interested in understanding how      you will address this issue. American taxpayers deserve      nothing less.       In the interim, I ask you to respond to the following      requests for information and documents. In responding to each      request, first repeat the enumerated question followed by the      appropriate response. Your responses should encompass the      period of January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2008. I would      appreciate receiving responses to the following questions by      no later than June 18, 2008:       1.

If you have any      questions please contact my Committee staff, Paul Thacker at      (202) 224-4515. Any formal correspondence should be sent      electronically in PDF searchable format to brian_[email protected]           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.                                       ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2008.     Dr. Drew Gilpin Faust,     President, Harvard University,     Massachusetts Hall, Cambridge, MA.     Dr. Peter L. Slavin,     President, Massachusetts General Hospital (Partners          Healthcare), Boston, MA.       Dear Drs. Faust and Slavin: The United States Senate      Committee on Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the      Medicare and Medicaid programs and, accordingly, a      responsibility to the more than 80 million Americans who      receive health care coverage under these programs. As Ranking      Member of the Committee, I have a duty to protect the health      of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer      dollars appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by      thought leaders, like those at Harvard Medical School who are      discussed throughout this letter, often have a profound      impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded programs      like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients are      treated and funds expended.       Moreover, and as has been detailed in several studies and      news reports, funding by pharmaceutical companies can      influence scientific studies, continuing medical education,      and the prescribing patterns of doctors. Because I am      concerned that there has been little transparency on this      matter, I have sent letters to almost two dozen research      universities across the United States. In these letters, I      asked questions about the conflict of interest disclosure      forms signed by some of their faculty. Universities require      doctors to report their related outside income, but I am      concerned that these requirements are disregarded sometimes.       I have also been taking a keen interest in the almost $24      billion annually appropriated to the National Institutes of      Health to fund grants at various institutions such as yours.      As you know, institutions are required to manage a grantee's      conflicts of interest. But I am learning that this task is      made difficult because physicians do not consistently report      all the payments received from drug companies.       To bring some greater transparency to this issue, Senator      Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act      (Act). This Act will require drug companies to report      publicly any payments that they make to doctors, within      certain parameters.       I am writing to try and assess the implementation of      financial disclosure policies of Harvard University (Harvard)      and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH/Partners), (the      Institutions). In response to my letters of June 29, October      25, and October 26, 2007, your Institutions provided me with      the financial disclosure reports that Drs. Joseph Biederman,      Thomas Spencer, and Timothy Wilens (Physicians) filed during      the period of January 2000 through June 2007.       My staff investigators carefully reviewed each of the      Physicians' disclosure forms and detailed the payments      disclosed. I then asked that your Institutions confirm the      accuracy of the information. In March 2008, your Institutions      then requested additional information from the Physicians      pursuant to my inquiry. That information was subsequently      provided to me.       In their second disclosures to your Institutions, the      Physicians revealed different information than they had      disclosed initially to your respective Institutions. On April      29, 2008, I received notification from Harvard Medical      School's Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity that he has      referred the cases of these Physicians to the Standing      Committee on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment (``Standing      Committee''). The Chief Academic Officer (CAO), Partners      HealthCare System, also wrote me that Partners will look to      the Standing Committee to conduct the initial factual review      of potential non-compliance that are contained in both the      Harvard Medical School Policy and the Partners Policy. In      addition, the CAO stated that, in addition to the Standing      Committee's review process, Partners will conduct its own      independent review of conflicts of interest disclosures these      Physicians submitted separately to Partners in connection      with publicly funded research and other aspects of Partners      Policy. I look forward to being updated on these reviews in      the near future.       In addition, I contacted executives at several major      pharmaceutical companies and asked them to list the payments      that they made to Drs. Biederman, Spencer, and Wilens during      the years 2000 through 2007. These companies voluntarily and      cooperatively reported additional payments that the      Physicians do not appear to have disclosed to your      Institutions.       Because these disclosures do not match, I am attaching a      chart intended to provide a few examples of the data that      have been reported me. This chart contains three columns:      payments disclosed in the forms the physicians filed at your      Institutions, payments revealed in March 2008, and amounts      reported by some drug companies.       I would appreciate further information to see if the      problems I have found with these three Physicians are      systemic within your Institutions.                     INSTITUTIONAL AND NIH POLICIES       Both Harvard and MGH/Partners have established an income de      minimus limit. This policy forbids researchers working at      your Institutions from conducting clinical trials with a drug      or technology if they receive payments over $20,000 from the      company that manufactures that drug or technology. Prior to      2004, the income de minimus limit established by your      institutions was $10,000.       Further, federal regulations place several requirements on      a university/hospital when its researchers apply for NIH      grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of      objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in      pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their      institution any ``significant financial interest'' that may      appear to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets      ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000      in value or 5 percent ownership in a single entity.       Based upon information available to me, it appears that      each of the Physicians identified above received grants to      conduct studies involving atomoxetine, a drug that sells      under the brand name Strattera. For example:       In 2000, the NIH awarded Dr. Biederman a grant to study      atomoxetine in children. At that time, Dr. Biederman      disclosed that he received less than $10,000 in payments from      Eli Lilly & Company (Eli Lilly). But Eli Lilly reported that      it paid Dr. Biederman more than $14,000 for advisory services      that year--a difference of at least $4,000.       In 2004, the NIH awarded Dr. Wilens a 5-year grant to study      atomoxetine. In his second disclosure to your Institutions,      Dr. Wilens revealed that he received $7,500 from Eli Lilly in      2004. But Eli Lilly reported to me that it paid Dr. Wilens      $27,500 for advisory services and speaking fees in 2004--a      difference of about $20,000.       It is my understanding that Dr. Wilens' NIH-funded study of      atomoxetine is still ongoing. According to Eli Lilly, it paid      Dr. Wilens almost $65,000 during the period January 2004      through June 2007. However, as of March 2008, and based upon      the documents provided to us to date, Dr. Wilens disclosed      payments of about half of the amount reported by Eli Lilly      for this period. Dr. Wilens also did three other studies of      atomoxetine in 2006 and 2007.       I have also found several instances where these Physicians      apparently received income above your institutions' income de      minimus limit. For instance, in 2003, Dr. Spencer conducted a      study of atomoxetine in adolescents. At the time, he      disclosed no significant financial interests related to this      study. But Eli Lilly reported paying Dr. Spencer over $25,000      that year.       In 2001, Dr. Biederman disclosed plans to begin a study      sponsored by Cephalon, Inc. At the time; Dr. Biederman      disclosed that he had no financial relationship with the      sponsor of this study. Yet, on his conflict of interest      disclosure, he acknowledged receiving research support and      speaking fees from Cephalon, Inc., but did not provide any      information on the amounts paid. In March 2008, Dr. Biederman      revealed that Cephalon, Inc. paid him $13,000 in 2001.       In 2005, Dr. Biederman began another clinical trial      sponsored by Cephalon, Inc., which was scheduled to start in      September 2005 and end in September 2006. Initially, Dr.      Biederman disclosed that he had no financial relationship      with the sponsor of this study. But in March 2008, Dr.      Biederman revealed that Cephalon, Inc. paid him $11,000 for      honoraria in 2005 and an additional $24,750 in 2006.       In light of the information set forth above, I ask your      continued cooperation in examining conflicts of interest. In      my opinion, institutions across the United States must be      able to rely on the representations of its faculty to ensure      the integrity of medicine, academia, and the grant-making      process. At the same time, should the Physician Payments      Sunshine Act become law, institutions like yours will be able      to access a database that will set forth the payments made to      all doctors, including your faculty members. Indeed at this      time there are several pharmaceutical and device companies      that are looking favorably upon the Physician Payments      Sunshine Bill and for that I am gratified.       Accordingly, I request that your respective institutions      respond to the following questions and requests for      information. For each response, please repeat the enumerated      request and follow with the appropriate answer.       1. For each of the NIH grants received by the Physicians,      please confirm that the Physicians reported to Harvard and      MGH/Partners' designated official ``the existence of [his]      conflicting interest.'' Please provide separate responses for      each grant received for the period from January 1, 2000 to      the present, and provide any supporting documentation for      each grant identified.       2. For each grant identified above, please explain how      Harvard and MGH/Partners ensured ``that the interest has been      managed, reduced, or eliminated?'' Please provide an      individual response for each grant that each doctor received      from January 2000 to the present, and provide any      documentation to support each claim.       3. Please report on the status of the Harvard Standing      Committee and additional Partners reviews of the      discrepancies in disclosures by Drs. Biederman, Spencer and      Wilens, including what action, if any, will be considered.       4. For Drs. Biederman, Spencer, and Wilens, please report      whether a determination can be made as to whether or not any      doctor violated guidelines governing clinical trials and the      need to report conflicts of interest to an institutional      review board (IRB). Please respond by naming each clinical      trial for which the doctor was the principal investigator,      along with confirmation that conflicts of interest were      reported, if possible.       5. Please provide a total dollar figure for all NIH monies      annually received by Harvard and MGH/Partners, respectively.      This request covers the period of 2000 through 2007.       6. Please provide a list of all NIH grants received by      Harvard and MGH/Partners. This request covers the period of      2000 through 2007. For each grant please provide the      following:       a. Primary Investigator;       b. Grant Title;       c. Grant number;       d. Brief description; and       e. Amount of Award.       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and      assistance in this matter. As you know, in cooperating with      the Committee's review, no documents, records, data or      information related to these matters shall be destroyed,      modified, removed or otherwise made inaccessible to the      Committee.       I look forward to hearing from you by no later than June      18, 2008. All documents responsive to this request should be      sent electronically in PDF format to [email protected]rep.senate.gov.
