This date will mark the 25th anniversary of Saints Monica and Luke Parish, and also will mark the 90th anniversary of Saint Luke Parish and the 80th anniversary of Saint Monica Parish. This celebration, honoring the people and the history of these parishes, will take place at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary.  The official dedication of Saint Luke Parish, by then-Bishop Aldering, took place on September 30, 1917, the year my father arrived in Gary. The previous July, Saint Luke's first pastor, Father Frank Gnibba was appointed, and it was through his leadership that the first auditorium, or chapel, was constructed. This modest structure was the beginning of what would eventually become Saints Monica and Luke Parish. It housed seating for 550 people, as well as four classrooms, which formed the original Saint Luke's school. An important part of the history of Saint Luke is that the school was staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame from 1917-1969. During this time, under the leadership of Father Wilfred P. Mannion, the church's current building was constructed. The new location officially opened on October 16, 1955.  Saint Monica Parish, established in Gary in 1927, was the result of the efforts of four African American Catholic women: Lillian Bolden, Louise Agnes Smith, Josefa Streeter, and Eugenia Williams. Because African Americans were not welcome in the existing Catholic churches in Gary at the time, these inspirational leaders and beacons of change petitioned then-Bishop John Francis Noll to establish a church for them. This request was granted, and Saint Monica Parish was born. In 1928, Father H. James Conway became Saint Monica's first pastor. Father Conway would serve the Catholic community in Gary for many years, eventually being named pastor at Saint Luke in 1959. During his tenure, in 1945, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament began instructing students at Saint Monica School, which focused on academic excellence and Christian service, and would become one of the premier educational facilities in the City of Gary. Another leader of Saint Monica's was Father Joseph M. Barry, an oblate from Boston who was very close to our family, as was another of the congregation's leaders, Myrtle King. Father William Martin, an assistant to Father Conway, took over as pastor at Saint Monica in 1968 and would eventually become the first pastor at Saints Monica and Luke Parish upon the parishes' merger in 1982.  Throughout the years, the parishioners of both Saint Luke and Saint Monica were a magnificent example of the Christian community in northwest Indiana. When the two churches merged in 1982 to become what is now Saints Monica and Luke Parish, their outstanding service to the community continued. Through the diligent efforts of its members, service to those in need has become one of the parish's identifying trademarks. Saints Monica and Luke operates a food pantry that serves families once a month, as well as the Saints Monica and Luke Soup Kitchen, which opened its doors in April 1993 and has served a hot meal to those in need every Friday since.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the church's current and dedicated Pastor, Father Pat Gaza, and the entire congregation at Saints Monica and Luke Parish on their 25th anniversary, as well as the preceding parishes. Throughout the years, the clergy and members of Saints Monica and Luke have dedicated themselves to providing spiritual guidance through their faith, as well as unconditional service to their community. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our deepest admiration.                          ____________________
