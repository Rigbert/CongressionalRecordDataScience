Speaker, a former colleague of our ours died last Saturday morning. He was an extraordinarily good human being and a very close friend. I want to pay tribute to a good and decent American, an absolutely wonderful individual, Carlton R. Sickles, who passed away early Saturday.  It is unfortunate that millions of people whose lives he touched during his 82 years never had the benefit of knowing him personally. I am blessed as many in this body were blessed by knowing him well. He was a veteran ofWorld War II and the Korean War, a former Maryland legislator, a gubernatorial candidate and a Member of the House from 1963 to 1967.  But he is perhaps best known, Mr. Speaker, for those of us who live in the Washington metropolitan area as the father of the Metrorail transit system which today serves millions of customers every single year, not only those who live in this region but those millions of people who come to the Washington metropolitan area to visit their Capitol and their Representatives.  On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, I will forever be indebted to Carlton for encouraging me to choose a career in public service. I wanted to run for the House of Delegates in 1966. He was running for governor. He urged me to run for the State Senate. I did not think I could win a State Senate seat. I was 2 months out of law school and thought that premature, but he continued to encourage me. And the third time he asked I ran, and I was fortunate enough to be successful. That has made a huge difference in my life.  He encouraged so many others to participate in public service. His own public service was a credit to elective office, a credit to this institution, a credit to Maryland, and his community.  To his wife Jacqueline, his children, and all his family, I offer my deepest condolences. Carlton was a role model who left a tremendous legacy. He will be sorely missed.
