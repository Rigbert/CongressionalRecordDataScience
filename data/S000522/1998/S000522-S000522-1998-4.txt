Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 562) concerning properties wrongfully expropriated by formerly totalitarian governments.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 562         Whereas totalitarian regimes, including Fascist and      Communist dictatorships, have caused immeasurable human      suffering and loss, degrading not only every conceivable      human right, but the human spirit itself;       Whereas the villainy of communism was dedicated, in      particular, to the organized and systematic destruction of      private property ownership, including ownership of real,      personal, business, and financial property, by individuals      and communities;       Whereas the confiscation of property without compensation      by totalitarian regimes was often designed to victimize      people because of religion, ethnicity, national or social      origin, or opposition to such regimes;       Whereas certain individuals and communities twice suffered      the taking of their properties without compensation, first by      the Nazis and their collaborators and next by subsequent      Communist regimes;       Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious      properties, as well as properties such as hospitals, schools      and orphanages owned by religious communities, were destroyed      or confiscated as a means of breaking the spiritual devotion      and allegiance of religious people and dismantling religious      communities;       Whereas refugees from communism, in addition to being      wrongfully deprived of their property, were often forced to      relinquish their citizenship in order to protect themselves      and their families from reprisals by the Communists who ruled      their countries;       Whereas the participating States of the Organization for      Security and Cooperation in Europe have agreed to achieve or      maintain full recognition and protection of all types of      property, including private property, and the right to      prompt, just and effective compensation in the event private      property is taken for public use;       Whereas the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the      Caucasus, and Central Asia, have entered a post-Communist      period of transition and democratic development, and many      countries have begun the difficult and wrenching process of      trying to right the wrongs of previous totalitarian regimes;       Whereas many countries in Central and Eastern Europe have      enacted laws providing for the restitution of properties that      were illegally or unjustly seized, nationalized, confiscated,      or otherwise expropriated by totalitarian regimes;       Whereas legal or administrative restrictions that require      claimants to reside in, or be a citizen of, the country from      which they seek restitution of, or compensation for,      wrongfully expropriated property are arbitrary,      discriminatory, and in violation of international law; and       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that      the activity of governments and their administrative agencies      be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their      parliaments or legislatures, and such laws themselves must be      consistent with international human rights standards: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) welcomes the efforts of many formerly totalitarian      countries to address the complex and difficult question of      the status of wrongfully expropriated properties;       (2) urges countries which have not already done so to      return wrongfully expropriated properties to their rightful      owners or, when actual return is not possible, to pay prompt,      just and effective compensation, in accordance with      principles of justice and in a manner that is just,      transparent and fair;       (3) calls for the return of wrongfully expropriated      properties to religious communities;       (4) calls on Croatia, the Czech Republic, Latvia,      Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and any other nation whose laws      or regulations limit restitution or compensation for      wrongfully expropriated properties to persons who reside in,      or are citizens of, the country from which restitution or      compensation is sought, to remove such restrictions; and       (5) urges formerly totalitarian countries to pass and      effectively implement laws that provide for restitution of,      or compensation for, wrongfully expropriated property.       Sec. 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall      transmit a copy of this resolution to the President.
