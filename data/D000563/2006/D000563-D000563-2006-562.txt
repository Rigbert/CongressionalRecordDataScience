In the interest of full disclosure of special interest groups and who is pushing legislation, would the Senator from Oklahoma also demand that kind of disclosure so we know if there is a change of a word or two, and one corporation, one lobbyist, or one special interest group is a big winner in a bill that is not an appropriations bill? Is the Senator from Oklahoma going to demand the same disclosure?
