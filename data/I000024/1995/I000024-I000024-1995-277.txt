They do not like it. There are members in the house and senate in [[Page S1900]] Oklahoma who, every year, try to figure out ways to either inflate projections of income and revenues or minimize expenditures to circumvent this thing; yet, in the final analysis, they know that we have a type of sequestration that sets in. If they do not do it, they are going to have to bite the political bullet of all those people who have their programs cut by 1 or 2 percent, whatever it takes. And it works.  People in this body quite often talk about the States that have a balanced budget amendment. Look at the cities. I was mayor of the city of Tulsa--a major city--for three terms. In our charter, we had the same thing. There are always people on the city commission who want to circumvent that and somehow want to spend more money than comes in, but they have not been able to do it. For all those individuals who say this is different, the Federal Government should not be like States or should not be like the cities and the other subdivisions, they have yet to come up with any logical justification for that statement. If it works at the State level in almost all of the States and it works in almost every city charter, it would work in the Federal Government.
