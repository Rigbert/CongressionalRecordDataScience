 Chairman, let me read briefly from a letter that I received from Steve Robertson, who is director of the National Legislative Commission for the American Legion. They say and I quote:       We have been and will continue to be strong supporters of      the veterans' pro bono representation program which will      receive a substantial portion of the proposed transfer.      Without adequate funding, this essential program will be      unable to meet the needs of those veterans who depend on it      as their only means of representation before the court.  Let me also read, if I might, from Thomas McMasters, who is the national commander of the Disabled American Veterans. He says, and I quote:       As you know, the DAV has been an active participant in the      veterans' pro bono legal program and supports what this      program has been able to do for those veterans unable to      obtain legal representation for their claims before the      United States Court of Veterans Appeals. Accordingly, we      support your amendment which will allow the Court to fully      fund the pro bono legal program without reducing activities      of the Court.  Mr. Chairman, what these gentlemen are saying, because they know something of the issue, because they represent veterans, they are saying we have a lot of low-income veterans who cannot make a trip to Washington, by the way, to make their claim. If they are low-income by definition, they cannot leave their communities, and I think that is a disgrace unto itself.  We are talking about $1.4 million. Given the amounts of money that we are talking about in this appropriations bill, this is a tiny sum of money and I really do think we should respect low-income veterans who may have gotten a raw deal from the VA and have a right to hear their appeals before the court.
