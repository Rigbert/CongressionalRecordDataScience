Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from the [[Page H653]] State of Michigan, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, our Constitution is an extraordinary document. Our Constitution is the only document of its kind in the world to have lasted so long and to have been used so often as a model for other nations.  This balanced budget amendment that we consider tonight would dishonor our Constitution. It substitutes good politics for what is good policy, for what is right.  Make no mistake. I want a balanced budget like everyone else. I do not want our children and unborn generations to bear the burden of the deficit and increasing national debt.  But I believe we must deal with this issue in a responsible and sensible way. Passing the buck to future sessions of Congress is not responsible.  The new Republican majority must tell the American people what they are going to cut, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, a school lunch program for our children.  Our knees, the American people's knees, will not buckle as some on the Republican side have suggested.  Two years ago Members on this side of the aisle made the hard choices needed to reduce the deficit. We reduced the Federal deficit by over $500 billion. We acted responsibly. I expect no less from those on the other side of the aisle.  Now they are in charge. They are in control. Lay your cards on the table face up. Tell us the hard choices you are willing to make, be straight with our children and the elderly. Tell them what they will have to do and what they will have to do without.  We do not need this amendment to our Constitution, Mr. Chairman. What we need is courage, raw courage, to make the tough choices facing our country.  Have the courage to do the right thing and vote against this amendment.
