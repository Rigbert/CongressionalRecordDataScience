Mr. Chairman, I am glad my good friend from New York brought up the death penalty and pointed out that there is killing involved in the taking of human life in abortion. I am one who has voted against the death penalty. I do not believe in it.  I would welcome and invite the gentleman and others who believe as he does to recognize that when chemical poisons and when dismemberment occurs on an unborn child, that is killing. We do not want to facilitate it. That is what this amendment is all about. This facilitates the killing of those babies.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey].
