 This motion, my colleagues, reeks with the stench of cynicism. Let me tell you why. The distinguished chairman rose and asked for unanimous consent to add the protections to members of our Armed Forces who are either serving or have served, and he then asked to protect our senior citizens. Heasked for unanimous consent to do that, and the gentleman from Texas objected, so it was not added.  Then the chairman rose and asked that we substitute ``forthwith'' for ``promptly'' so their amendment could be immediately adopted, and the gentleman from Texas objected.  How cynical can you be to offer an amendment, I tell my friend, which in its own framework will kill the very proposition you are making? For if this amendment prevails, what will happen is, the bill will be killed and the protection of the Armed Forces that he seeks, the protection of the seniors that he seeks, will be killed.  My friends on this side of the aisle, this is a political game. The American public knows it is a political game. Let's reject this cynical political game and pass this legislation.
