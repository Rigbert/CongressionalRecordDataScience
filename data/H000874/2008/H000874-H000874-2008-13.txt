So we have acted on the regulatory field; but very frankly, what has happened is this administration said they didn't believe regulation was helpful to growing the economy, and Senator McCain, their candidate for President, has said he's the biggest deregulator in town and doesn't believe in regulation.  So I tell my friend that, from a regulatory standpoint, the articulation of policy by the present President and your candidate for President has been that they do not believe in keeping the referee on the field.
