Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena for testimony in a criminal action pending in Superior Court in the District of Columbia. In this action, the defendant is charged with demonstrating during a Subcommittee hearing of the Judiciary Committee and continuing to demonstrate after being instructed to stop by a law enforcement officer. A trial is scheduled to begin in the case on October 28, 2019. The Government is seeking testimony at the trial about Committee hearing procedures from Jason Covey, hearing clerk of the Judiciary Committee. The Committee would like to comply with the subpoena by making Mr. Covey available for testimony in this case.  The enclosed resolution would authorize the production of testimony from Mr. Covey in the upcoming trial.                          ____________________
