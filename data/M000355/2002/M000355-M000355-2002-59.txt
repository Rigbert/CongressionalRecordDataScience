 He has a unique perspective as the only physician in the Senate for lending his voice to this most important cause. I might say to my friend, to those on the other side of the aisle, we may or may not win Tuesday morning, but this is not goingaway. We will be back, and we will some day address this problem because it is a national problem. Some on the other side will argue for States rights, which I always find interesting coming from very liberal Members of the Senate, that somehow this is not a Federal problem. I intend to outline in my full remarks exactly why it is a national problem and can only be corrected at the national level. I thank my friend for his outstanding comments this morning and look forward to continued discussion next week.
