 President, I rise today to honor the memory of an extraordinary and courageous young lady. Emily Ann Jordt, daughter of Bill and Deb Jordt of Hinton, Iowa, passed away on March 15, 1999, after fighting cancer for three years. My heart is heavy for the Jordt family. No one would disagree that cancer is a devastating illness. However, when cancer touches the life of a child, it seems an especially harsh reality. I know from personal experience the difficulties that follow a cancer diagnosis. My wife, Barbara, is a breast cancer survivor and we believe early detection saved her life. I have long supported biomedical research, and Emily's story reminds all of us the importance of remaining vigilant in providing funding for cancer research. To quote Emily, ``We can do this together.'' It is my hope that by sharing Emily's story with my colleagues in the Senate, Emily's memory may be truly honored.             Emily's Story--A Life of Strength and Courage       Emily was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive      childhood cancer, in 1996 when she was only nine years old.      While this cancer is usually found in muscle tissue in an      extremity, Emily's was in her jaw and neck. Emily was      frightened. Her grandfather had died of lung cancer. Emily      came to understand that there were many kinds of cancers, and      that not everyone dies of this disease. Emily joined her      family and doctors in what was to become a three-year fight      for her life.       Emily had surgery to remove a tumor below her lower right      jaw. Her best chance for remission was simultaneous radiation      and chemotherapy treatment. Even though interruptions in the      harsh protocol were needed for her body to recover, radiation      was completed, and chemotherapy resumed.       After radiation Emily had difficulty with muscles of her      tongue and throat. A feeding tube was surgically implanted      and she used a suction machine to clear her throat and      airways. She bravely adjusted to this life-style.       Emily dearly loved school. She maintained an A-B average      throughout her illness. She played trumpet in the school      band. When a facial nerve was impaired because of surgery,      she switched to percussion and continued on. She served as a      customer representative of the Westerner Bank in her school.      She was an ardent fundraiser for school projects. Her      classmates regarded her as a peacemaker.       Emily played soccer in a YMCA league throughout her      treatment. She loved the sport. She was back on the soccer      field and played most of a full game only 11 days after      having major surgery to remove the tumor a second time.       Emily planned and presented a writer's workshop entitled      ``Getting through the Tough Stuff'' where she encouraged      young people her age to use writing as a vehicle to deal with      the difficult challenges of life and be sensitive and caring      to others.       Picture a nine-year-old presenting her concerns about and      suggestions for pediatric     care to the Board of Directors of the hospital where she      spent a great deal of time. Emily did it. She believed that      one person can make a difference. And Emily did make a      difference.       Emily was active in 4-H, serving as vice-president of her      club. She chose many categories in which to participate,      everything from showing her 4-month old filly to playing the      piano in Share the Fun. She presented a written and visual      display of items used throughout her surgeries and treatment.      For this she was awarded an Outstanding Junior Achievement      Ribbon.       Emily took an active part in Relay for Life in her county.      She served as Junior Chairperson, giving a speech the night      of the event. She enlisted the help of her classmates and      teachers to help publicize events.       As only a child can, Emily leaned on her faith to see her      through. Church was important to Emily. She took communion      instruction, participated in youth group activities, sang and      provided special music for worship. She willingly served      church dinners. She helped to organize a basketball team and      enlisted a neighbor to be their coach. This team won the Good      Sportsmanship trophy.       Emily maintained a positive and determined attitude. When      traditional treatments became ineffective, she willingly      tried non-traditional methods. She clung to the hope that she      would again be as normal as the other kids. While the disease      took her life on March 15, 1999, it could not crush her      spirit. It was that very same spirit that caused her to fight      to the very end.       Emily fought this illness for three long years, showing      that with strength, determination, and courage, life is to be      lived. Emily strongly believed the scripture verses that say,      ``Let the children come to me for such is the kingdom of      God,'' and ``A Child Shall Lead.'' Let us capture the essence      of Emily's spirit, follow her lead, and make a difference.                                  ____In Memory and Celebration of the Life of Emily Ann Jordt, February 15,                           1987-March 15, 1999       Emily's life is meant to be more than just one more sad      account of how a child, a person, died from cancer. It is      meant to make us uncomfortable. It is meant to make us weep.      Then, it is meant to make us determined to act--to do      something.       Finding a cure for cancer is a very difficult but not      impossible task. What is needed to do that? An open mind.      When we keep our minds open, ideas and possibilities can      flow. One of Emily's favorite movies as a young child was      Cinderella. In that movie we hear the line, ``Impossible      things are happening every day.''       As lawmakers, do not tie the hands of researchers because      dollars are limited. Do not tie the hands of researchers from      exploring avenues that may be out of the ordinary.       Emily did not care about the insurance companies and the      drug companies playing the games that they play to control      what happens to people's lives. What she cared about was      playing soccer, learning, sharing her talents, having      birthday parties, being a friend, all the things that      children do best.       We must listen to her story with renewed commitment of why      most of you were elected, to make a difference.       Emily continues to make a difference each time her story is      told. Her video continues to play at fundraisers for      Children's Miracle Network. Each time ``Em's Environmental      Mobile Lab'' (that was purchased through memorials and a      grant) is taken on site to provide hands on learning for the      students at Akron-Westfield Community School, Emily continues      to make a difference. When the CEO of the hospital where      Emily spent so much times says, ``I am a different person      because of what Emily has taught me and that will make me a      better CEO,'' you know that Emily has truly made a      difference!       Have you made that kind of difference? Emily sacrificed her      life so that we, you and I, might see more clearly what our      job is.       A phrase that Emily and her family adopted as their motto      is, ``We can do this together.'' We as her family and friends      are making a difference by addressing you as our      representatives. Now, It is your chance to make a difference,      to vote for additional funding for cancer research, and to      clear the way for the impossible to happen.       ``Let us capture the essence of Emily's spirit, follow her      lead, and make a difference.''
