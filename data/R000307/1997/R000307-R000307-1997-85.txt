 Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, in looking at the Hollings amendment, in addition to giving to the Government the power to control the speech of candidates, as we just discussed in our earlier colloquy, which could be, presumably, $5,000, which would certainly guarantee the election of every incumbent, I would also ask my good friend how he would interpret the following power given to the Government. It says the Government could limit the amount of expenditures that may be made ``by''--I assume that is the candidate--``in support of the candidate, or in opposition to the candidate.''  Now, let me ask my good friend from Kansas, since we would be making the rules here in Congress, and since we would be given the permission to make these rules since this is an amendment to the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States for the first time in history, I ask my good friend from Kansas, might it not be a shrewd move on the part of all incumbents to say that those in support of or in opposition to a candidate cannot speak at all?
