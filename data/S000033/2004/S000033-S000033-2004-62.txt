 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I will close in a minute by saying that what we are talking about here is not a huge sum of money. It is $30 million. And one can always argue that where you take the money there is a reason for that money, and I respect that. But I think the evidence is overwhelming that we are on the cusp of major breakthroughs which can change our entire use of energy in this country and lead us and the entire world to move toward clean, sustainable energy and away from nuclear power, of which we do not know how to dispose of today, and away from fossil fuels, which are causing so many serious environmental problems.  So this amendment is not just a $30 million amendment, but I think it is an indication of the sentiment of this Congress to tell the American people and the world that we are prepared to go forward in a bold new way with huge potential, and so I would urge support for this amendment.
