President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Fischer, Menendez, Casey, Klobuchar and Franken in the introduction of the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Reauthorization Act. This legislation is an extension of ongoing bipartisan efforts in the Senate over the past decade to hopefully one day cure cancers in children, adolescents, and young adults.  I first started working on this issue after meeting the Haight family from Warwick, Rhode Island in June of 2004. Nancy and Vincent lost their son, Ben, when he was just 9 years old to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive tumor in the brain. With the strong support of families like the Haights for increased research into the causes of childhood cancers and improved treatment options, I introduced legislation that eventually was signed into law in 2008 as the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.  Since then, I have worked to secure funding for these efforts, including $6 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to improve the ability of state cancer registries to rapidly collect information on the diagnosis and treatment information of children with cancer, and $1 million for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, to help educate families about treatment options and follow-up care.  Then, last year, I met Grace. Grace, from Providence, RI, is now 10 years old and is a survivor of medulloblastoma, another type of tumor that forms in the brain. Grace and her family reminded me that we must do more to ensure biomedical advances can continue so that better treatments will become available.  With Ben and Grace, and their families, in mind, I have been working to update the original Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.  As such, the reauthorization we are introducing today would help create a comprehensive children's cancer biorepository for researchers to use in searching for biospecimens to study, would improve surveillance of childhood cancer cases, and would require a study of ways to encourage the development of novel treatments.  I am also pleased to be reintroducing the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Act. Through increased research and advances in medical innovation, the population of survivors of childhood cancer has grown from just four percentsurviving more than five years in 1960 to nearly eighty percent today.  Unfortunately, even after beating cancer, as many as \2/3\ of survivors suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, including second cancers and organ damage. This legislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they age, and establish a new pilot program to begin to explore models of care for childhood cancer survivors.  We must do more to ensure that children survive cancer and any late effects so they can live a long, healthy, and productive life. I look forward to working with Senator Fischer, and our colleagues, to see these bills enacted.                                 ______                                       By
