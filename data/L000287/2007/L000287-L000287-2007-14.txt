Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, my colleague, my chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of bipartisanship to thank all of our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, for working together to bring forth this important piece of legislation.  Now is the time, not tomorrow or next week, now is the time to reauthorize and expand SCHIP, because there's nothing, but nothing, more important than the health of our little children. All of our children, all of the poor children are in the same boat, whether black or white, Hispanic, Asian American or Native American. They need health care to grow strong and survive.  We, in Congress, have the best possible health care, and now is the time to deliver that same promise of health to our Nation's children. Suffer the little children. Suffer the little children, all of the children.  The time is always right to do right. We must pass the bill today for the children of America.  Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to at this time yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), a member of the committee.
