President, the Executive Calendar of the Senate notes, on page 5, Calendar No. 1002, James Michael Cole, of the District of Columbia, nominated by the President of the United States to be Deputy Attorney General. That was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, his nomination, on July 20 of this year. We are now into December, and this year is coming to an end. This has taken long enough.  I ask that the No. 2 spot in the Department of Justice be filled, that we not continue to have this vacancy and imperil the important mission of that Department.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session and to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 1002, James Michael Cole, of the District of Columbia, to be Deputy Attorney General; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no interviewing action or debate; that any statements be printed in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
