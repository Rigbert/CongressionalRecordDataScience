SEC. 215. DAM SAFETY PROGRAM.       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the      ``National Dam Safety Program Act of 1996''.       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Dams are an essential part of the national      infrastructure. Dams fail from time to time with catastrophic      results; thus, dam safety is a vital public concern.       (2) Dam failures have caused, and can cause in the future,      enormous loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and      economic and social disruption.       (3) Some dams are at or near the end of their structural,      useful, or operational life. With respect to future dam      failures, the loss, destruction, and disruption can be      substantially reduced through the development and      implementation of dam safety hazard reduction measures,      including--       (A) improved design and construction standards and      practices supported by a national dam performance resource      bank;       (B) safe operations and maintenance procedures;       (C) early warning systems;       (D) coordinated emergency preparedness plans; and       (E) public awareness and involvement programs.       (4) Dam safety problems persist nationwide. The diversity      in Federal and State dam safety programs calls for national      leadership in a cooperative effort involving Federal and      State governments and the private sector. An expertly staffed      and adequately financed dam safety hazard reduction program,      based on Federal, State, local, and private research,      planning, decisionmaking, and contributions, would reduce the      risk of such loss, destruction, and disruption from dam      failure by an amount far greater than the cost of such      program.       (5) There is a fundamental need for a national dam safety      program and the need will continue. An effective national      program in dam safety hazards reduction will require input      from and review by Federal and non-Federal experts in dams      design, construction, operation, and maintenance and in the      practical application of dam failure hazards reduction      measures. At the present time, there is no national dam      safety program.       (6) The coordinating authority for national leadership is      provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's      (hereinafter in this section referred to as ``FEMA'') dam      safety program through Executive Order 12148 in coordination      with appropriate Federal agencies and the States.       (7) While FEMA's dam safety program shall continue as a      proper Federal undertaking and shall provide the foundation      for a National Dam Safety Program, statutory authority to      meet increasing needs and to discharge Federal      responsibilities in national dam safety is needed.       (8) Statutory authority will strengthen FEMA's leadership      role, will codify the national dam safety program, and will      authorize the Director of FEMA (hereinafter in this section      referred to as the ``Director'') to communicate directly with      Congress on authorizations and appropriations and to build      upon the hazard reduction aspects of national dam safety.       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to reduce      the risks to life and property from dam failure in the United      States through the establishment and maintenance of an      effective national dam safety program which will bring      together the Federal and non-Federal communities' expertise      and resources to achieve national dam safety hazard      reduction. It is not the intent of this section to preempt      any other Federal or State authorities nor is the intent of      this section to mandate State participation in the grant      assistance program to be established under this section.       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the following      definitions apply:       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any      Federal agency that designs, finances, constructs, owns,      operates, maintains, or regulates the construction,      operation, or maintenance of any dam.
