Speaker, we owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the American taxpayers to do better. As a body, we can do better, much better.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage each and every one of my colleagues to vote ``no,'' to vote ``no'' on this pointless and harmful piece of legislation. This bill is not worthy of the paper that it is written on. Vote ``no'' on this mean-spirited bill. It is not the way to go.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
