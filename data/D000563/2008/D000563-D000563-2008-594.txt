President, I rise in support of the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007.  After Hurricane Katrina, I had a chance to meet some of the survivors who were displaced by the storm and ended up in Illinois. Many had lost their homes, their jobs, their communities, everything. Nearly 3 years later, some are still picking up the pieces of a former life.  We can't stop every disaster from happening. But we can be prepared, so what happened after Katrina never happens again.  Katrina taught us the importance of being prepared. We need to understand the risks of disaster, prepare homesand communities to withstand disaster, and make sure that once disaster strikes, communities can get back on their feet as quickly as possible.
