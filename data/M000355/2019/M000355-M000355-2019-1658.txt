 President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked, the postcloture time on the R. Clarke Cooper nomination expire at 2:15 p.m. today. I further ask that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. Finally, I ask that following the cloture vote on the R. Clarke Cooper nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. today.
