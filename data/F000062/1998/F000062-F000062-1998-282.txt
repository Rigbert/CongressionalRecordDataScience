 I have a letter from the University of California at San Diego, from the professor of the Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, the Department of Pharmacology, University of California; another one from Dr. Bishop, Nobel laureate, University of California; a letter from the Whitehead Institute; another letter from the University of California from the Vice President of Health Affairs and the Vice Provost of Research; a letter from Dr. Roger Pedersen, professor and research director of the Reproductive Genetics Unit, University of California, San Francisco; and a letter from the Nobel laureate of chemistry to Senator Mack. In 1980, he won the Nobel prize.  I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     University of California,                                 San Diego, CA, February 10, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to urge you to      continue working to protect basic biomedical research in any      proposed human cloning legislation. While we all agree that      ``cloning'' a complete human being is undesirable and      unethical at present, it is very important that any      legislation that is passed not inadvertently block important      research into regenerative technology, or into the creation      of artificially grown human organs for transplantation and      other purposes. For example, as you know the recently      proposed Bond/Frist cloning bill, S. 1599 in the Senate is      far too broad and would ban many related and valuable      research and medical activities. Your bill S. 1602 with      Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) bans the implantation of the      product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's womb.      The language in S. 1602 appears much more reasonable and with      minor modification could be recommended for support by the      scientific community.       For your information, I have reproduced below a statement      from the American Society for Cell Biology on cloning, which      clearly delineates principles that many scientists feel are      most useful in thinking about this important legislative      challenge.``The American Society for Cell Biology Statement on Cloning, January,                                   1998       ``At the request of the National Bioethics Advisory      Commission, the American Society for Cell Biology recommended      in the Spring of 1997 a voluntary international moratorium on      human nuclear transfer for the purpose of creating a new      human being. This would allow scientists and the public the      opportunity to determine the safety and appropriateness of      such experimentation.       ``The ASCB continues to support such a moratorium as a      constructive interim response to the concerns raised by the      cloning of an adult sheep. However, recent events in the U.S.      have escalated and infused new urgency into this debate,      resulting in increased demands for regulatory legislation.       ``The ASCB urges that if legislation is needed, it should      specifically be concerned with the reproduction of a human      being by nuclear transfer. At the same time, any legislation      should not impede or interfere with existing and potential      critical research fundamental to the prevention or cure of      human disease. This research often includes the cloning of      human and animal cell lines and DNA, but not whole human      beings.       ``The National Bioethics Advisory Commission did recommend      a three to five year moratorium on human nuclear transfer for      the purpose of creating a new human being in order to allow      time to evaluate the safety of and public views about such      procedures. The ASCB urges that the Commission's      recommendation be the basis for any federal legislation.''       It is very important that our citizens and legislators      think calmly and carefully about what legislation is passed      in this area. We must ensure that we do not inadvertently      hold back important and valuable medical research. I am sure      that simple and temporary legislation, which doesn't seek to      be too broad in its scope, and introduce many unintended      consequences would be the best strategy. I hope that you will      proceed with great caution.           Sincerely,     Lawrence S.B. Goldstein, Ph.D.                                  ____                                          Whitehead Institute,                                  Cambridge, MA, February 5, 1998.     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am very concerned about efforts to      bring Senate Bill 1599, the Bond bill, to an immediate vote.      While I agree that there should be a national ban on human      cloning, it is essential that any such law protect areas of      critical research that can benefit human health. The Bond      bill's generic ban on the use of ``human somatic cell nuclear      transfer technology,'' would, in fact, be quite damaging to      medical research progress in the United States.       The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop      new cell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and      Alzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on      the repair of spinal cord injuries and severe burns.       I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill      would cause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly      and disabling human diseases. In contrast, Senate     Bill 1602 (the Feinstein/Kennedy bill) focuses on the      implantation of the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer.      By banning implantation, the Feinstein/Kennedy bill would      permit life-saving research to continue and still prohibit      the cloning of human beings.       All major advances in technology raise new ethical, legal,      and social issues. The cloning issues are particularly      complex. I appreciate your efforts to promote widespread and      careful public deliberation and, at the same time to foster      important advances in human health.           Sincerely,                                                   Gerald R. Fink,     Director.                                  ____                                     University of California,                                   Oakland, CA, February 10, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing on behalf of the      University of California to urge you to vote against the      upcoming cloture motion for S. 1601, the cloning bill. While      we recognize the sensitivity and importance of this issue,      the University is concerned that premature legislation on      cloning, however well intentioned, may prove to be too      inclusive, with resulting negative consequences on future      advances in biomedical research.       The current opportunities in biomedical research are      unparalleled. Thousands of experiments are carried out each      day in the university laboratories using routine molecular      and cellular research approaches involving human tissues,      cells and molecules. Over the past two decades, this research      has contributed to major advances in our understanding of the      molecular and cellular basis of human disease. It has led to      important new medical advances, including the production of      human insulin, hepatitis vaccine, and sensitive diagnostics      for AIDS. The scientific techniques involved in cloning      research are very promising in terms of our ability to treat      and manage myriad diseases and disorders, ranging from cancer      to heart disease, to Parkinson's and Alzhemier's, to      infertility and HIV/AIDS. These advances have saved hundreds      of thousands of lives and dramatically reduced health care      costs.       We urge you to vote no on the motion to invoke cloture on      S. 1601, so that there is more time to consider the      implications of cloning legislation. If Congress chooses to      enact legislation, we urge you to make certain that any      legislative language does not prohibit legitimate and      worthwhile scientific research that has the potential to      provide enormous health benefits. We would be happy to offer      our resources as the legislative debate continues.       Thank you for considering our views.           Sincerely,     Cornelius L. Hopper,                                   Vice President, Health Affairs.     Robert N. Shelton,     Vice Provost, Research.                                  ____                                         University of California,                                                San Francisco,                              San Francisco, CA, February 4, 1998.     Hon. Connie Mack,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Mack: I understand that the U.S. Senate is      considering several bills related to human cloning. One of      these bills, introduced by Senator Bond and others, prohibits      human somatic nuclear transfer to be used for the purpose of      creating an embryo. Although this bill, as I understand it,      protects many areas of science, the specific prohibition on      somatic nuclear transfer is unwarranted and potentially      detrimental to medical research.       The fundamental flaw in this legislation is the prohibition      of a technology irrespective of its application. Such      prohibition forecloses on any benefit from the technology,      even if that benefit were in no way objectionable. Many well-     intentioned people fail to understand that somatic cell      nuclear transfer is not limited to cloning an organism. There      are many examples of possible future applications of this      technology to produce healthy tissue for therapeutic      purposes, such as skin grafts for burn patients, or even to      create insulin-producing cells for diabetics. There may also      be applications for cancer patients who need a bone marrow      transplant for whom a match cannot be found.       The Senate should instead address its attention to specific      applications of this technology that are unwanted in our      society, such as creating a new human being.       I hope that you will work to ensure that research on this      promising technology is allowed to continue.           Sincerely,                                                      J.M. Bishop,     Nobel Laureate.                                  ____                                                 February 4, 1998.     Hon. Senator Kennedy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my deep      concern about the negative impact of impending legislation      introduced by Senators Bond, Frist et al. (S. 1599) intended      to regulate cloning of a human being. As an active researcher      in the scientific field of the discovery leading to Dolly, I      understand its implications for basic science and human      health. Dolly's existence proves for the first time that the      genetic material of an adult body cell can be completely      reprogrammed by the egg, thus totally restoring the genetic      potential for specializing into all possible cell types. This      discovery that genetic reprogramming is possible in mammals      is as important to human health as the discovery of      penicillin. Basic research on genetic reprogramming will      likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for numerous      human diseases, including heart disease, diabetes,      neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson disease),      genetic diseases and birth defects. I believe that imprecise,      hastily-written legislation against human cloning, such as S.      1599, will hinder these important research opportunities for      understanding genetic reprogramming of adult cells. Excessive      regulation as specified by S. 1599, including civil penalties      and criminalization, in the area of this new discovery is      likely to thwart the momentum of basic research on genetic      reprogramming and deter the enthusiasm and ability of      researchers poised to make major new contributions in      applying their findings to human health problems.       In no conceivable instance would research on genetic      reprogramming involve cloning of human beings. Indeed,      active, credible researchers and clinicians overwhelmingly      regard cloning a human being as an unethical and      reprehensible act. Last year, working through the Society for      Developmental Biology, I spearheaded a voluntary moratorium      on cloning human beings. This moratorium unequivocally      states that we have no intention to clone human beings,      where this is defined as ``duplication of an existing or      previously existing human being by transferring the      nucleus of a differentiated, somatic cell into an      enucleated human oocyte, and implanting the resulting      product for intrauterine gestation and subsequent birth.''      To date, 15 additional scientific and medical societies,      including the Federation of American Societies for      Experimental Biology, the American Society for      Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for the Study of      Reproduction, together representing more than 60,000      reproductive, developmental, cell and molecular      biologists, have endorsed this moratorium. Historical      precedent (with recombinant DNA technology) indicates that      a voluntary moratorium can deter activities that are      potentially unsafe for humans. It is evident from recent      events that anyone who advocates cloning human beings for      any purpose will be subjected to ostracism and discredited      scientifically. Therefore, I believe that the existing      voluntary moratorium against cloning human beings is an      effective means of regulating the behavior of U.S.      scientists and physicians.       Presently, the fields of developmental biology and human      genetics are at an exciting juncture, where many novel genes      are being identified through the Human Genome Project and      their functions during normal development are being      understood for the first time. In addition, an understanding      of how these genes interact with the internal and external      environment of the cell is emerging for studies such as those      giving rise to Dolly. Deriving the full benefits of these new      insights for human health will require a dedicated and      cooperative research effort by many scientists, including      those who conduct research on human cells and tissues.       In conclusion, there is a great risk that anti-cloning      legislation would deprive the American people of      unprecedented human health benefits. I thus urge extreme      caution in any legal sanctions, such as those included in S.      1599, which would have lasting detrimental effects on our      ability to alleviate human diseases, and would also undermine      the competitive abilities of U.S. scientists in our field.       Respectfully yours,                                         Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics            Unit, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and            Reproductive Science.
