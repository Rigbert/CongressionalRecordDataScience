 Madam Speaker, I was going to ask my friend from Pennsylvania whether he had talked to the Senate and thinks this has any chance of moving this week; and the answer I think I would give is no, it does not. So I agree with him. It would be tragic not to act.  It is tragic that we are acting in a partisan fashion, which almost ensures inaction on this, the last day that we are going to be here. We should be acting in a bipartisan fashion, as I have urged the majority leader to do.  What is a bipartisan fashion?  A, considering the emergency need today and funding the resources necessary to respond to that; B, taking under consideration the substantive legislative changes that can be affected that will help this issue, will send the messages that the gentleman wants to send.  He is my dear friend and a good Member of this body, but I will tell you, this bill has had no hearings, no committee consideration. Yes, there was a partisan task force, but this has had no consideration in this legislative process.  The majority leader, last week told me that there would be no bill that did not get 72 hours' notice. The gentleman knows you have a bill on the floor, which is contingent, of course, on the passage of this, which has had a few hours' notice, at best. Last night, I think at 10 o'clock the Rules Committee met on DACA.  So I will tell my friend that, had we acted in a bipartisan fashion, A, at whatever level of funding we could agree, pass a bill to meet the immediate crisis, B, have hearings on the ramifications of the law that passed with only two votes in opposition--over 405 Members voted for the 2008 legislation. We are changing that without a hearing either in subcommittee, committee, or full committee. That is not the way we ought to be working. That is not good for our country. It is not good for this institution. It is not fair.  I would urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.
