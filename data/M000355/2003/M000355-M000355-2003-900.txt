 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, May 13. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business with Members permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the weekly party lunches.
