 The Feed and Forage Act gives the Department of Defense an open-ended authority to spend money almost without limits. The Department of Defense can invoke the authority whenever it sees fit. No special condition or no special circumstances must be met before that law can be invoked. We need not be at war. We need not be engaged in military combat overseas for the Department of Defense to tap the Treasury without an appropriation. And there is essentially no limit on the amount of money that can be spent. It is like, you might say, Mr. President, an open line of credit.  Now, thank God, no other agency of the Federal Government has this kind of authority. Admittedly, in wartime, when our national security is threatened, this kind of authority may be essential. But, Mr. President, I am concerned about the use of this authority in peacetime, like today. My concerns are fueled by a Pentagon proposal to expand the authority beyond existing law. And remember, I just said that I wish to tell you what I am concerned about what the Department of Defense is thinking about doing.  The original fiscal year 1995 defense supplemental bill as submitted to Congress included a request for special legislative authority. It would be numbered section 1863. Secretary of Defense Perry has referred to section 1863, and these are his words, as his ``readiness preservation authority.'' Readiness preservation authority. I ask unanimous consent to print that language in the Record, too, for my colleagues to study.  There being no obligation, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Excerpt From the 1995 Supplemental Budget      (Supplemental language now requested, existing legislation)       Sec. 1863. During the last two quarters of the current      fiscal year, upon determination by the Secretary of Defense      that such action is necessary in the national interest, he      may, with the approval of the Office of Management and      Budget, incur necessary obligations to preserve the readiness      of the Armed Forces in excess of contract authority and      amounts available in appropriations of the Department of      Defense during the current fiscal year: Provided, That      obligations incurred shall be limited to those which are      required for essential readiness functions and activities of      the Armed Forces, including activities associated with      mission critical proficiency training, scheduled unit      exercises, the acquisition of spare parts that are critical      to the missions of the Armed Forces and such other activities      that the Secretary of Defense determines cannot be postponed      without a major impact on the readiness of the Armed Forces:      Provided further, That obligations incurred under the      foregoing authority shall not be more than 50 percent of the      total amount appropriated to the Department of Defense for      Operation and Maintenance, Budget Activity 1: Provided      further, That any proposal transmitted by the President to      the Congress to liquidate costs incurred under the provisions      of this section shall be accompanied by offsetting rescission      proposals, unless the President determines that emergency      conditions exist which preclude such rescissions: Provided      further, That the Congress shall be notified when funds are      made available for obligations under this authority.       This provision would allow the Department of Defense, with      OMB approval and Congressional notification, to make      obligations in excess of its total budget authority during      the last two quarters of 1995 to fund essential readiness      activities and functions. Excess obligations incurred under      this provision are limited to 50 percent of Budget Activity 1      under the Operation and Maintenance title. Any proposal to      liquidate excess obligations incurred under this provision      must be accompanied by offsetting rescission proposals unless      the President determines that emergency conditions exist      which preclude rescissions.
