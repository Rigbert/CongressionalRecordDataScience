President, I wanted to clarify an important part of this bill. While this bill does grant FDA many new authorities, the savings clauses in this bill--in particular, sections 403(3), 418(1)(3)(B), and 41900(3)(B)--preserve all of FDA's existing authority under both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, am I correct?
