President, I will be very brief because I see other Senators waiting to take the floor. I will note a couple of things. The distinguished majority leader has mentioned that it is Sunday. The guest Chaplain today, Father Paul Lavin of St. Joseph's Church, is my pastor when I am away from my home in Vermont, which is not often on a Sunday.  But this Sunday is extraordinary, that is, being in Washington and not in Vermont.  Father Lavin also prayed for, in the mass this morning which my wife and I attended, the Congress and the Government, and so forth, as we all do.  Sometimes we have to be careful we don't get too much of what we pray for, but I think it would probably be safe to say, as I look around at the staff and everybody else here, that they were probably praying that it would come to a conclusion.  In that respect, I note, Mr. President, as I have in other years, that while I may joke about Senators being nothing but constitutional impediments to the staff, the fact is, the U.S. Senate, the greatest parliamentary body in the world, could not exist without the extraordinarily talented men and women who work on Capitol Hill for Members on both sides of the aisle, for committees, for the Senate itself, and those who take the notes of our proceedings, to those who keep the procedures of the Senate moving.  I say a special compliment to the young men and women who come here and serve as pages, come from all over the country and serve here as pages. I have been fortunate to have had a series of some of the most exemplary young men and women from Vermont who have served here as pages. They go through a rigorous screening process. Only the best get picked. And they go back to be the best among our citizens in our own State.  The people in this country ofttimes do not realize the extraordinary dedication of the men and women who work here who sometimes put in literally around-the-clock hours and days, who literally give of themselves more than any private industry could ever expect of anyone. And that is what makes the Senate work.  My friend from Mississippi and I were discussing earlier putting together this last-minute legislation. Well, we can make some policy decisions, but it is these people who have to then pull it together. For Foreign operations, Tim Rieser, from my staff, carries out my duties as ranking member on that. There are dozens of others on both sides that have to do this--Robin Cleveland for Senator McConnell, who is the chairman of that subcommittee.  And it is the same with all the subcommittees, trying to pull these pieces together and actually have the paper. We stand up and say ``aye'' or ``nay,'' but they have to have the papers on the floor in perfect condition for us to vote on them.  Then, whether it is the people in the Cloakroom, the people back at our offices, or anybody else, they also give up their family time to be here for the good of the country.                          ____________________
