 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I will make some additional points on the Dorgan tax haven included in the Conrad substitute. I share Senator Conrad's concerns about the ability of large corporations to manipulate the Tax Code, to shift large amounts of profit offshore, but this provision is not the right way to address those concerns. It is very overbroad and inadequate. It is overbroad because it harms the competitiveness of United States multinationals, repealing deferral for holding company structuresthat allow them to efficiently allocate active foreign generated resources among their foreign operations without incurring U.S. tax on entirely foreign transactions.  It is inadequate because it applies only to the subsidiaries in black-listed countries. Companies that use tax savings for abusive purposes could easily avoid this rule by locating in a low-tax country that is not on the list.  Ireland would be a perfect example of that, where we read press reports that companies such as Microsoft are shifting huge profits. Treasury would have authority to add countries to the list, but does anyone think Ireland, with whom we already have a tax treaty, would be added to that black list?
