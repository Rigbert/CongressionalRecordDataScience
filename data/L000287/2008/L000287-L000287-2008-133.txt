Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Carl V. Patton, President of Georgia State University, who is retiring June 30 of this year.  For 16 years he has led Georgia State University in its transition from what was considered to be a commuter school into a vibrant research university which is home to more than 28,000 students representing every county in the State, every State in the Nation, and 160 countries.  President Patton not only wrote a bestselling book on public policy, he has practiced his beliefs, providing the leadership to create buildings, departments, knowledge, and solutions vital to our prosperity in the 21st century. As the University has grown physically, it has grown in stature as well. Among President Patton's many accomplishments:  He launched a university-wide planning effort that produced what is known as the ``Main Street Master Plan'', which increases the University's footprint in the downtown community and shapes the University's future growth.  He started the University's first comprehensive capital campaign, securing private funding sources to supplement state allocations for building projects.  Under Dr. Patton's leadership, Georgia State University has expanded its campus using a strategy of acquiring and rehabilitating buildings and, when necessary, constructing new buildings like the Student Center, the Recreation Center, the Aderhold Learning Center, the Rialto Theater, Haas-Howell and Standard Buildings, Robinson College of Business, Commerce Building, North Metro Center, student housing at the Village and the Lofts and now the University Commons. Students, faculty, and staff now occupy floor space from the old Fairlie-Popular district to Grady Hospital. Residence halls full of students with dreams to change the world have replaced dilapidated structures empty of any economic hope. Old banks, tired office buildings, and moribund shells of department stores now bristle with the energy of a new commerce based on knowledge and preparing our young students to take on today's problems with tomorrow's solutions. Downtown Atlanta now is a living, vibrant area 24 hours a day thanks to the presence of thousands of students learning, living, and playing while placing more than $7 million a day into the local economy.  Instead of designing walls to keep the city and its urban ways separate from the campus, President Patton has insisted that the University fully integrate its research, teaching and service mission into the fabric of the urban environment of its downtown Atlanta home.  His vision has included a state-of-the-art urban science park. And, thanks in no small part to the support of this Congress, this science park will support research on the treatment of autism, obesity, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to neuroscience research, Georgia State will employ the efforts of eminent scholars from biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, mathematics, and statistics to better understand the molecular basis of disease.  Finally, each of the six schools that are a part of Georgia State have grown and prospered during President Patton's tenure.  Georgia State has grown into one of this Nation's leading urban-serving research universities reflecting Dr. Patton's vision for a partnership between Atlanta and the University. That vision is best described by his words:  ``It's not just us serving the city. It's not the city serving us. It's the idea of together building a city and a university that are second to none. Georgia State is a source of limitless potential that can be unleashed through a clear understanding of how we generate lasting value to our city, our State, and the Nation. Working with our community, we are able to determine our shared future.''  Dr. Patton has lived his life in the way he hopes his students live theirs, tirelessly volunteering for service in his community through organizations like Central Atlanta Progress, the Rotary, and the Grady Memorial Hospital Corporation. His example and his hard work will not stop at retirement, however, as he plans to continue to live downtown and assist Georgia State in its future endeavors to raise capital and to expand its student body to tackle the tough issues of our times.  Madam Speaker, I am sure I speak for you and my colleagues in the House of Representatives when I say that Dr. Carl V. Patton is the kind of leader we need to set the right example for the future of our country and our students. He has served Georgia State University, the city of Atlanta, the State of Georgia,and the United States of America well. God Bless for a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
