  I know there are some others on the floor who would like to speak. Let me make a few observations here at the outset of the debate. My good friend from Maine mentioned that we had consulted with leaders in the area. The one leader that we have not consulted with is the duly elected leader of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi. Her party won 82 percent of the vote in 1990. She is the legitimately elected head of a Burmese Government that has not been allowed to function. It has not been allowed to function because the State Law and Order Restoration Council simply disallowed the election, put her under house arrest until July 1995, and she still effectively is in that state. They say she is not under arrest anymore, but, in fact, she stays at home most of the time. That is the safest place to stay. She has to sort of smuggle out messages to the rest of the world.  So the one leader we have not consulted, Aung San Suu Kyi, has an opinion about the proposal in the foreign operations bill. The duly elected leader of Burma, receiving 82 percent of the vote, thinks that the approach in the underlying bill is the way to go. Maybe the other people in Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, and other places do not think it is the way to go, but the one who won the election, the Western-style supervised election in 1990, thinks that the only thing that will work are sanctions.
