President, I announced my intention to offer this amendment at an earlier date. Since the announcement of that intention, we have been negotiating with Sallie Mae, the Government-sponsored enterprise which is the largest provider of student loans in the country. The reason for this amendment was a new policy of Sallie Mae, as of a few months ago. In fact, about a year ago Sallie Mae decided to stop reporting repayment information to two of the three major credit bureaus in the United States. It turns out that the Higher Education Act, which governs Sallie Mae, required that defaults on student loans be reported to all three national credit bureaus but, by regulation, positive repayment information only went to one.  As a consequence, many responsible students who had paid off their student loans were not provided the credit information on their own backgrounds so that it was clear that they paid off their loans. So these students who had turned to a credit bureau for a mortgage or a loan on a car would have an outstanding student loan. It worked to their disadvantage. This decision by Sallie Mae worked a terrible disadvantage to students who had done the right thing.  I made it clear to the chairman, Mr. Shelby, as well as Senator Sarbanes, that I thought this was an injustice that needed to be corrected. Fortunately for me and for the students involved, Sallie Mae has sent a letter. I understand Chairman Shelby, if I am not mistaken, has received a copy of this letter from Sallie Mae; is that correct?
