President, I ask unanimous consent that we call up the Stevens, Leahy, Murkowski, Jeffords, Coleman, Stabenow, Collins, and Levin amendment No. 4018 to extend the implementation deadline for the Western Hemisphere initiative by 18 months. I ask unanimous consent that it be allowed to be called up. It will simply be a voice vote.
