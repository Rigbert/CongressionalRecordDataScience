 President, I want to say a few words of thanks.  I would like to thank the members of the Secretary of the Senate's office, which houses everyone from the parliamentarians, to members of the disbursing office, to the clerks, historians, curators, librarians, and many other offices and individuals who keep the history and dignity of this institution alive.  I would like to thank the Sergeant At Arms's office and the many hundreds of individuals who do everything from keeping us safe to setting up rooms for meetings.  I also thank the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, which works daily to preserve this complex, which is more than just a collection of buildings, it is a living part of our Nation's history.  I thank the Capitol Police, who are prepared to put their lives on the line every day to protect everyone who works in and visits the Capitol. We are grateful for everything they do.  There are so many others to thank, from the committees and their staffs, to the doorkeepers, to the legal counsel's office and the pages. I know I am going to forget many individuals who deserve our thanks. Please know we are thankful for your service and your dedication.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the young people who serve in the Chamber as Senate pages be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            REPUBLICAN PAGES       Emma Rose James, Anna Linda Byrd, Anna Carmack, Herbert      Coleman Martinson, Elaina Joy Urban, Ben M. Courtney, Hannah      Elizabeth Michaud, Tatum Buss, John Patrick Tamas, Ally      Grayson Driver, Grace McElroy, Jackson Scott Blackwell,      Cameron Joseph Knecht, Brett David Brannon, Jr., Haley M.      Carbajal, and Easton Ewy.                            DEMOCRATIC PAGES       Jaclyn Cline, Amina Lampkin, Marshall Rawlins, Olivia Rich,      Megan Stewart, Marc Tarshis, Thomas Wiesler, C.J. Fowler,      Ignacio Mata, Bryce Stack, Blaine Stephens, Colin Gray-Hoehn,      Marah Bell, and Aarshi Kibria.  Mr. McCONNELL. On the Member side, allow me to thank my leadership team. Their counsel is invaluable, and their dedication is without equal.  Here on the floor, Laura Dove and her Republican Cloakroom staff have a tough job making things function every single day. Gary Myrick has a tough job on the Democratic side as well. They deserve recognition from both sides of the aisle for what they do.  I particularly would like to thank my chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, for her remarkable work ethic and her obvious talent. She has an impressive team behind her. There are so many I can name, but then we would be here all day, so let me say something they already know. I am certainly thankful for what Sharon and her whole team do every single day.  I know the Democratic leader feels the same way about his chief, Drew Willison, and the members of his staff.  Let me acknowledge his kind words yesterday as well. We both have difficult jobs, and, in my view, the Senators can have strong political disagreements without personal animosity always accompanying it. I think many of the 99 other Members of this body agree with that sentiment. We can disagree, as we often say, without being disagreeable. That is how this institution is supposed to function, after all.  I thank Senators for their service to this institution. We signed up for a rather challenging job. We often have different ideas about what serving our constituents means, but, as we have proved so often this year, we can still come together to accomplish important things for our country on education, transportation, and so many issues, just as we saw again a few minutes ago with passage of a significant cyber security measure, long-overdue improvements to the Visa Waiver Program, tax relief for families and small businesses, and other important matters.  I thanked the chairman of the Finance Committee the other day for his impressive work on the tax side of that legislation. Senator Hatch has been an invaluable ally working those issues.  Passage of the visa waiver reform and cyber security legislation are both notable accomplishments for our country, and neither would have been possible without the continued hard work of the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Ron Johnson. I would like to express sincere gratitude to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, for his work on cyber security too.  I know there are many others to thank--the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the leadership and members of all the committees who worked many long hours recently in particular.  I apologize to those I haven't been able to mention, but I want to thank them and to say simply this: I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year, and happy holidays to everyone. See you in 2016. Rest up because we still have a lot of work to do for the American people.
