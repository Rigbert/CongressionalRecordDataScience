Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 728.  Last Saturday President Clinton in his weekly radio address came out strongly opposed to this bill, saying that it would do away with the commitment that he and Congress made on the 100,000 cops on the beat that were promised in last year's crime bill. Unfortunately, the President is sorely misinformed on how much money is available in his own crime bill, and I believe he ought to apologize to the American people for spreading such misinformation around.                              {time}  1600  Let us look at the numbers in last year's crime bill and what is proposed in H.R. 728, and the American people will see that H.R. 728 has the potential of putting more cops on the beat than the crime bill that President Clinton signed into law last year.  Last year's crime bill provides $8.8 billion for community policing over a 6-year period. That is $1.47 billion a year. If the President says that that will pay for 100,000 police on the beat, that means that there is an average Federal payment of $14,700 per police officer.  The average cost of a police officer is about $70,000 a year, including the training and equipment expenses, as well as the expenses of hiring a new employee. That means that only about 21 percent of the total commitment of 100,000 cops on the beat will end up being funded by the Federal Government. So 21,000 cops is in the Democrat crime bill, which is a far cry from the 100,000 that the President and the supporters of last year's crime bill are claiming.  If you put it another way, if you subtract the Federal funding of the $8.8 billion from what it would cost to put 100,000 cops on the beat, the local communities will have to come up with $33 billion more in property tax revenue in order to put that number of police officers on the beat.  So the numbers that the President talked about simply do not add up, and I think that he and those who are using the 100,000 number ought to withdraw those claims quite promptly, because the money from the Federal Government simply is not there.  Now, with all of these figures on the table, why is H.R. 728 a better approach? First, it increases the block grant for police to a potential of $10 billion over 5 years. It takes away the strings that local governments have to put property taxpayers' money into paying for some of those expenses. The $10 billion a year is on the assumption that the local communities would spend all of the Federal money on more police and none of it on prevention programs, such as midnight basketball and prisoner self-esteem.  Second, it is the local communities that decide how this money should be spent. What is true in New York City and what the needs are in Detroit is not necessarily what the needs are in Menomonee Falls, WI, or Orlando, FL, or some districts that are completely rural.  The beauty of block grants is that each community makes that determination for itself following a review of the advisory committee that was outlined by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum].  Now, I think that the advisory committee and the types of public hearings that have to be held before the actual expenditures are made is the perfect check against money being wasted by local government. But even if it is, that determination can be made by the voters in each local jurisdiction when they go to vote to reelect their mayors or town chairmen and their council members, because come election time, the mayor that has fettered away Federal law enforcement funds on things that do not make any sense at all would be hard pressed to explain to the voters of his or her community why the decision was made.  So that accountability and that responsibility to the voters of a particular community is the best check against the dissipation of the Federal funds to things that are not effective that there is.  Let us face it: Press and public scrutiny of government decisions at all levels of government is much stronger now than it was during the terrible years of the LEAA. I want to put my faith in local government. This whole question and this whole debate is a question of money and a question of control. I think that local government will do a much better job in spending this money wisely than keeping the control in Washington and the U.S. Department of Justice.
