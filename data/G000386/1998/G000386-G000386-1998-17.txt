 I would like to make one additional point which I believeyou just made in your comments. I understand that the intention of the Conference was that the children of all Customs Service employees would be eligible to attend the DOD school in Puerto Rico. The Conferees did not intend to limit this eligibility to a single category of Customs Service employee. The Statement of Managers language in the Conference Report refers to Customs Agents. Some may interpret this to mean that only children of agents were eligible to attend the DOD school.
