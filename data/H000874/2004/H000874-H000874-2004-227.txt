Am I correct in presuming that that means that those under $26,000 will be covered as well as those over $26,000. As was the case with the Senate amendment that came over to the House?  Mr. DeLAY. I really hesitate to comment on what the content of the bill will be as we bring it to the floor next week. My understanding, as I have been advised, is the child tax credit that was to be given in 2006 will be accelerated to 2005, so that should cover the gentleman's concerns.                              {time}  1645
