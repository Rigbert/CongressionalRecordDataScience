Speaker, 2 weeks ago, Democrats made a clear and powerful statement that we will not stand silent as thousands of Americans are victimized by gun violence.  John Lewis, John Larson, and more than 100 other Democratic Members didn't hold this floor for 26 straight hours--and hold events with thousands of people across the country just last week--just to get a vote on legislation that won't make Americans safer. This week, Republicans will have a vote on a bill that was written by the NRA and would not address the scourge of gun violence.  The American people deserve a vote on legislation that will actually keep those under investigation for terrorism from purchasing guns legally in our country, bipartisan legislation like Republican Representative Peter King's no fly, no buy bill. They also deserve a vote on legislation that would strengthen and make comprehensive background checks.                          ____________________
