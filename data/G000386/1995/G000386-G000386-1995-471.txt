 President, let us take a look at the amendments that might be brought up. I hope they will not all be brought up:  One by Senator Bryan dealing with pensions. One by Senator Byrd that is described as a relevant amendment. We have four by Senator Feinstein dealing with campaign finance reform. We have one by Senator Ford that is an amendment pending dealing with frequent flier miles. Also, another one described as a relevant amendment. We have a manager's amendment by our friend Senator Glenn. Senator Graham, of Florida, has an amendment that is in the process of being drafted of which we have no description. Senator Kerry has an amendment dealing with leadership PAC's and campaign fund conversion for personal use. Senator Lautenberg has an amendment that is described as a relevant amendment. Senator Leahy dealing with employment rights. Senator Levin, another one described as relevant. Senator Reid, described as relevant. And Senator Wellstone has several, two that deal with gift ban, three that deal with campaign finance reform, one with health care, and two described as relevant.  I think that anybody in this body or anybody listening throughout the country would probably realize that each of these amendments, at least those that we have a description of, are legitimate subjects for discussion within this body. Most of them--not all of them--but most of them have already been alluded to by the Senate majority leader by his saying that before just a few short months are up, all of these issues will be discussed. The issue of gifts and the issue of lobbying reform have all been described by Senator Dole, the majority leader, as issues that he intends to give any Member of this body an opportunity to go as indepth as they want to on any of these issues.  So there is not any issue on this set of pending amendments that will not have an opportunity to be discussed; in [[Page S622]] other words, it will have an opportunity to be discussed the first half of this year, for sure.  So I urge my colleagues who are very sincere about what they are trying to accomplish through these amendments to maybe not offer these amendments on the bill that is before us.  Then that brings me to further discussion of the bill that is before us, because this is a bill that the people of this country have been demanding that we pass for quite a few years now, to correct a situation where in this country there are two sets of laws: One for Capitol Hill and one for the rest of the country; one for Pennsylvania Avenue, DC, and the other for Main Street, USA; where there is one set of laws for the Congress as an employer, or we individual Senators and Congressmen and women as employers because we hire staff, and another set of laws for every other employer in America. There is one set of protections for people in the private sector whose employees are protected by the employment, safety and civil rights laws, but no protection, or very little protection, for employees on Capitol Hill.  We have a situation of one set of laws applying to one part of the country and those laws not applying to Capitol Hill. Under the laws that apply outside Capitol Hill, employers of America can be intimidated and harassed and fined and maybe even put out of business by regulators and inspectors and various employees of Federal enforcement agencies coming around to their place of business to enforce those laws; whereas we, as an institution of Congress and an employer and we as individual Senators--and we happen to be employers of staff--we do not have to worry about that sort of intimidation and harassment and fined by regulators coming around and inspecting our offices and looking into our employment practices because we are not covered by those laws.  We have a situation where the private-sector employers understand that intimidation and they understand the egregiousness and the cost of legislation on their operation. We on Capitol Hill, because we have exempted ourselves from this series of legislation since the 1930's, do not know about that cost, do not know about the paying a fine, do not know about the intimidation that the private sector feels.  So for a long period of time--and I have been involved in sponsoring this legislation for 7 or 8 years--but for a long period of time, people in the private sector, understanding the unfairness of the situation, the American people have asked Congress to end that situation of dual statutes. They have asked Congress to end the unfair situation where we have exempted ourselves from this legislation.  The legislation that passed the House of Representatives did that. It passed unanimously in the other body. Senator Dole made a commitment a long time ago, after the Republicans had become the majority again as a result of the last election, that this bill would be No. 1 up on the floor of this body.  So we have the Congressional Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill sponsored by myself and by Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, to carry on from where the House left off, to end this situation. We discussed this bill all day Thursday, all day Friday and today is the third day. We are going to be on it, as Senator Dole said, until about 7 o'clock tomorrow night when we hope to pass it. Four days to pass legislation that unanimously has passed the House of Representatives and which everyone agrees is a situation that should be rectified.  But we have not spent much time in debate on the floor of this body discussing the merits of the legislation. We have had speeches by the Democratic manager, Senator Glenn, myself, Senator Lieberman, the main cosponsor, Members on both sides of the aisle gave some opening statements about why they support the legislation but no amendments to change the basic legislation.  We had 6 or 7 amendments last week, all of them tabled, unrelated amendments to the Congressional Accountability Act that we had to deal with because under the rules of the Senate those amendments can be offered even if they do not concern the subject matter of the basic underlying legislation.  Again, I would say, as I said about the amendments that are pending, that might be offered yet today and tomorrow, there was not a single issue that has been offered by my colleagues that is not a legitimate subject for discussion on the floor of this body. But again, whether those amendments were Thursday or Friday or today and tomorrow, they all fit into the category of issues that Senator Dole is going to give everybody an opportunity to participate in the debate and bills where those amendments are more germane to the subject.  So I think, since there is not opposition to the underlying legislation, we ought to be able to just get this behind us and move on and respond to what the people said in the election on November 8; that they no longer wanted business as usual in Washington, DC. And there is no better example of business as usual than for Congress to continue its exemption from employment and safety and civil rights laws that apply to the rest of the Nation but have not applied to us.  The House has demonstrated, for sure, it is not business as usual because they passed the bill with just a few minutes of discussion and unanimously. I wish we could do as well in the Senate. It looks as if the legislation will pass and we will end this dual system of lawmaking, and end our exemptions, but it is just taking a little bit longer than it should.  It is also important that we move on to other important pieces of legislation that are in the contract that we have with America: Unfunded mandates, the next bill that will be coming up on the floor of this body, so that we do not make policy here in Washington and then make Governors and legislators and mayors and councils raise their local taxes to pay for a policy we will not pay for here in Washington. Then we move on to a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, and then move on to a line-item veto, welfare reform, then moving term limits for Members of Congress, tort reform, and two or three other things such as tax relief and crime that we have a contract with America to pass within the first few months.  Then we have still the part of the year, the spring, the summer and the fall, when most of the work around here gets done in the late night hours. Maybe we will not have to work so late at night so long as we are working early in the year.  So I appreciate that scheduling and that better management of the calendar. But there will be plenty of opportunities to deal with all these very important amendments that my colleagues want to offer to this bill even though they are not relevant to the bill. I hope we will see some of these amendments not actually offered, and I hope that we can get agreement to time limits on these amendments when they will be offered.  I wish, as my good friend, Senator Glenn, has already stated, Senators would come over here and offer these amendments.  I am going to yield the floor, but before I do, Mr. President, I would like to have a section-by-section analysis of the legislation that Senator Lieberman and I have introduced submitted and printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Section-by-Section Analysis                         Section 1--Short Title       This act may be cited as the ``Congressional Accountability      Act of 1995''.                            Title I--General                        Section 101--Definitions       This section defines terms used throughout this act, as      follows:       (1) The term ``Board'' means the Board of Directors of the      Office of Compliance, which has authority under this act to      promulgate regulations for the implementation of the laws      made applicable by this act and to review decisions of      hearing officers in cases brought under the dispute      resolution process created by this act.

Section 102--Application of Laws       Section 102(a) enumerates the statutes, as prescribed by      this act, that are made applicable to the legislative branch.      These are (1) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) Title      VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) the Americans with      Disabilities Act of 1990; (4) Age Discrimination in      Employment Act of 1967; (5) Family and Medical Leave Act of      1993; (6) Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (7)      Federal Service Labor Management Relations Act; (8) Employee      Polygraph Protection Act of 1988; (9) Worker Adjustment and      Retraining Notification Act; (10) Rehabilitation Act of 1973;      (11) Veterans Reemployment Act.       Section 102(b) requires the Board of review statutes and      regulations relating to the terms and conditions of      employment and access to public services and accommodations.      Beginning on December 31, 1996, and every 2 years thereafter,      the Board is to report on whether these provisions apply to      the legislative branch, and to what degree, and whether      provisions inapplicable or less than fully applicable should      be changed to govern Congress. Thus, the Board will review      laws already in existence at the time of enactment that are      not addressed or fully addressed by this act, and will, in      the future consider as well legislation enacted after the      enactment of this act. Each report will be printed in the      Congressional Record and referred to the House of      Representatives and Senate committees of appropriate      jurisdiction.       Section 102(b) requires each committee report accompanying      a bill or joint resolution relating to terms and conditions      of employment or access to public services or accommodations      to describe the manner in which the bill applies to Congress.      In the event the provision is not applicable to Congress, the      report will contain a statement of reasons for its      inapplicability. If such requirement is not followed, it      shall not be in order for either House to consider the bill.      On a majority vote of that House, this point of order can be      waived.             Title II--Extension of Rights and Protections   Section 201--Rights and Protections Under Laws Against Employment                                Procedures       Civil Rights. Section 201(a) sets forth the basic rights to      freedom from employment discrimination on the basis of race,      color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or      disability, that are extended to all employees covered under      this act. By defining the rights guaranteed under this act by      reference to existing statutes, the Act incorporates the      interpretations of those rights as developed in case law.       Applicable remedies. In addition to setting forth the      rights to freedom from employment discrimination, this      section (in subsection (b)) sets forth the remedies available      to employees who prove a violation of those rights in      proceedings before hearing officer, or in Federal district      court. With respect to claims of discrimination on the basis      of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the      remedies are those that would be available to private      employees under sections 706(g) and 706(k) of title VII (42      U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(G), 2000e-5(k)), including reinstatement,      back pay, and attorney's fees. For these claims, the Act      incorporates the waiver of sovereign immunity from interest      for delay in payment that applies to the executive branch      under section 717(d) of title VII (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000E-     16(d)), as provided in section 225(b). Employees are also      entitled to compensatory damages available under section 1977      and sections 1977(A)(a) and (b)(2) of the revised statutes      (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981, 1981A(a), (b)(2)). Damages under title      VII may not exceed, for each employee, and without regard to      the size of the employing office, $300,000, the same maximum      figure that applies to large private employers.       With respect to age discrimination claims, employees are      entitled to the same remedies as are available under section      15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C.      Sec. 633a(C)) available to Federal employees who prove age      discrimination. The waiver provisions of section 7(f) of that      Act also apply to covered employees. 29 U.S.C. 626(f). In      regard to claims of discrimination on the basis of handicap      within the meaning of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act      of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 791), employees are entitled to the      same remedies as are available to Federal employees under      section 505(a)(1) of that act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 794a(a)(1)), as      well as the compensatory damages provisions described above      under Title VII. For claims of discrimination on the basis of      disability within the meaning of sections 102-104 of the      Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, employees are      entitled to the remedies as are available under section 107      of that Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12117(a)), as well as the title      VII compensatory damages.       As under current law with respect to Federal employees,      punitive damages are not available for any claims under this      section.       Section 201 is also made applicable to instrumentalities of      Congress.       Effective date. This section is effective one year after      enactment.Section 202--Rights and Protections Under the Family and Medical Leave                                   Act       Family and medical leave. This section provides employees      with the rights to family and medical leave provided to      private employees under sections 101 through 105 of the      Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. For purposes of      applying those sections, the term ``eligible employee'' as      used in the Family and Medical Leave Act is defined so that a      covered employee within the Senate, the House of      Representatives, or of the Congressional instrumentalities      covered by this act, earns his or her entitlement to family      and medical leave without respect to transfers between      employing offices. For example, once an employee has been a      covered employee for at least twelve months, and works for at      least 1250 hours during the previous twelve months, he or she      is an eligible employee for purposes of family and medical      leave, irrespective of whether he or she changes employing      offices.       This section makes title I of the Family and Medical Leave      Act, rather than title II, applicable to the General      Accounting Office and the Library of Congress, beginning one      year after the date of completion of the study referred to in      section 230.       Applicable remedies. The remedies for a violation of the      rights conferred by this section are the same remedies that      would be available to a private employee under section      107(a)(1) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29      U.S.C. Sec. 2617(a)(1), which includes damages, liquidated      damages and interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The      remedies and protections under this act provide rights over a      one year period. Accordingly, the Board is to ensure that the      six month statute of limitations that applies under this act      is applied in such a way as to ensure the possibility that      employees will have six months to seek to redress violations      of any rights conferred by the Family and Medical Leave Act.       Under this section, and various other sections of the bill,      the Board is given authority to issue regulations to enforce      the Family and Medical Leave Act. Such regulations shall be      the same as the substantive regulations issued by the      Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions      referred to in subsection (a), except insofar as the Board      may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with      the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would      be more effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section.       ``Good cause'' is a term of art in the Administrative      Procedures Act. This is a narrow phrase. It does not provide      an escape hatch for the Board to deviate from executive      branch regulations except for substantial justification. I      expect courts to interpret the term ``good cause'' narrowly      here, just as they have done with respect to the equivalent      term in the Administrative Procedures Act.       Effective date. This section is effective one year after      the enactment of this act. Section 203--Rights and Protections Under the Fair Labor Standards Act       Minimum wage, maximum hours, and equal pay. This section      provides employees with rights to minimum wage, equal pay,      maximum hours, afforded private and other public employees      under sections 6(a)(1), 6(d), 7 and 12(c) of the Fair Labor      Standards Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1), 206(d), 207,      212(c). As in the private sector, employees may not be      provided compensatory leave in lieu of overtime compensation.      For the purposes of this section, the term ``covered      employee'' does not include an intern as defined by      regulation. [[Page S624]]        The exemptions for certain employees, set forth in section      13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C.      Sec. 213(a)(1)), also apply under this act. Employees who are      employed in a ``bona fide executive, administrative, or      professional capacity'' are not covered by the minimum wage      and maximum hours provisions. Volunteers are also excluded      from coverage if they receive no compensation or are paid      expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee for their      services, and such services are not the same type of services      for which the individual is employed.       Applicable remedies. The remedies for a violation of the      rights conferred by this section shall be the remedies that      would be available to other employees under section 16(b) of      the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b)),      which includes unpaid minimum or overtime wages, liquidated      damages, attorney's fees, and costs.       Regulations issued by the Board. This section also directs      the Board to promulgate rules, pursuant to section 304 of      this act, that are necessary to implement the rights and      protections under this section. This would include rules on      what employees are exempt from the minimum wage and maximum      hours requirements, the definition of an intern, and which      employees' work depends directly on the schedule of the House      of Representatives and Senate. ``Directly'' is to be strictly      limited to those employees who are essentially floor staff.      Regulations issued by the Board are to be the same as      substantive regulations issued under the Fair labor Standards      Act by the Secretary of Labor, unless the Board determines      that a different rule would be more effective for      implementation of the rights and protections of this act.  Effective date. Subsections (a) and (b) of this section are effective one year after enactment of this act.   Section 204--Rights and Protections Under the Employee Polygraph                          Protection Act of 1988       Under this section, no employing Office, irrespective of      whether a covered employee works in that Office may require a      covered employee to take a lie detector test where such a      test would be prohibited if required under paragraphs (1),      (2), or (3) of section 3 of the Employee Protection Act of      1988 (29 U.S.C. 2002 (1), (2), (3). For purposes of this      section, the term ``covered employee'' includes the employees      of the General Accounting Office and Library of Congress. The      term ``employing Office'' includes the General Accounting      Office and Library of Congress. However, nothing in this      section precludes the Capitol Police from using lie detectors      in accordance with regulations issued under subsection (c).       The remedies available for a violation of this section are      the appropriate remedies under section 6(c)(1) of the      Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C.      20005(c)(1). In addition, the waiver provisions of section      6(d) of the act (29 U.S.C. 2005(d)) shall apply.       The Board is empowered to issue regulations to implement      this section under section 304 of this act. These regulations      shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the      Secretary of Labor to implement the underlying statute,      except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause,      that a modification of such regulations would be more      effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section.       The effective date for this section is one year after the      date of enactment of this act, except with respect to the      General Accounting Office and Library of Congress, for which      the effective date shall be one year after the transmission      to Congress of the study authorized in section 230.  Section 205--Rights and Protections Under the Worker Adjustment and                       Retraining Notification Act       This section provides that no employing office shall be      closed or a mass layoff ordered within the meaning of section      3 of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act      (29 U.S.C. 1202) until the end of a 60-day period after the      employing office serves written notice of such prospective      closing or layoff to representatives of covered employees or,      if there are no representatives, to covered employees. For      purposes of this section, the term ``covered employee''      includes employees of the General Accounting Office and      Library of Congress and the term ``employing office''      includes the General Accounting Office and Library of      Congress.       The remedies available for a violation of the rights      conferred by this section shall be such remedy as would be      appropriate under paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of section 5      of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29      U.S.C. 2104(a) (1), (2), (4)). Under this statute, a specific      rule affecting coverage is contained in section 225(f)(2).       The Board shall issue regulations pursuant to section 304      to issue regulations to implement this section. These      regulations shall be the same as substantive regulations      promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the      statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except      insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown,      that a modification of such regulations would be more      effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section.       This section is effective one year after the date of      enactment of this act, except in the case of the General      Accounting Office and Library of Congress, where the      effective date will be one year after transmission to the      Congress of the study provided for in section 230. Section 206--Rights and Protections Relating to Veterans' Employment                             and Reemployment       This section prohibits an employing office from (1)      discriminating, within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b)      of section 4311 of title 38, United States Code, against an      eligible employee; (2) denying an eligible employee      reemployment rights within the meaning of sections 4312 and      4313 of title 38, United States Code; or (3) denying an      eligible employee benefits within the meaning of sections      4316, 4317, and 4318 of title 38, United States Code. For      purposes of this section, the term ``eligible employee''      means a covered employee performing service in the uniformed      services, within the meaning of section 4303(13) of title 38,      United States Code, whose service has not been terminated      upon occurrence of any of the events enumerated in section      4304 of title 38, United States Code. For purposes of this      section, the term ``covered employee'' includes employees of      the General Accounting Office and Library of Congress, and      the term ``employing office'' includes the General Accounting      Office and the Library of Congress.       The remedy available for violation of this section shall be      the remedies available under paragraphs (1), (2)(A), and (3)      of section 4323(c) of chapter 43 of title 38, United States      Code. These remedies shall be in addition to, and not      substitutes for, any existing remedies available to covered      employees under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.       The Board, pursuant to section 304, shall issue regulations      to implement this section. These regulations shall be the      same as substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of      Labor to implement the underlying statutory provisions except      to the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause      shown, that a modification of such regulations would be more      effective for the implementation of the rights and provisions      under this section.       The effective date of this section is one year after      enactment of this act, except as to the General Accounting      Office and Library of Congress, where the effective date      shall be one year after transmittal to Congress of the study      authorized under section 230.          Section 207--Prohibition of Intimidation of Reprisal       This section provides one uniform remedy for intimidation      or reprisal taken against covered employees for exercising      rights and pursuing remedies of violations for the violation      of rights conferred by this act. Under this section, it is      unlawful for an employing office to take reprisal against, or      otherwise discriminate against, any covered employee because      the covered employee has opposed any practice made unlawful      by this act, or because the covered employee has initiated      proceedings, made a charge, or testified, assisted, or      participated in any manner in a hearing or other proceeding      under this act. The remedy available for a violation of this      subsection shall be such legal or equitable remedy as would      be appropriate.     Section 210--Rights and Protections Under the Americans With                             Disabilities Act       This section applies the protections of title II and III of      the Americans With Disabilities Act, which concern rights      other than employment discrimination, to each office of the      Senate, each office of the House of Representatives, each      Joint Committee, the Office of the Architect, the Capitol      Guide Board, Capitol Police Board, Congressional Budget      Office, Office of Technology Assessment, Office of      Compliance, and Office of the Attending Physician. It      prohibits discrimination in the provision of public services      on the basis of disability, within the meaning of sections      201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309 of the Americans With      Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182-     83 and 12189). For purposes of the application of the      Americans With Disabilities Act under this section, the      covered congressional entities are deemed to be public      entities.       The protection afforded by this section applies to any      individual with a disability as defined in section 201(s) of      the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.      Sec. 12131(2)). However, with respect to any claim of      employment discrimination on the basis of disability made by      any employee covered under this act, the exclusive remedy      shall be under section 201 of this act.       Applicable remedies. The remedies for discrimination in      public services prohibited by this section shall be the      remedies that would be available under section 203 or 308(a)      of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 12133, 12188(a)). Section 203 and 308(a) of the ADA      incorporates the remedies under section 505 of the      Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794A). This includes      equitable relief, attorneys fees, and costs. It does not      include the remedial procedures described in section 717 that      involves the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which      is not provided any enforcement authority under this act. Nor      does it include the provisions in title III of the Americans      With Disabilities Act that enable the Attorney General to      seek monetary damages in particular cases.       Procedures for enforcement. Under this section, a qualified      individual with a disability who alleges a violation under      this section may file a charge with the general counsel of      the office of compliance. The general counsel shall      investigate any such charge and, if the general counsel      believes that a violation [[Page S625]] may have occurred and      that mediation may aid in resolving the dispute, the general      counsel may request mediation with the Office under section      403 of this act between the complaining individual and the      entity alleged to have committed the violation. The general      counsel does not participate in the mediation.       If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, and the      general counsel believes that a violation has occurred, the      general counsel may, in his or her discretion, file a      complaint against the entity with the Office. Ordinarily,      once the general counsel concludes that a violation has      occurred, a complaint should be filed; however, in a      particular case, circumstances, such as the de minimis nature      of the violation, may warrant a decision not to file a      complaint.       The Office shall submit the complaint to a hearing officer      for decision under section 405. Any person who has filed a      charge under this section may intervene as of right, with the      full rights of a party. This procedure is established so that      this individual may participate in developing the record for      appeal in the event that the general counsel does not      participate in the judicial appeal.       Any party (including the complaining party who has      intervened) aggrieved by a final decision of a hearing      officer under this section may seek review of the decision by      the Board. Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the      Board may file a petition for review with the United      States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant      to section 407 of this act. This section authorizes      judicial review only of a final decision of the Board.      Decisions of the general counsel not to file a request for      mediation or a complaint, or not to appeal a hearing      officer's decision to the Board, are not subject to      judicial review under this section or under any other      provision of this Act.       Regulations to be issued by the Board. This section directs      the Board to issue rules pursuant to Section 304 of this Act,      to implement the rights and protections under this section.      Any such rules are to be consistent with the regulations      issued by the Attorney General and the Secretary of      Transportation to implement the provisions of the Americans      with Disabilities Act of 1990 referenced in section 210(b) of      this Act. The Board may promulgate rules that differ from      those of the Attorney General and the Secretary of      Transportation only if the Board determines for good cause      shown that a modification would be more effective for the      implementation of the rights and protections under this      section.       Inspections, reporting, and detailees. This section also      provides for regular inspections by the General Counsel of      the covered entities to ensure that they are in compliance      with the requirements of this section. The general counsel is      directed to report at least once each Congress to the Speaker      of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore      of the Senate on the results of the inspections and to      describe any steps necessary to ensure full compliance with      this section.       Under this section, the Attorney General, the Secretary of      Transportation, and the Architectural and Transportation      Barriers Compliance Board may, upon the request of the      general counsel, detail such personnel as may be necessary to      advise and assist the Office in carrying out its duties under      this Section.       A private right of action is provided to any qualified      person under the Americans with Disabilities Act against the      General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office,      and Library of Congress. However, the enforcement authority      of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be      exercised by the Chief Official of the Instrumentality.       Effective date. This section is effective on January 1,      1997, except as to the private right of action against the      instrumentalities, which is effective one year after      transmittal to Congress of the study provided for in section      230. Section 215--Rights and Protections Under the Occupational Safety and             Health Act; Procedures for Remedy of Violations       Protections from workplace hazards. This section      requires employees and employing offices to comply with      the provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and      Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 654). Section 5      requires each employer to furnish employees a workplace      free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to      cause death or serious physical harm and requires both      employers and employees to comply with the Occupational      Safety and Health Standards promulgated by the Secretary      of Labor under section 6 of that act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 655).      The requirement that employers and employees comply with      the Secretary of Labor's standards is subject to variance      granted under subsections (c)(4) and any regulations      promulgated by the Board under subsection (d).       For purposes of this section, the term ``employer'' as used      in the Occupational Safety and Health Act means an employing      office and the term ``employee'' means a covered employee.      For purposes of this section, the term ``employing office''      includes the General Accounting Office and Library of      Congress, and the term ``employee'' includes employees of the      General Accounting Office and Library of Congress.       Applicable remedies. The remedy available for violations      under this section are an order to correct the violation,      including such an order as would be appropriate under section      11 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29      U.S.C. Sec. 662), which include citations issued by the      general counsel.       Procedures for enforcement. The responsibilities for      enforcement of this section are vested in the general counsel      rather than the Secretary of Labor. The Board is given the      responsibility to conduct hearings and review orders that is      vested in the Occupational Safety and Health Review      Commission under section 10(c) of OSHA (29 U.S.C.      Sec. 659(c)) and to the Secretary of Labor with respect to      affirming or modifying abatement requirements, to hear      objections and requests with respect to citations and      notifications. The remedy available under this act for a      violation of OSHA is an order to correct the violation,      including such order as would be appropriate if ordered under      section 13(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of      1970.       Inspections. With respect to inspections, the authorities      granted to the Secretary of Labor in sections 8(a) and 8(f)      of OSHA (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 657(a), (f)) to inspect and      investigate places of employment are to be exercised by the      general counsel. Under this section, there are two possible      scenarios under which inspections will occur: through      employee-initiated requests that the general counsel inspect      particular offices and periodic inspections of all      congressional facilities. The general counsel exercises OSHA      authority with respect to both employee requested and      periodic inspections. Periodic inspections are random. Each      facility is to be inspected each Congress. However, the act      does not provide that employing offices are to receive notice      of the inspections.       Citations. With respect to citations, the authorities      granted to the Secretary of Labor in sections 9 and 10 of      OSHA (29 U.S.C. Sec. 658, 659) to issue citations for      violations or notices of failure to correct violations for      which citations have been issued are vested in the general      counsel. The citation would normally state a date by which      corrective action is to be completed. The citation is to be      issued only against the employing office that is responsible      for the particular violation as determined by regulations      issued by the Board. The general counsel may also issue a      notification to any employing office that the general counsel      believes has failed to correct a violation for which a      citation has been issued within the period permitted for its      correction.       If after issuing a citation or notification, the general      counsel determines that a violation has not been corrected,      the general counsel may file with the Office of Compliance a      complaint against the employing office named in the citation      or notification. Under OSHA, the general counsel can issue a      citation and proceed to file a complaint if the violation      remains unabated. Or the general counsel may file a      notification after the citation is not complied with, and      then file a complaint. The general counsel may not file a      notification without having first filed a citation that has      not been honored. The choice whether to follow a citation      with a complaint once it is evident that there has not been      compliance, or to file a notification before the filing of      the complaint, will normally turn on whether the general      counsel believes that good faith efforts are being undertaken      to comply with the citation, but the time period for complete      remediation of the citation period has expired. The Office      shall submit the complaint to a hearing officer subject to      Board review under the general provisions of the Act      outlining those procedures.       Variances. The Board shall exercise the authorities granted      the Secretary of Labor in sections 6(b)(6) and 6(d) of OSHA      (29 U.S.C. Sec. 655(b)(6) and (d)) to act on any request by      an employer for a temporary order granting a variance from a      standard made applicable by subsection (a). The Board may      refer such a request to a hearing officer for a hearing      conducted in accordance with section 405 of this act and      subject to review under section 406 of this act. The general      counsel or employing office aggrieved by a final decision of      the Board regarding a citation, notification, or variance,      may file a petition for review with the United States Court      of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to section 407.       Compliance date. If a citation of a violation under OSHA is      received, and appropriated funds are necessary to abate the      violation, abatement shall take place as soon as possible,      but no later than the fiscal year following the fiscal year      in which the citations are issued. This permits the Congress      to appropriate funds to remedy OSHA violations during the      standard appropriations timetable where the abatement amount      is large, and avoids disruptions to other functions of the      employing office caused by the unanticipated need for      additional expenditures.       Regulations issued by the Board. The Board shall promulgate      regulations to implement this section. Such regulations shall      be the same as the standards and regulations promulgated by      the Secretary of Labor to implement OSHA with the same      standard for deviation contained elsewhere in the act.       Periodic inspections. At least once each Congress, the      general counsel shall conduct periodic inspections of all      facilities of the Congress for compliance with the      Occupational Safety and Health Act. Based on the result of      each periodic inspection, the general counsel will prepare      and submit a report to the House Speaker, Senate President      pro tempore, and the employing office responsible for      correcting the violation. The report will also contain the      results of the periodic [[Page S626]] inspection, identify      the responsible employing office, describe the actions      necessary to correct any violation, and assess the risks to      employee health and safety associated with any violation. If      a report identifies any violation, the general counsel shall      issue a citation or notice. The general counsel may be      assisted by personnel detailed from the Secretary of Labor,      upon request of the executive director for such assistance.       The bill uses the terms ``employing office'' as a      designative term referring to an office. There is no      requirement that the employing office responsible for the      violation actually be the employing office of the employee      that makes the complaint, for instance.       Effective date. The period from the date of enactment until      December 31, 1996 shall be available to the Office of the      Architect of the Capitol to identify any OSHA violations,      determine costs of compliance, and to take any necessary      abatement actions. The general counsel shall conduct a      thorough inspection prior to July 1, 1996, and report the      results to the Congress. Except as to GAO and Library of      Congress, this section will become effective on January 1,      1997. As to these instrumentalities, this section will take      effect 1 year after transmission to Congress of the study      provided for in section 230.Section 220--Application of Federal Service Labor-Management Relations          Statute; Procedures for Implementation and Enforcement       Labor-management relations. This section applies to      employees and employing offices the rights, protections, and      responsibilities relating to collective bargaining      established for other Federal employees and employers under 5      U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, 7119 through      7122, and 7131. For purposes of applying those provisions      under this section, the term ``agency'' shall be deemed to      mean an employing office.       The remedy for a violation of subsection (a) shall be a      remedy under section 7118(a)(7) of title 5 of the United      States Code as would be appropriate if awarded by the Federal      Labor Relations Authority to remedy a violation of any      provision made applicable by subsection (a).       In applying the Federal service labor-management relations      provisions to employees and employing offices, the Board      shall exercise the authorities of the Federal Labor Relations      Authority under 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7105, 7111 to 7113, 7115,      7117, 7118, and 7122 and of the President under 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 7103(b). Any petition or other submission that would be      submitted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority shall,      under this section be submitted to the Board.       The Board may refer any matter submitted to it under      subparagraph (c)(1) of this section to a hearing officer for      decision pursuant to section 405 of this act. The Board may      direct that the general counsel carry out the Board's      investigative authorities.       Procedures. Under this section, the general counsel shall      exercise the authorities of the general counsel of the      Federal Labor Relations Authority under 5 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 7104 and 7118. Any charge or other submission that,      if submitted under chapter 71 of title 5 would be submitted      to the general counsel of the Federal Labor Relations      Authority shall, if brought under this section, be submitted      to the general counsel. If any person charges an employing      office or a labor organization representing employees with      having engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of      this section within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged      unfair labor practice, the general counsel shall investigate      the charge, and may issue a complaint. A complaint issued by      the general counsel under this section shall be submitted to      a hearing officer for decision under section 405 of this act.       For purposes of applying the Federal service labor-     management relations provisions under this section, the Board      shall exercise the authority of the Federal service impasses      panel under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119. Any request that under those      provisions would be presented to the Federal service impasses      panel shall, if made under this section, be presented to the      Board. At the request of the Board, the director shall      appoint a mediator or mediators to perform the functions of      the Federal service impasses panel under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119.      Ordinarily, the Board should request the appointment of a      mediator and should avoid participating in the mediation of      disputes for which it may have adjudicatory responsibilities.       Regulations to be issued by the Board. The Board shall      promulgate regulations to implement this section. The rules      promulgated under this section shall be the same as the      rules promulgated by the Federal labor relations authority      to implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7102, 7106, 7111 through      7117, 7119 through 7122, and 7131. The Board may      promulgate rules that are not the same as the rules of the      Federal labor relations authority only under the standard      provided as elsewhere in the act, except as provided in      subsection (e).       The Board shall issue rules pursuant to the rulemaking      provisions of section 304 of this act on the manner and      extent to which the rights conferred by this section should      apply to employees who are employed in positions in offices      with a direct connection to the legislative process,      including the personal office of any Member of the House or      the Senate, a standing, select, special, permanent,      temporary, or other committee of the Senate or the House, a      joint committee of Congress, and the offices of various party      officers, including the Office of the Majority and Minority      Leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives. These      rules should be the same as the regulations of the Federal      labor relations authority except to the extent that the Board      may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with      the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would      be more effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section; and that the Board shall      exclude from coverage any covered employees who are employed      in the offices listed in paragraph 2 of subsection (e) if the      Board determines that such exclusion is required because of a      conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest, or      Congress' constitutional responsibilities. Paragraph (h) of      subsection (e) should be construed narrowly. However, one      portion of one office that might fall within this paragraph      would be the employees of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms      who engage in doorkeeping and maintaining order in the      legislative Chamber and who compel the presence of absent      Senators.       A conflict of interest would include, for example, whether      certain classes of employees should be precluded from being      represented by unions affiliated with noncongressional or      non-Federal unions. This separate standard from deviation      from regulations is not a standardless license to roam far      afield from such executive branch regulations. The Board      cannot determine unilaterally that an insupportably broad      view of Congress' constitutional responsibilities means that      no unions of any kind can work in Congress. Without      abdicating its review responsibilities, however, courts      should give more deference to congressional determinations      under this particular regulatory area than to all other      deviations from executive branch regulations made by the      Board.       Effective date. Subsections (a) and (b) of this section      shall be effective on October 1, 1996, except with respect to      the offices listed in subsection (e)(2), to the covered      employees of such offices, and to representatives of such      employees, for which subsections (a) and (b) shall be      effective on the effective date of regulations issued under      subsection (e).                            part e--general       Section 225--Generally Applicable Remedies and Limitations       Under subsection 225(a), if a complainant is a prevailing      party under section 405, 406, 407, or 408, the hearing      officer, Board, or court, as the case may be, may award      attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs as      would be appropriate if awarded under section 706(k) of the      Civil Rights Act of 1964. Although the Board has no authority      to issue regulations under section 201, it does have the      ability under section 303 to issue procedural rules. Such      rules could govern the availability of fees and costs under      section 706(k), so long as the rules were consistent with      court cases interpreting the Civil Rights Act. For example,      some courts have held that the amount of compensatory damages      a prevailing party recovers is relevant to determine a      reasonable fee award, and that recovery of only a portion of      the compensatory damages request can form the basis for      reducing the fee award. Other courts have held that      proportionality cannot be considered in awarding attorney's      fees. Given the conflict among the cases, the Board could      decide which set of cases to follow when it issues its      regulations.       Subsection (b) provides that in any proceeding under      section 405, 406, 407, or 408, the same interest to      compensate for delay in payment shall be made available as      would be appropriate in actions involving the executive      branch under section 717(d) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.      This is an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity as to these      interest payments. Subsection (c) provides, in keeping with      longstanding rules applicable to the Federal Government, that      no civil penalty or punitive damages may be awarded with      respect to any claim under this act.       Subsection (d) provides that except in cases under the      Veterans Reemployment Act, no person may commence an      administrative or judicial proceeding to seek a remedy for      the rights and protections afforded by this act except as      provided in this act.       Subsection (e) provides that only a covered employee who      has undergone and completed the procedures described in      section 402 and 403 may pursue a civil action in court.      Counseling and mediation with the office are preconditions to      bringing any civil action under this act.       Subsection (f) states that except where contrary exemptions      and exemptions appear in this act, the definitions and      exemptions in the laws made applicable by this act shall      apply under this act. This means that although the various 11      laws are made applicable to Congress, the exemptions and      definitions that limit its application in the private sector      limit its applicability to Congress as well and that      regulations of the executive branch interpreting those      definitions and exemptions should ordinarily apply.       Subsection (g) states that the act shall not be construed      to authorize enforcement by the executive branch of this act,      but this does not override the provision that executive      branch employees may be detailed to the Office of Compliance      at the request of the executive director.  Section 230--Study and Recommendations Regarding General Accounting     Office, Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress       This section directs the Administrative Conference of the      United States to study the [[Page S627]] extent to which the      legislative branch employees not covered under this act are      or are not covered by the employment laws made applicable by      this act. This primarily includes employees in the General      Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the      Library of Congress The Administrative Conference should      study the manner and extent to which these employees are      covered under existing laws, and should also study the      regulations and procedures implemented by these congressional      instrumentalities to provide for the enforcement of these      rights and protections.       This study should evaluate not only the extent to which      employees are provided the rights and protections of the laws      made applicable to Congress in this act. But also whether      they are as comprehensive and effective as those provided      under this act. The study should include recommendations for      legislation to extend or improve coverage as well as      recommended improvements in regulations or procedures.      Recommendations for legislation may include recommendations      on clarifying existing legislation where coverage of      legislative branch employees is ambiguous, or can be      determined only by unduly complex parsing of a number of      laws.       The Administrative Office shall submit the study and      recommendations required under this section to the Board      within 2 years after enactment of this act. The Board shall      transmit the study and recommendations head of each      instrumentality or other entity considered in this study and      to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President      pro tempore for referral to the appropriate committees of the      House of Representatives and of the Senate.                    Title III--Office of Compliance           Section 301--Establishment of Office of Compliance       This section creates the Office of Congressional Fair      Employment Practices as an independent office in the      legislative branch of the Government to administer the      dispute resolution process created by this act.       The Office shall be overseen by a board of directors,      which shall be composed of 5 members. A five member board      is the best size to discourage deadlock and to facilitate      effective decisionmaking.\1\     \1\Some management researchers have concluded that      policymaking bodies of five members are preferable to both      larger and small groups. See, U.S. Senate Committee on      Governmental Affairs, Study on Federal Regulation, Vol. IV,      Doc. No. 95-72, July 1977, p. 115.       It is extremely important that the Board function in a      nonpartisan manner. For this reason, the act requires that      all members of the Board be appointed without regard to      political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to      perform the duties of office. Board members shall be      appointed solely on the basis of fitness to perform their      duties under the act, and shall have background and      experience in application of the rights, protections, and      remedies under the laws made applicable to section 102. There      is no assumption that any particular kind of training or      experience is necessary, but a variety of experiences would      qualify an individual for a position on the Board. The act      does not require that any individual member have training or      experience under all of the statutes made applicable by this      act, but members should be selected with a view to providing      the Board as a whole with some expertise in each field of law      within the Board's jurisdiction.       On the other hand, the committee also recognizes that, in      order for the Board to function in Congress's political      environment, and to insulate the Board against claims of      partisanship that will inevitably be raised by persons      dissatisfied with a particular decision, the process for the      selection of the Board members must be fully bipartisan. To      accomplish this, the appointment of members is jointly made      between the Houses and between the parties. Accordingly, the      members shall be appointed jointly by the Speaker of the      House, majority leader of the Senate, and the minority leader      of both Houses. The chair of the Board shall also be      appointed jointly. Appointment of the first 5 members of the      Board shall be completed not later than 90 days after the      date of enactment.       There are certain disqualifications from service as a Board      member. No lobbyist may serve. No Board member may be a      Member of Congress or a former Member. Nor may a Board member      be an officer or employee of the House, Senate, an      instrumentality of Congress, except an officer or employee of      the GAO Personnel Appeals Board, House Office of Fair      Employment Practices, or the Senate Office of Fair Employment      Practices, or a former holder of one of these positions      within 4 years of the date of appointment. These requirements      are critical because the office must, in both appearance and      reality, be independent in order to gain and keep the      confidence of the employees and employers who will utilize      the dispute resolution process created by this act.       Vacancies on the Board are to be filed in the same manner      as the original appointment for the vacant position. Because      the Board is small in number, it will be important to fill      vacancies as quickly as possible, consistent with selecting      the best qualified individuals for these positions.       Terms. The terms of office of the members are staggered so      that, after the first appointments, there will not be      complete turnover of the Board. The appointment is for 5      years and cannot be renewed, except for someone who serves      three years or less. Of the first five members, one shall      serve three years, two for four years, and two for five      years, one of whom shall be chair.       Removal. Members may be removed from office by a majority      vote of the appointing authority. To further ensure the      independence of the Board, members may only be removed for      specific causes including a disability that substantially      prevents the member from carrying out the member's duties,      incompetence, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, a      felony or conduct involving moral turpitude, or holding an      office or employment or engaging in an activity that      disqualifies the individual from service as a member of the      Board. The reason for removal of any member must be stated,      in writing, to the member being removed by the Speaker of the      House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the      Senate.       Compensation and travel expenses. Members may be      compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the      annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level V of the      Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. sec. 5316 for each day      during which the member is engaged in the performance of      board duties. Travel time should be included in the      computation of the time a member has spent engaged in the      performance of board duties.       Members of the Board are entitled to reimbursement for      travel expenses for each day that the member is engaged in      the performance of Board duties away from home or the regular      place of business of the member. The rates for travel      expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, shall be      at rates authorized for employees of agencies under 5 U.S.C.      sec. 5751.       Subsection (h) describes the duties of the office, which      include educating members and other employing authorities of      their duties and employees of their rights under this act. It      is also to provide educational materials on the statutes made      applicable to Congress by this act to employing offices for      new employees. The office shall also compile and publish      statistics on the use of the office by covered employees,      including the number and types of contacts made with the      office, on the number of covered employees who initiated      proceedings under the act, as well as the number of employees      who filed a complaint, the basis for the complaint, and its      disposition. In light of the confidentiality of the      proceedings in the administrative process, this information      should be compiled in a manner that does not reveal the      identity of particular employees or employing offices.       The Board and office shall be subject to oversight by the      Committee of rules and Administration and the Committee on      Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on House      Oversight of the House of Representatives. Oversight      authority of these committees does not extend to the      processing, consideration, or disposition of individual cases      or the unwillingness of the general counsel to file a      complaint regarding particular charges within his or her      responsibility.       The office is to open within 1 year after enactment of this      act. This will provide sufficient time for the Board members      to be selected, the regulations to be issued, and the office      to be staffed.       Financial disclosure reports. Members of the Board will be      required to file financial disclosure reports under the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-521, title I      (5 U.S.C. appendix sections 103(H)(A)(II)II)).           Section 302--Officers, Staff, and Other Personnel       This section provides for the appointment of staff of the      new office.       Executive director. The position of executive director is      modeled after the Director of the Office of Senate Fair      Employment Practices (OSFEP), who administers the Senate's      internal resolution process. Like the Senate's Director of      OSFEP, the Director of the Congressional Office will have the      responsibility of the daily administration of the disputes      resolution system created by this act. This includes      assisting in the development and implementation of rules of      procedures for the dispute resolution process, selecting      hearing officers, counselors, and mediators, and maintaining      the dockets of cases filed with the office.       The Chair, subject to the approval of the Board, shall      appoint, and has the power to remove, the director. As is the      case of members of the Board, selection of a director should      be made solely on the basis of ability to perform the      functions of the job and without regard to political      affiliation. To ensure the appearance of independence and      impartiality of the Director, certain individuals are      precluded from service as Director. These are the same      persons who are ineligible to serve as Directors.       The Chair may set the compensation of the Executive      Director, but the rate of pay may not exceed the annual rate      of basic pay prescribed for level V of the executive schedule      under 5 U.S.C. sec 5316. The Executive Director will serve      a nonrenewable 5-year term, except that the first      Executive Director may serve a nonrenewable 7-year term.       Additionally the office will have two Deputy Directors, one      for each House of Congress. The Deputy Executive Directors      are appointed and removed by the Chair, subject to the      approval of the Board. The appointment shall be made without      regard to political affiliation and with the same      disqualifications that apply to service as Executive      Director. The Deputy Executive Director [[Page S628]] shall      serve a 5-year term, except that the first Deputy Executive      Director shall serve for 6 years. This will mean that the      Deputy Executive Director will serve terms that do not expire      concurrently with the Executive Director.       The Deputy Executive Director shall recommend the      regulations to the Board under section 304(a)(2)(B)(i),      maintain the regulations and all records pertaining to the      regulations, and shall assume such other responsibilities as      may be delegated to the Executive Director.       The Executive Director may appoint, terminate, and fix the      compensation of such staff, including hearing officers,      necessary to enable the office to carry out its functions.      The Executive Director does not have authority to appoint      attorneys to assist the general counsel, which authority is      provided directly to the general counsel. The Executive      Director may request other Government departments or agencies      to detail on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis the      services of the personnel of the department or agency. In      addition, the Executive Director is authorized to procure the      temporary or intermittent services of consultants.       General Counsel. The Chair, subject to the approval of the      board, may appoint and remove a general counsel. This      position does not have an analogy in the Senate fair      employment process. This position and its duties, however,      are modeled on the role of the general counsel in bodies such      as the General Accounting Office Personnel Appeals Board or      the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Under this act, the      general counsel may receive complaints of violations of the      provisions of titles II and III of the Americans With      Disabilities Act made applicable by this act and file and      prosecute complaints in the name of parties making charges of      violations. The general counsel will also conduct workplace      inspections and issue citations of violations of the      requirements of OSHA made applicable by this act. The general      counsel exercises authority comparable to that of the Federal      Labor Relations Authority's General Counsel. The general      counsel also provides representation to the office when it is      named as a respondent in proceedings brought in the Federal      Circuit under this act.       To ensure that the general counsel is, and appears to be,      independent and impartial, certain individuals are precluded      from service as general counsel. These are the same as apply      to the Board of Directors.       The Chair may fix the compensation of the general counsel,      which shall not exceed the annual rate of basic pay      prescribed for level V of the executive schedule under 5      U.S.C. sec. 5316. The general counsel may appoint, terminate,      and fix the compensation of such additional counsel as may be      necessary to carry out the duties of the general counsel. The      term of office of the general counsel is for a single term of      5 years. The general counsel may only be removed for cause.      The act carefully prescribes which officials may be removed      only for cause and which may not.                     Section 303--procedural rules       This section sets forth the procedure for the adoption and      amendment of rules governing the procedures of the Office of      Compliance, including rules concerning hearing officers. The      rules and amendments thereto shall be submitted for      publication in the Congressional Record.       Under subsection (b), the Executive Director shall adopt      the rules referred to in subsection (a) in accordance with      the principles and procedures of the Administrative      Procedures Act. The Executive Director shall publish a notice      of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the APA, but with      publication occurring in the Congressional Record rather than      the Federal Register. Before issuing rules, the Executive      Director shall provide a comment period of at least 30 days      after publication of the notice of rulemaking. Upon adopting      rules, the Executive Director shall transmit notice of such      action along with the rules to the Speaker of the House and      the President pro tempore of the Senate for publication in      the Congressional Record. Rules are considered to be issued      on the date on which they are so published.                  Section 304--substantive regulations       This section sets forth the procedures of issuing      regulations to implement this Act, including regulations the      board is required to issue under title II, including      appropriate application of exemptions under the laws made      applicable in title II. There shall be three sets of      substantive rules, one for each House, and one for other      employing offices.       The authority conferred by this section is authority only      to issue rules that will aid in understanding how the laws      apply to the Congress and does not include the authority to      limit the substantive rights conferred under this act. Thus,      for example, such rules might set forth guidance to Senate      offices as to how the board would interpret the family and      medical leave act's entitlement to unpaid family or medical      leave, in light of the fact that the Senate payroll system      does not have a leave without pay status.       Under subsection (b), the Board shall adopt the regulations      in accordance with the principles and procedures of the      Administrative Procedures Act. Instead of publishing a      general notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal      Register, the Board shall transmit such notice to the Speaker      of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate for      publication in the Congressional Record. Such notice shall      set forth the recommendations of the Deputy Director in      regard to regulations of the House and Senate and of the      executive director for the other employing offices. In this      way, the members of the approving body will know how the      board's proposed regulations differ from the recommendations      of the Deputy Director for their respective house.       Before adopting regulations, the Board shall provide a      comment period of at least 30 days after publication of a      general notice of proposed rulemaking. After considering      comments, the Board shall adopt regulations and transmit      notice of such action together with the regulations to the      Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro      tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional      Record. The Board shall include a recommendation in the      general notice of proposed rulemaking as to whether the      regulations should be approved by resolution of the Senate,      by resolution of the House of Representatives, by concurrent      resolution, or by joint resolution.       Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(i) of      subsection (a) may be approved by the Senate by resolution or      by the Congress by joint or concurrent resolution.      Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(ii) of subsection      (a) may be approved by the House of Representatives by      resolution or by the Congress by concurrent or joint      resolution. Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(iii)      may be approved by Congress by concurrent resolution or by      joint resolution. Upon receipt of a notice of adoption of      regulations, the presiding officers shall refer such notice      and the proposed regulation to the committee or committees of      jurisdiction in that House. The referral is designed to let      the committee determine whether the regulations should be      approved and by which method.       Following approval of regulations by the Congress or one of      its Houses, the Board shall submit the regulations for      publication in the Congressional Record. The date of issuance      of the regulations is the date on which they were published      in the Congressional Record as a result of this procedure.      Regulations shall become effective not less than 60 days      after the regulations are issued, except that an earlier      effective date may be specified for good cause found within      the meaning of section 553(d) of title 5 of the United States      Code.       Amendment to the rules. The Board's rules may be amended in      the same manner as they are initially adopted under this      section. The Board may, in its discretion, dispense with the      publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking of      minor, technical, or urgent amendments when the Board finds      that notices are ``impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to      the public interest'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. sec.      553(B).       Right to petition for rulemaking.--Any person may petition      the Board for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.      However, nothing in this section confers upon any individual      a right to seek judicial review of any action or inaction of      the Board under this section.       In formulating regulations, the Executive Director, Deputy      Directors, and Board shall consult with the chair of the      administrative conference, the Secretary of Labor, the      Federal Labor Relations Authority, and may consult with any      other persons of their choosing.                         Section 305--Expenses       Authorization of Appropriations. In fiscal year 1995, and      each fiscal year thereafter, the Congress authorizes to be      appropriated necessary funds for the expenses of the office      in carrying out its duties. Until money is first appropriated      under this section, but not for a period exceeding 12 months      after the date of enactment of this act, the expenses of the      office shall be paid one-half from the contingent fund of the      Senate and one-half from the contingent fund of the House,      upon vouchers approved by the director.       Witness fees and allowances. Except for employees,      witnesses before a hearing officer or the Board in any      proceeding other than rulemaking are entitled to be paid the      same fee and mileage allowances as are paid to subpoenaed      witnesses in the courts of the United States. It is intended      that, as in the courts, these costs will be borne by the      parties. Employees who are summoned, or assigned by the      employers to testify in their official capacity or to produce      official records before a mediator, hearing officer, or the      Board, shall be entitled to travel expenses under 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 5751. The committee intends for the office to bear these      costs.  Title IV--Administrative and Judicial Dispute--Resolution Procedures       Much of title IV builds on the dispute resolution process      created for the Senate in title III of the Civil Rights Act      of 1991. The most significant changes in this title from the      existing Senate procedures are the addition of the option of      initiating an action in Federal district court following the      initial two stages of dispute resolution and the deletion of      review of each decision by the Senate Ethics Committee. An      opportunity to appeal to the Board is available in the place      of Ethics Committee review.     Section 401--Procedure for consideration of alleged violations       Section 401 lists the procedure for consideration of      alleged violations of the statutes made applicable to      congressional employing offices under part A of title II.      They are [[Page S629]] counseling as provided in section 402,      mediation as provided in section 403, and an election as      provided in section 404 of either (1) a formal complaint and      hearing as provided in section 405, subject to board review      in section 406, and judicial review in the United States      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as provided in      section 407, or (2) a civil action in a district court of the      United States as provided in section 408. However, in the      case of an employee of the Architect of the Capitol or of the      Capitol Police, the Executive Director, after receiving a      request for counseling under section 402, may recommend that      an employee use the grievance procedures of the Architect of      the Capitol or the Capitol Police. The decision to make the      recommendation to the employee is entirely discretionary on      the part of the Executive Director. The decision to follow      the recommendation is entirely discretionary on the employee.      The purpose is to permit employees to use another      administrative remedy that may function well in the eyes of      the employee, without prejudice for further opportunity to      utilize the procedures available through the Office of      Compliance, as the time limitations available for counseling      or mediation shall not apply when during the specific period      that the Executive Director recommends that the employee use      for using the grievance procedures.                        Section 402--Counseling       Initiation. A covered employee shall request counseling      with the Office as a condition for commencing a proceeding      alleging a violation of a law made applicable under part A of      title II of this act. For claims under any of these statutes,      the request for counseling must be made within 180 days after      the date of the alleged violation. A failure to request      counseling within the time required bars an employee from      proceeding under this act to redress violations under these      sections.       Purpose. The purpose of counseling is to provide an      employee with the opportunity to discuss and evaluate the      employee's claims. Under the current Senate system, employees      meet with a counselor who assists them in preparing a      statement of their claims, reviews what other information      might aid in making a determination about whether to proceed      with a claim, and may assist the employee in contacting the      employing office to determine if a dispute can be resolved.      The type of counseling may vary, depending upon the nature of      the problem, the sophistication of the employee, and the      willingness of parties to resolve issues. The purpose of      counseling is neither to discourage nor to encourage further      adversarial proceedings, but rather to assist in identifying      issues at an early stage, so that they can be addressed      appropriately.       Period for counseling. Counseling commences on the date the      request for counseling is received in the Office and      continues for 30 days, unless the employee and the Office      agree to reduce the period. The 30 days begins on the date      the request for counseling is received.       Notification of the end of the counseling period. The      Office is required to notify the employee in writing of the      end of the counseling period.                         Section 403--Mediation       Initiation. A covered employee must request mediation with      the Office no later than 15 days after the date on which the      employee receives notification of the end of the counseling      period. Mediation under section 403 is a precondition for      making the election of procedures provided in section 404.       Mediation process. The Director shall specify one or more      individuals to mediate a dispute, depending upon the      Director's view of what would be most beneficial in a      particular case. In selecting mediators, the Director is      required to consider individuals recommended by organizations      with expertise in mediating or arbitrating personnel matters.      The Director may also consider other individuals with      expertise in this field.       The purpose of the mediation is to resolve disputes at an      early stage in a manner that serves the interests of all      parties. To this end, it is important that both sides      participate in the process. Although parties cannot be forced      to mediate, it is expected that employees and employing      offices will take seriously this opportunity by carefully      assessing the claims of the other party and responding to      reasonable requests for information. The parties to mediation      under section 403(b) may include the Office, the covered      employee, and the employing office. Mediation may occur      through meetings with the parties separately or jointly for      the purpose of resolving the dispute.       Mediation period. Mediation shall occur for 30 days      beginning on the date the request for mediation is received.      The 30-day period may be extended at the joint request of the      covered employee and the employing office. The Office shall      in writing notify the parties to the mediation of the end of      the mediation period.       Independence of the mediation process. In order to protect      the integrity of the mediation process and ensure that      parties have confidence in it, no individual who conducts      mediation may conduct or aid in the hearing conducted under      section 405 with respect to the same matter. In addition, no      individual who participates as a mediator may testify about,      or produce records relating to, that mediation, either      voluntarily or by compulsion, in any proceeding under this      act or before any other investigative or adjudicative entity.                  Section 404--Election of Proceeding       Not later than 90 days after a covered employee receives      notice of the end of the period of mediation, but no sooner      than 30 days after receipt of such notification, such covered      employee may either (1) file a complaint with the Office in      accordance with section 405, or (2) file a civil action in      accordance with section 408 in the United States District      Court for the district in which the employee is employed or      for the District of Columbia.                   Section 405--Complaint and hearing       Complaint. An individual who has made a timely request for      counseling and mediation, has completed those processes, and      has not elected to file a complaint in Federal District Court      under section 408, may file a complaint with the Office. The      complaint must be filed no later than 90 days after receiving      the notice of the end of mediation, but no sooner than 30      days after receiving such notice. The respondent to the      complaint shall be the employing office involved in the      violation or in which the violation is alleged to have      occurred, and about which mediation was conducted.       Appointment of a hearing officer. Upon the filing of a      complaint, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to      the case. The hearing officer may dismiss any claim that the      hearing officer finds to be frivolous or that fails to state      a claim upon which relief can be granted. When the Executive      Director issues rules under section 303, he or she may      consider whether the procedures of title VII can be applied      to these proceedings. For instance, whether employing offices      can be awarded fees when the hearing officer determines that      the complaint is frivolous, groundless, and brought in bad      faith.       No member of the House of Representatives, Senator, officer      of either House, head of an employing office, member of the      board, or covered employee, may be appointed to be a hearing      officer.       The Executive Director is required to develop lists of      individuals experienced in arbitrating or adjudicating the      kinds of personnel and other matters for which hearings may      be conducted under this act. The lists can be composed of      categories of individuals with expertise in particular      fields, or possessing particular skills. In developing the      lists, the Executive Director shall consider candidates      recommended to the Director of the Federal Mediation and      Conciliation Service, the Administrative Conference of the      United States, or other organizations composed of individuals      with expertise in adjudicating or arbitrating the kinds of      matters for which hearings may be conducted under this act,      such as technical matters relating to occupational safety and      health.       In requiring the Executive Director to select individuals      randomly or by rotation from these lists, the act does      not prevent the Executive Director from hiring hearing      officers as full-time employees of the Office or from      selecting hearing officers on the basis of specialized      expertise required for a particular case.       Hearing. Unless a hearing officer dismisses a complaint on      a threshold legal issue, the hearing officer shall conduct a      hearing on the record. The hearing should be conducted as      expeditiously as practical, but in any event must be      commenced no later than 60 days after the filing of the      complaint. The hearing officer should, to the greatest extent      practical, conduct the hearing in accordance with the      principles of 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 554-57.       Discovery. The hearing officer may, in his or her      discretion, permit reasonable prehearing discovery. In      exercising this discretion, hearing officers should be      mindful of the requirement that the hearing is to be      conducted expeditiously and should seek to prevent      repetitious, overly burdensome, and unnecessary discovery.       Subpoenas. In general. At the request of a party, a hearing      officer may issue a subpoena for the attendance of witnesses      and the production of records. Hearing officers should not      issue subpoenas in blank, but rather only issue subpoenas for      specific witnesses or document requests. Ordinarily,      subpoenas should not be required for the production of      testimony or records in this process. Employees and employing      offices have a responsibility to respond to reasonable      discovery requests, without the requirement of compulsory      process.       Where appropriate, the attendance of witnesses and the      production or records may be required from any place within      the United States. Subpoenas shall be served in the manner      provided under rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil      Procedure.       Objections. If a person refuses, on the basis of relevance,      privilege, or other objection, to testify or produce records      in response to a question or to produce records in connection      with a proceeding before a hearing officer, the hearing      officer shall rule on the objection and, if the objection is      overruled, order compliance. The hearing officer shall, at      the request of the witness or any party, and may on the      hearing officer's own initiative, refer the ruling to the      board for review.       Enforcement. If a person fails to comply with a subpoena,      the Board may authorize the General Counsel to apply to an      appropriate United States District Court for an order      requiring that the person appear before the hearing officer      to testify and-or to produce records. The application shall      be made in the judicial district where the hearing is      conducted or where the person refusing to comply is found,      resides, or transacts business. Any failure to obey a lawful      order [[Page S630]] of the district court issued pursuant to      this section may be held by such court to be a civil      contempt thereof.       Service of process. In an action brought in district court      to enforce a subpoena under this section, or in a civil      contempt action under this section, process may be served in      any judicial district in which the individual or entity      refusing or failing to comply resides, transacts business, or      may be found, and subpoenas for witnesses who are required to      attend such proceedings may run into any other district.       Decision. Following any hearing under this section, the      hearing officer shall issue a written decision as      expeditiously as possible, but in no event more than 90 days      after the conclusion of the hearing. Each decision shall      state the issues raised in the complaint, describe the      evidence in the record, contain findings of fact and      conclusions of law, and contain a determination of whether a      violation has occurred, and, where appropriate, order      remedies authorized under title II of this act. The decision      shall be entered in the records of the Office as the final      decision of the hearing officer, and of the Office if such      decision is not appealed under section 406 to the Board. The      Office shall transmit a copy of the decision to each of the      parties.       Precedents. In conducting hearings and deciding cases,      hearing officers are to be guided by judicial decisions under      the statutes made applicable by section 102 and by Board      decisions under this act.                    Section 406--Appeal to the Board       In general. Any party aggrieved by the decision of a      hearing officer under section 405(g) may seek review by      filing a petition for review in the Office not later than 30      days after notice by the Office of the entry in the Office      records of the final decision of the hearing officer.       Opportunity for argument. The Board shall provide the      parties with a reasonable opportunity to be heard on their      appeal through written submissions. In the discretion of the      Board, the parties may be heard through oral argument.       Standard of review. The standard of review to be applied by      the Board is the same standard that will be applied by the      Federal Circuit sitting in review of the Board's decisions.      The Board shall set aside a decision of a hearing officer      only if the Board determines that the decision is arbitrary,      capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not      consistent with the law, not made consistent with required      procedures, or unsupported by substantial evidence.       Record. In making determinations under this section, the      Board shall review the whole record, or those parts cited by      a party. The record on review shall include the record before      the hearing officer and the decision of the hearing      officer. Due account shall be taken of the rule of      prejudicial error.       Decision. The Board shall issue a written decision setting      forth the reasons for its decision. The decision may affirm,      reverse, or remand to the hearing officer for further      proceedings. A decision of the Board that does not require      further proceedings before a hearing officer shall be entered      in the records of the offices as a final decision.    Section 407--Judicial Review of Board Decisions and Enforcement               In general. The United States Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any      proceeding commenced by a petition of a party aggrieved by a      final decision of the Board under section 406(e) in cases      arising under part A of title II, a charging individual or      respondent before the Board who files a petition under      section 210(d)4, the general counsel or a respondent before      the Board who files a petition under section 215(c)(5), or      the general counsel or a respondent who files a petition      under section 220(c)(3). The same court shall also have      exclusive jurisdiction over any petition of the general      counsel filed in the name of the Office and at the direction      of the Board, to enforce a final decision under section      405(g) or 406(e) with respect to a violation of part A, B, C,      or D of title II.       Procedures. The rules governing the naming of respondents      reflects the different procedural postures under which      appeals may arise. The goal is to make sure that the Office      is not a respondent in a petition filed by its employee, the      general counsel. Any party before the Board may be named      respondent if not so named if the party so elects within 30      days after service of the petition. The section also provides      for a right of intervention for participants before the Board      who were not made respondents.       Law applicable. Proceedings under this section shall be      governed by chapter 158 of title 28, of the United States      Code, which applies to appellate court review of agency      orders. In order to tailor chapter 158 to review of      congressional adjudicatory processes, some changes are made      in that chapter's requirements. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2344,      the clerk is to serve a copy of the petition on the general      counsel; the authority of the Attorney General under 28      U.S.C. Sec. 2348 shall not apply, and a petition for review      shall be filed in the Office not later than 90 days after the      entry in the Office of the final decision under section      406(e) for which review is sought. The Office shall be an      agency as that term is used in chapter 158 of title 28, and      any reference to the Attorney General shall be deemed to      refer to the general counsel. The Office shall be named as      the respondent in any such action in order to defend the      decision of the congressional process.       Standard of review. The Standard of review in proceedings      under this section is the standard that applies under the      administrative procedures act, namely, that the court shall      set aside a final decision of the Board only if it determines      that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of      discretion, or otherwise not consistent with law; not made      consistent with required procedures; or unsupported by      substantial evidence.       Record. In making determinations under this section, the      court shall review the whole record, or those parts cited by      a party. The record on review shall include the record before      the hearing officer, the decision of the hearing officer, the      record before the Board, and the decision of the Board. Due      account shall be taken of the rule of procedural error.                       Section 408--Civil Action       Jurisdiction. An individual who has made a timely request      for counseling and mediation, has completed those procedures,      and has elected not to file a complaint with the Office, may      file a complaint in the United States district court for the      district in which the employee is employed or for the      District of Columbia. The time period for filing such a      complaint is set forth in section 404. The defendant shall be      the employing office alleged to have committed the violation,      or in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.       Jury trial. In a proceeding under this section, any party      may demand a jury trial in circumstances where a jury trial      would be available in an action against a private defendant      under the relevant law made applicable by this act. In any      case in which a violation of section 201 is alleged, the      court shall not inform the jury of the maximum amount of      compensatory damages available under section 201(b)(1) or      201(b)(3).              Section 409--Judicial Review of Regulations       This section provides that in any proceeding brought under      Section 407 or 408 in which the application of a regulation      issued under this act is at issue, the court may review the      validity of the regulation in accordance with the provisions      of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 706(2) of title      5, United States Code, except that with respect to      regulations approved by a joint resolution under section      304(c), only the provisions of section 706(2)(B) of title 5,      United States Code shall apply. This simply means that if the      regulation has the force of law, the regulation cannot be      challenged as being inconsistent with the underlying statute      applied to Congress under this bill, but may only be      challenged on constitutional grounds. All other regulations      could be challenged as not complying with the statutory      provisions forming the substantive and procedural basis for      issuing the regulation.       The only means for challenging the validity of      the regulation is through a proceeding brought under      section 407 or 408 of this act. Thus, there is no ability      to challenge a regulation when issued, as would be      available under the Administrative Procedures Act, but      only through collateral challenge. If the court determines      that the regulation is invalid, the court shall apply, to      the extent necessary and appropriate, the most relevant      substantive executive agency regulation promulgated to      implement the statutory provisions with respect to which      the invalid regulation was issued.       In determining whether to hold the regulations invalid, the      court should give equivalent deference to the Board as to an      executive branch agency with statutory authority and      expertise in issuing the regulation only if the regulation in      question is identical to a regulation of an executive branch      agency. To the extent the Board modifies the executive branch      agency in issuing the regulation whose validity is challenged      under this section, the court of appeals is to provide no      deference to the Board's reading of the underlying statute      when it issued the regulation unless the regulation was      adopted by joint resolution, or in connection with the      regulations issued under section 220(e).          Section 411--Effect of Failure To Issue Regulations       In any proceeding under section 405, 406, 407, or 408,      except a proceeding to enforce section 220 with respect to      offices listed under section 220(e)(2), if the Board has not      issued a regulation on a matter for which this act requires a      regulation to be issued, the hearing officer, board, or      court, as the case may be, shall apply, to the extent      necessary and appropriate, the most relevant substantive      executive agency regulation promulgated to implement the      statutory provision at issue in the proceeding.            Section 412--Expedited Review of Certain Appeals       This section authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme      Court from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or      order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision      of this act. In such a case, only the constitutional issue      would be before the court.                 Section 413--Privileges and Immunities       Under section 413, the authorization to bring judicial      proceedings under sections 407 and 408 shall not constitute a      waiver of sovereign immunity for any other purpose, or of the      privileges of any Member of Congress under the speech and      debate clause, or a waiver of wither the Senate or the House      of Representatives, including under article I,      [[Page S631]] section 5, clause 3, or under the rules of      either House relating to records and information within its      jurisdiction.                 Section 414--Settlement of Complaints       Under section 414, any settlement entered into by the      parties to a proceeding described in sections 210, 215, 220,      or 401 shall be in writing and not effective until approved      by the Executive Director. Nothing in this act shall affect      the power of the Senate and the House of Representatives,      respectively, to establish rules governing the process by      which a settlement may be entered into by such House or by      any employing office of such House.                         Section 415--Payments       Except as provided in subsection (c) of section 415, only      funds which are appropriated to an account of the Office of      the Treasury for the payment of awards and settlements may be      used for the payment of awards and settlements under this      act. A prevailing party may recover exclusive compensation      for his or her claims from such appropriated funds. Funds in      the account are not available for awards and settlements      involving the General Accounting Office, the Government      Printing Office, or the Library of Congress.       Awards and settlements may not be paid from the Claims and      Judgment Fund of the Treasury. Nothing in this act authorizes      the Board, the Office, the Director, or a hearing officer,      without further authorization, to direct that amounts paid      for settlements or awards be paid from official accounts of      the employing office. This act does not affect the power of      each House to determine how settlements or awards shall be      paid.       Subsection (b) provides that except as provided in      subsection (c), there are authorized appropriations of such      sums as may be necessary for administrative, personnel, and      similar expenses of employing offices which are needed to      comply with this act. These expenses could be such items as      funding management side labor negotiations under section 220.      These expenses are costs of adhering to the act, but not      costs of complying with adjudicative decisions remediating      violations, which are addressed in section 415.       Under subsection (c), funds to correct violations of the      Americans With Disabilities Act and the Occupational Safety      and Health Act may be paid only from funds appropriated to      the employing office or entity responsible for correcting      such violations.                      Section 416--Confidentiality       A principal distinction between the administrative dispute      resolution proceedings conducted under this act and the      proceedings in district court authorized under section 408 is      the confidentiality of the administrative proceedings. Under      this section, all counseling, mediation, and hearings are      confidential. The record developed in the hearing and the      decisions of hearing officers and the board may be made      public only for purposes of judicial review under section      407. This Requirement of confidentiality does not preclude      the Executive Director from disclosing to committees of      Congress information sought; however, such information      shall remain subject to the confidentiality requirements      of this section.       Final decisions entered under section 405(g) or 406(e)      shall be made public if it is in favor of the complaining      covered employee, or in favor of the charging party under      section 210, or if the decision reverses a decision of a      hearing officer which had been in favor of a covered employee      or a charging party. The Board may make public any other      decision at its discretion. Nothing in the act prohibits the      employing office from making public a final decision in its      favor.                   Title V--Miscellaneous Provisions               Section 501--Exercise of Rulemaking Power       This section provides that sections 204 and 401 and the      rules issued pursuant to them are an exercise of the      rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the      Senate and shall be considered part of the rules of each      House. These rules shall supersede other rules of each House      only to the extent that they are inconsistent with them. The      House and the Senate each retain their constitutional rights      to change these rules (insofar as they relate to such House)      at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as      each House may change its other rules.       Section 502--Political Affiliation and Place of Residence       This section permits employing offices to consider the      party affiliation, domicile, or political compatibility with      the employing office of an employee as referred to in      subsection (b) of this section with respect to employment      decisions. The term employee here means an employee on the      staff of leadership offices, committees and subcommittees,      employees of the staff of a member, an officer of either      House or a congressional employee elected or appointed by the      House or Senate and applicant for these positions. Section 503--Nondiscrimiantion Rules of the House of Representatives                                and Senate       This section provides that the Select Committee on Ethics      of the Senate and the Committee on Standards of Official      Conduct of the House of Representatives retain full power, in      accordance with the authority provided to them by the Senate      and the House of Representatives, with respect to the      discipline of members, officers, and employees for violating      rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives on      nondiscrimination in employment.            Section 504--Technical and Conforming Amendments       This section amends the Government Employee Rights Act so      that it remains in effect for certain Presidential appointees      and for certain State employees, and repeals the remaining      sections of the act as of the date this act takes effect.              Section 505--Judicial Branch Coverage Study       This section requires the judicial conference of the United      States to prepare a report by the Chief Justice to Congress      on the application to the judicial branch of the 11 laws made      applicable to Congress by this act. The report is to be      submitted by December 31, 1996, and shall include any      recommendations the Judicial Conference may have for      legislation to provide to employees of the judicial branch,      protections, and procedures under these laws, including      administrative and judicial relief, that are comparable to      that provided to congressional employees under this act.                    Section 506--Savings Provisions       This section provides a method for the transition from the      previous dispute resolution processes under which      congressional employees were covered to the process      established by this act. The purpose of this section is to      ensure that claims that are in the process of being resolved      are not extinguished, and that they will be adjudicated under      current law.                       Section 507--Severability       This section provides that if any provision of this act is      held to be invalid, the remainder of this act shall not be      affected.
