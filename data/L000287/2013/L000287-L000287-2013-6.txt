 This is unbelievable. I cannot believe we are here again. With so much to be done, so much good that we could do, this Republican Congress wants to stop the country, to deny the people a chance to see a doctor. How many times are we going to do this? What is next? Medicare? Medicaid? Social Security? This is not right; it is not fair; it is not just.  Madam Speaker, the voters have spoken; the Supreme Court has ruled. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It is constitutional, it is compassionate, it is what is right, it is what is necessary.  So much progress has been made. Young people can stay insured under their parents, more people will have coverage, coverage to help them see a doctor when they need to, coverage that covers.  The American people are counting on us. We must fulfill our constitutional responsibility to fund the Federal Government. We must keep the promise of health care to the American people. We will not go backwards. We have come too far and we cannot turn back.  Madam Speaker, health care is a right. It is not a privilege for the wealthy. Every citizen of the United States should be able to see a doctor when they need to. Every single one. This is a resolution that would stop that. It is not the American way. It is not the America that we believe in.  We should care for each other. We should look out for one another. We are one family, one house--the American House--and we should not pull the roof down on our heads to win political points.  Vote ``no'' on this backward deal. Vote for what is right, what is fair and just.
