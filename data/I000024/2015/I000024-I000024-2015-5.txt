President, in response, let me say that Senator Udall is far too generous to me, but I can assure you right now that Bonnie Lautenberg is watching this. We would not have been able to do this if you had not provided the leadership in the Democrats. You kept bringing more and more people in, making modest changes, and I was quite shocked at some that came in. But you and Bonnie were the leaders.  This bill is so significant to every manufacturer, everyone who does any kind of business. We will now finally get a handle on and be able to analyze what chemicals are in the best interest of America and the best safety interests of our people. I thank Senator Udall so much for his participation and bringing the group together.  I yield the floor.
