 On August 6 of this year, over 33 million people in 9,700 communities from all 50 States will participate in the 19th Annual National Night Out. These volunteers greet their neighbors, meet with local police, and participate in block parties and parades, all to encourage citizens to become active caretakers of their communities. This resolution would salute and encourage those efforts.  This past year has seen our nation both horrified by unthinkable tragedy, and driven to ensure that nothing so terrible ever happens again. Unfortunately, we can't have a police officer protecting us on every block, during every minute, of everyday. And while many of us in the Congress have worked for years to enhance the tools and resources available to law enforcement, few things are more valuable in our ongoing war against terrorism and crime than the eyes and ears of conscientious citizens. A 1995 study by the National Institute of Justice shows that crime rates are 40 percent lower, on average, in communities with high mutual trust among neighbors. By encouraging members of each community to get to know one another, be familiar with their block, and work with local law enforcement officials to spot and address suspicious situations, National Night Out helps all of us sleep more soundly.  Today, with terrorists seeking to strike our homeland, our efforts to keep America's streets safe are more crucial than ever. Working side by side with local law enforcement, neighborhood crime watch groups have been, and will continue to be an invaluable resource. In fact, a Justice Department survey indicates that 90 percent of law enforcement officers believe National Night Out enhances their policing programs. Every year, National Night Out provides Americans with a great opportunity to meet their neighbors, show their patriotism, and keep their streets safe. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Specter and me in thanking them for making a difference, one doorstep at a time.                          ____________________
