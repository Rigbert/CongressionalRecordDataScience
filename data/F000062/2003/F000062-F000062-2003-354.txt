 President, I rise today to introduce the Bob Hope American Patriot Award Act of 2003. This legislation would create a presidential commemorative award for an individual or organization that demonstrates ``extraordinary love of this Nation and devotion to its citizens in the form of true patriotism.''  In addition, this legislation would honor one of the most respected figures in America, who for seven decades has served our Nation with his talents in entertainment. As many are familiar, I am speaking today of Bob Hope.  To celebrate Bob Hope's 100th birthday on May 29, 2003, this legislation would give the President the opportunity to annually recognize the wonderful trait of ``patriotism,'' so well exemplified by Hope throughout his lifetime. Mr. Hope has long demonstrated that entertainment can positively influence ``love of country and dedication to the spiritual well-being of America's troops.''  A master of the skills of acting and singing, Bob Hope may be the most talented and prolific entertainer of our time. Many of us will recall his work in the series of ``Road'' films with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. His expansive career has involved stage musical comedy, motion pictures, and live appearances at the USO shows.  On May 6, 1941, Bob Hope began a 50-year service with the United States Armed Forces, in which he did approximately 60 USO tours. He has touredU.S. military stations all over the world, including Germany, the South Pacific, and Vietnam. Veterans and U.S. soldiers alike will always remember his variety shows, which included skits, dancers, specialty acts, and comedic monologues.
