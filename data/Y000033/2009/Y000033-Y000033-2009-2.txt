Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss the $2.4 million that was included at my request in the FY10 Defense Appropriations Bill for Synthetic Liquid Fuels.  Considering the large amounts of potential CO2 emissions produced by a coal or a natural gas-to-liquids facility, technologies will have to be developed to ascertain the feasibility of sequestering the CO2.  Recent investigations by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that between 8 and 12 billion barrels of additional oil can be recovered from the existing Alaska North Slope oil fields with using CO2 enhanced oil recovery technology. Alaska North Slope oil reservoirs present a potentially large target or ``sink'' for sequestering the CO2 generated in a Fairbanks-based coal-to-liquids or a coal/gas-to-liquids plant, thereby enhancing conventional oil recovery as a by-product. However, very little practical study of CO2 sequestration has directly addressed the Alaska North Slope area. Moreover, in the present case, effective CO2 sequestration is highly dependent on the technologically and economically-feasible transportation of CO2 from the Fairbanks source to the Alaska North Slope. Additionally, for the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline proposed to bring the Alaska North Slope natural gas to world markets, to be successful, accommodation for the handling of about 480 mmscf CO2/day, assuming 4 bscf/day of natural gas, from the Prudhoe Bay Unit must be considered.  The study paid for by these monies would investigate the feasibility of gathering, delivering and utilizing the resultant CO2 from the plant for enhanced oil recovery on the North Slope of Alaska, thereby simultaneously sequestering CO2 and increasing domestic oil production. If this proves feasible, the construction of the proposed would supply the U.S. military with domestically produced synthetic fuel and greatly increase U.S. oil production from existing oil fields.
