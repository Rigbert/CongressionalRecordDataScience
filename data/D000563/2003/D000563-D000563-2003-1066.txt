I might say to the Senator from Nevada, the Senator from Utah, in a speech to the Utah Federalist Society, said when you have a nominee like Miguel Estrada with no published opinions, then you have to really ask questions. Get to the bottom of his jurisprudential views, in the words of the Senator from Utah. In the case of Judge Paez, there was not only ample record about how he ruled, he answered the questions. Miguel Estrada has ducked the questions time and time again and believes if he canhold us back long enough he will get a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. That would be a dereliction of duty on the part of the Senate and that is why we are spending this time on this nominee. An important constitutional principle is at stake here, a principle of whether or not the Senate will have the right and the authority to ask the questions, to make a reasoned judgment before we give our advice and consent to a President's judicial nominees.
