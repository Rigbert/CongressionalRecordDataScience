Speaker, I rise in opposition to this conference report. For the last 2 days we engaged in debate over balancing the budget. That fight to cut spending, reduce the deficit, and balance our budget must be won. A budget balanced fairly, with no tax giveaways to the privileged few, is not beyond our abilities, though that is not the budget that passed here earlier today.  Now before us is another bill that cuts spending, but again, does not dedicate its savings to deficit reduction. In the original bill, we all supported the Brewster amendment, which overwhelmingly passed this Chamber by over 400 votes. However, what we have here is a bill that imposes draconian cuts: no summer jobs after this year, a cut this year in thousands of jobs across this country, no heating assistance for our seniors, and then it directs those precious dollars to give tax benefits to the most privileged among us. This bill deserves to be vetoed. We will have another bill here that is just and fair.
