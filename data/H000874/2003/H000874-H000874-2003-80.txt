 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's concern is duly noted. And as the gentleman knows, at the end of a session like this, there are conferences and meetings going all over the place trying to get these bills wrapped up for the end of the session, and formal notices and appropriate notices will go out in a timely fashion so that Members will have time to understand what is in these bills before they vote on them.
