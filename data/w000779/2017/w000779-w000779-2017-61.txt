President, I am going to yield to my colleagues in a minute.  I just think it is important to make sure that the public understands exactly what some of the facts are behind the Republican proposals.  My colleague from Ohio just talked about how the Republican proposal is going to create many more jobs in the United States and certainly isn't going to keep the system that makes it attractive to do business overseas. Yet my understanding is, all the previous versions--and we are going through the 500-plus pages now--are based on territorial taxation.  I don't imagine too many folks in coffee shops are up on what territorial taxation is, but it is an express lane for shipping jobs overseas.
