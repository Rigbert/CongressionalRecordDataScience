 I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions be recognized to offer two amendments and be given up to 15 minutes to speak to those amendments; that following his remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the Sanders amendment and there be 2 minutes of debate prior a vote in relation to that amendment, equally divided, with no second-degree amendments in order to the Sanders amendment prior to the vote.
