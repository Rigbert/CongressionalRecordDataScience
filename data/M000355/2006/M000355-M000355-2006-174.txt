 President, today, we unanimously invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to the border fence act by a vote of 94 to 0. Unless an agreement is reached to begin earlier, we will begin consideration of that bill no later than 5:45 tomorrow afternoon. We will update Senators as to the voting schedule as we attempt to reach agreement on this bill, as well as any other legislative or executive items that may be considered.                          ____________________
