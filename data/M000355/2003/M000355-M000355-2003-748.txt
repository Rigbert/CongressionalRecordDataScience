 I am pleased to have had an opportunity to serve as a member of the Task Force along with my colleagues, Senators Lugar and Feinstein, and Representative Lantos.  The report describes the State Peace and Development Council's repressive rule in Burma, and makes a number of recommendations including: increased humanitarian assistance for the people of Burma through NGOS, and in consultation with the NLD and other groups representative of a multiethnic Burma; an import ban on goods produced in Burma, visa denials to leaders of the military regime and its political arms, and the freezing of assets abroad; U.S. leadership in urging the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution that demands the immediate release of Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners, and to hold an emergency session to impose other sanctions on Burma; U.S. leadership in working with our allies and Burma's regional neighbors to bolster support for the struggle for freedom and the rule of law in Burma; no certification for Burma on narcotics cooperation as it has ``failed demonstrably'' to curtail drug production, drug trafficking and money laundering; and increased assistance to refugees fleeing Burma in Thailand, India, Bangladesh, and China.  I thank the council for the timeliness of the task force, and all the members for their participation.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the executive summary of the report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Burma: A Time For Change                           executive summary       On May 30, 2003, the Burmese military regime orchestrated      violent attacks by pro-government militia on Aung san Suu      Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD)      and her supporters as they traveled outside Mandalay. At      least four of her bodyguards were killed as well as a      significant number of others. She has been held in custody      since then. Following the attacks, the regime arrested more      than 100 democracy activists, imprisoned at least a dozen,      shut down NLD offices across the country, and closed schools      and universities. This is the bloodiest confrontation between      Burma's military rulers and democracy supporters since 1988,      when the government suppressed a popular uprising against the      regime and thousands were killed.       Burma has been ruled for more than 40 years by a succession      of military regimes that have systematically impoverished a      country once known for its high literacy rate, excellent      universities, and abundant natural resources. Today, Burma is      one of the most tightly controlled dictatorships in the      world, lacking any freedom of speech, assembly, or the press;      denying any due process of law; and perpetuating human rights      abuses, such as forced labor, military rape of civilians,      political imprisonment, torture, trafficking in persons, and      use of child soldiers. Burma is also facing what the United      Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) has called a ``silent      emergency,'' a health crisis of epidemic proportions. HIV/     AIDS is spreading rapidly, and malaria, tuberculosis,      leprosy, maternal mortality, and malnutrition are pervasive.      Government spending on health and education is miniscule.       Burma is a leading producer of opium and methamphetamine      for the illegal drug trade, which is a major source of      corruption within Burma. Four decades of military operations      against insurgent ethnic nationalities as well as mass forced      relocations have created one of the largest refugee      populations in Asia. As many as two million people have fled      Burma for political and economic reasons; inside Burma,      hundred of thousands have been internally displaced. They      lack access to food, health care, schools, and even clean      water.       In August 1988, a popular uprising against the military      regime was brutally suppressed and thousands were killed. In      1990, the regime held elections for a multi-party parliament      in which the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung      San Suu Kyi who was then under house arrest, won 82 percent      of the seats. However, the elections were ignored by the      junta and the elected parliamentary representatives never      took office. The regime imprisoned hundreds of pro-democracy      supporters, including elected members of parliament.      Thousands more fled the country.       After the 1988 uprising, the United States imposed      graduated sanctions on Burma, initially terminating economic      aid, withdrawing trade preferences, imposing an arms embargo,      and blocking loans the grants from international financial      institutions. In 1997, based on a presidential finding that      the Burmese government had committed large-scale repression      and violence against the democratic opposition, the United      States banned any new American investments in Burma.       In 2000, the United Nations, mandated by UN General      Assembly resolutions, sent Special Envoy Razali Ismail to      Rangoon to promote substantive political dialogue on      transition to democratic government between Burmese      government and the democratic opposition. Since then,      Ambassador Razali has visited Rangoon nine times with no      apparent progress toward establishing this dialogue. He is      returning to Rangoon in early June.       In order to strengthen international efforts to install      democratic government and end repression in Burma, the Task      Force recommends that the United States take specific      initiatives in four key areas:        Humanitarian assistance to address Burma's health crisis       In view of Burma's massive public health crisis, the United      States should increase humanitarian assistance to Burma,      provided that funds are given to international nongovermental      organizations (NGOs) for basic human needs through a process      that requires transparency, accountability, and consultation      with the NLD and other groups representatives of a      multiethnic Burma.       Although the United States should not generally provide      humanitarian assistance directly to the Burmese government,      the United States could provide technical assistance to the      Ministry of Health if the Burmese government agrees to meet      the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standard that      HIV/AIDS testing be voluntary and confidential.       The United States should work together with other donor      governments, UN agencies, and if possible, the Burmese      government State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to      establish certain minimal standards of independence for      international NGOs operating in Burma, including clear      guidelines for administrative operations, reporting, and      other regulations involving duty-free entry privileges,      memoranda of understanding and residency permits.         Promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law       In view of the recent government-sponsored attacks on      members of the democratic opposition, resulting in a number      of deaths, and the Burmese government's detention of Aung San      Suu Kyi, the United States should urge the United Nations      Security Council to adopt a resolution that demands the      immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political      prisoners and condemns the Burmese government's egregious      human rights abuses as well as its refusal to engage in      substantive political dialogue with the democratic      opposition. In addition, the United States should urge the      Security Council to hold an emergency session on Burma to      discuss imposing targeted sanctions, which could include      denying visas to leaders of the military regime, the Union      Solidarity Development Association (USDA) and their families,      freezing their assets and imposing bans     both on new investment in Burma and on importing goods      produced in Burma.       Because the Burmese military government has failed to      address human rights abuses, including the unconditional      release of all political prisoners, and to move forward in      talks with the NLD and other pro-democracy groups toward      establishing a democratic government, the United States      should increase well-targeted sanctions, including an import      ban on goods produced in Burma, and encourage the United      Nations and other countries to join with the United States in      adopting similar sanctions.       The United States should redouble its efforts with the      governments of China, Japan and the Association of Southeast      Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, particularly Thailand,      Singapore and Malaysia, to press the SPDC to work with the      NLD and ethnic nationalities toward political transition in      Burma. The United States, as a member of the SEAN Regional      Forum, should urge ASEAN to consider seriously the cross-     border effects of internal problems including      illegal migration, health, trafficking, narcotics and      other issues connected with the internal situation in      Burma. The United States should also continue to      coordinate closely with the European Union on policies      toward Burma.       Until the SPDC makes substantial progress in improving      human rights and engaging in substantive political dialogue      with the democratic opposition, the United States should      strongly discourage the government of Japan from forgiving      outstanding debt from bilateral grants and loans except those      that directly address basic human needs. Such aid should      exclude infrastructure projects, such as dams and airport      renovations, and also be limited to basic human needs.      Moreover, the United States should encourage Japan to use its      influence with ASEAN governments to urge them to become pro-     active in support of democracy and human rights in Burma.       While maintaining its own sanctions on Burma, the United      States, as one of the largest donors to the international      financial institutions, should urge Asian investors to press      the Burmese government to begin implementing the economic      measures recommended by the World Bank, International      Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank as one of the      prerequisites for further investment. The United States      should also urge China to use its influence to press the      Burmese government to reform its economy and move towards      democratic governance in order to promote stability in the      region.       In order to develop capacity for future democratic      governance and to rebuild technical competence in Burma, the      United States should promote cultural, media and educational      exchanges with the Burmese, provided that these opportunities      are readily accessible to qualified candidates, including      representatives of the political opposition. The selection      process should include widespread publicity of exchange and      fellowship opportunities, a joint selection committee      comprised of Burmese civilian authorities (academics,      intellectuals) and representatives of the U.S. Embassy in      Rangoon who, after consulting broadly, make their selections      based on the quality of candidates and their potential to      contribute to Burma's future. In addition, the United States      should provide increased funding for the American Center in      Rangoon as well as for English language training and      scholarship opportunities.               U.S. narcotics control policy toward Burma       The United States should not certify Burma at this time      because it has ``failed demonstrably'' to curtail drug      production, drug trafficking and money laundering. In      addition, the United States should not provide any counter-     narcotics assistance to the Burmese government. Increased      counter-narcotics cooperation should depend, at minimum, on      significant steps by the Burmese government to curb      methamphetamine production, to arrest leading traffickers,      and to stop channeling drug money into the illicit economy.        IV. Refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons       The United States should strongly urge the Thai government      to halt deportations of Burmese and protect the security of      Burmese living in Thailand, regardless of their status. In      addition, the United States should coordinate U.S. policy      towards Thailand with donors, such as the governments of      Norway, Denmark, Japan, and Canada.       The United States should provide increased humanitarian      assistance, including cross-border assistance, for displaced      Burmese along both sides of the Thai-Burma border as well as      on Burmese's borders with India, Bangladesh, and China, as      well as inside Burma. Support should be provided for clean      water, sanitation services, primary health care, reproductive      health, and health education for refugees and undocumented      migrants living in refugee-like circumstances. Support of      education, especially for women and children, is also      critical.       The United States should urge greater access by      international NGOs and UN agencies to northern Rakhine State      provide humanitarian assistance and monitor abuses committed      against Muslim communities and returned refugees.                          ____________________
