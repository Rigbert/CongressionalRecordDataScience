There isn't a parent in America who isn't sensitive to that today.  The suggestion of a smaller classroom and more personal attention to children in the early stages of their development suggests to me the possibility of spotting a child's problem at an early stage and perhaps dealing with it successfully rather than having this child pushed through the mill, ignored, perhaps not given the personal attention they need.  It strikes me that there are so many different pieces to this, whether it is the guns that make these troubled kids so dangerous to so many other people, or the fact that there are troubled children who are not getting the personal attention they need.  I join with the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope we can return to an agenda that really identifies the priorities of America's families. It is important to talk about Ed-Flex. It is important to talk about Y2K. But for goodness sake, before we leave at the end of the year, shouldn't we talk about the issues that families talk about when they are sitting around the table or around the family room watching television?  I salute the Senator. I hope he will continue with his efforts.
