 President, in ``The Federalist No. 3,'' John Jay wrote that ``[a]mong the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their safety seems to be the first.'' Such is the importance that our nation historically has placed on the maintenance of law and order. And our law enforcement officers, whom our country has charged with carrying out this primary responsibility, shoulder a weighty, and often times dangerous, burden. In 1999 alone, one hundred and thirty-four law enforcement officers fell in the line ofduty, making the ultimate sacrifice to protect our communities.  While most Americans are aware that their police officers work in a dangerous environment, many Americans do not know that in enforcing the laws that exist to protect us all, these officers, themselves, often are denied basic legal protections in internal investigations and administrative hearings and are penalized for exercising their free speech and associational rights. They live in fear of being investigated without notice, interrogated without an attorney, and dismissed without a hearing, often times at the behest of some recently arrested criminal looking for a payback. In short, many officers do not enjoy the same basic due process and First Amendment rights as does the criminal element from which they are trying to protect us.  According to the National Association of Police Organizations, Inc., NAPO, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this country, officers enjoy some legal protections against false accusations and abusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers have very limited due process and First Amendment rights and confront limitations on their exercise of those and other rights.'' And according to the Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, ``[i]n a startling number of jurisdictions throughout this country, law enforcement officers have no procedural or administrative protections whatsoever; in fact, they can be, and frequently are, summarily dismissed from their jobs without explanation. Officers who lose their careers due to administrative or political expediency almost always find it impossible to find new employment in public safety. An officer's reputation, once tarnished by accusation, is almost impossible to restore.'' In short, a trumped-up charge against a police officer can result in a lifetime sentence of a damaged career and reputation.  It is time for our Nation to end this sorry situation. We must make sure that every member of law enforcement, in every jurisdiction in the country, is able to participate in the political process without fear of retaliation and is able to do his or her job without wondering whether they can defend themselves if their performance is scrutinized. To this end, I am proud to rise today with Senator Biden to introduce the ``Law Enforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act of 2001.'' This bill would guarantee due process rights to every police officer who is subject to investigation for non-criminal disciplinary action, and it would protect them from retribution on the job for participating in the political process while off the job. Some of these protections are: the right to be informed of administrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing, as well as an opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel or another representative.  While this bill would protect the men and women who serve on the front lines of our nation's war against crime, it would not do so at the cost of citizen accountability. Just the opposite. It would strengthen the ability of individual citizens to hold accountable those few officers who misuse their authority. Specifically, as NAPO notes, ``[o]ften police departments lack any guidelines and procedures for handling and investigating complaints, thus raising doubts about officer accountability.'' This bill will fill that void and thereby go a long way to dispelling such doubts. By establishing, as the FOP observes, ``an effective means for the receipt, review and investigation of public complaints against law enforcement officers that is fair and equitable to all parties,'' this bill ensures that legitimate citizen complaints against police officers will be actively investigated and that citizens will be informed of the progress and outcome of those investigations. It thus strikes an appropriate balance: the bill makes sure that every police officer has basic fundamental procedural rights, while at the same time ensuring that citizens have the opportunity to raise legitimate complaints and concerns about police officer conduct.  This legislation is the product of much hard work and continual refinements by leading law enforcement groups, most notably the FOP and the NAPO. They have both strongly endorsed it, and, like Senator Biden and me, will work hard for its enactment. Over the years, Senator Biden and I, in conjunction with these groups, have made similar efforts to protect the men and women who protect us. While we have not yet been successful, we remain undeterred and will continue working toward our goal. The time has come to give our law enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they desperately deserve. We urge our colleagues to join us in this very worthy effort.                                 ______                                       By
