Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and I thank Kevin and Richard for their kind comments regarding the counsel they have received from Parker and the relationship they have with her.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Parker's favorite Member of Congress, notwithstanding that that includes the majority leader and my friend, Mr. Hudson, and I on that list. We may be friends with Parker, and she may like and respect us, but her favorite Member of Congress is Bruce Poliquin from Maine.
