 I am grateful for everyone's work to bring about these historic reforms. Together, we have taken steps to reduce crime and recidivism, to strengthen faith and fairness in the criminal justice system, and to signal to those willing to make amends that redemption is within their reach. Together, we have taken an important step to live up to the commitment we make every time we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States: to provide liberty and justice for all.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hyde-Smith). The assistant Democratic leader.
