Speaker, I rise to talk about Jerry Seinfeld and George Kastanza and those people who do not pay taxes. The Republicans believe if you do not pay income taxes, you do not pay taxes. I ask 50 percent of the working Americans, hard-working Americans who only pay FICA, 7 percent off the top gross, ``Do you pay taxes?''  Mr. Speaker, I have three daughters, two of whom are in that category. They pay taxes. That is what the President is talking about. That is what Democrats are talking about. Yes, they ought to be included in tax relief, because those hard-working Americans are earning just enough to stay above water, and they need help; not the folks who are making $75,000, $150,000, $275,000 and $500,000. But in addition to that, Mr. Speaker, watch out. Watch out. Because what this tax bill does is it starts to really hit in the seventh year in terms of undermining our ability to get the deficit under control. In the second 10 years, it explodes in terms of tax benefits for the wealthiest in America and the deficit will be paid by the poorest working Americans in America.                          ____________________
