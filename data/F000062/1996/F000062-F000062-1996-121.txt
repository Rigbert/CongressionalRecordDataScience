 President, I rise in opposition to amendment 4002 offered by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott. While its intent is surely positive, the effect would be to badly undermine United States interests with regard to Iraq.  First of all, it calls on the President to do something that is beyond is authority. The President does not have the power to unilaterally renegotiate the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 986, which the United States voted for.  Resolution 986 was passed in 1995 to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, whose suffering Saddam Hussein was cynically exploiting to fracture the anti-Iraq coalition.  At that time, calls for sanctions to be lifted were increasing in the Arab world, and even from U.N. SecurityCouncil members France and Russia. The consensus on maintaining sanctions was eroding.  Resolution 986 was a way of demonstrating to the world that our quarrel is with Saddam, not the Iraqi people, and to try to relieve some of their suffering, about which Saddam clearly does not care one bit.  The resolution requires an iron-clad U.N. monitoring program to ensure that the proceeds from up to $2 billion of oil sales over 6 months are deposited in a U.N. escrow account, which Saddam cannot touch. They would then be used primarily for humanitarian relief.  This morning, Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement on implementing Resolution 986. Iraq will begin selling its oil within a few weeks. At that time, U.N. monitors will move in to ensure that the food and medicine is used properly and distributed equitably.  In addition to humanitarian relief, the funds will be used for two other important purposes: To support the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq, or UNSCOM, which is responsible for finding and dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and which is badly in need of funds; and to support the U.N. Compensation Commission, which settles international claims against Iraq, for Kuwait, but also for U.S. companies and individuals harmed by the Iraqi invasion.  If we attempt to divert money from these causes, we will send a message that we don't care about the suffering of the Iraqi people. I cannot think of a better way for us to strengthen Saddam's standing inside Iraq. He would be able to blame the United States for his people's suffering.  Diverting money from humanitarian aid would also threaten to split the coalition. There would be renewed calls for lifting sanctions outright, especially in the Arab world. Resolution 986 maintains all sanctions on Iraq.  We would also undermine UNSCOM's crucial mission to ensure that Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile programs are dead and buried. And we would send a message that we do not care about Kuwait, or even U.S. citizens, being compensated for losses suffered on account of Saddam's invasion.  It is certainly reasonable for the United States to seek compensation whenever possible for U.S. operations that support U.N. missions. But when those operations are in our interest, we need to be prepared to shoulder the burden.  Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch both serve U.S. interests by containing Saddam's military and protecting the Kurds and Shiites (not the Sunnis, as erroneously stated in the amendment) of Iraq. That is why President Bush started both these operations after the Gulf War and why President Clinton has continued them.  In 1996, $646 million was authorized for Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch, out of a total defense budget of $264.7 billion. Do you know what percentage of our defense budget that is? It is two-tenths of one percent of our total defense budget.  That's right. For two-tenths of one percent of our defense budget, we are containing Saddam Hussein's military, preventing him from flying his aircraft or threatening Kuwait, and providing crucial protection to the Kurds and Shiites of Iraq.  By any standard, that is a bargain. If we are not prepared to spend two-tenths of one percent of our defense budget to contain one of our most dangerous adversaries in a crucial part of the world, then why do we even have a defense budget?  We shouldn't jeopardize our interests in Iraq by insisting on compensation for conducting operations that are so clearly in our Nation's national interests. Britain, France, and Turkey also participate in these operations without compensation.  Although conducted with our allies, these operations are primarily U.S. operations, which means that we make decisions on how they are conducted. If we demand U.N. compensation for these operations, it is only a short leap to granting the United Nations greater say about the conduct of the mission.  I doubt that the sponsors of the amendment would advocate giving the United Nations greater control over U.S. troops conducting Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch, but it seems to be the inevitable outcome of demanding compensation.  In short, this amendment urges the President to do something that (a) he cannot do, and (b) would badly undermine U.S. interests in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.                        military infrastructure
