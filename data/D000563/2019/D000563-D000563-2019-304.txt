President, back in 2017, Dream Center Education Holdings, the spinoff of a Christian charity with no previous experience in higher education, announced its intention to acquire the campuses of the failing for-profit giant Education Management Corporation, EDMC, and convert them to nonprofit status.  Among EDMC's most notable brands were the Art Institutes and Argosy University.  I joined several of my Senate colleagues at the time, raising concerns about Dream Center's ability to effectively manage this higher education enterprise in the best interests of students and taxpayers.  Despite our concerns, Secretary DeVos's Department of Education gave its preliminary approval to the transaction in October 2017, without conditioning that approval on any restrictions or protections for students and taxpayers.  The Department's failure to protect students and taxpayers at this critical juncture set up a chain of events that left thousands of students harmed and millions in taxpayer dollars wasted.  In November 2017, as part of its own approval of that transaction, the Higher Learning Commission, HLC, removed accreditation from Dream Center's newly acquired Art Institute of Colorado and the Illinois Institute of Art effective January 20, 2018.  HLC transitioned these schools to ``candidates for accreditation,'' during which time they could still receive Title IV funds.  HLC noted that the loss of accreditation could have serious consequences for current and prospective students and that students ``should know that their courses or degrees are not accredited by HLC and may not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and universities or recognized by prospective employers.''  Because of these risks, HLC required Dream Center to provide students with ``proper advisement and accommodations.''  But Dream Center failed to comply with these requirements and instead continued to falsely advertise to students that these institutions ``remain accredited.''  In June 2018, when several news articles brought the misrepresentation to light, I wrote to the Higher Learning Commission asking them to investigate.  I also sent a copy of that letter to the Department of Education.  Then, in August 2018, an article by David Halperin alleged that the top DeVos postsecondary education official, Diane Auer Jones, directed Dream Center to continue to represent the Illinois and Colorado campuses as accredited while she worked behind the scenes to orchestrate retroactive accreditation.  As Chairman Scott put it in his recent letter, it was an attempt at ``rewriting history to erase Dream Center's deceptive marketing practices.''  And, it required changing Department regulations.  I wrote to Secretary DeVos in August about these troubling accusations.  In a December 4, 2018, response, signed by then-Assistant Secretary for Legislation and Congressional Affairs Peter Oppenheim, the Department denied the allegations.  Instead, Mr. Oppenheim's letter asserts that Ms. Jones didn't learn about the misrepresentation until July 17, 2018.  In response to subsequent written questions, Secretary DeVos further stated to me that Ms. Jones first learned that HLC had withdrawn accreditation from the Illinois and Colorado campuses on July 10, 2018.  But, according to emails obtained and released by Chairman Scott, Ms. Jones appears to have been already working to change Department regulations to allow Dream Center to obtain retroactive accreditation before these dates.  A July 3, 2018, internal Dream Center email reads, ``We just got off the phone with [the Department of Education]. It appears HLC is in sync with retro-[accreditation].''  Diane Jones is specifically mentioned in the email as being the Department official working with accreditors to facilitate this.  As reported by the New York Times, in a recorded meeting on July 11, 2018, Dream Center's chief operating officer told faculty in Illinois that the Department was working to change its regulations to allow retroactive accreditation.  As evidence, he specifically referred to a conversation the week before with Ms. Jones.  These revelations raise the prospect that Secretary DeVos, Ms. Jones, and other Department officials may have misled me and other members of Congress in their responses to questions on this matter.  Ultimately, the Dream Center debacle led to thousands of students being lured into a predatory enterprise on the verge of collapse.  The question is, to what extent did the DeVos Department of Education, and Ms. Jones in particular, inappropriately aid and abet Dream Center's exploitation of students and bilking of taxpayers as the company collapsed.  In February of this year, House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and I asked the Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the Department's role in the Dream Center collapse.  Now, the revelations accompanying Chairman Scott's letter, raise serious questions about the Department's truthfulness with Congress and a potential attempt to cover up inappropriate involvement by Ms. Jones or others.  In his letter, Chairman requested transcribed interviews with several Department officials, including Ms. Jones, and a host of documents and correspondence.  I call on Secretary DeVos to immediately comply with these requests, to direct her Department to fully cooperate with Chairman Scott without delay. Anything less and we will be forced to ask what exactly Secretary DeVos is trying to hide.                          ____________________
