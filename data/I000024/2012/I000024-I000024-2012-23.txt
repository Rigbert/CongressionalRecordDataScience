President, the Senator from Georgia is exactly right. I do not think, in the years I have been here, I have ever seen one issue where everyone is in agreement. If we go back to 2007, 94 Members of this Senate got together and they said--and this is all documented--that: Detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay should not be released into American society, nor should they be transferred stateside into facilities.  We all agreed on that.
