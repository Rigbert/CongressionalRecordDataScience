 President, I rise in opposition to this sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Delaware that would allow Amtrak to invade the highway trust fund for its financial wants.  Under this plan, Amtrak would divert one-half cent per gallon of the highway automobile fuel tax, from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund, and into a new trust fund designed to benefit Amtrak trains. By voting for this resolution, Senators would vote to classify much of this entirely new spending from this new trust fund as direct spending under the Budget Enforcement Act. Thus, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution resolves the Senate to both plunder the highway trust fund and create a new entitlement. Now is not the time to create new entitlements; now is the time to show our sincerity in balancing the Federal budget.  Mr. President, Senators should vote against this Amtrak resolution because it steals much needed capitol funds from our country's mass transit systems. And let me remind my colleagues that Amtrak is not the same as your local mass transit system. Both may carry significant numbers of passengers when compared to the private automobile, but the similarities end there and the differences begin. Local mass transit carries the working poor, disabled and the elderly to jobs, to local clothing and grocery stores, to medical services, and other amenities of the local community. These are people who do not have access to other modes of transportation and are highly dependent on the local mass transit system. Mass transit carries more people in 1 day than Amtrak carries in 1 year.  Let me also remind my colleagues that 60 percent of the cuts made in the fiscal year 1996 transportation appropriations came from mass transit.  Amtrak, on the other hand, has a very different ridership. A study states that ``travel on Amtrak by persons with incomes above $40,000 is 3.5 times higher than intercity buses and nearly 1.5 times higher than airlines.'' This is not the working poor trying to get to their job, or the elderly to medical care. It is all well and good to buy new scenic cruisers and build train stations in New York, but not at the expense of getting people to their jobs, or to the doctor.  Mr. President, on May 6 the White House issued a statement of administration policy on S. 1318, which reauthorized Amtrak. I as unanimous consent that that statement be entered into the Record after my remarks. It is clear from that statement that the administration has deep concerns about changing Amtrak's funding. In that statement the Office of Management and Budget ``strongly opposes'' providing Amtrak appropriated funds on an accelerated basis, fearing that this ``would unnecessarily increase Federal borrowing costs.'' They also oppose ``subordinating the Federal interest as a creditor in the event of a default under the section 511 loan program'' and the proposed Federal guarantee of new borrowing authority for Amtrak authorized in this legislation.  I have to ask my friend from Delaware if he intends to create a new tax to subsidize Amtrak as a follow-up to his sense-of-the-Senate resolution?  I ask this because my reading of the amendment is that revenues taken from the highway trust fund and re-routed to Amtrak shall be re-routed between the period of January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001.  However, my reading of the Tax Code (Sec. 9503, 1996 Cumulative Annual Pocket Part, West Publishing Company, 1996.) tells me that the fuel tax for the highway trust fund expires on September 30, 1999. Thus, under current law there will be no revenues for 2 full years of this subsidy, if this subsidy were law. Indeed, under current law, the only automobile fuel tax that will survive after September 30, 1999, is President Clinton's 1993 4.3-cent-per-gallon fueltax increase for the general fund that so many of my colleagues in the Senate oppose.  Therefore, I again would like to ask my friend from Delaware if he intends to increase highway taxes in the future, and is this the first step toward that tax increase?  If Amtrak needs the Senate to sustain or increase a tax, then I especially urge all of my colleagues who oppose tax increases to consistently oppose this Amtrak sense of the Senate because, like all other tax increases, it will hit the pocketbooks of taxpaying Americans.  Senators should vote against this Amtrak train invasion of the highway trust fund because this proposed new Amtrak trust fund contradicts any efforts to balance the budget. Senate bill No. 1395 outlines the plan for the new Amtrak trust fund. That bill legislates direct spending from the highway trust fund, through the new Amtrak trust fund, and into Amtrak. I believe that Congress should not now be creating a new and special entitlement for Amtrak while at the same time we are reducing the growth of other more important entitlements that affect many more Americans. We in the Senate are in an historic and difficult process of offering this Nation a balanced budget. If this budget succeeds, it will be the first balanced budget enacted since 1969. While attempting to achieve a balanced budget plan for fiscal 1996, many in Congress have already made painful sacrifices. The budget resolution for 1997 requires that many of us repeat those same sacrifices. Given the choice, Mr. President, many of us might rather spend the necessary revenue offsets to increase funding for Medicare or Medicaid or for the protection of the environment. Therefore, it is inappropriate that Congress would at this same time create a new entitlement for Amtrak.  Mr. President, this Amtrak resolution further cuts against a balanced budget because it is new spending. As the second most senior Republican Member of the Senate Budget Committee, I am here to remind everyone that the highway trust funds are on the budget. Though there is a separate account for the highway trust funds, there is no separate book. Any new and additional spending for Amtrak is to feed yet another hungry mouth, and yet another break in our fiscal dam. Therefore, in our budget balancing efforts, funding Amtrak from an existing source still requires that the Senate either raise someone else's taxes, or cut someone else's spending without a thorough review. I am against both. I want to balance the budget.  Additionally, I will say that though this sense-of-the-Senate resolution regards a revenue bill, the Senate Committee on Finance has held no hearings on the underlying bill, nor has it held a general hearing on the Amtrak train's invasion of the automobile driver's highway trust fund moneys.  In summary, Mr. President, a vote in favor of this Amtrak sense of the Senate is a vote against highways and against automobile drivers. It is a vote in favor of corporate welfare and against Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Indeed, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution for Amtrak is a vote against a balanced budget.  I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this resolution to bail out Amtrak by invading the automobile driver's highway trust fund and creating new spending.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement of administration policy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Statement of Administration Policy           S. 1318--Amtrak and Local Rail Revitalization Act       The Administration agrees with the thrust of S. 1318, to      enable Amtrak to respond to consumer needs and market      realities and to free itself from Federal subsidies. Although      S. 1318 includes many provisions to that end, some of its      provisions could impede achievement of these objectives or      impose other unnecessary burdens.       The Administration is generally opposed to the imposition      of arbitrary caps on punitive damage amounts, and would      strongly oppose the inclusion of any provision in S. 1318      imposing such caps.       The Administration also strongly opposes the requirement      that appropriated funds be provided to Amtrak on an      accelerated basis. This requirement, which is not necessary      to support Amtrak's operations, would shift $659 million of      Federal outlays to FY 1996 that would occur, under current      law, in FY 1997 and FY 1998. This would unnecessarily      increase Federal borrowing costs.       In addition, the Administration strongly opposes Senate      passage of S. 1318 unless it is amended to:       Delete the provisions for a permanent authorization of      appropriations for the Local Rail Freight Assistance Program      (LRFAP), and modifications to the section 511 loan program.      The President did not request, and Congress did not provide,      any appropriations for LRFAP for the current fiscal year. The      rail freight industry has clearly established its ability to      operate without Federal subsidies or loans. Any future      decisions to subsidize the rail freight industry should be      made by local State governments in the context of their      overall transportation planning, not by the Federal      Government.       Delete the provision which would subordinate the Federal      interest as a creditor in the event of a default under the      section 511 loan program. Such provisions increase the risk,      and therefore the ``subsidy rate,'' of loans guaranteed under      this program, thereby reducing the number of loans which      could be made with the resources available.
