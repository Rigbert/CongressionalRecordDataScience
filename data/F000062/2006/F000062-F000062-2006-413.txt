 President, I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate April 24, 2005, the 91st anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. I do so because I believe it is necessary to recognize and ensure that similar atrocities do not happen in the future.  No one knows this better than the 500,000 Armenians who are living in my home State of California. These men, women, and children are a shining example of the backbone of our society and serve as a symbol of perseverance and determination.  Their ancestors came to our country to build a better life for themselves and their families, and today, Armenian-Americans recognize that the repercussions of allowing aggression and injustice against ethnic, religious, or minority groups to persist can be dire.  During the Armenian genocide, which took place between 1915 and 1923, over a million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes.  We must never again allow a human tragedy to occur on this scale. It is unacceptable to witness thousands of innocent victims suffer and die without taking any action.  And I know this issue not only resonates with the Armenians in California but with everyone in the country. Every day, numerous constituents from different backgrounds call my office asking what Congress and the administration are doing to prevent genocide from occurring again.  It is absolutely essential that we do not let history repeat itself. We can--and we must--do better.  The Armenian-American community knows this all too well and today, we stand with them in commemorating the start of the Armenian genocide. So let us renew our commitment to support those around the world who face persecution and even death simply because of who they are. We will never forget the Armenian genocide, and we look to the present and future with a newfound sense of hope and optimism so that we may have the strength to stand up and prevent such atrocities.
