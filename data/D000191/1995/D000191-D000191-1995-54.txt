Chairman, there are a number of vital amendments, and particularly the one relating to the Coast Guard, where we have quite a few speakers. If we could get 10 minutes per side for that one, or if the Chairman would want to accept the amendment, of course we would not have to debate it, or if the Chairman would want to cede some of his time, so we could get at least 10 minutes on our side, I would not object.
