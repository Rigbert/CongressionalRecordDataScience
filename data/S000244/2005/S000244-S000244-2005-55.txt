Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  My, how times have changed. I was here in 1993 and I was the principal Republican author of a bill called the Brady Bill, which in part required the establishment of an automated system to check out whether somebody who was trying to purchase a firearm was eligible under the law to purchase and possess that firearm.                              {time}  2030  That had an automated system to verify the eligibility of the prospective firearm purchaser against the database that was maintained by the Department of justice. Lo and behold, the people that were pushing the Brady bill, and there were many more on that side of the aisle than the side I serve on, said this system is going to be a foolproof system in order to make sure that convicted felons or adjudicated mental incompetents will never get a firearm in their hands by purchasing it from a licensed firearm dealer. So if it was good enough then to check out people who might not be eligible to possess a firearm because of a felony conviction or a mental incompetency adjudication, then the same type of system ought to be good enough to check out whether somebody who is asking for a job is legally entitled to work in this country.  There is a 2-year delay in implementing the verification system in this bill. That is a little bit more than we heard on the Brady bill. But I think that telling the Department of Homeland Security that they got have to get this thing up and running in 2 years to be able to verify the new hires and then, 4 years later, the existing hires is plenty of time to be able to check out, in a manner that does not create a national identification card, whether somebody is eligible to get a job.  This is a good amendment. It requires progress reports on how the Department of Homeland Security is doing. What is wrong with that? We ought to pass the amendment.
