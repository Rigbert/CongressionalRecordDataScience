Speaker, It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Hammond Police Department will represent northwest Indiana in the Police Memorial Week taking place in our Nation's Capital from May 11 to 16, 1997. The Hammond police motorcycle brigade, comprised mainly of traffic enforcement officers, will leave northwest Indiana tomorrow for their day long journey to Washington, DC.  The Hammond Police Department, which conducts its own memorial ceremony for its fallen officers every year, will be the first police department in northwest Indiana to participate in the Police Memorial Week. On May 11, the Hammond police officers will gather with other motorcycle officers from across the country at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium to attend the Law Ride Motorcycle Parade, which will include a procession to Judiciary Square. During the week, the officers will be given the chance to attend seminars, candlelight vigils, and the main memorial on May 16 at Judiciary Square. The Hammond motorcycle brigade, which has expressed interest in participating in this memorial in past years, took the initiative in earning the necessary funds by conducting a raffle and securing donations from Hammond businesses. Any remaining money will be generously donated to the Indiana Surviving Families Fund, which helps families who have lost a police officer in the line of duty.  Those Hammond police officers who will ride in the brigade tomorrow include: Lt. John Pohl, Sg. Dennis Serafin, Cpl. Anthony Sonaty, Cpl. Charles Legg, Cpl. Danny Small, Cpl. George Gavrilos, Cpl. Kerry Newman, Officer Bret Plemons, and Officer Richard Tumidalsky. In addition, Chief of Hammond Police, Fred Behrens, will be joining the aforementioned police officers in Washington on Wednesday, May 14.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Hammond police brigade to our Nation's Capital as they remember police officers who have been killed in the line of duty. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Hammond police, as well as police officers across our Nation, on the dedication and courage they demonstrate daily in working to keep our communities safe.                          ____________________
