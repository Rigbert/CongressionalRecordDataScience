President, the bill under consideration on the Senate floor is intended to provide appropriations for the Department of Interior. Unfortunately, we were forced by circumstances to shift our focus during the course of debating this bill to consideration of an emergency issue which faces our Nation that relates to funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is because the President's budget did not provide enough funds to provide quality health care to veterans across America during the remainder of this fiscal year.  Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs admitted to Congress that its budget for the current fiscal year will be at least $1 billion short of the amount needed. Part of the reason for this is reportedly that the Department based its budget needs on faulty estimates. Reportedly, the VA thought it would see a 2.3-percent increase in patient demand for services. In reality, they have experienced increases of 5.2 percent. In other words, the Bush administration miscalculated. Their estimate of veteran patient load was less than half of what actually proved to be the case.  Senator Patty Murray of Washington has been our leader on this issue. Repeatedly in the Committee on the Budget and in the Senate she has said the Veterans' Administration was not asking for enough resources to take care of the veterans from other wars and the returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. She spoke at length in the Senate about the many opportunities we have had in the Senate over the last few months for the Bush administration officials to state their true budget needs. They repeatedly said they needed no more money this year. Now, belatedly, they admit they are at least $1 billion short of what they really need.  With the Murray amendment that Senator Byrd is joining and offering, the Senate has an opportunity to address this serious shortfall and to provide to America's veterans the real resources they need and deserve. One of the medical services that unquestionably, indeed, desperately needs funds is the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The war in Iraq is producing a new generation of American veterans whose wounds are invisible. Already, we see recently returned veterans with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and post traumatic-stress disorder.  As our men and women come home from battle, we must be ready to give them the help they need, the help they deserve, the help we promised. I have noted on numerous occasions the special need for additional VA capacity to treat returning veterans suffering from PTSD. Last year, the New England Journal of Medicine published data showing that roughly one in every six returning Iraqi veterans will likely suffer this debilitating mental health condition. With the number of troops having served in Iraq and Afghanistan now exceeding 1.1 million, it is absolutely clear--it has been clear for some time now--that the VA is going to see a big increase in the need for post-traumatic stress disorder treatment. Even the toughest warriors can have troubled feelings following the stress of combat. It is no sign of weakness. It is no sign of cowardice. It certainly is no sign of failure.  Frankly, they need to ask for help, and we need to give it. All our veterans need to know that services are available to them and they should not be ashamed to use them. Unfortunately, the VA's current capacity to help them is lacking. The Government Accountability Office reported last September that officials at six out of seven VA medical facilities said they may not be able to meet an increase in demand for PTSD services. Their own internal committee has made repeated recommendations about the need to expand PTSD treatment capability within the Department, but the GAO has also recorded that the Veterans' Administration has not fully implemented any of these recommendations.  Given the failure of the VA to expand PTSD treatment, as its own experts have advised, given the failure of the VA to adequately see the coming increase in patient need, given the failure of the VA to budget for its real requirements, it is time for Congress to do something, to take strong corrective action.  I have introduced legislation to fill in the gaps in the VA's treatment structure for PTSD to ensure that counselors and PTSD teams are available in every veteran center and VA hospital. But even before we make these structural changes, we can provide the funding increases to prevent long delays in service. This amendment we will consider from Senator Murray and Senator Byrd is an important step toward that goal.  It is a sad fact under the Bush administration's leadership that the Department of Veterans Affairs has failed to adequately budget for the health care needs of American veterans. Sad, but it is true. Where the administration has failed, Congress must step in and correct the problem. This amendment will help fill the gap.  In less than 20 minutes, President Bush will be speaking to America. He will be talking about the situation in Iraq. He will give his speech in the company of some of the best and bravest men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. He will undoubtedly say to them, on behalf of all Members, that we stand behind them. His words will be heartfelt and they will truly represent the way we feel about the men and women in uniform. But our commitment to soldiers and to veterans has to go beyond statements on television. It has to go beyond speeches. It has to go beyond some of the things that are left in the Congressional Record each day as a tribute. It has to be shown in our deeds.  We will have a chance with the Murray amendment to put the necessary funds in the Veterans' Department so that the hospitals and clinics across America can help our veterans from other wars and our soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. The assistance which they need can help right now. The longer a soldier is troubled, the longer a soldier suffers from PTSD and the stress and anxiety and depression that comes with it, the more difficult it is for them to finally break away and to return to a normal life. Quick, professional care is necessary.  Don't look beyond the fact that many of these soldiers have spouses and children who are affected by their problems. They need help, too. Family therapy from VA should be part of this commitment.  As I traveled around Illinois a few months back and met with the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I was stunned. Some of the youngest, strongest, best-looking soldiers who returned, men and women, who appeared to have no concerns at all, back at home in civilian life, were struggling with demons inside, demons that were created by things that they saw, things that they did, things that they were exposed to which many of us, thank God, will never have to see. We need to help them. We need to make sure that our commitment to them goes beyond a cheer, goes beyond a kind word, goes to the deeds that are necessary to prove our true commitment to the men and women in uniform.  This last group I spoke to was the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention, a statewide convention in Illinois in the city of Peoria. It was a good meeting. They were mainly veterans from other wars, from the Persian Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, World War II. These were primarily men but some women who had served our country and were coming together. Time and again, they asked us to not only stand behind our troops, but also stand behind our veterans. They challenged me. They said: Senator, be the best Senator we have ever had in this State for the veterans and soldiers. I will try to show them that I can live up to the challenge.  With this amendment, the Murray amendment which I have supported before, and which now should pass, the Senate can go on record on a bipartisan basis saying we stand behind our soldiers and our veterans.                                  Iraq  Let me say a word, Mr. President, about the President's speech this evening about the war in Iraq. Once again, it goes without saying that we are all committed to the men and women in uniform. The last time there was a supplemental appropriations bill on the floor that the President asked for, in the range of $81 billion, for the war in Iraq, it passed unanimously 100 to 0. I think that tells the story. Whether you agreed with the President's policy beginning this war or disagreed, we all agree that our men and women in uniform should have everything they need to execute this war.  But it is a war unlike any that we fought in recent times. It is hard to claim territory and hold it. Fallujah, just a few months ago, was the scene of great carnage, as American troops went in to root out the insurgents and terrorists. We lost a lot of our wonderful soldiers in that battle. They achieved their goal. They cleared out Fallujah. Yet, just a few days ago, we lost more soldiers in that same city; in this case, several women soldiers who lost their lives in the terrorism that has now become too commonplace. So claiming and holding territory is obviously very difficult in Iraq.  It is also difficult to identify an enemy that does not wear a uniform, does not stand in formation, and wreaks its havoc with these roadside bombs and other terrorist devices they use. It is a different type of war.  We are concerned as well about the status of the Government in Iraq. It is a government in formation. They are trying to put together a constitution.  Two of my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Democrat and a Republican, sent a letter to the President to urge him, in his speech tonight, to make it clear to the Iraqis they have to hold fast to the timetables to form their own government and take responsibility for their own future. Those two Senators, one from each political party, said if they failed to do that, we had to make it clear to them that we would have to reassess our commitment in Iraq.  Those are strong words, bipartisan words, but I think they represent the feelings of many Americans. We have done a great thing in Iraq in removing Saddam Hussein. That was never the issue. The question, of course, was, what would happen afterward. We had a good plan to win the military side of this conflict and to win the war. We did not have a good plan to win the peace. More than 2 years after our invasion of Iraq, more than 1,734 American soldiers have given their lives, more than 13,000 have been gravely wounded. And, unfortunately, those numbers will increase.  Tonight, the President will talk to us about his plan. If this, what we have seen to date, is what the President's plan is in Iraq, we clearly need a muchdifferent plan. We need a plan for success, a plan for victory, a plan that will bring our troops home.  There is a feeling among many of us in this Chamber and across America that we do not have that plan today. The President has to be honest with us about the costs of this war, first in human terms and most certainly in dollar terms. Some of our early allies have picked up and left--more burden on American soldiers, more burden on American taxpayers.  Finally, this Congress needs to do its job, not just to provide the resources for those soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan but to also make certain there is oversight. Yesterday, Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Lautenberg, and a few others, held a hearing from the Democratic Policy Committee on Halliburton. Halliburton is, of course, one of the largest contractors in Iraq. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts have gone their way without competitive bid and with precious little oversight.  What Senator Dorgan and others have disclosed in the course of those hearings is nothing short of shameful. We should be holding every contractor in Iraq accountable to produce good equipment, to produce good armaments, to provide our troops with what they need to succeed and come home safely. But this Congress, dominated by the President's political party, is loathe to even raise these difficult questions. So we have to hold a hearing on Monday mornings and hope that someone will notice as whistleblowers come forward and talk about some of the scandals that are occurring with the contractors in Iraq.  Congress has dropped the ball. We have a responsibility, regardless of who is in the White House and what political party he might belong to, to accept our congressional responsibility to ask hard questions.  President Harry Truman knew that. When he was a Senator from Missouri, he was the one asking the hard questions of Franklin Roosevelt's Democratic administration during World War II: Were they doing their job? Was there profiteering? Were there people taking advantage of taxpayers and our troops? Senator Truman was right with his Truman commission. Unfortunately, in today's Congress, there is nothing coming out of the Republican side of the aisle to ask those hard questions, to make sure our troops get what they truly deserve.  So tonight we will hear from the President that our goal is still democracy in Iraq. It is a good goal. It is one I hope we can achieve. But it is a difficult goal. And we have to understand that the Iraqis have premier responsibility for their own future.  Mr. President, 140,000 or 150,000 American troops, with their lives on the line every day in Iraq, remind us that we went into this war without a plan on how it would end, without an exit strategy. I hope the President will spell that out with some detail this evening. I am not expecting him to say there will be a timetable for withdrawal. He has already said he is not in favor of that. But we need to know what his plan for success will be.  Tomorrow, when we vote on this amendment on the Interior bill on the VA funding, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure for our veterans and for our soldiers. We must appropriate the funds the VA needs to provide our veterans the health care they deserve, to treat both the lasting battle scars that can be seen and those battle scars that remain invisible.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
