 Chairman, let me continue reading from the New York Times:       John Nelson, appointed last year as the reconnaissance      office top financial manager     and given the task of cleaning up the problem, said in an      interview published today in a special edition of Defense      Week that the secret agency had undergone, quoting from Mr.      Nelson, fundamental financial meltdown.  The article continues:       The financial incompetence of the reconnaissance office      meant that one of the Nation's biggest intelligence agencies      misinformed Congress, the director of the Central      Intelligence Agency and the Secretary of Defense about how      much money it had.  Continuing the New York Times:       The agency's secrecy made congressional oversight next to      impossible, intelligence officials said. Thus the      congressional intelligence committees kept appropriating      money for the secret agency unaware that it was building up a      surplus of billions of dollars.End of quote from the New York Times.  Mr. Chairman, how are we going to have credibility with the American people when we say to hungry kids, we have got to cut back on nutrition programs, when we say to homeless people, there is not enough money available for affordable housing, when we say to elderly people, the Congress cannot help you pay for the prescription drugs you desperately need, when we say there is not enough money for education and have got to cut back and then, after this horrendous financial irresponsibility on the part of an intelligence community, we say, hey, no problem, you need more money, we are there to help you out.  This is wrong. This is not what deficit reduction is about. This is a horrendous sense of national priorities.  For all of those Members who have been cutting, cutting, cutting, who have been coming up here every day talking about the national debt, I ask you to support my amendment, a 10-percent cut in the intelligence budget.
