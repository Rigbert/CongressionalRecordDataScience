Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1055, offered by my good friend and colleague, Dan Donovan. This is an important piece of legislation. It underscores the unfinished business towards Liberia.  Liberia is one of our best friends and allies, historically to the present day, for very many reasons, including the fact that freed men and women and former slaves from this country went back and helped to make Liberia what it is today.  Unfortunately, they have had people like Charles Taylor, a despotic leader who killed and maimed and enabled gross rape. He, personally, has been held to account by the Court for Sierra Leone.  We all know that David Crane, chief prosecutor, who has testified before my subcommittee on several occasions, did a wonderful job in bringing large numbers of people to justice. Charles Taylor, for example, got 50 years. I will never forget that infamous photo of Taylor looking down at the floor, never thinking that he would get a 50-year jail term for his crimes.  But there are many others who never got prosecuted. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission made serious recommendations that have not been implemented, including establishment of a criminal tribunal for Liberia.  The time has come. Dan Donovan's bill puts the House clearly on record in saying we think this needs to be done, and it needs to be done now. I thank him for his leadership. On the subcommittee, he has been a great voice of reason and strength, as well as for human rights, particularly for those in Liberia. Last September, he chaired one of our hearings on Liberia, and I thought he did a masterful job, and I want to thank him for that leadership.  Mr. Speaker, this is an important bipartisan bill. I urge its passage.
