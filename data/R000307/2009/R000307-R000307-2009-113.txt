You have already described the fact that this is exactly the same legislation, the same language in the legislation that was passed by this body and the House last year--CHIP I, CHIP II--and then it was deleted. They were talking about crowding out, and that is what happens when public subsidies encourage people to give up their private insurance.  So I am sitting here trying to figure this out. The CBO analysis says that 400,000 children will be covered in higher income families, but another 400,000 children will drop their existing private coverage as a result.  I think you had another figure that you just said.
