Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1643, extending most-favored-nation status to Bulgaria. Bulgaria has made great strides in the areas of human rights, foreign policy, economic reforms, and Jackson-Vanik requirements. MFN has been granted to Bulgaria since 1991 and this bill will continue Bulgaria's commitment to minority rights and a free market with permanent and unconditional most-favored-nation trade status.  Mr. Speaker, since the fall of communism, Bulgaria has pledged progress toward democratic and economic reforms. They have met some significant barriers which have slowed the pace of some of these reforms, including a budget crisis and high inflation. It should be noted that much of the $8 billion debt is due to its commitment to participate in the UN embargo against Yugoslavia.  Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, human rights are respected in this diverse country of ethnic Bulgarians, Turks, Gypsies, and Bulgarian muslims. Ethnic Turks, in particular, have seen their situation improve considerably since the fall of communism and the Bulgarian Government has also displayed leadership in improving its traditionally rocky relations with Turkey. In virtually every area * * * freedom of movement, treatment of national minorities, and freedom of expression, Bulgaria has improved dramatically.  In the former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria continues to work for a peaceful resolution and was the first country to recognize all of the former Yugoslav republics, including Macedonia. With a resolution of this nightmare if and when it ends, Bulgaria will see much improved economic conditions.  Mr. Speaker, the future for Bulgaria is very bright. Their continued movement to a free market means a better standard of living for the Bulgarian people and improved relations with the United States. H.R. 1643 is a major step in the right direction toward reaching this end and I urge its passage. Thank you.
