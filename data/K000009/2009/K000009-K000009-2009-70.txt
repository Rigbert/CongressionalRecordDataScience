Hungary is the first former Soviet nation, followed soon thereafter by Poland and then the Czech Republic, to join NATO. I stand here today to express gratitude for that historical moment and being given the opportunity to witness it and to recognize Hungary's pioneering commitment to solidarity, freedom, and security.  Despite years of Soviet rule, Hungary maintained a posture that looked both east and west. She became one of the first countries to institute meaningful political and economic reform after the fall of the Berlin Wall. And during the Cold War, Hungary struggled mightily not to let the door to her people close completely.  The country's exceptional acumen also boasts an impressive mathematical and scientific legacy that includes 13 Nobel Prizes, inventing the BASIC programming language, and even creating Rubik's cube. This is a nation of major measure.  When Hungary joined NATO on March 12, 1999, an enduring relationship was cemented between Hungary, Europe, and the United States. This partnership means more than a military alliance. It marked a rebirth of freedom with an end to oppression by the then Soviet Union. This historic achievement was celebrated from Budapest to Ohio, which boasts the largest Hungarian American population in our country according to the last census. This new era was marked importantly by our congressional district of Toledo that adopted two cities in Hungary, Szeged and its county, Csongrad County.  Hundreds of citizens since 1999 have been involved in cultural, educational, and political exchanges of extraordinary impact. And through the lifelong efforts of major leaders in our community, including now deceased Monsignor Martin Hernady, Ohio Representative Peter Ujvagi, the Hungarian Club of Toledo and its leader Mr. Andy Raikay, Holy Rosary, Calvin United and St. Stephen's Churches, Dr. Elizabeth Balint and Mr. Al Baldwin of the Great Lakes Consortium for International Training and Development, along with the University of Toledo, Bowling Green State University and Lords College, all are working together to build freedom forward.  Because of the new opportunities presented by NATO, the United States and Hungary were able to enrich our friendship. Our Ohio National Guard began an early partnership with the Republic of Hungary for the express purpose of demonstrating through the example of the citizen soldier the proper role of the military in a democratic society. Hungary's rich history, as well as its embrace of a new post-Soviet era governance, sets a strong example for other countries in the region that are still grappling with a meaningful identity as newly independent states. By working with our allies, America continues to nurture democracy and advance political freedoms in Eastern Europe and around the world.  An independent film that I was able to view last year, called Torn From the Flag, which has won all kinds of international awards, traces the history of Hungary from World War II through its current independence. I commend this film to all of our citizenry.  Tonight, I rise to pay tribute to Hungary, our great sister nation in liberty's cause. What a great joy it has been to get to know her people and her traditions in greater measure. And Ithank the people of my community who truly have been, each and every one of them, ambassadors of freedom from the United States to our great sister state of Hungary.                          ____________________
