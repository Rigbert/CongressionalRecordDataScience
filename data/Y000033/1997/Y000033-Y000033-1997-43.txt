Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to restate what has been said very eloquently by the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth], the gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen], and my good friend, the gentleman from American Samoa [Mr. Faleomavaega]. We cannot have itboth ways. We must have sound forest management and we must have young trees growing today.  I remember when there was the old saying ``plant a tree today for tomorrow,'' and we have forgotten that. Many people now want the old trees, the constant dying old trees, which contribute very little to mankind. They will either burn or they will die from beetle kill and they will stand and they do nothing to clean the air.  All this concurrent resolution says is we say it is time for us to have sound management, scientific management of our new forests; to plant those trees, to harvest the older trees and have these forests clean up our air.
