Speaker, I take the floor today to honor Judge Virginia A. Phillips, the recipient of the 2001 ATHENA of the Inland Valleys Award, which recognizes Judge Phillips for her professional excellence, community service and mentoring of fellow women.  The ATHENA Foundation Award Program originated in 1980 by Martha Mayhood Mertz, who realized that in the 75 years of presenting community awards, her Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce, of Michigan, had only once honored a woman. This realization led her to establish ATHENA so that focus would be given to the incredible number of professional women found throughout our communities nationwide.  In the 43rd congressional district Judge Virginia Phillips not only epitomizes all that the ATHENAs stand for but also all that we could possibly hope for in a role-model for the young women of today.  Judge Phillips received her B.A., Magna Cum Laude, from the University of California, Riverside in 1979, and later obtained her J.D. from the University of California, Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law. Additionally, her professional and community activities include: Board of Directors member of the Federal Bar Association--Inland Empire Chapter; Chairperson of the City of Riverside Law Enforcement Policy Advisory Board; Board of Directors member with the Riverside Youth Center; member of the Riverside Human Relations Committee; and much, much more. Judge Phillips' life long commitment to the Inland Empire community is obvious and compelling.  Presently, Judge Phillips serves as the first female district court judge from the Inland Empire appointed to the Central District of California, which encompasses over 18 million people, with more than three million people in the Eastern Division--the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino, California. And Riverside County, while being one of the fastest growing areas in the nation, has over 1.5 million people alone. In this position, Judge Phillips fills a critical need given the sheer number of cases that come before the Central District each month.  Mr. Speaker, my district is fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated community leader in Judge Phillips. She has given her time and talents providing motivation and inspiration to the young women with whom she comes into contact.  Judge Virginia Phillips' outstanding work makes me proud to call her a community member and fellow American. I know that all of Riverside, including myself, is grateful for her contribution to the betterment of our community and salute her on May 10th with the 2001 ATHENA Award.  I look forward to continuing to work with her and the many professional women of Riverside County for the good of our community. I would like to close with the ATHENA Foundation motto by Plato: ``What is honored in a country will be cultivated there.''                          ____________________
