Speaker, last week we lost a dear friend and a distinguished former Member of this House.  Lane Evans ably served the people of Illinois's 17th District for 24 years. He had been a public interest lawyer and a Marine veteran when he took office in 1983, and he got right to work fighting for his constituents by standing up for workers' rights, pushing for better care and benefits for those who had served in uniform, and advocating for greater opportunities for middle class families.  Lane was known as a champion of constituent services, helping northwestern Illinoisans get the help they needed from federal agencies and ensuring that casework was processed quickly and effectively. And America's veterans will always remember him for his work on behalf of those suffering from exposure to Agent Orange and those disfigured by land mines. When the Rock Island Arsenal faced cuts and closure 10 years ago, he fought with tenacity and determination to keep it open and save jobs across his district.  Lane was a self-described populist, someone who always put his fight for the common men and women of America first. He always kept faith with those he served, even after receiving the difficult diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in 1995. While his Parkinson's grew worse, Lane only grew more determined to achieve a better future for his constituents and his country. All of us who served with him were awed by his strength in body and in character as he faced that challenge with grace and resolve.  I join with the many whose lives he touched and made better throughout Illinois and across the country in paying tribute to Lane Evans and his legacy. I want to thank Representative Cheri Bustos for organizing this special order in Lane's memory and for carrying his work forward in Illinois's 17th District.  The people of Illinois and the United States--and the Members of this House--will not forget Lane Evans, his work, and his unwavering commitment to serving the country and community he so loved.                          ____________________
