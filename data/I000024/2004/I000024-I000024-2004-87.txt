President, I had the opportunity to watch Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, address the U.N. delegates. I wish he had seen what we all witnessed a few minutes ago when the great Prime Minister Allawi from Iraq gave one of the best messages I have ever heard to a joint meeting.  Much has been made about the Secretary General's remarks in an interview last week in which he called the war in Iraq ``illegal.'' Several of my colleagues, including Senator Coleman, have addressed this issue on the Senate floor, so I will not belabor the point. It is not an illegal war.  I would like to reemphasize that the liberation of Iraq was carried out to enforce Security Council resolutions.
