President, I applaud the Senate is passing bipartisan legislation that will protect employees who blow the whistle on criminal antitrust violations. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act is legislation that I have worked on with Senator Grassley for three Congresses now. This is the second Congress in a row that the Senate has passed it unanimously. The bill is an extension of my longstanding partnership with Senator Grassley on whistleblower issues.  Our bipartisan bill provides meaningful protections to employees who blow the whistle on the worst forms of anticompetitive behavior such as price fixing. Whistleblowers play an important role in alerting the public, Congress, and law enforcement agencies to wrongdoing in a number of areas. They often take significant risks in making these disclosures and can be the target of retaliation. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who alert the company, Congress, or law enforcement of criminal activity.  Senator Grassley and I modeled this legislation on the whistleblower protections we authored as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The protections are narrowly tailored and do not provide whistleblowers with an economic incentive to bring forth false claims. Last Congress, we made modest changes to the bill in the Judiciary Committee to improve the definition of a covered individual and to clarify that protections only apply to employees reporting criminal violations. This Congress, we made additional refinements in the Judiciary Committee to further clarify the scope of the bill. The protections in this bill build on recommendations from key stakeholders in a 2011 Government Accountability Office report to Congress.  Consumers benefit from competitive markets and the antitrust laws serve to safeguard competition. By protecting those who would blow the whistle on criminal antitrust behavior, our bill will help facilitate the reporting of these kinds of violations. I urge the House to pass this bipartisan legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of the bill from the National Whistleblowers Center be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                National Whistleblower Center,                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2015.     Re Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2015.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators, I am writing to you in support of the      Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2015. This      legislation will extend whistleblower protection for      employees who provide information to the Department of      Justice related to criminal antitrust violations. This Bill      will create, for the first time, whistleblower protections      for employees who report antitrust violations.       The protections in this bill were recommend by the      Government Accountability Office in a 2011 report and will      plug a loophole in the patchwork of whistleblower protection      that currently exists. Current laws in place do not provide      any protections for innocent third parties who blow the      whistle on criminal antitrust activity. The proposed Bill      will allow employees to file an action with the Department of      Labor in the event that they are retaliated against for      reporting criminal violations of the antitrust laws.       Numerous studies have shown that employees are the first      defense to prevent fraud and white-collar crime. Such crimes      harm businesses, consumers, and our economy. Investigators      rely heavily on information from insiders to protect the      public interest and prevent illegal competitive practices.      The brave individuals that report antitrust violations should      be protected.       This is a narrow but important bill that will help to      improve enforcement of the antitrust laws.                                                  Stephen M. Kohn,                                               Executive Director.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
