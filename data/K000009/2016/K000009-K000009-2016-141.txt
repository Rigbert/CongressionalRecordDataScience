Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill.  Our armed service chiefs and secretaries have requested two results from Congress in defense: stability and predictability in the budget.  Instead of adhering to their requests, this bill actually creates a contentious budget environment next April that causes even more harm to our military.  The bill is full of contradiction. It authorizes funds for over 50,000 more troops, but no money to send them anywhere after April. It authorizes much-needed equipment, but not any money to employ it on the battlefield. It authorizes 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, just not any money to keep them there during the actual fighting season.  It sends a message to our allies that we are only 60 percent committed to our missions with them, and it sends the message to our adversaries that we are only 60 percent committed to stopping them.  It is like we are a basketball team who bought new uniforms, recruited highly skilled players, built a new facility, and didn't even have any money left to play the second half of the season. No team wins under those circumstances. It doesn't matter how many state-of-the-art weapons you have or how well-trained your troops are, you can't win if you don't show up.  Much like General Breedlove, who believes ``virtual presence means actual absence,'' I believe this is a virtual plan and will be an actual disaster.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and ``no'' on the underlying bill.
