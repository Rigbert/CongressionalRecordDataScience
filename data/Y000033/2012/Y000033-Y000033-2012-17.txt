Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4347 would designate the United States Courthouse in Juneau, Alaska, as the Robert Boochever United States Courthouse.  Judge Boochever served our country as a captain in the U.S. Army during World War II and then moved to Alaska in 1940, where he worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in private practice. In 1972, he was appointed to the AlaskaSupreme Court and served 3 years as the chief justice. In 1980, he was the first Alaskan appointed as a judge to the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and served as a Federal judge for more than 30 years until his death in 2011.  Judge Boochever's commitment to the law and service made him a well-respected jurist, and so I am pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation. I support the passage of this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
