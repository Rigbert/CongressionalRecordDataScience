 President, today I am introducing a bill to clarify that children receiving health insurance under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in states like California are eligible for free vaccines under the 1993 Federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.  I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi who is introducing a companion bill in the House today.  I am introducing this bill because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as 528,000 children in California have lost or will lose their eligibility to receive free vaccines, under California's Healthy Families program. Approximately 169,000 kids have lost eligibility to date.  California ranks 37th overall among States having children fully immunized by the age of 18 to 24 months. From 1993 to 1997, Orange County, California, had 85 hospitalizations and four deaths related to chicken pox. Across the State in 1996 there were 15 deaths and 1,172 hospitalizations related to chicken pox. More recently, the Immunization Branch in California reports that in 1998 over 1,000 whooping cough cases, including 5 deaths, were reported--the largest number of cases and deaths since the 1960's. Whooping cough and chicken pox are diseases for which there are vaccinations. We must do more to increase access to vaccinations for our nation's children.  The Federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in 1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In 1998, as many 743,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or on Medicaid, received these vaccines. This number is down by approximately 32,000 children in comparison to the 1997 immunization figures for California's poor children. California received $80.3 million in 1999 from the Federal Government to provide vaccines.  Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than immunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--diseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows that vaccines are fundamental to children's good health.  Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the program, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can take to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold them from children who (1) have been getting them when they were uninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become insured.  According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of California's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the fact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Our uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 24 percent, the third highest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. As for children, 1.85 million or 19 percent of our children are without health insurance, compared to 15 percent nationally, according to UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need.  In creating the new children's health insurance program in California, the state chose to set up a program under which the state contracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible children care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, HHS has interpreted this form of ``health insurance'' as making them ``insured,'' as defined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for the federal vaccines. I disagree.  It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress made eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, children who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe that in defining the term ``insured'' at that time Congress clearly meant private health insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's new Healthy Families program are participating in a federal-state, subsidized insurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families apply to the state for participation. They are not insured by a private, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the Vaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B). On February 23, the California Medical Association wrote to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, ``As they are participants in a federal and state-subsidized health program, these individuals are not ``insured'' for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).''  The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is administering the new program with the Department of Health Services, wrote to HHS on February 5, ``It is imperative that states like California, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same support and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at no cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.'' The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, ``More than half a million California children should not be deprived of vaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality . . .,'' calling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.''  Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper childhoodimmunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help me keep our children healthy.                          ____________________
