Let me reaffirm what my colleague said. This whole concept of ombudsman and consumer assistance centers is designed to allow the consumer in the first few hours, or even minutes, when they encounter problems in the health care system, to get advice and assistance. This is not a theoretical concept. It works already in several States.  California has a model program around the Sacramento area. People have benefited from this. This is what we want to see in every State in the country.  Again, if we cannot be sensitive enough to recognize the need for consumer assistance early in the process, then I believe we are failing the American public miserably. I hope we can embrace, support, and adopt this amendment, particularly this provision with respect to the ombudsman consumer assistance program.  I yield back my time.
