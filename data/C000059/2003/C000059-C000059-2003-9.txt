Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1964) to establish the Highlands Stewardship Area in the States of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1964       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Highlands Conservation      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following--       (1) The Highlands region is a physiographic province that      encompasses more than 2,000,000 acres extending from eastern      Pennsylvania through the States of New Jersey and New York to      northwestern Connecticut.       (2) The Highlands region is an environmentally unique area      that--       (A) provides clean drinking water to over 15,000,000 people      in metropolitan areas in the States of Connecticut, New      Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania;       (B) provides critical wildlife habitat, including habitat      for 247 threatened and endangered species;       (C) maintains an important historic connection to early      Native American culture, colonial settlement, the American      Revolution, and the Civil War;       (D) contains recreational resources for 14 million visitors      annually;       (E) provides other significant ecological, natural,      tourism, recreational, educational, and economic benefits;      and       (F) provides homeownership opportunities and access to      affordable housing that is safe, clean, and healthy.       (3) An estimated 1 in 12 citizens of the United States live      within a 2-hour drive of the Highlands region.       (4) More than 1,400,000 residents live in the Highlands      region.       (5) The Highlands region forms a greenbelt adjacent to the      Philadelphia-New York City-Hartford urban corridor that      offers the opportunity to preserve water, forest and      agricultural resources, wildlife habitat, recreational areas,      and historic sites, while encouraging sustainable economic      growth and development in a fiscally and environmentally      sound manner.       (6) Continued population growth and land use patterns in      the Highlands region--       (A) reduce the availability and quality of water;       (B) reduce air quality;       (C) fragment the forests;       (D) destroy critical migration corridors and forest      habitat; and       (E) result in the loss of recreational opportunities and      scenic, historic, and cultural resources.       (7) The water, forest, wildlife, recreational,      agricultural, and cultural resources of the Highlands region,      in combination with the proximity of the Highlands region to      the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, make the      Highlands region nationally significant.       (8) The national significance of the Highlands region has      been documented in--       (A) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study      conducted by the Forest Service in 1990;       (B) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study: 2002      Update conducted by the Forest Service;       (C) the bi-State Skylands Greenway Task Force Report;       (D) the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment      Plan;       (E) the New York State Open Space Conservation Plan;       (F) the Connecticut Green Plan: Open Space Acquisition FY      2001-2006;       (G) the open space plans of the State of Pennsylvania; and       (H) other open space conservation plans for States in the      Highlands region.       (9) The Highlands region includes or is adjacent to      numerous parcels of land owned by the Federal Government or      federally designated areas that protect, conserve, or restore      resources of the Highlands region, including--       (A) the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge;       (B) the Shawanagunk Grasslands Wildlife Refuge;       (C) the Morristown National Historical Park;       (D) the Delaware and Lehigh Canal Corridors;       (E) the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area;       (F) the Delaware River Basin;       (G) the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area;       (H) the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River;       (I) the Appalachian National Scenic Trail;       (J) the United States Military Academy at West Point, New      York;       (K) the Highlands National Millenium Trail;       (L) the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge;       (M) the proposed Crossroads of the Revolution National      Heritage Area;       (N) the proposed Musconetcong National Scenic and      Recreational River in New Jersey; and       (O) the Farmington River Wild and Scenic Area in      Connecticut.       (10) It is in the interest of the United States to protect,      conserve, and restore the resources of the Highlands region      for the residents of, and visitors to, the Highlands region.       (11) The States of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and      Pennsylvania, and units of local government in the Highlands      region have the primary responsibility for protecting,      conserving, preserving, restoring and promoting the resources      of the Highlands region.       (12) Because of the longstanding Federal practice of      assisting States in creating, protecting, conserving, and      restoring areas of significant natural and cultural      importance, and the national significance of the Highlands      region, the Federal Government should, in partnership with      the Highlands States and units of local government in the      Highlands region, protect, restore, and preserve the water,      forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational and cultural      resources of the Highlands region.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To recognize the importance of the water, forest,      agricultural, wildlife, recreational and cultural resources      of the Highlands, and the national significance of the      Highlands region to the United States.
