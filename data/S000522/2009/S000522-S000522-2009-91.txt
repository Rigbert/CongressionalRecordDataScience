Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 342, offered by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Joseph Cao. The ``Vietnamese Refugees Day'' resolution sets aside May 2, 2009, as a day of remembrance and celebration for the growing Vietnamese American community in the United States and throughout the world.  First, I would like to say a few words about Mr. Cao, the first Vietnamese-American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Joseph is a husband, proud father and man of deep and abiding religious faith and currently serves the people of Louisiana's Second District with honor and distinction.  Mr. Cao is far too modest and humble to say it, but he is the quintessential example of a refugee success story.  Joseph Cao's father, a lieutenant in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, was captured by the North Vietnamese at the end of the war and was incarcerated for seven terrible years in a reeducation camp.  In 1975, at the age of 8, Joseph escaped Vietnam with two of his siblings. His mom and jailed father remained behind. Joseph Cao worked hard in his new adopted homeland. Smart, resourceful, devout and generous to a fault, Joseph earned his Bachelor's Degree at Baylor, his Master's from Fordham University, and his J.D. from Loyola Law School.                              {time}  1315  Never forgetting the plight of refugees, and wanting to make a difference in the lives of the disenfranchised, Joseph became an immigration lawyer. He worked tirelessly to aid refugees and to assist in unifying families. He served as a member of the board of directors of Boat People SOS, and he is now a member of the United States Congress and is a rising star in the House.   Mr. Speaker, Joseph Cao is an inspiration to all who escape tyranny and come to America. With persistence and hard work and faith, Joseph inspires a new generation of refugees and, really, everyone else as well that you can achieve much and do wonderful things if you put your mind to it and you persist.  Joseph's legislation highlights the extraordinary work and the contributions made by Vietnamese Americans and the work of groups like Boat People SOS and the work of people like Dr. Thang, who have welcomed Vietnamese asylum seekers fleeing reeducation camps, harassment, and religious persecution, labor violations and other human rights abuses.  Over 2 million boat people and other refugees from Vietnam have received asylum in the United States and around the world. Half of those individuals have made their home in the U.S. Vietnamese Americans have made and continue to make a significant contributions to our country, bringing their rich heritage and culture and work ethic to the United States, their new, cherished permanent home.  The sad thing, Mr. Speaker, is that Vietnam's government continues to repress its own citizens, and the human rights record of that country's government remains deplorable. So many Vietnamese suffer each day at the hands of the government and secret police. It's deplorable.
