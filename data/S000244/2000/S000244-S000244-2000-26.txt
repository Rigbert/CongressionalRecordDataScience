 Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill to get America's children the type of technologically adept teachers that they need to bring themselves into the 21st century. It should not be held up because we have had 2 years of study on this, direct hearings and having the bill open for amendment during the markup at the Committee on Science.  At no point prior to 48 hours ago have the objections, such as those raised by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) been brought up.  This bill has widespread support, and I would like to read off a list of the organizations that have supported it: the American Association for Engineering Education, the American Association of Engineering Societies, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, the American Chemical Society, the American Physical Society, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Business Round Table, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, International Society for Optical Engineering, International Technology Education Association, Jobs for the Future, National Academy Of Sciences, National Alliance of Business, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Science Teachers Association, National Society of Professional Engineers, Optical Society of America, SAE International and Triangle Coalition for Mathematics and Science Education.  Mr. Speaker, I would implore the House of Representatives to do the right thing, to give our kids the tools to advance into the 21st century and be able to compete in a globalized economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
