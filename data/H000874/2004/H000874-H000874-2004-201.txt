Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, it is not our intention to go into further discussions at this time with reference to the schedule. The substance of the legislation, that will be left for weeks to come. But this week is set aside to honor our former President, Ronald Reagan, and certainly we intend to participate with the majority in doing just that.                          ____________________
