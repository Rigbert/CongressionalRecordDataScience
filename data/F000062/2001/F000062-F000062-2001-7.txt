 Hagel, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 90       Whereas on June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea,      thereby initiating the Korean War, leading to the loss of      countless lives, and further polarizing a world engulfed by      the Cold War;       Whereas in the aftermath of the Korean War, the division of      the Koreas at the 38th parallel separated millions of Koreans      from their families, tearing at the heart of every mother,      father, daughter, and son;       Whereas on June 13 and 14, 2000, in the first summit      conference ever held between leaders of North and South      Korea, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung met with North      Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, North Korea's      capital;       Whereas in a historic joint declaration, South Korean      President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il      made an important promise to promote economic cooperation and      hold reunions of South Korean and North Korean citizens;       Whereas such reunions have been held in North and South      Korea since the signing of the joint declaration, reuniting      family members who had not seen or heard from each other for      more than 50 years;       Whereas 500,000 people of the United States of Korean      ancestry bear the pain of being separated from their families      in North Korea;       Whereas the United States values peace in the global      community and has long recognized the significance of uniting      families torn apart by the tragedy of war; and       Whereas a petition drive is taking place throughout the      United States, urging the United States Government to assist      in the reunification efforts: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) Congress and the President should support efforts to      reunite people of the United States of Korean ancestry with      their families in North Korea; and       (2) such efforts should be made in a timely manner, as 50      years have passed since the separation of these families.
