Speaker, it is my distinct honor to celebrate the activities of Hispanic Heritage Month. Governor O'Bannon has designated September 15 through October 15, 1998, Indiana's Hispanic Heritage Month. This proclamation is in recognition of the efforts Indiana's Hispanic-American population has consistently displayed to improve the State of Indiana, as well as Indiana's First Congressional District.  In Northwest Indiana, you will find a vibrant, active, and proud Hispanic community. Thriving organizations such as the Latin American Community Alliance for Support and Assistance (LACASA) of NWI, Inc., Northwest Indiana Hispanic Coordinating Council, Hispanic Women's Forum of NWI, Union Benefica Mexicana, Puerto Rican Parade and Cultural Organization, Sociedad Mutualista Mexico, Raza de Bronze, Northwest Indiana Latino Historical Society, the Hispanic Catholic Center, National Association of Hispanic Nurses-Indiana Chapter, National Council of LaRaza affiliate, U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute affiliates, National Council of Puerto Rican Women (NaCoPRW), League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Indiana University Northwest's ALMA Latino student organization, Purdue University Calumet's Los Latinos student organization, Calumet College of St. Joseph's Los Amigos Latino student organization, Ivy Tech State College's Latino student organization, Valparaiso University's LIVE Latino student organization, to name a few, provide an effective avenue for promoting Hispanic interests and their shared cultural heritage.  Active in every aspect of community life from labor organizer, police chief, and Federal district court judge to educators, Labor President, and clergy, the citizens of Northwest Indiana have a multitude of Hispanic-American role models to emulate. Indeed, as an increasingly important segment of the Northwest Indiana community, Hispanic-Americans are making many valuable contributions to our state and region. These valuable contributions have come not only culturally, but also in the areas of law, religion, agriculture, education, architecture, and technology. Without the contributions of Hispanic-Americans, the rich, diverse, ethnically flavored culture of Northwest Indiana would be incomplete.  Mr. Speaker, Hispanic-Americans strive to earn and enjoy the promise and benefits that America, at its best, extends to all. I am proud to serve as the Representative in Congress for Northwest Indiana, with its diverse multicultural heritage, and I encourage my distinguished colleagues, and all citizens, to participate and enjoy events commemorating Hispanic Heritage Month.                          ____________________
