As the gentleman knows, we would have an alternative to that. Can the leader give us assurance that we will have that option?  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman knows that it is the tradition of the House to keep Ways and Means tax bills very tight. We have always as a tradition discouraged amendments, but we have encouraged substitutes. I cannot speak for the Committee on Rules; but if there are alternatives in the form of substitutes, then they will be taken into consideration.
