President, I probably would not object. I would point out that I was responding to the distinguished Republican leader who had spoken an equal amount of time on Mr. Griffith. I had spoken yesterday considerably less time, on the same nomination, than the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. I also know both the Republican and Democratic cloakrooms have notified their Members that we are going to vote at 10. There are a number of hearings that have been established based on that. As a matter of courtesy, I am not going to object, but I wanted the distinguished Senator from Utah to know I took the same amount of time the distinguished Republican leader did on the same thing, and overall less time than the distinguished Senator from Utah has taken. I will not object.
