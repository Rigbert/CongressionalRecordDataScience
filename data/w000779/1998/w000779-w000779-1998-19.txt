The hour is late.  All we seek to do is to have technological neutrality. We are not going to tax catalogs. We also don't want to tax web sites. That is all this is about--preventing that kind of discriminatory tax.  I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these things happen as we consider legislation. There are very strongly held views on this issue, especially by the Senator from Florida who, as a former Governor, understands the impact of these issues on his State. I understand that and appreciate that. But I want to be clear that my interpretation and that of the Senator from Oregon and the proponents of this legislation are that if we do not allow the amendment 3711, then the legislation itself would be rendered largely meaningless.                          ____________________
