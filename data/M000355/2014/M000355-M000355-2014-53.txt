 President, I rise today to honor an exemplary public servant from my home State of Kentucky. Nan Gorman who is currently serving as the mayor of the City of Hazard will retire this year upon completing her term of office.  Mayor Gorman was born in Memphis, TN, but moved to Hazard shortly after. She grew up in hard times, with the Nation reeling from the effects of a worldwide depression. Though the odds may have been stacked against her, she graduated from the University of Cincinnati and the Parson School of Design in New York and subsequently traveled the world on a tour of self-education.  Nan experienced so much of the world in her travels, but she saw nothing that would prevent her from returning to her ``Old Kentucky Home.'' Back in Hazard, she married her high-school sweetheart, Bill, who was elected mayor of Hazard in 1978 and served in that capacity until his death 35 years later.  Bill Gorman was a beloved member of the Hazard community. When he died in October of 2010, however, Nan was appointed to serve as interim mayor and the town did not skip a beat. Nan performed so well in her interim role that she was voted into office by a 3-1 margin in the next election.  Although Mayor Gorman will step down at the end of her term, her love for the City of Hazard has not decreased in the slightest degree, and she is planning on running for one of the city's four commissioner seats.  Nan Gorman's dedication to public service and her community set a shining example for us all, and I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing her illustrious career.  Mr. President, though I admittedly possess a strong bias towards the author, who happens to be my wife, Secretary Elaine Chao, Politico published what I found to be an exceptional article on Mayor Gorman last year. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Politico, Nov. 17, 2013]                    Embracing Her Old Kentucky Home                            (By Elaine Chao)       Deep in the heart of Kentucky's rugged Eastern Mountain      region there lives a woman who has fascinated and inspired me      for two decades. She is known locally these days as ``Mayor      Nan''--the octogenarian chief executive of Hazard and      advocate for its 5,467 residents.       Nan Gorman was born in Memphis, Tenn., on St. Patrick's      Day. She moved to Hazard in 1929 when her father, James      Hagan, a recent medical school graduate and aspiring surgeon,      went to work there. The stock market was about to crash and      soon the Great Depression would be under way and take a      brutal toll on the rural mountain economy. In the early days,      her father was often paid for his services with chickens and      eggs. Later, her father became chief surgeon for the region      at the Hazard Hospital.       Hazard was not just small but remote because of the lack of      roads in the region so the Hagan family, with little Nan in      tow, traveled there from Tennessee via Virginia mountain      passes. Nan's parents, who she says still inspire and guide      her today, ensured that she had a good education and gave her      the opportunity to attend college but, as was prevalent then,      expected that she would soon settle down as a young woman,      marry and have children.       She eventually did all that, but not until after she had      experienced some of the world far from Hazard and her beloved      eastern Kentucky mountains that she says ``are like the arms      of a mother around us.'' So enraptured was she with the      natural beauty around Hazard that she became an artist to      record scenes in pencil, ink, watercolors and oil paints.       After World War II, Nan graduated from the University of      Cincinnati and attended the prestigious Parsons School of      Design in New York City. With an adventurous spirit, Nan flew      to Egypt by herself to study ancient history and then      traveled on for solo explorations of Greece, Rome, Paris and      London. Having been exposed to such exotic, vibrant cities so      full of opportunity, one could hardly have begrudged a choice      to make her life elsewhere. But instead, she chose to come      home to Kentucky. She got an apartment in Lexington and      worked as a freelance artist drawing advertisements for      clothing stores, doing architectural renderings and sketching      historical landmarks. One day she saw a classified      advertisement in which the state was looking for a full-time      artist, and she subsequently became the first one ever      employed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Among her tasks was      designing the state seal--United We Stand, Divided We Fall--     which is still in use today.       At age 50, Nan settled again in Hazard, remarried--to her      high school sweetheart, Bill, and together they formed a      partnership that would have a lasting impact on virtually      every sphere of the community. Bill was elected mayor in      1978, served for 35 years and never accepted a salary. When      he returned home to the Lord three years ago, Nan asked that      donations go to a fund to benefit local public schools.      Wishing to continue Bill's legacy of service to the      community, Nan was subsequently elected mayor as a write-in      candidate, winning by a 3-to-1 margin.       Nan's governing personal ethic is to constantly strive to      do better for Hazard's residents for as long as she can. When      last I spoke with her, Nan was alternately expressing pride      over a young local girl's success overcoming disadvantages,      helping with the Appalachian Regional Hospital's fundraising      campaign and her efforts to obtain refrigerators for families      in need.       An octogenarian well-deserving of retirement, Mayor Nan      instead toils from sunrise to late in the evening on behalf      of her town. She takes pleasure in the people and the      mountain scenery and loves nothing more than to watch      wildlife in her yard or to hear that some good fortune is      improving someone's life. My takeaway from every visit with      Nan is appreciation for the big difference that one woman in      a little town can make.                          ____________________
