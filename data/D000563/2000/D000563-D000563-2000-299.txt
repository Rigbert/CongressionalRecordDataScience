I am reading from this alternative. I would like to have the comment of the Senator from North Dakota. The Democratic alternative to change the estate tax would increase the exemption from $1.3 million per couple to $2 million per couple by 2002, and to $4 million per couple by 2010; meaning, if your estate is at $4 million, in the year 2010 you would not pay a single penny in estate taxes. This would eliminate the tax on two-thirds of the estates currently subject to tax every year.  The Democratic alternative would also increase the family-owned business exemption from $2.6 million per couple to twice that, of a general exemption, to $4 million per couple by 2002 and $8 million per couple by 2010. This would remove almost all family-owned farms and 75 percent of family-owned businesses from the estate tax rolls.  So the Democratic alternative eliminates two-thirds of the families paying estate taxes in America, 75 percent of the family-owned businesses, and virtually all of the family farms under the Democratic alternative, for a fraction of the cost of the Republican approach.  I think the Senator from North Dakota has made it clear that the people who are left at that point paying the estate tax, under the Democratic approach, would include, if I have not mistaken his comment, the Forbes top 400 wealthiest people in America. They would still be paying the estate tax.  I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota if I am not mistaken. Did he not say that the Republican approach, as opposed to the Democratic approach, would mean for the top 400 wealthiest people in America, the Republican tax break would be $250 billion? Was that the comment made by the Senator from North Dakota? It would be a $250 billion tax break for 400 people in America? That is the Republican priority that they want to bring to the floor, and not consider everything else the Senator from North Dakota has raised?
