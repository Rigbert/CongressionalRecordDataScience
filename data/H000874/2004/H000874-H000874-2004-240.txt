 Mr. DeLAY. His understanding may be a little late because as of almost over a week now, both the Republicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate have given up trying to come up with a number agreed to by the President and have decided to go to conference. The minority on the Senate side has been informed of that fact. We are ready to go to conference to work out whatever the number may be within conference, to work out all the other disagreements between the two bodies, and they are ready to go to conference. I do not want to speak for the other body, but it is the minority that is refusing to allow the majority over there to go to conference.
