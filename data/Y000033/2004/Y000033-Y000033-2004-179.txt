Mr. Chairman, I submit the following two letters for the Record.                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2004.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: I am writing with regard to H.R. 3550,      the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, which was      ordered reported by the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure on March 24, 2004. As you know, the Energy and      Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over matters involving      air quality planning and the air quality impact of      transportation projects, the Congestion Mitigation Air      Quality Program, provisions involving energy production,      supply and storage and other matters contained within H.R.      3550 as reported.       I recognize your desire to bring this legislation before      the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I will not      exercise my Committee's right to a referral. By agreeing to      waive its consideration of the bill, however, the Energy and      Commerce Committee does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R.      3550. In addition, the Energy and Commerce Committee reserves      its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill      that are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this legislation. I ask      for your commitment to support any request by the Energy and      Commerce Committee for conferees on H.R. 3550 or similar      legislation.       I request that you include this letter as part of the      Committee's Report on H.R. 3550 and in the Record during      consideration of the legislation on the House floor. Thank      you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                           U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on            Transportation and Infrastructure,                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2004.     Hon. Joe Barton, Chairman,     Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of March 26,      2004 regarding H.R. 3550, the Transportation Equity Act: A      Legacy for Users. Your assistance in expediting consideration      of the bill is very much appreciated.       I agree that there are certain provisions in the bill that      are of jurisdictional interest to the Committee on Energy and      Commerce and I agree that by foregoing a sequential referral,      the Committee on Commerce is not waving its jurisdiction. Be      assured that I will support your request to be represented in      the conference on those provisions in the jurisdiction of the      Energy and Commerce Committee.       As you have requested, I will include this exchange of      letters in the Committee report on the bill and in the Record      when the bill is on the Floor. Thank you for your cooperation      and your continued leadership and support in surface      transportation matters.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.
