President, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the country's pediatricians, is recommending to the Senate that this amendment be passed to encourage healthier foods for our kids. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that this amendment has no cost.  This amendment would, for the first time, test out farm-to-school programs through a competitive pilot program with at least five farm-to-school demonstration projects so it would be possible to fill in the information voidabout what works and what doesn't. The Agriculture Department's own Economic Research Service reports that ``data and analysis of farm-to-school programs are scarce.''  Under this amendment, the schools win, the farmers win, and the taxpayers win. I hope we can accept it with a voice vote.
