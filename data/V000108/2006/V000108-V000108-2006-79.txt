Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I wish to congratulate the members of the Save the Dunes Council as they celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. To commemorate this special occasion, the Save the Dunes Council hosted a 40th Anniversary Gala Event on Saturday, October 21, 2006, at Valparaiso University's Brauer Museum of Art in Valparaiso, Indiana.  From its humble beginning, the Save the Dunes Council, created in the Ogden Dunes living room of Dorothy Buell and a mere dozen of her female neighbors, has become one of the most knowledgeable, involved, and respected organizations in Northwest Indiana and beyond. Founded in 1952 with the mission of protecting and preserving the Indiana Dunes, the Save the Dunes Council worked tirelessly toward their goal of creating a National Lakeshore, which they accomplished in 1966. Since that time, the Save the Dunes Council, comprised of local citizens, has continued to fight to protect the lakeshore from man-made intrusions and preserve the environment. Through the efforts of these dedicated individuals, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore has nearly doubled in size. Currently, the National Lakeshore consists of more than 15,000 picturesque acres of land, while plans for continued expansion are in place.  The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore has, for many years, been a popular tourist destination as well as a place where local families and groups can enjoy an afternoon together. Its scenic lake views and magnificent sandy beaches have made the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore a focal point of Northwest Indiana, while the spectacular Mount Baldy, the largest of the lakeshore's moving dunes at 126 feet, is a sight that visitors are sure to remember. In addition to the magnificent nature views, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore offers a wide array of activities to satisfy the interests of all nature-lovers, including: hiking, swimming, bird watching, fishing, camping, and horseback riding, as well as many guided tours and other gatherings.  On Saturday, October 21, 2006, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore 40th Anniversary Gala took place and featured a social hour and exhibit tours of the artwork of Frank V. Dudley, an artist who dedicated forty years of his life to the preservation and promotion of the Indiana Dunes. The evening proceeded with a silent auction, formal dinner, speakers, and music.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the efforts of the members of the Save the Dunes Council, past and present, and in celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the establishment of the Indiana Dunes as a National Lakeshore. These selfless individuals continue to dedicate their time and unrelenting efforts to serve their community through the preservation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________
