 This is truly an accomplishment as a five-star designation is quite a rarity. With fewer than ten plans nationwide receiving this top rating, Martin's Point Medicare Advantage plans are among a very select group. They are also the only Maine health care organization to receive this distinction for 2012.  The CMS five-star rating system was developed to help demonstrate the value of Medicare plans and to help ensure that they meet specific quality standards. It provides the nation's nearly 48 million Medicare beneficiaries with a tool to compare the quality of care and customer service that Medicare health and drug plans offer. The rating system considers several quality measures, such as success in providing preventive services like screenings and vaccines; chronic illness management; and ratings of plan responsiveness, care, and customer service.  Martin's Point is a not-for-profit health care organization committed to providing the best possible health care experience to its patients and members. The organization is comprised of a multispecialty medical group with nine primary care health centers in Maine and New Hampshire. Martin's Point also administers three health plans: a Medicare Advantage plan in Maine, the U.S. Family Health Plan for military families and retirees throughout New England, and a new innovative program called MaineSense for small to medium employers in Maine. Its Medicare Advantage plans cover more than 12,500 Medicare beneficiaries across the State of Maine.  Martin's Point began in the early 1960s in the Camden/Rockport, ME, area when Dr. Niles Perkins obtained federal funding under the Great Society Act of Congress to provide health care services to uninsured or underinsured indigent individuals. These individuals, many of them fisherman and employees of a local fish processing plant, didn't qualify for Medicare, but also couldn't afford health insurance on their own. With the Federal funding obtained, Dr. Niles formed Penobscot Bay Medical Association.  Meanwhile in 1982, Dr. Johann Brower, a colleague of Dr. Perkins at Penobscot Bay Medical Associates, wrote a proposal to purchase some of the land and facilities at Martin's Point from the U.S. Government. Despite the fact that several other organizations, including Mercy, applied for the grant, Dr. Brower's application was the only one submitted on time and was accepted. The purchase price was $1.00, under the conditions that Penobscot Bay Medical Associates would operate the facility as a not-for-profit for 30 years.  Penobscot Bay Medical Associates, doing business as Martin's Point, became a designated uniform service treatment facility. Maine military retirees were able to come from all over the State to the facility and have their care paid for by CHAMPUS. Access to primary care--family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics--along with on-site laboratory, dental, optometry, pharmacy and radiology was made available to all patients utilizing the facility.  In 1996, under the U.S. Family Health Plan, Martin's Point was authorized as a TRICARE prime provider and awarded their first multimillion-dollar, multiyear contract with the Department of Defense. This all happened under the direction of Dr. David Howes, who became the president and CEO of Martin's Point in 1996.  In the 2000s, Martin's Point expanded their USHFP membership--they now have over 35,000 members in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and the northern tier of Pennsylvania  Then, in 2006, they launched their Generations Advantage plans. These are Medicare Advantage options for seniors and persons with disabilities in six Maine counties. They have since expanded so that in 2010, their Medicare Advantage plans are offered in all 16 counties in Maine. They serve over 12,500 members.  In 2008, Martin's Point became one of the first 40 organizations to become a prototyping organization in the Institute for Healthcare Improvements Triple Aim initiative. In 2009, they affiliated with Bowdoin Medical Group, a large group of physicians with five health centers in southern and coastal Maine communities. This acquisition essentially doubled Martin's Point provider base and patient count--bringing their total number of health centers up to 9.  In November 2010, Martin's Point opened the doors of their new, state-of-the-art primary care facility on the Veranda St. peninsula at Martin's Point. This flagship facility, designed with input from providers, patients and other clinical employees, is a fitting tribute to the patient-focused philosophy of Martin's Point and helps them to realize their unending commitment to providing a better health care experience for their patients.  Today, Martin's Point's Medicare Advantage plans are in the top 3 percent nationally based on quality. I am delighted to recognize Martin's Point for this accomplishment, and I wish them all the best in the coming years.                          ____________________
