  In the years they paid no income tax, these 82 companies reported $102 billion in pretax U.S. profits. Moreover, instead of paying $35.6 billion in income taxes as the statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate required, these companies received tax rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury totaling $12.6 billion. These rebates meant that the companies made more after taxes than before taxes in those no-tax years.  Twenty-eight corporations enjoyed negative federal income tax rates over the entire 2001-2003 period. These companies, whose pretax U.S. profits totaled $44.9 billion over the 3 years, included: Pepco Holdings (-59.6 percent tax rate), Prudential Financial (-46.2 percent), ITT Industries (-22.3 percent), Boeing (-18.8 percent), Unisys (-16.0 percent), and CSX (-7.5 percent), the company previously headed by Secretary of the Treasury Snow. General Electric topped the corporate tax breaks recipients with $9.5 billion in tax breaks over 3 years.  The average effective rate for the 275 Fortune 500 companies was only 17.2 percent in 2002-2003, though the corporate tax rate is 35 percent.  How is this happening? Accelerated depreciation. Legislation adopted in 2002 and 2003 vastly increased corporate write-offs for ``accelerated depreciation'' and made it easier for corporations to use their excess tax subsidies to generate tax-rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury, at a 3-year cost of $175 billion.  Offshore tax sheltering. Over the past decade, corporations and their accounting firms have become increasingly aggressive in seeking ways to shift their profits, on paper, into offshore tax havens, in order to avoid their tax obligations. Corporate offshore tax sheltering is estimated to cost the U.S. Treasury anywhere from $30 to $70 billion a year.  Senator Levin has been aggressive in trying to close these loopholes and some of his ideas were adopted in the Senate version of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill.  Stock options. Of the 275 corporations studied, 269 received stock-option tax benefits during the 2001-2003 periods, which lowered their taxes by a total of $32 billion over three years. Microsoft had the largest tax savings with $5 billion.  Tax credits. The federal tax code provides tax credits for companies that engage in research, exporting, hiring low-wage workers, affordable housing, and enhanced coals usage. For example, Bank of America cut its taxes by $590 million over 2001-2003 by purchasing affordable-housing tax credits.
