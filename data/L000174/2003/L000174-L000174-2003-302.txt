President, I rise today to talk about a man, Kirk Noble Bloodsworth, who was the victim of a grossly imperfect system. I first met Kirk Bloodsworth in 2000 when he came to me as a man who had been exonerated after almost 9 years of wrongful imprisonment. I am proud to say that we have become close friends and partners in the fight to reform capital punishment in America.  For 8 years, 11 months and 19 days, Kirk Bloodsworth served time in prison as an innocent man. And for the next 10 years, Mr. Bloodsworth lived in a jail without bars. He lived in a world where people questioned his innocence, where rumors followed him everywhere he went, and where he was unable to find stable employment.  On July 25, 1984, 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton was brutally raped and murdered. Fifteen days later, Kirk Bloodsworth was arrested based on the testimony of several witnesses who said they had seen him near the spot where they found Miss Hamilton. There was no physical evidence linking Mr. Bloodsworth to the crime.  In March, 1985, Mr. Bloodsworth, a former Marine with no criminal background, was convicted and sentenced to death in Maryland. He was 24 years old. Subsequently, the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned Mr. Bloodsworth's conviction. However, a second jury trial found him guilty, and sentenced him to two consecutive life terms. In 1992, at the request of Mr. Bloodsworth and his attorney, the evidence from his trial--Miss Hamilton's shirt and underpants--was tested for DNA. By June 1993, two DNA fingerprinting tests--one conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and one conducted by Forensic Science Associates concluded that Mr. Bloodsworth's DNA was not the same as DNA found on Miss Hamilton's underpants.  On June 28, 1993, Mr. Bloodsworth was released from prison; in December, 1993, Maryland Governor William Schaefer pardoned him; and in June, 1994, the State of Maryland awarded him $300,000 in compensation.  The wheels of justice broke down in this case, but we cannot pretend that what happened to Kirk Bloodsworth was an exceptional occurrence. Mr. Bloodsworth's nightmare of wrongful conviction has been repeated again and again across the country. To date, 111 individuals convicted and sentenced to death have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.  Today Mr. Bloodsworth is outspoken about the importance of making post-conviction DNA testing available to defendants with a credible claim of innocence, something I have fought hard to accomplish as part of the Innocence Protection Act. People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of the death penalty. But we can all agree that a system that sentences innocent persons to death has no place in a civilized society, much less in 21st century America.  While DNA testing freed Mr. Bloodsworth from prison in 1993, the test results did not convince everyone that Kirk Bloodsworth was not guilty. Prosecutors refused to lift the veil of suspicion over him, in effect saying that the DNA tests might be sufficient to undermine his conviction, but not to prove his innocence. Mr. Bloodsworth told the Baltimore Sun that he spent years asking the county to run the DNA found on Dawn Hamilton's clothing through the State DNA database. Finally, last week, the State ran the DNA evidence through its database and the black cloud that had followed Mr. Bloodsworth for 10 years was lifted.  On September 5, 2003, Mr. Bloodsworth was told that the State tests implicated Mr. Kimberly Shay Ruffner, a convicted sex offender, as the rapist and murderer of Dawn Hamilton. Mr. Ruffner has now been charged with first-degree murder. The prosecutor who previously refused to acknowledge Mr. Bloodsworth's innocence went to his home to apologize to him.  I know that I am joined by many others when I say that I am delighted that Mr. Bloodsworth can finally feel truly free. His fight to prove his own innocence has been won. I am certain that he will continue with his efforts to fix the broken machinery of capital punishment in America and especially to assist others who experienced wrongful conviction.  I ask unanimous consent that a Baltimore Sun article detailing the recent events in Mr. Bloodsworth's case be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 6, 2003]  DNA That Freed Man Leads to New Suspect; Killing: Kirk Bloodsworth, Convicted and Then Cleared in the Rape-Murder of a Child, Learns a Man               he Knew in Prison is Charged With the Crimes                          (By Stephanie Hanes)       The same DNA evidence that freed Kirk Bloodsworth from      prison 10 years ago has now implicated another man in the      1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton of Rosedale,      quashing any lingering questions about Bloodsworth's      involvement in the crime.       Kimberly Shay Ruffner, a 45-year-old convicted sex offender      who went to prison for an attempted rape and attempted murder      in Fells Point only weeks after Dawn Hamilton was killed, was      charged yesterday with first-degree murder.       The Baltimore County state's attorney's office--which has      never publicly acknowledged Bloodsworth's innocence--     announced the development, and a prosecutor apologized to      Bloodsworth in person.       ``Even though I was cleared, there were so many people who      didn't believe me,'' said Bloodsworth, 42, who was reached at      his home in Cambridge. ``This is the proof everyone needs.''       Ruffner is still in prison for the Fells Point attack, with      a release date of 2020. Baltimore County State's Attorney      Sandra A. O'Connor said prosecutors will seek the death      penalty in Dawn's killing.       ``This was a horrendous rape-murder of a 9-year-old girl,''      O'Connor said. ``Whether or not he is incarcerated, he will      be held accountable.''       While Bloodsworth's supporters said they were delighted      with the outcome, they criticized Baltimore County law      enforcement officials for not testing the DNA earlier.       In June, The Sun wrote that the DNA in Bloodsworth's case      had not been compared to the state's DNA database of      convicted felons. As a convicted sex offender, Ruffner's DNA      would have been in the state's database as early as 1994.       Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said the      comparison was made last month.       ``I can't tell you how pleased I am for Kirk,but what      happened here today should have happened earlier,'' said      Barry C. Scheck, the co-founder of the New York-based      Innocence Project, which tries to free the wrongly      convicted.                            delay in testing       Scheck, who helped exonerate Bloodsworth, said he has been      asking for this sort of testing for years. It was after      Scheck's most recent letter to the Baltimore County State's      Attorney's Office that police and prosecutors started moving      toward testing the DNA against the database, The Sun reported      in June.       Yesterday morning, Assistant State's Attorney S. Ann      Brobst, who prosecuted Bloodsworth and who had been      criticized by his supporters for refusing to admit his      innocence, went to Bloodsworth's home to tell him the news.       ``She apologized up and down,'' Bloodsworth said yesterday.      ``She had to eat a lot of crow to come. You've got to give      her something for it.''       O'Connor said Dawn's father, Thomas Hamilton, was also told      of the new arrest. He was unavailable for comment.                          death row, then life       Bloodsworth was convicted of Dawn's murder in 1985 and sent      to death row. Multiple witnesses had testified that they saw      him near the crime scene.       The next year, the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned his      conviction. But when Bloodsworth was retried, he was again      found guilty and this time sentenced to life in prison.       In 1992, prosecutors agreed to run DNA tests on a semen      stain found on Dawn's underwear--a stain that law enforcement      officials said they had not noticed earlier. Those tests      showed that Bloodsworth was not the person who had sexually      assaulted the little girl.       Prosecutors agreed to release Bloodsworth immediately but      would not apologize or say he was innocent.       ``I believe that he is not guilty,'' O'Connor said at the      time. ``I'm not prepared to say he's innocent. Only the      people who were there know what happened.''                            Lingering doubts       Bloodsworth was pardoned by former Gov. William Donald      Schaefer and given $300,000 from the state. But life after      prison was a struggle, one that he now talks about openly.       At first, he had trouble holding jobs and grappled with      freedom after nine years behind bars. He heard the derogatory      whispers and saw the dirty looks. He once wiped the scrawled      words ``Child Killer'' off his car.       ``He has confided to me many, many times that people echo      what Ann Brobst kept saying: (The DNA) doesn't mean he's      innocent,'' Scheck said.       In recent years, Bloodsworth married and started working as      a consultant for the Justice Project, a Washington advocacy      group for justice reform. He has testified for lawmakers and      spoken in classrooms across the country about the importance      of DNA evidence.       In his own case, he said he has pushed for years for county      law enforcement to run the preserved DNA evidence through the      state's database.       A month after Dawn Hamilton was killed, Kimberly Ruffner      was arrested for the Fells Point attack.       He had broken into a woman's house Aug. 28, 1984, and had      tried to rape her, police said. When she struggled, he tried      to kill her with a pair of scissors. The woman managed to      escape, and police found Ruffner hours later.       He was tried and convicted of breaking and entering,      assault with intent to murder and attempted rape, said Mark      Vernarelli, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public      Safety and Correctional Services. He was sentenced to 45      years in prison.       According to court records, Ruffner had been charged with      two other sex offenses in 1983.       In the Maryland Correctional Institution at Jessup, Ruffner      slept on the tier below Bloodsworth in the same building.       The two men lifted weights together, and Bloodsworth, who      worked in the prison library, would give him books,      Bloodsworth said. They both had red hair. But Bloodsworth      said they were nothing more than acquaintances.       Not once, Bloodsworth said, did Ruffner indicate that he      was responsible for Dawn's murder.       ``It's spooky,'' Bloodsworth said. ``The whole time he was      there. I just can't get over it.''                             case timeline       July 1984--The body of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton is found in      a wooded area near the Fontana Village apartments in      Rosedale, Baltimore County.       August 1984--Police arrest and charge Kirk Noble      Bloodsworth, a former waterman from Cambridge, in Dawn      Hamilton's death.       Also, Kimberly Shay Ruffner is arrested on charges of      breaking and entering, assault with intent to murder and      attempted rape after attacking a Fells Point woman with a      pair of scissors.       March 1985--A jury convicts Bloodsworth of Dawn Hamilton's      murder. Baltimore County Judge J. William Hinkel sentences      Bloodsworth to death.       July 185--Ruffner is convicted on charges in the Fells      Point attack and is sentenced to 45 years in prison.       July 1986--The Maryland Court of Appeals overturns      Bloodsworth's conviction, saying prosecutors withheld      evidence about another suspect.       April 1987--A second jury convicts Bloodsworth of murder.      He is sentenced to two consecutive life terms--one for sexual      assault and the other for murder.       April 1992--At the request of Bloodsworth's attorney,      Baltimore County prosecutors agree to release evidence from      Bloodsworth's trial--panties, a shirt and a stick--for DNA      testing.       May 1993--A California DNA lab reports that a semen stain      on the victim's panties cannot have come from Bloodsworth.       June 25, 1993--The FBI, conducting its own test, agrees the      semen found on the panties could not have come from      Bloodsworth.       June 28, 1993--Bloodsworth walks out of the House of      Correction in Jessup, a free man.       December 1993--Gov. William Donald Schaefer pardons      Bloodsworth.       June 22, 1994--Bloodsworth is awarded $300,000 by the state      of Maryland for nine years of wrongful imprisonment.       Sept. 5, 2003--Baltimore County Assistant State's Attorney      S. Ann Brobst, who prosecuted Bloodsworth, visits him at his      Cambridge home and tells him further DNA tests matched the      semen found in Dawn Hamilton's panties to Ruffner, a Maryland      prison inmate.       She also apologizes.                          ____________________
