Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on April 12, 1981, two American heroes, Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen, were strapped into their seats in the Space Shuttle Columbia and took off into history, orbiting the Earth for 54 hours, 20 minutes, and 53 seconds. This was the boldest test flight in history.  The space shuttle was the first reusable spacecraft to be flown into orbit without the benefit of previous unmanned orbital test flights, and was the first spacecraft to land on a conventional runway at Edwards Air Force Base in my home State of California.  Like the explorers Lewis and Clark who explored our great Nation and who opened up the West, John Young and Robert Crippen opened a new era of human exploration beyond our planet Earth. Now, as we move forward with the vision for space exploration, the successful return to flight of the space shuttle represents the first step toward going to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  Today as a Nation, we want to pay tribute to the National Space and Aeronautics Administration on the 25th anniversary of the first flight of the space shuttle. We want to honor Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen, who flew the first Space Shuttle Columbia, on April 12-14, 1981, on its first orbital test flight. We want to commend the men and women of NASA and our aerospace industry for the roles they play in inspiring the American people. This is what provides the inspiration to our next generation to study math and science. This is what keeps our Nation competitive.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
