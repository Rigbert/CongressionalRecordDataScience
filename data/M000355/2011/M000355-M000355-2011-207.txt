 President, I want to pay tribute to a young woman from Owensboro, KY, who lost her life while in service to her country. U.S. Navy LCDR Jane Lanham Tafoya was assigned to the Naval Branch Health Clinic in Manama, Bahrain, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She died from non-combat related causes on September 19, 2006. She was 43 years old.  For her heroic service, Lieutenant Commander Tafoya received many awards, medals and decorations, including the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Gold Star, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, and the Navy Pistol Shot Medal with Sharpshooter Device.  Lieutenant Commander Tafoya had served for 18 years in the Navy. Before her assignment in Bahrain she had served at the Naval Hospital and Naval Reserve Center in Philadelphia, the Bureau of Medicine here in Washington, DC, the Naval Hospital at Camp Lejeune, NC, aboard the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan, and at Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit 2 in Norfolk, VA. In Bahrain she was working as an industrial hygienist.  Born in Daviess County, KY, Jane was a graduate of Owensboro Catholic High School, Murray State University and Temple University. Her mother, Avis Lanham, remembers Jane as a smart student who enjoyed learning, got all As in school, and loved to read. In high school Jane played softball and volleyball, and she was on the Murray State intramural bowling team.  Avis says that Jane loved to travel, and she loved being in the Navy. And Jane ``could always see the good in people,'' Avis says of her daughter. Whenever something negative was said about a person, Jane would just respond with, ``Well, nobody's perfect.''  We are thinking of Jane's loved ones today, including her husband John Tafoya; her daughters Rachel and Natalie Tafoya; her mother Avis Lanham; her brother and sister-in-law Brad and Kathy; her sister and brother-in-lawPhyllis and Kenny; and many other beloved family members and friends. Jane was preceded in death by her father Marvin Bill Lanham.  Today the Senate honors this loving wife, mother, and daughter for her long career of service. And we salute the sacrifice that LCDR Jane Lanham Tafoya made, half a world away from her native Owensboro home, on behalf of a very grateful Nation.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
