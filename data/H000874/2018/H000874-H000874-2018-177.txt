'  How can any self-respecting Member of this House, how can any self-respecting Republican who made that representation to my Tea Party friends, vote for this rule?  I have no idea.

It hasn't been addressed, much less solved.  But the real problem is that nobody knows what is in this legislation. With all due respect to the chairman of the Rules Committee, he hasn't read this bill.
