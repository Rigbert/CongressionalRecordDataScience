President, since the American people first elected President Obama, Senate Republicans have been engaged in a concerted effort to filibuster, obstruct and delay his moderate judicial nominees. They have already, during the last 4 years, filibustered more of President Obama's moderate judicial nominees than were filibustered during President Bush's entire 8 years--67 percent more, in fact--and there is no dispute that President Bush was engaged in an effort to pack the courts with ideological extremists.  In connection with the wrongheaded filibuster of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, an outstanding nominee to the DC Circuit, I urged them to abandon their misguided efforts that sacrifice outstanding judges for purposes of partisan payback. Regrettably, their response seems to be to expand their efforts through a ``wholesale filibuster'' of nominations to the DC Circuit and a legislative proposal to strip three judgeships from the DC Circuit.  I am tempted to suggest that they amend their bill to make it effective whenever the next Republican President is elected. I say that to point out that they had no concerns with supporting President Bush's four Senate-confirmed nominees to the DC Circuit. Those nominees filled the very vacancies for the 9th, 10th and even the 11th judgeship on the court that Senate Republicans are demanding be eliminated now that President Obama has been reelected by the American people. The target of this legislation seems apparent when its sponsors emphasize that it is designed to take effect immediately and acknowledge that ``[h]istorically, legislation introduced in the Senate altering the number of judgeships has most often postponed enactment until the beginning of the next President's term'' but that their legislation ``does not do this.'' It is just another foray in their concerted efforts to block this President from appointing judges to the DC Circuit.  In its April 5, 2013 letter, the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent us recommendations ``based on our current caseload needs.'' They do not recommend stripping judgeships from the DC Circuit but state that they should continue at 11. Four are currently vacant. According to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge for the DC Circuit has actually increased by 50 percent since 2005, when the Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. When the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith, President Bush's nominee to the 11th seat in 2005, the confirmation resulted in there being approximately 119 pending cases per active DC Circuit judge. There are currently 188 pending cases for each active judge on the DC Circuit, more than 50 percent higher.  Senate Republicans also seek to misuse caseload numbers. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is often considered ``the second most important court in the land'' because of its special jurisdiction and because of the important and complex cases that it decides. The court reviews complicated decisionsand rulemaking of many Federal agencies, and in recent years has handled some of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of September 11. These cases make incredible demands on the time of the judges serving on this court. It is misleading to cite statistics and to accuse hardworking judges of having a light or easy workload. All cases are not the same and many of the hardest, most complex and most time-consuming cases in the Nation end up at the DC Circuit.  As the former Chief Judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals explained again recently, ``The nature of the DC Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts.'' She correctly noted in her recent column:       The DC Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming,      labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest      impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water      regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues,      insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands      of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days      of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners,      and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of      record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically      intricate legal opinions.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that article again be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Today, the Senate will vote on only one of the 15 judicial nominees ready for final action. While I am glad that we are being allowed to fill one of the 86 judicial vacancies around the country, I wish we were allowed to make more progress more quickly. After all, there are 14 judicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee without objection who are currently pending before the Senate. All members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats agreed that they were qualified and should be confirmed. Some were held over from last year. Indeed, there are still five judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar who could and should have been confirmed last year.  There are currently three times as many judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar as there were at this point in President Bush's second term. Of course by then the Senate had proceeded to confirm almost two dozen more judges than we have been allowed to proceed to consider. Before Senate Republicans pat themselves on the back too hard, they should help us clear the nominees backlogged from last year and acknowledge that there was just one judicial nominee confirmed this year whose hearing was held this year. The others were all nominees they needlessly held over for months and who should have been confirmed last year.  It is really incomprehensible that so many judgeships were forced to remain vacant for so long when there was no actual opposition to these consensus nominees. That is not what Democratic Senators did during the Bush administration. This is a new and destructive tactic. Despite the progress we have been allowed to make this year, we remain more than 20 circuit and district nominees behind the pace set during President Bush's administration. Just 183 of President Obama's circuit and district nominees have been confirmed, compared to 206 of President Bush's at the same point, and vacancies today are nearly double what they were in April 2005. We can make up much of that ground if Senate Republicans would just agree to a vote on all 15 nominees currently pending on the Executive Calendar. All of them received bipartisan support in committee, and all but one were unanimous. There is no good reason for further delay.  At this point in President Bush's presidency, when his district nominees were reported by the Judiciary Committee, it took, on average, just 35 days for them to receive a vote. The comparable average for President Obama's district court nominees is nearly three times as long, 102 days. This number is has a firm foundation-- arithmetic. It is derived simply by adding up the number of days each nominee waited and dividing by the number of nominees. That is how an average is calculated.  During President Bush's first term alone, 57 district nominees were confirmed within just 1 week of being reported. By contrast, during his first 4 years only two of President Obama's district nominees have been confirmed within a week of being reported by the Committee. Just before the Thanksgiving recess in 2009, when Senator Sessions of Alabama was the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, we were able to get Republican agreement to confirm Judge Abdul Kallon, a nominee from Alabama, and Judge Christina Reiss, our Chief Judge for the Federal District Court for the District of Vermont. They had their hearing on November 4, were voted on by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later on November 19, and were confirmed by the Senate on November 21. They were not stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar without a vote for weeks and months. They were confirmed 2 days after the vote by the Judiciary Committee. That should be the standard we follow, not be the exception. It should not take being from the ranking Republican's home State to be promptly confirmed as a noncontroversial judicial nominee.  Digging deeper into the numbers, the Congressional Research Service has found that during President Bush's first term, 85 percent of his district nominees waited 60 days or fewer for a vote. In President Obama's first term, 78 percent of his district nominees waited 60 days or longer. What these data show is that President Obama's district nominees have been facing unprecedented delays. There is an undeniable pattern of Republican obstruction and delay that has faced district nominees during the last four years, a pattern that is without precedent.  While these delays and backlogs are without precedent, Republicans point to April 2004 as the one time that there were a number of President Bush's nominees pending on the floor. Of course back in April 2004, President Bush had bypassed the Senate and recess appointed two individuals to be circuit judges, while Republican Committee staff hacked into a shared server to pilfer Democratic files. Still, we were able to clear the backlog that resulted by confirming more than 20 consensus nominees in just 1 month. There is nothing like that to explain the years of backlogged judicial nominees during this administration. In truth, 17 of the judicial nominations for which Senate Republicans take credit over the past 2 years should have been confirmed more than 2 years ago in the preceding Congress. They allowed only 60 judicial confirmations to take place during President Obama's first 2 years in office, the lowest total for a President in over 30 years. This is not a new phenomenon. During President Obama's first year in office, Senate Republicans stalled all but 12 of his circuit and district nominees. That was the lowest 1-year confirmation total since the Eisenhower administration, when the Federal bench was barely one-third the size it is today.  The fact is that we have these 15 nominees waiting for a vote. All Senate Democrats are prepared to vote on all of them today.  Before Republicans take refuge in the number of vacancies without a nominee, they should be honest about their slow-walking the President on recommendations for nominees from their home States. For example, there are 24 emergency vacancies in States represented by Republican Senators. Over 40 percent of all judicial emergency vacancies are in just 3 States, each of which is represented by 2 Republican Senators. Those Senators should be working with the White House to fill those vacancies. I encourage Republican Senators to work with this President, just as I encouraged Democratic Senators to work with President Bush, to find good nominees for those important vacancies and to allow qualified nominees to move forward. I take very seriously our responsibilities of both advice and consent on nominations.  Today, the Senate is being allowed to confirm Judge Beverly O'Connell to a judicial emergency vacancy on the Federal trial court for the Central District of California, one of the busiest courts in the Nation. She currently serves on the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles in California, where she has served for the last 8 years. She is also currently an Adjunct Professor of Law at Loyola Law School and at Pepperdine University School of Law. Prior to becoming a judge, she served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California for 10years and worked in private practice as an associate at Morrison & Foerster LLP. She received the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary's highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' and has the support of her home State Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. She originally had her hearing last December, was unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee, will be overwhelming approved by the Senate, and should and could have been confirmed last year.  Finally, last month, I spoke about the damaging effect of sequestration on our Federal courts and our system of justice and how these indiscriminate cuts have caused both Federal prosecutors and Federal public defenders to be furloughed. The effects have become all too real as even terrorism prosecutions are being delayed. Chief Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York called these cuts ``devastating.'' The head of the Federal Defenders Office stated: ``On a good day, we're stretched thin. . . . Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.'' He is right. Sequestration is causing grave harm to our judicial system. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article dated April 8 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 2013]               Senate Must Act on Appeals Court Vacancies                         (By Patricia M. Wald)       Patricia M. Wald, who is retired, served as a judge on the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1979 to 1999,      including five years as chief judge.       Pending before the Senate are nominations to fill two of      the four vacant judgeships on the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the District of Columbia Circuit. This court has exclusive      jurisdiction over many vital national security challenges and      hears the bulk of appeals from the major regulatory agencies      of the federal government. Aside from the U.S. Supreme Court,      it resolves more constitutional questions involving      separation of powers and executive prerogatives than any      court in the country.       The D.C. Circuit has 11 judgeships but only seven active      judges. There is cause for extreme concern that Congress is      systematically denying the court the human resources it needs      to carry out its weighty mandates.       The court's vacancies date to 2005, and it has not received      a new appointment since 2006. The number of pending cases per      judge has grown from 119 in 2005 to 188 today. A great many      of these are not easy cases. The D.C. Circuit hears the most      complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over      regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans'      lives: clean air and water regulations, nuclear plant safety,      healthcare reform issues, insider trading and more. These      cases can require thousands of hours of preparation by the      judges, often consuming days of argument, involving hundreds      of parties and interveners, and necessitating dozens of      briefs and thousands of pages of record--all of which      culminates in lengthy, technically intricate legal opinions.       I served on the D.C. Circuit for more than 20 years and as      its chief judge for almost five. My colleagues and I worked      as steadily and intensively as judges on other circuits even      if they may have heard more cases. The nature of the D.C.      Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts.      The U.S. Judicial Conference reviews this caseload      periodically and makes recommendations to Congress about the      court's structure. In 2009, the conference recommended, based      on its review, that the circuit's 12th judgeship be      eliminated. This apolitical process is the proper way to      determine the circuit's needs, rather than in the more highly      charged context of individual confirmations.       During my two-decade tenure, 11 active judges were sitting      a majority of the time; today, the court has only 64 percent      of its authorized active judges. This precipitous decline      manifests in the way the court operates. And while the D.C.      Circuit has five senior judges, they may opt out of the most      complex regulatory cases and do not sit en banc. They also      choose the periods during which they will sit, which can      affect the randomization of assignment of judges to cases.       There is, moreover, a subtle constitutional dynamic at work      here: The president nominates and the Senate confirms federal      judges for life. While some presidents may not encounter any      vacancies during their administration, over time the      constitutional schemata ensures that the makeup of courts      reflects the choices of changing presidents and the ``advise      and consent'' of changing Senates. Since the circuit courts'      structure was established in 1948, President Obama is the      first president not to have a single judge confirmed to the      D.C. Circuit during his first full term. The constitutional      system of nomination and confirmation can work only if there      is good faith on the part of both the president and the      Senate to move qualified nominees along, rather than      withholding consent for political reasons. I recall my own      difficult confirmation 35 years ago as the first female judge      on the circuit; eminent senators such as Barry Goldwater,      Thad Cochran and Alan Simpson voted to confirm me regardless      of differences in party or general political philosophy.       The two D.C. Circuit nominees before the Senate are      exceedingly well qualified. Caitlin Halligan served as my law      clerk during the 1995-96 term, working on cases involving the      Department of Health and Human Services, the Immigration and      Naturalization Service, the Federal Communications Commission      and diverse other topics. She later clerked for Supreme Court      Justice Stephen Breyer. She also served as New York solicitor      general and general counsel for the Manhattan district      attorney's office, as well as being a partner in a major law      firm. The other nominee, Sri Srinivasan, has similarly      impressive credentials and a reputation that surely merits      prompt and serious consideration of his nomination.       There is a tradition in the D.C. Circuit of spirited      differences among judges on the most important legal issues      of our time. My experience, however, was that deliberations      generally focused on the legal and real-world consequences of      decisions and reflected a premium on rational thinking and      intellectual prowess, not personal philosophy or policy      preferences. It is in that vein that I urge the Senate to      confirm the two pending nominations to the D.C. Circuit, so      that this eminent court can live up to its full potential in      our country's judicial work.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2013]           Citing Cuts, Lawyers Seek Relief in Terrorism Case                          (By Benjamin Weiser)       Federal public defenders who are representing a son-in-law      of Osama bin Laden on terrorism charges urged a judge on      Monday not to hold an early trial because automatic      government budget cuts were requiring furloughs of lawyers in      their office.       The request, which seemed to take the judge, Lewis A.      Kaplan, by surprise, follows requests that five or six      federal judges in Manhattan have received from public      defenders to be relieved from cases in the wake of the      automatic cuts, known as sequestration, said Loretta A.      Preska, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in      Manhattan.       ``It's devastating,'' Judge Preska said late Monday. She      praised the work of the federal defenders and said their      replacement in cases with publicly paid court-appointed      lawyers would probably lead to delays and higher costs.       Judge Kaplan said in court on Monday that he was      considering holding the trial of bin Laden's son-in-law,      Sulaiman Abu Ghaith--a onetime Al Qaeda spokesman charged      with conspiring to kill Americans--in September. After the      defense requested a later date, he said: ``It's extremely      troublesome to contemplate the possibility of a case of this      nature being delayed because of sequestration. Let me say      only that--stunning.''       The judge did not set a trial date, saying he would      consider the request, but the exchange shows how the forced      budget cuts are beginning to have an effect on the      administration of justice in federal courts in New York.       About 30 trial lawyers with the federal defenders office      handle around 2,000 criminal cases a year in federal courts      in Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations, according to      David E. Patton, who heads the office.       The forced cuts, he said, will mean each lawyer in the      office will be furloughed for five and a half weeks through      the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.       ``On a good day, we're stretched thin,'' Mr. Patton said.      ``Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You      simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.''       ``Investigations have to be conducted,'' Mr. Patton added.      ``Evidence must be reviewed. Law must be researched. Those      things don't just happen by themselves.''       In seeking the delay, lawyers for Mr. Abu Ghaith, who was      arraigned in March, cited the need for overseas      investigation, the translation of voluminous materials and      other issues. ``We would urge the court to find a later      date,'' one lawyer, Martin Cohen, said.       Judge Preska said that lawyers had been allowed to leave      one of the cases in which the furlough problem had been      cited; the issue is pending in the others.       Newly appointed lawyers would have to ``get up to speed''      on their cases, and because they are paid by the hour      (federal defenders are salaried), the public would probably      end up paying more, Judge Preska said. ``There's no      resolution,'' she said. ``Time is of the essence, and we're      very, very concerned.''
