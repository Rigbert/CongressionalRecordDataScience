Speaker, I anticipated this was going to be an extraordinarily hostile colloquy.  Louisiana was so incredibly lucky. However, it cost me, I admit to the world, I guess. I hope I don't get in legal trouble. But the Republican whip and I had a little sort of side bet, so I owe the Republican whip a crab dinner for four people. That is the bad news.  The good news is the minority whip will now be eating the best crab in America, not Louisiana crab. It will be Maryland crab that I will be giving him for dinner.  Mr. Speaker, if my friend would like to ask some questions about the schedule--or he did ask me, I am told. But I knew that game was coming.
