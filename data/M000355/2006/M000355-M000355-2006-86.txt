 President, tomorrow we will conduct a short period of morning business before turning to the United States-India nuclear bill. We were able to reach an agreement to limit amendments to the bill earlier today, and it is my hope that we will be able to expedite consideration and vote final passage tomorrow. We are also attempting to begin work on the Agriculture appropriations bill.  We were able to pass the short-term continuing resolution today. I thank everyone for clearing that joint resolution for the President's desk.                          ____________________[Page S10976]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
