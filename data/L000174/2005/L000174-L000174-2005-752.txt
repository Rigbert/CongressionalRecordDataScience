President, Vermont is a State filled with extraordinary people who lead extraordinary lives. We take great pride that despite our modest geographical size, Vermont produces people whose voices, commitment and accomplishments transcend our borders and leave a lasting impact on the world in which we live.  Later this spring, one such Vermonter will be moving on to a new chapter in his life. Professor Alan Wertheimer, the John G. McCullough Professor of Political Science at the University of Vermont, will be retiring after over 35 years of teaching.  Professor Wertheimer is a distinguished scholar, having authored a number of highly acclaimed books. He has taught thousands of students over the years, including many members of my staff. He has been active in the affairs of the university and the community. His wife Susan and their children have been by his side every step of the way.  The role of scholars in shaping our society has been debated for thousands of years. Professor Wertheimer leaves in his wake a whole generation of students who he helped grapple with some of the most difficult and complex political and philosophical questions of our time, in a relevant, provocative and memorable style.  We in Vermont owe an enormous debt to Professor Wertheimer. He chose to grace our State university with his presence for his entire academic career. Thousands of Vermonters and students from all over the country and the world have had their lives enhanced by his dedication and scholarship.  I ask unanimous consent that a recent article in the Vermont Quarterly about Professor Wertheimer be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 What Does Professor Wertheimer Think?                            (By Kevin Foley)       Bright as they are, try as they will UVM's first class of      Honors College students can't always figure that one out, but      they just might learn to define and defend their own thoughts      in the process. Inside the Honors Ethics Seminar, where a      college's debut is sparked by a venerable professor's swan      song.       Alan Wertheimer's method is the question, and right now, as      a high-wattage October sun pours in and illuminates the      buttery walls of his Allen House honors college seminar room,      the question is this: ``Is Alan Wertheimer tall?''       Well, no, not in modern-day America. But in the 18th      century? Among the diminutive Bayaka, a Central African pygmy      tribe? Among political theorists, where Wertheimer cuts a      large figure because of decades of work illuminating crucial      concepts in ethics and law like coercion? Who is to say?      Perhaps Wertheimer, who goes about five-seven in his teaching      clogs, really is tall.       But there's no time for that now. The professor has moved      on to another proposition, another question.       Wertheimer, who is the John G. McCullough Professor of      Political Science to his colleagues and ``Big Al'' to his      honors students (offering another data point on the      contingency of height), is ending his 37-year career at the      University with a beginning: Along with philosopher Don Loeb,      Wertheimer, who is retiring at the end of this academic year,      developed a two-semester course in ethics that all 90      students enrolled in the new Honors College are taking. (See      ``Your Honor,'' below.) The idea is to provide these talented      first-year students, a diverse group of future environmental      engineers, doctors, English teachers, and software      developers, a shared intellectual experience that cuts across      every academic discipline and profession.       But the universal applicability of ethics--we all, after      all, have strong notions of right and wrong, fair and unfair,      whether to hand back the overpriced grocery store's      miscounted change or keep it--is also a potential trap, at      least if you've got a group of 15 very young, very bright,      and very vocal students. Loeb puts it this way: ``When you      teach particle physics, nobody tries to come in with equally      valid opinions on whether mesons have mass.'' Ethics is      different: whether or not protestors should mass inspires      more passionate opinions than the properties of sub-atomic      matter.       But in the Honors College, emoting is not thinking. Opinion      is not analysis. Instructors need to spark a lively      discussion (generally an easy task with this crowd, even when      the subject is Plato's Crito), but also to manage it, keeping      the conversation aligned with the readings, and helping      members of the class interrogate their classmates' ideas, and      their own. Voicing your thoughts is great; defending them      well is something else entirely. Something better. And      putting logic into opinions is where Wertheimer's teaching      excels.       The professor proffers another statement to the class, ``It      is not wrong to download music even if it violates the law.''      The students are supposed to reply true, false, or don't      know, but once again, a statement quickly morphs into an      interrogatory and the discussion surges. Passions rise--was      that a telltale flash of porcelain iPod earbuds in the      messenger bag across the table?--as the first-years come to a      somewhat sheepish consensus: when it comes to illegally      downloading music, fine, true, cool. Wertheimer winces. It is      early in the semester, after all. (Or was that a smile?) The      seminar soon rumbles on to categorizing a statement about the      existence of God. The group opinion here, just barely, is      ``don't know.''       Questions, questions, questions. But few answers from      Wertheimer: none today, in fact. At a different time, in the      more relaxed confines of his corner office on the top floor      of Old Mill, the professor sits under a Chicago Art Institute      poster depicting a bright horseracing scene, and explains      why.       ``The job is not to answer the question,'' he says. ``It's      to get them to think about it more rigorously.''                            AN ORDERLY MIND       The method is the question: Reading Consent to Sexual      Intercourse, Wertheimer's most recent book and a tome far      less racy than its title might imply, illustrates the power      of carefully chosen, interlocking queries. With a      characteristic intellectual flip, Wertheimer's discussion is      not so much about the obvious ``when does no mean no?''--     that's morally clear, he thinks, or should be--but when does      yes really mean yes.       Think about that: when does yes really mean yes? It can      make your skull vibrate, even before the professor launches      into nearly 300 pages of tricky cases and complicated      theories. Can a retarded person truly consent to sex? A      coerced one? Someone deceived, egregiously or subtly? Someone      drunk? And those scenarios are only the beginning.       Wertheimer doesn't present a grand theory, an overarching      vision, a huge program for social change. That's not his      style. Instead, he offers a lot of thorough discussion of      complicated cases, and some focused theories for hashing      through them. This is not to say that the book lacks moral      vision, however. Wertheimer's philosophical peregrinations      leave him convinced that sexual deception, a matter largely      ignored by the law, needs to be taken more seriously. Why      should the law say so much about commercial deceits, when      dollars are at stake, and so little about sexual lies, which      cost so much emotionally?       Lawyers like to say that ``hard cases make bad law,'' and      they well may, but Wertheimer's gifts for sustained, precise      and dispassionate analysis at least makes them into      compelling theories. The books that Wertheimer built his      intellectual reputation with, Coercion and Exploitation, take      similarly knotty philosophical areas and methodically think      through them in ways that are useful to political theorists,      philosophers, and lawyers. More than useful: One reviewer      said of Exploitation that ``no one interested in the topic      will be able to ignore this classic work.'' Wertheimer's      scholarly appeal, says his colleague Robert Pepperman Taylor,      a fellow political science professor and dean of the Honors      College, comes down to the clarity and rigor of his approach.       ``These are issues which people tend to wax rhetorical      about, but Al brings his extremely clear analytical mind to      bear on problems that can raise a lot of heat, a lot of      passion, a lot of rhetoric,'' Taylor says. ``He insists that      we speak clearly about these things and understand them      clearly.''       Wertheimer's career, unlike his writing and thinking,      hasn't always taken the clearest and most logical path from      point A to B. The professor, in fact, attributes many of his      professional breakthroughs to good fortune; a fellowship at      Princeton led to his first book, a semester spent teaching      law at the University of San Diego contributed to his latest      book. Now, after stepping down from his full-time duties at      UVM, Wertheimer will spend a year at the National Institutes      of Health, working on issues of coercion and consent in      medical research.       ``Things happen,'' he says. ``Truth be told, that's the      story of a lot of my career--anybody's career--things happen.      Each opportunity led to new opportunities. I suppose it's      true that the rich get richer; and, while I'm not exactly      rich, I have gotten intellectually richer.''                           SHARING THE WEALTH       In casual conversation, Wertheimer is genial and amusing,      fairly soft-spoken, prone to answer questions after one of      the stretches of contemplation that make him a formidable      bridge player. In the classroom, he's loud and kinetic (``I      think he shocks the kids a little,'' a colleague says,      ``because he is passionate--very passionate--about things      that maybe they never know anyone cared about'') as he      explores and tests his students' logic.       ``To make a class of the kind I teach go well, you need at      least four or five articulate, bright students,'' Wertheimer      explains. ``One or two isn't enough: You need a critical      mass. If you have that, you get the others going.''       In the honors seminar, Wertheimer has his requisite fluent      five and then some, and while the discussions are lively, the      conversation isn't always totally satisfying for     the students. As the class spent a fall semester wrestling      with abortion, inheritance, Plato, and the war in Iraq, their      frequent tendency was to try to gauge what Big Al, the      compact seer in the front of the room, thought. But after      nearly 40 years of undergraduate teaching, Wertheimer is wily      about concealing his personal views behind a Socratic screen      when it suits his pedagogical purposes.       First-year honors student Kevin Ohashi, an electric-haired      computer jock who spent his last two years of high school in      Kathmandu, says that sphinx-like quality drove some of his      classmates nuts. ``Professor Wertheimer loves to play the      devil's advocate,'' Ohashi says. ``In class he would take the      side that most people weren't on and propose a hypothetical      situation that started tilting things his way, and then he      might switch again. I thought it was great.''       Ohashi says that the result of all those hours of      discussion, at least for him, wasn't a messenger bag full of      new ideas or a changed sense of moral purpose. Instead, in      conversations with friends from the honors floor and      elsewhere, he has over time found himself defending his old      ideas with more confidence and care. Ohashi's experience      echoes a theme common in letters from Wertheimer's former      students: They often say things like ``I never knew what      it meant to think through a problem before.''                        INTELLECTUAL ATMOSPHERE       The professor got involved with creating the inaugural      honors seminar (hardly a relaxed way to spend one's last year      before retirement) because his experiences on the UVM faculty      and as a UVM parent left him convinced that the campus needed      a more intellectual culture.       If we're successful, we'll have created an intellectual      environment,'' he says. ``We toyed with the idea of having      some variation in content between sections of the first-year      seminars, but we dropped that, precisely so that people can      engage in a common experience.''       Honors students live together, study together, and play      together. But the honors experience operates in quieter, more      personal ways as well. Rahul Mudannayake, a first-year pre-     med honors student from Sri Lanka, says that some of the      class readings and discussions have haunted him, especially a      particular essay by the famous Princeton philosopher Peter      Singer. In the essay, ``Rich and Poor,'' Singer outlines the      vast discrepancies between wealth and poverty in the world,      and insists that the wealthy have an obligation to assist.      (Singer also visited campus to speak and meet with students      in the class.) After the end of the fall semester,      Mudannayake went home to Sri Lanka, just before the tsunami      struck and devastated the country's coastal areas. The      student did what he could, helping to ferry food and medicine      to affected regions in the days after the tragedy, but the      calamity made the ethical arguments he heard in the seminar,      especially Singer's, immediate.       ``The class has stayed with me in my life,'' Mudannayake      says. ``Spending a $1.50 here on a bottle of soda is      difficult, considering what I read, what I saw in Sri Lanka.      The way I spend my money now is totally different, and      Wertheimer and Singer are part of that.''       And here is where Al Wertheimer's questions finally end      with an answer: A student thinking through the issues and      making a personal choice, arrived at with rigor.                               SIDEBAR 1     Your Honor       Students at the University's newest college live and learn      together and, proponents of the program say, their debates,      excitement and activities will enrich the entire academic      atmosphere of campus.       It works like this: The campus-wide Honors College accepts      about 100 of the most gifted first-year students enrolling at      the University, regardless of major, and throws them together      for a intense program of social events, a two-semester in-     depth seminar class (for now, the ethics course developed by      Wertheimer and Loeb), special lectures from big-name      intellectuals and, in most cases, living on an all-honors      floor at Harris/Millis.       By 2007, as successive classes enroll, the program will      grow to encompass about 700 students (sophomores can apply      for admission; college organizers wanted to give students who      don't catch fire academically until they reach UVM a chance      to participate in the program, which includes perks like      priority class scheduling), supporting and extending existing      college-level honors programs. Down the line, honors students      will live in the new $60 million University Heights Student      Residential Learning Complex, creating a Harvard or Oxford-     style ``residential college.''                               SIDEBAR 2     A Teacher's Tribute       On April 15, a daylong symposium in Old Mill will celebrate      Alan Wertheimer's intellectual life in a manner befitting the      man. Instead of gold watches and encomiums, judges,      politicians and scholars will gather for a program on ethics      in public life. The event will feature former Vermont Gov.      Madeleine Kunin; Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice John      Dooley; and Harvard University's Arthur Applebaum, Dennis      Thompson, and Nancy Rosenbaum. The discussion will range from      Iraq to judicial activism and gay relationships to      presidential campaign ethics. All events are free and open to      the public; and, of course, Professor Wertheimer will be      there doing what he does, asking questions, listening      closely, weighing arguments, thoughtfully negotiating the      tricky philosophical waters of politics and life.                          ____________________
