Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of the Inland Empire are exceptional. My district has been fortunate to have dynamic and devoted community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Dan Walters is one of these individuals. Today I would like to recognize Dan Walters, who will be retiring from the position of District Director of The National Exchange Club after fifteen years of continuous volunteer service to the California and Nevada districts.  The National Exchange Club holds three core values dear to their mission of service: a commitment to family, a commitment to the community, and a commitment to country. Dan has embodied these three attributes during his fifteen years of service to his organization, and as a dynamic and effective leader, he has encouraged many others to do so as well.  Some of Dan's primary work with the National Exchange Club has involved working to prevent child abuse through education and fundraising activities nationwide. Among other important roles, The National Exchange Club recognizes those who uphold the ideals and institutions of their community; including law enforcement and fire department officers, school teachers, and students of the month, to name a few. Dan and his organization have also championed the installation of FreedomShrines in our junior and senior high schools nationwide. These Shrines serve to inspire our nation's youth and are just another example of Dan's, and The National Exchange Club's, commitment to strengthening America's civic society and promoting American patriotism.  Dan's tireless efforts have not gone by unnoticed. In 2010, Dan was awarded the high honor of the National Exchange Club's Lifetime Achievement Award. Throughout his tenure with the National Exchange Club, Dan also received additional awards and letters of commendation from the National Exchange Club's Directors and District Executive Directors for his dedication to making our communities better places to live.  Dan's passion and dedication to the Exchange Club's efforts have been, and will continue to be, an inspiration throughout the community. He has been the heart and soul of many projects within our region and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that many in our region are grateful for his service and I congratulate him on his retirement.                          ____________________
