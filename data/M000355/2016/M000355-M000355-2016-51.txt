 President, ``God gave us two ears so we would listen more than talk.''  It is a simple phrase that many of us have likely heard before, but to Senator Kelly Ayotte, it is the best piece of advice she says she ever received, and it is a proverb she has lived by during her time in the Senate. In fact, it is how she got her start here in the first place.  As New Hampshire's first female attorney general, Kelly listened to the concerns of those around her. She heard their concerns about the direction our country was going, about the numerous security threats facing our Nation, and about out-of-control spending. She could have just sat on the sidelines as these problems escalated--it certainly would have been the easier choice--but she chose to jump in the game and work to solve them instead. From day one, Senator Ayotte rolled up her sleeves and got to work. As the most prominent New Hampshire newspaper put it, she has never been a ``freshman back-bencher,'' she has been a dynamo from the start.  I can't say I was surprised. I still remember the first time I heard about Kelly. It was from our former colleague Judd Gregg, who told me about this rising star in New Hampshire. Boy, was he right. It didn't take long for everyone to reach a similar conclusion.  Kelly is tough, she is a problem solver, and she is a fighter. Senator Ayotte doesn't view the challenges of this job as obstacles either. She prefers to call them opportunities. She says: ``It's how you react to those bends in the road that will make the biggest difference in your life.'' During her 6 years here, she has clearly made a difference in the lives of a lot of others as well.  Senator Ayotte has helped make a difference as a champion for jobs and as a champion for the economy. As someone who has helped start a small business, she knows firsthand how regulations can stifle growth. She fought to cut through the redtape and the burdensome rules. She cosponsored a law to help small businesses expand and refinance, and she worked to strengthen manufacturing and support job training.  Senator Ayotte has helped make a difference as a leader on combating opioid abuse. As a former prosecutor who has been among the loudest voices drawing attention to this horrible epidemic, she knows how devastating it has been in her State and across the country. She worked with first responders and families to figure out how to address this heartbreaking challenge. She sponsored and helped pass comprehensive legislation that will help us tackle it. Now, in no small part because of her efforts, we will pass critical funding this very week that will help our communities begin to heal.  Like New Hampshire, my home State of Kentucky has been among the hardest hit by this epidemic. It has been a privilege working with my friend to help do something about it.  Senator Ayotte has helped make a difference as an expert on national security issues too. This military spouse didn't need someone to tell her what it means to serve nor what it means for veterans and their families. She mastered the issue almost overnight. She fought for language in the VA reform legislation to expand choice when it comes to veterans' health care. She helped prevent dangerous Guantanamo terrorists from being moved to U.S. soil, and she has long spoken out about the threat posed by Iran. She just voted to extend some critical sanctions against the regime last week, and Senator Ayotte has helped lead efforts to counter its ballistic missile program for years.  It is clear she has been a leader on national security issues right from the start. I was proud to have Senator Ayotte join me and other colleagues on a congressional delegation I led to the Middle East not long after she took office. It was evident then what a difference she would make on these important matters. She has regularly joined in efforts with two other leading voices in our conference on defense, too, Senators McCain and Graham. Together, they are the ``Three Amigos'' or, as our former colleague Joe Lieberman might point out, we should really call them the ``Three Amigos 2.0.''  Either way, here is what is clear. It is an equal partnership, one of mutual respect and trust, one that has strengthened our conference and defense policy, and one that I am sure Senators McCain and Graham would tell you has enriched both their Senate work and their lives. I am sure many other colleagues feel exactly the same way.  Senator Ayotte set out to make an impact. She clearly made one on her State, her country, for her constituents, and her colleagues, but I know Senator Ayotte would tell you the most cherished moments of her life aren't those spent in classified briefings or on congressional delegations, they are the ones spent with her family--with her husband Joe and their two children, 9-year-old Jake and 12-year-old Kate. They have always been her biggest fans. They are a constant source of comfort and support. Sometimes they like to jump in on the action themselves.  In fact, Kate recently made a cameo--alongside her mother--in an ad featuring the two shooting hoops and practicing layups. From what I hear, Kate may even have her sights on a future in politics. She once advised her mom not to run for President.  Senator Ayotte was taken aback. She said she wasn't planning on it but wondered why she would ask in the first place. Well, Kate replied: ``Because I want to be the first woman President.''  I guess it is true what they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. It is not surprising when you consider the example Kelly Ayotte has set, not just for Kate but for so many others as well. If anyone can do it all, it is Kelly Ayotte. From sports practices and Lego competitions to 5Ks and trips to the largest lake in New Hampshire, the time with her kids is what truly brings Kelly joy.  As all of you know, this job can make you appreciate the little things even more. It is why you will never hear her complain about waiting in the pickup line at school. It is why she enjoys spending her weekend grocery shopping at the Market Basket, probably picking up the ingredients for Grape-Nuts pudding--whatever that is. Apparently, it is one of Kelly's favorites. I will just take her word for that.  I wish to acknowledge what a privilege it has been getting to know Senator Ayotte and working with her over the past few years. Her impact has been immeasurable, her friendship indisputable. I know she has made her family proud as well.  I want to conclude with a mantra that Kelly and Joe rely upon when facing a challenge: ``Brush the dirt off and get back in the game.'' It is a good reminder for each of us. I feel confident in saying that Senator Ayotte will be back in the game, looking out for her State and making our country stronger and safer no matter where her next journey leads.                          ____________________
