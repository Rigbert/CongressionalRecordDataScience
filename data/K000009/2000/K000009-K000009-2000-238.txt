Speaker, with great respect, gratitude, but sadness, I enter into the Congressional Record the life story of Mr. James Daken, one of the most accomplished city managers in our nation, who died earlier this year in Peoria, Illinois.  For those of us who knew Jim as City Manager for the City of Toledo, there is no question his professionalism and leadership remain with us even until today. He served our community honorably, beginning in 1967, and then moved to Peoria in 1979 to continue his work building America's midwestern heritage. For certain, it was Toledo's loss and Peoria's gain.  I can remember Jim as the type of manager that would compliment other city employees, even beginning staffers in low level positions. He was a team builder and lifted public administration to a higher level in our community, for which we remain grateful always.  To his wife, children, and family, may I officially extend deepest sympathy coupled with true admiration for a superb public servant who moved America forward in the 20th century.              [From the Blade, Toledo, OH, July 12, 2000]              Ex-Toledoan Set U.S. Record as City Manager       James B. Daken of Peoria, Ill., a former Toledo city      manager who was America's youngest manager of a major city      when he took the job at age 29, died of lung cancer Monday in      his home. He was 58.       In 1971, the International City Management Association      named him one of its 10 outstanding young men.       Mr. Daken, who was born, raised, and educated in      Cincinnati, came to Toledo in July, 1967, when he took the      job of assistant city manager. He was promoted to city      manager in March, 1971, and held the post until October,      1976, when he moved to Hartford, Conn., to become its city      manager.       Former Mayor Harry Kessler credited Mr. Daken with being      ``largely responsible for the success I had as mayor. He and      [the late] Frank Pizza did the most. I was questioned      seriously about hiring a 29-year-old as city manager, but Jim      was a 29-year-old going on 39 years old or 49.''       Under the city charter at the time, city council selected      the city manager from candidates recommended by the mayor.       Mr. Kessler said after he became mayor, he organized a      citizens committee to study municipal government to help city      officials identify problems and possible fixes.       ``More than 90 per cent of the committee's recommendations      were adopted,'' Mr. Kessler said. ``Jim Daken was responsible      for organizing the recommendations of the committee so that      they could be made into ordinances that would pass council's      scrutiny.''       Ohio Supreme Court Justice Andy Douglas said he was a      member of the Toledo council committee that selected Mr.      Daken for the city manager's job.       ``His major contribution was bringing stillness to troubled      waters,'' Justice Douglas said. ``He inherited a number of      cumbersome, difficult, and complicated matters, and he      provided solutions generally acceptable to all.''       Expansion of Toledo's water and sewer services to outside      communities in Lucas and Wood counties was a priority with      Justice Douglas as a councilman, and he credited Mr. Daken      with helping the city to achieve those sales.       ``The only thing the city makes money on is the sale of      water,'' Justice Douglas said. ``I think the city's water-     pumping capacity was increased from about 140 to 160 million      gallons a day, and there are plans to raise that to more than      200 million gallons. He was directly involved in bringing      that about.''       Former Toledo Councilwoman Carol Pietrykowski said she was      chairwoman of the council committee that hired Mr. Daken. She      noted that ``Jim came in and made a presentation, very      professionally, and I was impressed with it. Whatever Jim      did, he did well.''       Later, Mr. Daken as city manager impressed Mrs.      Pietrykowski again with his ability to explain to each      council member complicated legislation that was coming before      council.       ``He was the most communicative and the easiest city      manager to work with while I was on council,'' Mrs.      Pietrykowski said. ``When there was an issue, he would come      to every councilman. He would answer every question we had.      And he was very fair with the city council's office staff.''       Mrs. Pietrykowski added that Mr. Daken ``knew who he worked      for. It was city council in those days.''       J. Michael Porter, a former city manager, said that when he      was Toledo's director of natural       Mr. Porter added that Mr. Daken was a ``professional's      professional. He believed in the city-manager system and did      everything he could to enhance the profession.''       Mr. Daken was city manager in Peoria from 1979 to 1987 and      was vice president of the Foster and Gallagher, Inc., mail      order and telemarketing firm in Peoria from 1987 to 1996. He      was executive director of the Peoria Historical Society from      1997 to 1999, when he took his most recent job as Peoria      County administrator.       His daughter, Amy, described him as a very intelligent and      just person who ``had a lot of integrity. I think he just      really tried the hardest to do what he truly believed was      right. He had a very strong sense of social justice and civil      rights: He always stood for people who were oppressed and      always thought about them.''       She added that he recently told her a story about his trip      to Peoria just before he became city manager there.       ``The first thing he said was, `Show me the slums, because      that's what the state of the city is,' '' she said.       He also recently refused to get a higher pay increase than      the people working for the county under him, she said.       Raised in Cincinnati where he finished high school, Mr.      Daken held a bachelor's in political science and a master's      in public administration from the University of Cincinnati.      In 1964, he began his career as a student intern for the city      of Cincinnati. He later worked as a budget analyst for the      city of Cincinnati until the city of Toledo hired him as its      assistant manager.       Mr. Daken was a member of Toledo's Downtown Kiwanis, Old      Newsboys Goodfellow Association, American Society for Public      Administration; Children's International Summer Villages      Association and YMCA, Peoria Rotary Club, where he was      president in 1997, and the Peoria Symphony, for which he was      a longtime member of the board.       Surviving are his wife, Peggy; daughters, Amy and Sarah,      and sons, Russ and Kevin.       Memorial services will be at 10 a.m. tomorrow in St.      Vincent de Paul Church, Peoria. Visitation will be after 4      p.m. today in Wright and Salmon Mortuary, Peoria.
