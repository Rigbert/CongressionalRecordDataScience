 President, I wish to inform all Senators that on Friday, September 19, 2008, the Committee on Rules and Administration approved amendments to the U.S. Senate Internet Services Usage Rules and Policies. These regulations are effective immediately.  The regulations were amended to accommodate Senate offices interested in utilizing social networking sites. I wish to emphasize that all Senate Web sites must be located in the senate.gov host domain, except for the exceptions specified in A3 of the regulations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the amended regulations printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         U.S. Senate Internet Services Usage Rules and Policise                      A. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY       1. Senate Internet Services (``World Wide Web and      electronic mail, blogs, podcasting, streaming media, etc.'')      may only be used for official purposes. The use of Senate      Internet Services for personal, promotional, commercial, or      partisan political/campaign purposes is prohibited.       2. Members of the Senate, as well as Committee Chairmen and      Officers of the Senate may post to the Internet Servers      information files which contain matter relating to     their official business, activities, and duties. All other      offices must request approval from the Committee on Rules and      Administration before posting material on the Internet      Information Servers.       3. Websites covered by this policy must be located in the      Senate.gov host-domain.       a. Exceptions: A Member, Committee or Officer of the Senate      (``Office'') may separately maintain websites or channels or      otherwise post material on third-party websites that are      available to the general public subject to Senate Rules,      Regulations, Standing Orders and Statutes governing Senate      operations, including the prohibition on using Senate      internet resources for personal, promotional, commercial, or      partisan political/campaign purposes.       To provide assistance and guidance to Offices, the Rules      and Administration Committee may provide a non-exhaustive      list of examples of third-party websites that, at the time      they are reviewed by the Committee, agree:       a. to provide naming protocols or other methods that will      enable the public to know when a site or channel is      maintained by an office;       b. not to add personal, promotional, commercial or partisan      political/campaign-related content or links to an Office-     maintained website or channel; and       c. not to use data gathering tools on an Office-maintained      website or channel that allow for collecting personal      information on users and distributing it to outside parties.       b. If the use of a particular website is determined to pose      a possible threat to the security of the Senate's computer      network, the Committee on Rules and Administration reserves      the right to direct offices to cease using these websites      until the issue can be resolved.       c. The Rules Committee shall require the removal of a      website or channel maintained by the Member on such third-     party website or channel at the end of a Member's term.       4. It is the responsibility of each Senator, Committee      Chairman (on behalf of the committee), Officer of the Senate,      or office head to oversee the use of the Internet Services by      his or her office and to ensure that the use of the services      is consistent with the requirements established by this      policy and applicable laws and regulations.       5. Official records may not be placed on the Internet      Servers unless otherwise approved by the Secretary of the      Senate and prepared in accordance with Section 501 of Title      44 of the United States Code. Such records include, but are      not limited to: bills, public laws, committee reports, and      other legislative materials.      B. POSTING OR LINKING TO THE FOLLOWING MATTER IS PROHIBITED       1. Political Matter       a. Matter which specifically solicits political support for      the sender or any other person or political party, or a vote      or financial assistance for any candidate for any political      office is prohibited.       b. Matter which mentions a Senator or an employee of a      Senator as a candidate for political office, or which      constitutes electioneering, or which advocates the election      or defeat of any individuals, or a political party is      prohibited.       2. Personal Matter       a. Matter which by its nature is purely personal and is      unrelated to the official business activities and duties of      the sender is prohibited.       b. Matter which constitutes or includes any article,      account, sketch, narration, or other text laudatory and      complimentary of any Senator on a purely personal or      political basis rather than on the basis of performance of      official duties as a Senator is prohibited.       c. Reports of how or when a Senator, the Senator's spouse,      or any other member of the Senator's family spends time other      than in the performance of, or in connection with, the      legislative, representative, and other official functions of      such Senator is prohibited.       d. Any transmission expressing holiday greetings from a      Senator is prohibited. This prohibition does not preclude an      expression of holiday greetings at the commencement or      conclusion of an otherwise proper transmission.       3. Promotional Matter       a. The solicitation of funds for any purpose is prohibited.       b. The placement of logos or links used for personal,      promotional, commercial, or partisan political/campaign      purposes is prohibited.            C. RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF INTERNET SERVICES       1. During the 60-day period immediately preceding the date      of any primary or general election (whether regular, special,      or runoff) for any national, state, or local office in which      the Senator is a candidate, no Member may solicit constituent      input or inquiries (such as online petitions or opinion polls      or issue alerts) using a Senate Internet Server (``World Wide      Web and electronic mail, blogs, podcasting, streaming media,      etc.''), unless the candidacy of the Senator in such election      is uncontested.       2. Electronic mail may not be transmitted by a Member      during the 60-day period before the date of the Member's      primary or general election unless it is in response to a      direct inquiry. Exceptions to this moratorium include the      following: press release distribution to press organizations      and email to perform administrative communication. Direct      inquiries do not include a request to be added to a mailing      list, subscription list, or other request to receive future      mailings. During the 60-day period, electronic news letters      may not be sent out.       3. During the 60-day period immediately before the date of      a biennial general Federal election, no Member may solicit      constituent input or inquiries (such as online petitions or      opinion polls, issue alerts or request to be added to      newsletter mailing lists electronic or otherwise, on behalf      of another Senator who is a candidate for election, unless      the candidacy of the Senator in such election is uncontested.       4. An uncontested candidacy is established when the Rules      Committee receives written certification from the appropriate      state official that the Senator's candidacy may not be      contested under state law. Since the candidacy of a Senator      who is running for re-election from a state which permits      write-in votes on elections day without prior registration or      other advance qualification by the candidate may be      contested, such a Member is subject to the above      restrictions.       5. If a Member is under the restrictions as defined in      subtitle C, paragraph (1), above, the following statement      must appear on the homepage: (``Pursuant to Senate policy,      newsletters, petitions, opinion polls and issue alerts and      other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this      office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a      primary or general election.''). The words ``Senate Policy''      must be hypertext linked to the Internet services policy on      the Senate Home Page.       6. A Senator's homepage may not refer or be hypertext      linked to another Member's site or electronic mail address      without authorization from that Member.       7. Any Links to Information not located on a Senate      Internet Server must be identified as a link to a non-Senate      entity, subject to the exceptions noted in (A)(3).
