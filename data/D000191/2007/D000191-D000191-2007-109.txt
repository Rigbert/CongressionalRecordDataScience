  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the Republicans belittling the 100 hours, say, well, we really didn't do much. It is low hanging fruit. Well, if that is so, why in the last 12 years did the Republicans not raise the Federal minimum wage? In fact, they didn't even allow a vote on raising the Federal minimum wage in the last decade, and they would belittle that because they don't care about working people in this country.  They said a year ago, their leaders in face of the Abramoff scandal which enveloped the Republican Party, that they would have ethics reform on the floor and passed before the end of February. Well, February came and went. We got it done in January, a year later, after we took control. They couldn't even clean up their own mess. And they belittle what we are doing.  A year ago, they jammed through legislation to raise the cost of student financial aid to pay for tax cuts for wealthy investors, to extend those tax breaks from 2008 to 2010. Yesterday, we passed legislation to cut the costs of interest and student financial aid in half. We took on big banks, and we will take on the wealthy investors. There is a big difference in this Congress, and the Republicans are whining.                          ____________________
