 It doesn't say that anywhere in the law. It doesn't say it anyplace. They made that up. I don't know what sort of political points they want to make, but keeping the speeches to what the law says, and not what somebody thinks it says, seems to be very important to intellectually honest debate.  To the Senator from Oregon, drug companies want cash-paying customers with no coverage because those people, as we all know, pay the highest prices. The drug companies don't have to negotiate with anyone when seniors don't have any drug coverage, such as they didn't have before this law went into effect. Part D provides that drug coverage, and now the drug companies have to compete to offer lower prices and to get plans to put their drugs on their preferred drug list. It is very necessary. They would like to have the environment that you want: No formulary. Then they have everything the way they want it. That is how negotiations work, to drive down prices, to get your plan approved, and that is how competition works to reduce prices, and that is what we see after 2\1/2\ months of the operation of this legislation. Don't give the drug companies what they want: no formulary.
