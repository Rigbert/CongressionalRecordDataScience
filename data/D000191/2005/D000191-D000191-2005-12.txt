Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Part B Amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 109-347      offered by Mr. DeFazio:       At the end of the bill, add the following (and conform the      table of contents accordingly):                TITLE __--PRESCREENING OF AIR PASSENGERS     SEC. __. IMMEDIATE INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER PRESCREENING PILOT                    PROGRAM.       (a) Pilot Program.--Not later than 90 days after the date      of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security      shall initiate a pilot program to evaluate the use of      automated systems for the immediate prescreening of      passengers on flights in foreign air transportation, as      defined by section 40102 of title 49, United States Code,      that are bound for the United States.       (b) Requirements.--At a minimum, with respect to a      passenger on a flight described in subsection (a) operated by      an air carrier or foreign air carrier, the automated systems      evaluated under the pilot program shall--       (1) compare the passenger's information against the      integrated and consolidated terrorist watchlist maintained by      the Federal Government and provide the results of the      comparison to the air carrier or foreign air carrier before      the passenger is permitted to board the flight;       (2) provide functions similar to the advanced passenger      information system established under section 431 of the      Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431); and       (3) make use of machine-readable data elements on passports      and other travel and entry documents in a manner consistent      with international standards.       (c) Operation.--The pilot program shall be conducted--       (1) in not fewer than 2 foreign airports; and       (2) in collaboration with not fewer than one air carrier at      each airport participating in the pilot program.       (d) Evaluation of Automated Systems.--In conducting the      pilot program, the Secretary shall evaluate not more than 3      automated systems. One or more of such systems shall be      commercially available and currently in use to prescreen      passengers.       (e) Privacy Protection.--The Secretary shall ensure that      the passenger data is collected under the pilot program in a      manner consistent with the standards established under      section 552a of title 5, United States Code.       (f) Duration.--The Secretary shall conduct the pilot      program for not fewer than 90 days.       (g) Passenger Defined.--In this section, the term      ``passenger'' includes members of the flight crew.       (h) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of      completion of the pilot program, the Secretary shall submit      to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of      Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and      Transportation of the Senate a report containing the      following:       (1) An assessment of the technical performance of each of      the tested systems, including the system's accuracy,      scalability, and effectiveness with respect to measurable      factors, including, at a minimum, passenger throughput, the      rate of flight diversions, and the rate of false negatives      and positives.       (2) A description of the provisions of each tested system      to protect the civil liberties and privacy rights of      passengers, as well as a description of the adequacy of an      immediate redress or appeals process for passengers denied      authorization to travel.       (3) Cost projections for implementation of each tested      system, including--       (A) projected costs to the Department of Homeland Security;      and       (B) projected costs of compliance to air carriers operating      flights described in subsection (a).       (4) A determination as to which tested system is the best-     performing and most efficient system to ensure immediate      prescreening of international passengers. Such determination      shall be made after consultation with individuals in the      private sector having expertise in airline industry, travel,      tourism, privacy, national security, and computer security      issues.       (5) A plan to fully deploy the best-performing and most      efficient system tested by not later than January 1, 2007.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 610, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Hopefully, this will be a relatively noncontroversial amendment, unlike the preceding.  We are doing something nonsensical today. We have, post-9/11, required that manifests be submitted to the United States of America to our law enforcement intelligence authorities for incoming flights for all passengers on board. That is good. That was only voluntarily before 9/11.  Unfortunately, we do not require that this be done until the flight has left, and we have all seen that a number of times flights have been turned back. They have had to land in Canada or Maine. People have had to be off-loaded. It would be a lot more sensible to have a program where we could vet the manifest before the plane leaves.  So this amendment would set up a pilot program. The technology exists. It is being done in Australia and elsewhere very successfully, to have a pilot program so that we could show that this will work so that we can both make America more secure and facilitate international air travel.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from California claim the time in opposition?
