Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I understand the gentleman said a lot of things about reaching bipartisan agreements and all of this sort of stuff, and the Senate needed 60 votes. They didn't introduce a bill. Not a single appropriation bill was introduced.                              {time}  1215  They had the same 60-vote requirement last year, and they passed a lot of bills last year. The reason they didn't pass bills is that the President of the United States wouldn't come to the table and agree on caps. They could have done the same thing we did.  We are an independent branch of government. We are the Article I branch of government. We appropriate money. We spend money. But the Senate has not done its work.  If you brought the bills to the floor and couldn't get 60 votes, we get it. But I will tell my friend that there is great frustration. For the first time since my friend has been a Member of the Congress, we passed 96 percent of the funding for government by June 30, otherwise known as 3 full months before the end of the fiscal year, giving the Senate a lot of time.  But, no, we had to wait and wait and wait until the President sent down Secretary Mnuchin, and we finally made an agreement on 302(a)s, in other words, the caps, what we were going to spend.  With all due respect to all this talk about bipartisanship and that we need to work together, that is, of course, true. It was not true in the Congresses when my friend's party was in the majority. The Republicans passed partisan bills, and they went over to the Senate. The Senate didn't take them, and we went back and forth.  There has been no back and forth. We did our work, and although the Republicans disagreed with the numbers publicly, privately, very frankly, a lot of my friend's Members told me the numbers were pretty good numbers, and they liked them, including defense. We passed a Defense bill with a substantial increase for our troops, readiness, operations, and training.  I say that to Mr. Whip not to criticize my friend but to simply say that of all this verbiage about being nice to get together and do something, the regular order is we pass bills, the Senate passes bills, and then we have a conference. Unfortunately, we have gotten away from that, which I think is very bad for the House, the Senate, and the American people.  We cannot go to conference if the Senate doesn't even pass a bill, doesn't even introduce a bill, waiting on the President of the United States to say, ``Simon says.''  We can't get a bill supported by 90 percent of the American people, comprehensive background checks, which 90 percent, a majority of my friend's party, a majority of my party, and a majority of independents thinks makes common sense. We passed it in February, and we can't even have it on the floor in the United States Senate.  Not only are they not doing appropriations bills, but they are not doing any other bills either. They spend all their time on judges.  We are a little frustrated on this side because we have done our work. Ninety-six percent of government is funded, and, yes, there could have been differences of opinion. They should have passed bills and said, no, we don't agree.  Mr. Speaker, the problem they would have had, I tell my friend, is that they didn't want to have bipartisan bills because, yes, it would have required them to get 60 votes, and they didn't want to make the compromises necessary to get 60 votes.  We are here, just a little more than 15 days before the end of the fiscal year, and the Senate has not passed a single bill while we have funded 96 percent of government. This CR is necessary. Nobody wants to shut down government, I hope. Hopefully, the CR will not have anything that either party will disagree with, and we will extend some things that need to be extended because we haven't acted upon them in a timely fashion. But I am hopeful that the CR will get to the Senate, that we will pass the CR, that there will be no drama, and then, as the gentleman suggests, and I agree with him, that we will sit down in a bipartisan way and try to reach agreement on each 1 of the 12 appropriations bills and either put them separately or in a minibus or omnibus and pass them to fund the government and not have what we had last year and into the first part of 2017, a shutdown of the Government of the United States. That was not good for the people of our country, not good for our government employees, and not good for the Congress of the United States to be unable to do its work, resulting in a shutdown of government.  I appreciate the gentleman's sentiment about doing things in a bipartisan way, but you can't do things in a bipartisan way if they don't come to the floor. If the leader over there doesn't have 60 votes, then he needs to reach a compromise because we need to get our business done. We passed all of our bills. Some were not partisan, I think, in many ways, but there was a determination not to vote for them because we hadn't reached a caps number. I think that was unfortunate because I think, as someone who served on the committee for 23 years, Mr. Speaker, we passed our bills in many, many instances--most instances--in a bipartisan fashion.  I didn't want the comment to go not responded to, in terms of the Senate's refusal and unwillingness to act and do its business. And here we are, not a single bill--not one--has been passed through the committee.  The gentleman's party has the majority on the committee. At least my friend could report them out of committee and then work on getting 60 votes.
