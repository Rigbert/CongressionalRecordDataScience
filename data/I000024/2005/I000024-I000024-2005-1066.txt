It never has happened until now.                               Exhibit 1                  [From the LA Times, April 26, 2005]                          Nuke the Filibuster       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again      conservative Christians who strongly want to see President      Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge      against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are      born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist      legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal      senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago      but now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to      amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of      heart is explained by something deeper than the mere      difference between being in the majority and being in the      minority.       At the risk of seeming dull or unfashionable for not      getting our own intellectual makeover, we still think      judicial candidates nominated by a president deserve an up-     or-down vote in the Senate. We hardly see eye to eye with the      far right on social issues, and we oppose some of these      judicial nominees, but we urge Republican leaders to press      ahead with their threat to nuke the filibuster. The so-called      nuclear option entails a finding by a straight majority that      filibusters are inappropriate in judicial confirmation      battles.       But the Senate shouldn't stop with filibusters over judges.      It should strive to nuke the filibuster for all legislative      purposes.       The filibuster debate is a stark reminder of the      unprincipled and results-oriented nature of politics, as      senators readily switch sides for tactical advantage.      Politicians' lack of consistency on fundamental matters--the      debate over the proper balance of power between Washington      and the states would be another case in point--is far more      corrosive to the health of American democracy and the rule of      law than any number of Bush-appointed judges could ever be.      For one thing, it validates public wariness about politicians      professing deep convictions.       Liberal interest groups determined to keep Bush nominees      off the bench are in such a frenzy that they would have you      believe that the Senate filibuster lies at the heart of all      American freedoms, its lineage traceable to the Constitution,      if not the Magna Carta. The filibuster, a parliamentary      tactic allowing 41 senators to block a vote by extending      debate on a measure indefinitely, is indeed venerable--it can      be traced back two centuries. But it is merely the product of      the Senate's own rule-making, altered over time; the measure      was not part of the founding fathers' checks and balances to      prevent a tyranny of the majority. The Senate's structure      itself was part of that calculus.       The filibuster is a reactionary instrument that goes too      far in empowering a minority of senators. It's no accident      that most filibusters have hindered progressive crusades in      Washington, be it on civil rights or campaign finance reform.      California's Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of those      recent converts to the filibuster, embarrassed herself by      hailing Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) as her inspiration at a      pro-filibuster rally. At least Byrd is being consistent in      his support--he filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act.       A showdown is looking increasingly likely, though it isn't      clear that all Republicans want this fight. Some of them      realize they will again be in the minority someday and that      the filibuster is a handy brake on the federal government's      activism. If their caution prevails, or if Republicans take      on the filibuster only in the narrow context of confirmation      battles, we will happily weigh in again in the future, still      on the anti-filibuster team.
