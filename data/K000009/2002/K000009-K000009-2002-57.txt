Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, do not try to buy slab specialty steel made by domestic manufacturers in the heartland of America that I represent because the last one just closed. If you are an independent machine toolmaker, you cannot find that product. It is a very, very serious situation.  I just want to put two words on the record to add to this discussion: one is ``recession'' and another is ``repression.''  In terms of recession, if we think about the recession that we are crawling our way out of, and some parts of America are still in, what triggered it? Rising oil prices for imported fuel. People have forgotten that.  Before September 11, we were already struggling with a hammerlock on this economy; and then after September 11 when the OPEC countries and some of the other oil exporting countries got worried, they lowered prices. Then they are coming back up again. This is a very manipulated price scheme, and that was proven by the Federal Trade Commission in some of the initial investigations done as we entered this recession.  The American people should remember that rising petroleum costs and imports, the rising costs of imports, can really kick this economy in the shins. If we think back to the 1970s and what happened in those decades with the Arab oil embargoes and the severe depression that this country was thrown into because of the costs of rising imports, we are now importing more than we did back then. Yes, we are conserving more at the same time, but we have not created the new fuels here at home. What we need to do on the public and private sides, we have been bunting rather than hitting three-base hits.                              {time}  1900  It has made a huge difference in our ability to handle our economy in a way that preserves our independence and does not do as much harm here at home.  The other word I wanted to just say a word about, if I could, and that is repression, because some of the very countries that receive the dollars when our people go to the gas pump, for example, and they buy petroleum that is refined into gasoline from other countries, those dollars go to them. What do they use them for? The gentleman from Oregon mentioned Saudi Arabia. Most of the terrorists were born or spent time in Saudi Arabia. That is a very repressive regime. And our dollars support it. What did Osama bin Laden say? He said that he wanted U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia. What are U.S. troops doing in Saudi Arabia? Thousands and thousands and thousands of troops, what are they doing there? And what happened to the USS Cole about a year and a half ago in Yemen harbor when a suicide bomber hit our destroyer, what was that ship doing there in the Middle East? Could it be anything to do with watching the oil lanes and the movement of tankers out of that region of the world? I think it had a whole lot to do with that and I think it is important for us to think about who we are supporting when we spend our dollars.  It is very hard for the American people to do anything on the petroleum issue because when they go to the gas pump, they do not know that Citgo gets its gasoline from Venezuela, they do not know that Occidental has fields in Colombia, they do not really think about Exxon in Saudi Arabia, they do not associate a company name with a country. Yet that is exactly what is going on. And so if you buy that product, you support through the transaction the regimes of those countries and there is not a single democracy among them. And in the end the people living in those countries translate our behavior as a society into what they experience in their own homelands and they want a better way of life, but the regimes there do not permit it. And so some of the anger directed against the United States is a direct result of the economic relationships that keep them down.  I would just maybe brag a little bit here about an organization in northwest Ohio called Northwest Ohio Ethanol, because at the same time as our Marines and Special Forces are defending the edge of freedom globally, there are things people can do here at home. And in terms of our energy trade deficit, one of the most important actions we can take is to become fuel self-sufficient. We have a new private company, Northwest Ohio Ethanol, that has been incorporated, that is selling shares on the private market so that Ohio's farmers can come together and provide a new fuel for the future.  We only have two biofuel pumps in the entire State of Ohio, a State of 11 million people. I want to buy an E-85 car. I want to buy a biodiesel vehicle. I would be a fool to do it in Ohio because I cannot get the fuel to put in it. And so this deficit is really a very wicked thing, because the average American cannot alone dig out of it. The actions that one could take as a consumer are precluded because of the very large interests that control the refining and the supply of fuel to the marketplace. It is important to think about the words recession at home and repression abroad and what kind of a political endowment we are bequeathing to the future.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for assisting in this special order this evening. We will have opportunities to discuss this again. You have certainly opened up the door to discuss energy self-sufficiency and energy policy which I think is one of the strongest steps we could take to make this country secure for the next century, both militarily and economically. I would love to engage in a special order on that subject some evening.
