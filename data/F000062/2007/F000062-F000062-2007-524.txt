 President, a brief explanation, and then I wish to set aside the amendment. But essentially what this amendment does is very simple. It relates to classified earmarks and simply says:       It shall not be in order to consider any bill, resolution,      or conference report that contains an earmark included in any      classified portion of a report accompanying the measure      unless the bill, resolution, or conference report includes,      in unclassified language, to the greatest extent possible, a      general program description, funding level, and the name of      the sponsor of that earmark.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside.
