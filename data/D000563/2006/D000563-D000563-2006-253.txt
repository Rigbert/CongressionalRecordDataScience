President, I made an earlier unanimous consent request that we were going to alternate. I could read the list that we currently have subject, of course, to the arrival of Senators. But it is our hope that we would have Senator Kerry followed by Senator Kennedy, and then Senators Jack Reed and Hillary Clinton, followed by Senators Harkin, Boxer, Dayton, Carper, Dorgan, Murray, Mikulski, and Lautenberg.
