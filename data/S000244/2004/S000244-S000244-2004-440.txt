Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, the gentlewoman from Texas' argument has nothing to do with her amendment and the examples that she has used has nothing to do with this bill.  First, what the amendment does is exactly what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) has indicated, and that is to say, that a company could sue for getting too fat. Well, a company is a piece of paper that is signed by the Secretary of State of the State of corporation, and has the State seal affixed to it. Companies do not get fat, at least in the physical way that this bill is designed to address.  Secondly, the gentlewoman from Texas brings up the case of the lawsuit that was filed against Oprah Winfrey. That was a defamation suit. This bill has nothing to do with allegations of defamation. Anybody who claims to have a cause of action for defamation is perfectly able to go to court and file their case.  So I do not understand what relevance the gentlewoman's amendment has to the issues that are presented to this bill, and that is why it should be defeated.
