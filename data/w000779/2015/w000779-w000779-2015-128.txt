President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Judge Stephen Schwebel, who is both a dispute arbitrator and president of the International Court of Justice. This letter provides a useful perspective on the investment matters that have been discussed this week.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      May 5, 2015.     Senator Ron Wyden,     Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I have been asked to comment on      statements that have recently been circulated that oppose      inclusion in the projected Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) of      provision for investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS).      Please permit me to note that I addressed criticism of ISDS a      year ago at some length in a speech to the Congress of the      International Council for Commercial Arbitration. A copy of      that speech is attached. I believe that it is of current      pertinence.       For my part, as a former Judge and President of the      International Court of Justice, with experience going back to      1954 in international arbitration between States, between      corporations and States, and in international commercial      arbitration, I remain convinced that investor-State dispute      settlement is a progressive development in international law      and relations that should be preserved and nurtured. It      should certainly be included in the TPP and in the comparable      transatlantic treaty under negotiation as it has been in more      than 3000 bilateral investment treaties, and in important      multilateral treaties, notably NAFTA and the Energy Charter      Treaty.       A letter of April 30, 2015 written to leaders of the Senate      and House by five distinguished professors of law and      economics and a former Circuit Court Judge criticizes 1SDS      because it allows foreign investors to avoid U.S. courts by      resorting to arbitral tribunals. The letter fails to take      account of the fundamental fact that treaties are reciprocal.      If the United States seeks to have disputes that arise      between American investors and foreign governments not      resolved by foreign courts, some of which may be less than      objective in their treatment of foreign investors; if the      United States seeks to substitute the rule of law for its      exercise of diplomatic protection which if and when      episodically extended is often ineffective; if the United      States seeks to avoid the gunboat diplomacy of earlier era,      then it must be ready to extend to foreign investors      investing in the United States the option of recourse to      international arbitration which their governments      reciprocally extend to U.S. investors. It is of course true      that U.S. courts generally have high standards in their      treatment of foreign parties. It is also true that the      substantive provisions of treaties providing for investor/     State arbitration are consistent with U.S. Constitutional      guarantees. In point of fact, few arbitral cases have been      filed against the United States in ISDS proceedings and so      far the United States has won them all.       A report of the Transnational Institute of 2012 charges      that a small group of arbitrators has decided a majority of      investor/State disputes, that this group is ``riven with      conflicts'', and that they exhibit a ``strong market      orientation''. An example cited is that of Marc Lalonde ``who      has served on the board for energy and mining company      Sherritt International'' while energy and mining cases      ``account for half of the 30 cases in which he has served as      arbitrator''. But in fact Mr. Lalonde earlier was a very      senior official of the Government of Canada for some 20      years, serving as a Minister of the Crown--a cabinet officer,      in American parlance--for Health and Welfare, Status of      Women, Federal-Provincial Relations, Justice, Energy, Mines      and Resources, and Finance. By parity of reasoning, he should      exhibit not a strong market orientation but a strong pro-     State orientation. In point of fact, Mr. Lalonde exhibits an      impartial orientation and has the confidence of both      governments and investors, as his colleagues in the field do      as well. If they did not, the system of investor/State      arbitration would not have flourished as it has.       Charges by groups and individuals that the ISDS process      manifests ``a serious pro-company tilt'' are contrary to      fact. Of 144 publically available arbitral awards, as of      January 2012, where arbitrators resolved a dispute arising      under a treaty, States won 87 cases, and investors won 57.      ICSID statistics show that of its disputes decided in 2013,      jurisdiction was declined in 31%, the award dismissed all      claims in 32%, and an award upholding claims in part or in      fill issued in 37%. These figures in the large hardly support      the allegation of a bias against States. If investment      arbitrators were truly influenced by the prospects of      remuneration for extended proceedings and for further      appointments, why would they terminate so     many arbitral proceedings at the jurisdictional stage?      Moreover, the large majority of international arbitral awards      are unanimous, a fact that suggests that arbitrators are not      unduly responsive to the interests of the party that      appointed them.       In short, the integrity of ISDS is demonstrably high.           Your sincerely,                                              Stephen M. Schwebel.
