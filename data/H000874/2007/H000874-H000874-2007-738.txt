 So it was not an oversight to that extent; it has historically been not treated. Having said that, I can tell the gentleman, I have talked to Mr. Miller, the chairman of the committee that dealt with the minimum wage bill, and he is going to look at that to make sure that American Samoa is consistent with, and that does not mean exactly the same wage scale, but consistent with our concerns that were incorporated in the minimum wage bill, which received, as you know, 82 votes on your side and all of the votes on our side; a very bipartisan bill.  But American Samoa has been treated in a way different in the past. So it was not an oversight. But the question has been raised by people on your side and our side, and so Mr. Miller and the people on his committee will be looking at that. So the answer to your question is, yes.
