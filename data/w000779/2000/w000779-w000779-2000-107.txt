President, I am introducing today the Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act. This bill will enhance the privacy rights of wireless subscribers by strengthening the laws that prohibit eavesdropping wireless communications. Since the early days of wireless communications, Congress has paid particular attention to the privacy rights of wireless subscribers. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to find loopholes in the law. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns.  Using the loopholes, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to develop a ``gray market'' for modified and modifiable wireless scanners. Some of these individuals even advertise in magazines and on Internet websites that their products can be altered easily to pick up cellular communications. The information and equipment necessary to make these modifications are also widely advertised, sometimes with blatant offers to unblock the cellular frequencies after the equipment is purchased.  The Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act attacks these problems on several fronts. First, it would expand the definition of the frequencies that may not be scanned to include digital Personal Communications Service (PCS) frequencies as well as cellular ones. The legislation recognizes that some frequencies are shared between commercial mobile services and public safety users, and that the use of scanners to monitor public safety communications may assist in saving lives. As to those frequencies, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may adopt such regulations as may be necessary to enhance privacy.  Second, the bill would clarify that it is just as illegal to modify scanners for the purpose of eavesdropping as it is to manufacture or import them for this purpose, and it would direct the FCC to modify its rules to reflect this change. The bill also would amend current law to prohibit either the intentional interception or the intentional divulgence of wireless communications, so that either action on its own would be prohibited. Finally, the bill would require the FCC to investigate and take action on wireless privacy violations, regardless of any other investigative or enforcement action by any other federal agency. This provision would help ensure that these newly strengthened privacy protections are full enforced in the future.  The millions of Americans who use wireless communications deserve to have their privacy protected. They should be able to enjoy the same privacy protection as landline phone users. The Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act will help provide those protections, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Burns and me in supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2326       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Wireless Eavesdropping      Protection Act of 2000''.     SEC. 2. COMMERCE IN ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING DEVICES.
