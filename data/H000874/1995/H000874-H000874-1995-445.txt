Speaker, as a member of the Naval Academy Board of Visitors and a Member of Congress who has three of the greatest Naval installations in the country in my congressional district--the Patuxent Naval Air Station, the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center, and the Naval Research Laboratory--I was extremely honored to join this year's graduation exercises at the U.S. Naval Academy.   Last year President Clinton in speaking to the graduates said that ``I came here today because I want America to know there remains no finer Navy in the world than the U.S. Navy, and no finer training ground for naval leadership than the U.S. Naval Academy.''  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the words of our commander in chief.  This year, the graduation speaker was Secretary of the Navy John Dalton, who spoke of the timeless traits of leadership, traits I believe as Members of this body and as a nation we should practice in our everyday lives. I would like to submit the address by Secretary Dalton for the Record and close with one of his quotes to the outstanding graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy's Class of 1995:       This institution is unique because its mission is to ensure      that in your hearts you are unique. . . . That foremost and      everywhere the defense of American liberty will remain your      task  . . . whether in the Naval service or elsewhere.  My congratulations to the graduates of the class of 1995.  Mr. Speaker, I include Secretary Dalton's address for the Record:                     Timeless Traits of Leadership               (By Secretary of the Navy, John H. Dalton)       Thank you, Chuck [Admiral Larson]. I want to congratulate      you on the outstanding job you have done here at the Academy.      One of the decisions I am most proud of was my decision to      make Admiral Chuck Larson Superintendent of the Naval      Academy. He has stepped in and demonstrated once again his      extraordinary leadership ability. I thank you, the Academy      thanks you, the Naval Service thanks you, and, above all,      America thanks you for producing such outstanding young      officers as we have graduating here today.       I am very pleased today to have two people--who are very      special to me--here with us. . . . First of all, my claim to      fame--the first lady of the Navy, my wife, Margaret . . . and      sitting with her is a young man who graduated with honors      last year from Davidson College and taught for a year at a      Peace Corps-related service in Jamaica--teaching kids in the      third world . . . and who is going to be entering Officer      Candidate School this August to become a Naval Officer of the      United States Navy: my son John.       We are also very pleased to have with us today an      outstanding Member of Congress, who has been a strong support      and friend of the naval service, Congressman Steny Hoyer.       I have a letter I would like to read to you from our      Commander-in-Chief. He wanted to be here today, but was      called to that other Academy out in Colorado. I took the      first prize and came here. The letter reads:       Congratulations to the class of 1995 as you complete your      studies at the United States Naval Academy. You can take      great pride in the skills and character you have developed,      knowing that you are well prepared to meet the tremendous      challenge of leadership. Through the past 150 years, more      than 60 thousand Naval Academy men and women have helped to      keep our nation great.       Today, America looks to you to maintain this tradition of      excellence. I am confident that you will be equal to the      task. As you establish new standards of able performance and      lead the Naval and Marine Corps into the 21st Century, you      will stand as a beacon of liberty and democracy for nations      around the world. On behalf of all Americans, thank you for      your dedication to the idea of freedom and your commitment      for defending the Constitution of the United States. Best      wishes to each of you for every future success. Signed. Bill      Clinton       It is simply not possible to describe what a great honor      and privilege it is for me to be the principal speaker at the      sesquicentennial graduation ceremony of this great      institution that I love. I'm proud to be a graduate of the      United States Naval Academy, and I know how proud and excited      you are today because I remember so well how I felt as I sat      where you now sit on graduation day in 1964. The speaker was      Congressman Carl Vinson, Chairman of the House Armed Services      Committee. Due to the day's excitement, I remember very      little of what he said.       Three decades from now, you probably won't remember much of      what I say either. But, I hope that you get the main point.      Actually, in preparation for this speech I went back to      review Carl Vinson's text. He said, ``during your Navy      careers there not only will continue to be Secretaries of the      Navy, but these Secretaries will also continue to shoulder      heavy responsibilities.'' Those words did not have any      significance to me at that time. They certainly do now! Paul      Nitze was Secretary of the Navy then and handed me my diploma      as I will have the honor to present yours to you today.       At graduation last year President Clinton said, ``I came      here today because I want America to know there remains no      finer Navy in the world than the United States Navy, and no      finer training ground for naval leadership than the United      States Naval Academy.'' I could not agree more. Today, I want      to talk to you about naval leadership and my experience here      as a midshipman.       When I was a sophomore at Byrd High School in Shreveport,      Louisiana, we had a guest speaker who said that in his      opinion the finest overall education that anyone could get in      our country was at the United States Naval Academy. My mother      always taught me to ``hitch my wagon to a star,'' so I      decided right then the Academy was where I wanted to go. That      was the only place I applied, but in the spring of my senior      year, I learned that I had not been accepted. I was      devastated! So, I went to LSU for a year, which I enjoyed,      but my heart was still set on the Naval Academy. The next      year I was admitted into the Class of 1964.       I got off to a rocky start as a plebe and continued to have      some painful and humbling experiences. I wanted to row crew,      but got cut plebe summer. The first time they published an      unsat list for academics my name was on it. I wanted to fly,      but my eyes deteriorated. I competed for a Rhodes Scholarship      and was not selected.       But, I also had many great and memorable experiences here.      I marched with the whole brigade in John F. Kennedy's      inaugural parade. Sadly, I later led a special honor company      that marched in his funeral procession to Arlington National      Cemetery. I spent first class summer on a foreign exchange      cruise with Her Majesty's Royal Navy in Singapore. I had the      privilege to serve as a striper in one of the truly great      classes ever to graduate from here. For four years in a row,      we ``beat Army'' in football . . . and I am confident that      come the first Saturday in December, we are going to start      that habit one more time!       The greatest lesson I learned came from our Superintendent,      Rear Admiral Charles C. Kirkpatrick. He repeatedly told us,      ``You can do anything you set your mind to do, and don't you      forget it.'' I pass that on to you. You can do anything you      set your mind to do, and don't you forget it.       I know that right now your minds are on the end of your      long voyage here . . . and the pride and joy you feel in what      you have accomplished. Your family and friends share that      pride and so do I. But along with the celebration, this is      also a moment for each of you to think seriously about the      challenges you will face in the future.       As you move forward in life, the one thing you will always      need is a framework on which to base your approach to      leadership. I have given much thought over the years to my      own framework. It helped me with the leadership challenges I      faced--as a midshipman, an active duty submarine officer, a      Naval reservist, a community leader, and government official.       Recently an acquaintance of mine, a theologian from      California, sent me a list of eight specific leadership      traits that he drew from chapter 27 of the book of Acts in      the Bible. In a succinct way, he has caught traits essential      to my leadership framework. Now I'm not a preacher and this      is not a sermon. But you certainly don't have to be a      religious person to appreciate the value of these traits, and      you don't have to be a Biblical scholar to interpret them.       These traits have stood the test of time. The list is as      follows: A leader is trusted, a leader takes the initiative,      a leader uses good judgment, a leader speaks with authority,      a leader strengthens others, is optimistic and enthusiastic,      never compromises absolutes, and leads by example.       This list can be exemplified by predecessors of yours from      this Academy who have captured the essence of these      leadership traits.       The first trait is trust. I am told by Admiral Larson that      your class admires President Jimmy Carter, Class of 1947, and      so do I. He personifies trust. He was successful with the      Camp David Accords and the Middle East Peace Treaty, and he      continues to serve the cause of peace in the world, because      he is so honest and straightforward that he is genuinely      trusted.       As plebes, you memorized a great example of trust. At the      Battle of Manila Bay, Admiral George Dewey (Class of 1859)      turned to the captain of his flagship and said, ``You may      fire when ready, Gridley.'' This Academy teaches trust and      Admiral Dewey trusted each captain and crew to fight without      need for his personal direction.       A leader takes the initiative. ``Carpe Diem'' Latin for      ``seize the day'' has always been a fundamental tenet of      leadership.       I find inspiration in this regard in the deeds of Vice      Admiral Jim Stockdale, a classmate of President Carter, who      took command of his fellow Prisoners of War in Hanoi at the      height of the Vietnam conflict. Admiral Stockdale initiated      and led cohesive resistance to torture and abuse despite the      daily uncertainty of his own fate.       Good judgment is also critical to good leadership. Good      judgment is not just evident in success, it can be most      evident in defeat and disappointment.       In the Battle of the Coral Sea, the carrier USS Lexington--     one of our few assets following Pearl Harbor--took multiple      hits that caused her to list and burn. Rear Admiral Aubrey      Fitch (Class of 1906), commander of the carrier group--and      later a Superintendent of the Naval Academy--calmly assessed      damage control efforts. He then turned to the Lexington's      captain and said, ``It's time to get the men off this      thing.'' Twenty-seven hundred lives were saved by that one      judgment call. A good leader needs to make tough decisions      especially when things are going wrong.       The next trait is at the heart of a leader's personality. A      leader speaks with authority. A leader needs to have      sufficient confidence in what he is saying so that potential      followers will be convinced. The best way to      convince people is to speak with authority. And if that authority is      matched by knowledge then the chances for leadership are      greatly enhanced.       The development of the concept of amphibious warfare was      initiated by Marine Corps Commandants who combined authority      with conviction and knowledge. From its origins during the      tenures of Commandants John Lejeune, Wendell Neville, and      Benjamin Fuller, through the establishment of the Fleet      Marine Force under General John H. Russell, all Naval Academy      graduates, the development of the Marine Corps as America's      expeditionary force was the result of leadership. It was      backed by the experience of campaigns in the Caribbean,      Central America, the Pacific and China. These leaders spoke      with authority in directing new ideas because they had      experienced the old ideas and borne the scars.       Likewise, when Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh      Burke (Class of 1923) began the project to build the first      fleet ballistic missile submarine, he needed to convince both      the civilian leadership and the Navy itself that the program      required top priority. The authority of his presentation was      fortified with his combat experience--and his reflections      about the deterrence implications of that experience.       A leader strengths others. A good leader does not seek to      impose his or her own attitudes or solutions on others.      Rather, the leader provides the support and guidance that      prompts others to have confidence in their own abilities and      decision-making.       When Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz (Class of 1905) arrived      to take command of the remnants of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl      Harbor, his first effort was to renew the confidence of the      staff and the commanding officers that they could go on to      victory. Rather than making heads roll, he made them think.      Rather than emphasizing the mistakes, he convinced his      subordinates that they were the ones to overcome the past.      Those who served under him recalled that his very      ``presence'' seemed to give confidence wherever he was. He      strengthened others to believe their abilities could achieve      the crucial victory that they sought.       A leader remains optimistic and enthusiastic. To lead      effectively, see the glass as half-full, not half-empty.      Believe, every morning, that things are going to be better      than before. Attitudes are infectious. Optimism and      enthusiasm overcome the greatest challenges.       Captain John Paul Jones captured this idea with the      immortal quote, ``I have not yet begun to fight.'' I have a      painting of that famous battle between the Bonhomme Richard      and Serapis hanging in my office and it inspires me every      day. John Paul Jones's spirit of optimism and enthusiasm has      been a part of our Navy since the American Revolution.       A leader never compromises absolutes. Defense of American      freedom and obedience to the Constitution of the United      States are two absolutes the Naval Service lives by, and for      which our Sailors and Marines may face death.       Admiral Hyman Rickover (Class of 1922), the father of the      nuclear Navy--by whom I was interviewed for the Navy's      nuclear program--vividly demonstrated this commitment to      absolutes. He wanted to ensure there was no compromise in the      safety of our submarines. And he did this by setting an      example. Most Americans don't know that Admiral Rickover went      on the first trial dive of every nuclear submarine the Navy      built. He knew that it wasn't enough to simply certify on      paper that a new submarine was safe. If Sailors were going to      trust their lives to an untested submarine, he would go with      them. If something seemed like it was going wrong during the      dive, he would calmly go to the compartment where the problem      appeared and sit to watch the crew handle it. How could you      be afraid when this small, wrinkled old man was not? How      could you treat safety as anything but an absolute.       This leads to the final quality on this list of traits:      example. The best leaders need fewer words than most, because      they lead with their lives. In the sports world, example is      not just ability, but both the willingness to lead and the      humility to support a team effort that is stronger than one      skilled individual. Roger Staubach class of '65 and David      Robinson class of `87 are competitors who set the example as      both leaders and teammates.       Among today's Naval leaders, Rear Admiral Anthony Watson,      class of 1970, has set an example that many young Americans      have decided to follow. Raised in a public housing project in      Chicago, he was a recognized leader in every position from      midshipman to Commanding Officer to Deputy Commandant here,      and became the first African-American submariner to make flag      rank. He takes over soon as Commander of the Navy Recruiting      Command, a position that demands a very public example.       And finally, I want to mention an academy graduate who      exemplifies the fact that women in the Navy and Marine Corps      no longer face any limits to their dreams. Since the age of      ten, LCDR Wendy Lawrence, class of 1981, dreamed of becoming      an astronaut. Three years ago she fulfilled that childhood      dream. She became the first female naval aviator chosen by      NASA for the astronaut program and was a mission specialist      on the shuttle Endeavour's last mission. LCDR Lawrence      demonstrates that what matters to the Naval service, above      all else, is your performance as an officer. Man or woman,      you will rise as high as your abilities will take you.       These eight traits of leadership provide a path, a course      that has been marked for almost two thousand years.       There is a long line of Naval heroes before you . . . men      and women tried by history. Your turn has come. That's what      you were trained for. That is why the Naval Academy has      existed for 150 years. Not just to educate . . . not just to      train you in the arts of war . . . not just to provide      competent officers. But to instill you with a commitment and      tradition of service and leadership that will remain with you      forever.       In character and in deed, you will always be the ones to      set the example. This institutional is unique because its      mission is to ensure that in your hearts you are unique . . .      that foremost and everywhere the defense of American liberty      will remain your task . . . whether in the Naval Service or      elsewhere. Those people behind you are counting on you. When      you shake hands with me as you receive your diploma, let's      regard it as a pact--a bond between two graduates of this      extraordinary institution--to be as worthy as we can possibly      be of those who have gone before us . . . of those who march      with us today . . . and of those who will follow us. In a few      moments, your diploma and our handshake will seal that bond.      And then the real challenge will begin.       God bless you. God bless the United States Navy and United      States Marine Corps. And God bless America.                          ____________________
