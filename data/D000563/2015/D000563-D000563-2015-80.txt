President, first, let me thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal. I join him in condemning the violence that is taking place in the streets of the Middle East and Jerusalem and other places. I also join him in calling for a two-state solution so that we can have both the Palestinian people and the people of Israel living safely and securely without fear of any kind of military action from one against the other. That should be our ultimate goal, and we should renew that goal regularly. I join him in what he had to say.                          ____________________
