 That is different from an IRS auditor coming in and auditing Mr. and Mrs. John Jones' account, and the more they found, the more they get working as an IRS employee. These efforts will be directed at collecting debts that are not in dispute, debts that have been arrived at as owed, debts that have basically been forgotten, as I said, to the tune now of $70 billion. There is a lot of difference between that and protecting someone who the IRS is auditing or having a tax dispute with. This is not a tax dispute. This is a debt owed. There is a lot of difference.
