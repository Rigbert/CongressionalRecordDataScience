Speaker, I certainly hope she is correct, and I believe she is absolutely correct that we can work in a bipartisan fashion. There is nobody in this House who wants to see people in poverty. We may have different views of how to achieve the objective of empowering all of our people to seize the opportunity and to be paid a living wage and to support themselves and their family in a way we want them supported. We can work together--I agree with the gentlewoman--in a bipartisan fashion on that issue. I thank her for her leadership in achieving that objective.
