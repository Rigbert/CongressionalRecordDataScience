I have been and continue to be willing to work with all of my colleagues to adopt such a bill. I take nothing off the table. I believe it will take both reason and political courage to achieve such an objective. Americans are hoping and, yes, praying thatwe will have such wisdom and such courage.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to commit themselves to adopting a bipartisan and effective alternative to this destructive and irrational path.
