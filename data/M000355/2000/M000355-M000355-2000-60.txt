 President, I extend my appreciation to my good friend from Vermont. I have enjoyed working with him on this bill. And I express my particular gratitude to Robin Cleveland, Billy Piper, Jennifer Chartrand, Jon Meek, Chris Williams, Cara Thanassi, and all of my staff involved in developing this measure.  Are we now ready for third reading?  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on third reading.
