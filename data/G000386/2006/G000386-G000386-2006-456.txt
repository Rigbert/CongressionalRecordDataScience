 I hope my friend from Montana will agree with me on this, that we do have differences on this one part, the capital gains part of this bill, but I think we agree on everything else in the bill. I hope people listening to Senator Baucus and I maybe differing on this one point will remember that on most everything that goes on in our committee, we agree. I do not want them to get a distorted view of our friendship and our working together on this legislation.  I yield back my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
