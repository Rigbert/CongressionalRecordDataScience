  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Congress can recess for the Memorial Day break with a big bang. We are going to increase the debt ceiling by $984 billion, almost $1 trillion, and also later today the Congress will vote to borrow over $300 billion to reduce the taxes, principally of a wealthy few in this country, under the premise that under trickle-down economics, they will invest that money in such a way it will create jobs.  Well, the last tax cut of $1.2 trillion cost the country 1.7 million jobs and caused us to borrow another $1 trillion, because we are now running deficits.  We could make real investments and put people back to work, investments in roads, bridges, highways, mass transit, sewer, water systems, things that increase the productive capacity of the country and the wealth of the country.  By the administration's own measures, if we diverted that money instead of borrowing it to give to wealthy people in the hope it might create the 1million jobs the President hopes for, we could create 13 million jobs directly in construction, with a huge spillover in economic activity across the country.  There is a very viable alternative: do not borrow money to give to a few people. Never have we borrowed so much to give to so few.                          ____________________
