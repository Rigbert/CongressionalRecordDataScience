Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC will be celebrating its 9th anniversary by hosting a gala dinner and banquet on Saturday, March 5, 2011, at the Halls of Saint George, in Schererville, Indiana.  The Indian American Cultural Center, which opened on March 9, 2002, was established with the following goal in mind: to foster peace and harmony amongst the people of Northwest Indiana by showcasing their cultural heritage and creating spiritual awareness in both youth and adults, as well as to engage in various charitable events, both nationally and locally. Since its inception, the Indian American Cultural Center has been instrumental in educating Northwest Indiana's citizens on the traditions and customs of the Indian heritage.  The members of the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC are to be commended, not only for their commitment to preserving tradition, but also for their commitment to making improvements that benefit all mankind. Proceeds from this year's gala, which throughout the years has demonstrated the immense generosity of its attendees and organizers, will go to support the Carmelite Home for Girls. In the past, proceeds from the gala have gone to such noble causes as cancer research, educational scholarships, the American Red Cross, and tsunami relief, as well as to victims of Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Kashmir, India.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the board and members of the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC for their outstanding contributions to society. Their commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
