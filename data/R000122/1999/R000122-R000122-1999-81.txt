President, I rise to talk about a crisis that is affecting the families of this country. That crisis is the child care system, the ability to obtain safe, affordable, high-quality child care.  Today there are an estimated 13 million children, 6 million of them infants and toddlers, who require some form of day care. For working families, the price of this day care is exceedingly difficult to meet each and every day.  Full-day child care ranges from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. For some low-income families, that represents 25 percent of their income.  This is a huge obligation. We have, I fear and believe, the responsibility to ensure that we can help these families meet this obligation to protect their children. Not only is this necessary simply for the custodial protection and care of children, it is necessary for their enhancement, their advancement, for their intellectual development.  We have discovered over the last several years, because of all the research that is being done at the National Institutes of Health, and other places, the crucial role of the early development of children in their ultimate intellectual and social development as adults.  We know if we have good, nurturing care in the early days of life, this care will lead to better cognitive performance later on. It will increase classroom success. It will lead to more fully developed individuals who can cope with the challenges of this next century that is just upon us.  So our investment in child care is not simply something that is altruistic--something we want to do because it is for the kids and for working families--it is in the best interests of this country in order to provide for the citizens of this country of the next century.  We know also, as we look around, that one of the problems in child care, I say to Senators, is that because of the low reimbursement rates that the child care centers receive from the States, that they are not able to retain good employees and that they are not able to train the employees they can retain--particularly in this booming economy we see today.  So what you have in so many child care centers is a situation where they cannot retain their employees, they cannot attract the very best employees, they do not have the resources to fully develop the potential for these employees, and as a result, ultimately, children suffer.  In fact, there have been numerous studies. The one that I found most disturbing is one where four States were studied in the United States, and it was found that in those States only one out of seven child care centers provided care that promoted the healthy development of the child. Even more shocking, one in eight of these child care centers actually provided care that threatened the health of the child. We have to do something about it.  Prior to welfare reform, there was a law on the books that said the State, when they were subsidizing day care for low-income parents, had to at least try to achieve the 75th percentile in terms of their reimbursement rate. What that means is that they had to have a reimbursement rate that could at least meet the cost of 75 out of 100 of the centers in their particular State. That has gone by the wayside. But in order to keep quality in our child care system, we have to get to reimbursement rates that will, in fact, provide the resources for child care centers to have quality, enhancing care to benefit the children of this country.  What has also been abandoned in the last several years is even the attempt by the States to go ahead and do surveys of the market so they know what it costs different child care centers to provide care and know what it costs for the parents to send their children to day-care centers. Having abandoned these market surveys, essentially there is no connection between their subsidy rate and, in fact, the cost of day care. So working families who receive these subsidies--and there are more and more families who are receiving subsidies as we move welfare recipients to work--have no correlation between what they are getting and essentially what the cost of child care is in the real world.  What I have done, along with some of my colleagues, is introduce legislation that would, in fact, give the States an incentive, first to do their market surveys, to find out the cost of day care in their communities, and then to strive to meet those market rates.  I have been very pleased to be joined by Senators Chris Dodd and Ted Kennedy, who are leaders in the field of improving child care in this country, together with Senators Feinstein, Inouye, and Murray in introducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act. Essentially, this legislation would establish a new mandatory pool of funding, $300 million each year over the next 5 years, as part of the Child Care Development Block Grant Program. This funding would be an incentive for States to first conduct a market survey and then to make significant movement towards raising their subsidy rates to that market rate. In so doing, we can directly contribute to the bottom line of these child care centers. They, in turn, can retain personnel, train their personnel, and create a more enhancing environment for the development of children. This, I think, is a goal we should have.  Increased reimbursement rates also expand the number of choices parents have in finding quality child care.  We will also, I hope, at the same time try to increase the overall scope of the child development block grants. One of the consequences of simply increasing funding for the child care development block grant, is many States will not increase the subsidy they pay for children; they will simply try to enroll more children. This puts centers in a very cruel dilemma because the more children they have at that far-below-market rate the greater the economic pressure on the centers.  The program I am presenting today with my colleagues would do what child care providers have argued must be done, and that is to give them additional resources so they can, in fact, improve the quality of day care--not simply the number of children in day care but the quality of day care. If we do these things we are going to be in a strong position to face the challenges ahead.  One of the greatest challenges for working families is the cost of day care for their children. I have been very pleased to note that this legislation has been endorsed by the USA Child Care, the Children's Defense Fund, Catholic Charities of the United States, the Child Welfare League of America, the YMCA of the United States, the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, the National Head Start Association, the National Child Care Association and a host of other agencies and organizations throughout the country. They recognize, as I do, and as my colleagues who are introducing this legislation do, that we can talk a lot about child care, we can emphasize how important it is to families, we can stress the importance to our economy and to our long-run future in this country, but until we put real resources to work, we will not be able to meet the real needs of families. These needs grow each day.  I urge strong support for this legislation. Again, I thank and commend my colleagues who have joined me in this effort: Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Feinstein, Inouye, and Murray, and encourage others to join us. I believe if we make this investment in quality child care, we will be making one of the most important investments we can make in the future of this country and in the individual future of families throughout the United States.  I thank my colleagues for joining me, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the legislation.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1475       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive      Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that      much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and      nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care      and education leads to increased cognitive abilities,      positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of      long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term      economic and social self-sufficiency.       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including      6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day      in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1      in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy      development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care      that threatens the safety and health of children.       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per      year.       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child      care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal      subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For      families with young children and a monthly income under      $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent      of their income.       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, the maximum the State      will reimburse a child care provider for the care of a child      who receives a subsidy, are too low to ensure that quality      care is accessible to all families.       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care      children get and whether families can find quality child care      in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates      force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower      the quality of care for children, including reducing number      of staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and      cutting enriching educational activities and services.       (7) Children in low quality child care are more likely to      have delayed reading and language skills, and display more      aggression toward other children and adults.       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child      care as child care providers are able to attract and retain      qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional      training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and      purchase basic supplies and developmentally appropriate      educational materials.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the      quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child      care payment rates.     SEC. 3.
