 President, the amendment I offer to the budget resolution would express the Senate's intention to give high priority to embassy security.  As was underscored by the tragic embassy bombings in East Africa last August, our embassies overseas are highly vulnerable to terrorist attack. Following the bombings, the Secretary of State ordered a worldwide review of the current security situation.  According to testimony provided by the Department of State to the Committee on Foreign Relations, over 80 percent of U.S. embassies and consulates have less than the required 100-foot setback from the street, and many missions are in desperate need of greater security improvements.  As required by law, the Secretary also convened ``Accountability Review Boards'' to examine the bombings.
