President, last May, I announced my intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the nomination of Deborah Majoras to be the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. I did so because despite several requests, I had received no assurance from Ms. Majoras that under her leadership, the FTC would take any steps to address anticompetitive practices that drive up gasoline prices nationwide and particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon consumers typically pay some of the highest gasoline prices in the Nation.  Today, I received a letter from Ms. Majoras describing how she is moving forward on certain commitments she made to me concerning the FTC's policies for the oil and gasoline industry.In particular, she committed to consult with outside experts to get to the bottom of the differences between the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the FTC on the impacts of the FTC oil merger policies on gasoline prices. Ms. Majoras' letter states that she is working to do this by conducting a public review of the GAO report on the Effects of Mergers and Market Concentration in the U.S. Petroleum Industry. Following that review, Ms. Majoras also promises to share her views with me on the GAO report.  Ms. Majoras' letter indicates she is making a good-faith effort to take a fresh look at the issues raised by the GAO report. In light of this and the other actions Ms. Majoras has initiated to get to the bottom of the reasons why consumers in my part of the country are paying such high gasoline prices, I will no longer object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up Ms. Majoras' nomination. I will, however, continue to closely monitor the FTC actions under Ms. Majoras' leadership to ensure gasoline consumers are not overpaying at the pump.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this statement along with Ms. Majoras' letter be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Federal Trade Commission,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2004.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden, In response to your recent inquiries, I      want to assure you that I am working to implement the actions      that I laid out in my letter of June 10, 2004. For example,      we are working on the public review by outside economic      experts of the findings in the GAO Report, Energy Markets:      Effects of Mergers and Market Concentration in the U.S.      Petroleum Industry and the criticisms of that report. As you      know, it is common for economists to submit their work for      peer review and discussion, and I believe that such an      assessment would be useful. Given your interest in the      report, I plan to share my views with you about the findings      and conclusions of this public discussion once we have      completed that process.       Here at the FTC, we are working at full throttle to protect      American consumers; I look forward to working cooperatively      with the Congress in the coming session on these efforts.           Sincerely,     Deborah Platt Majoras.                          ____________________
