Speaker, the Wall Street Journal reported this morning that by a margin of almost 2 to 1, American families are counting on President Clinton to veto the Gingrich budget plan. They know the Gingrich plan cuts Medicare too deeply. It hurts working families, and it cuts education and also cuts health care for the poor in this country. They want the President to reject it.  So how will Speaker Gingrich put pressure on President Clinton? He will try to shut down the Government. For the first time in our history, the first time in the history of the Nation, Speaker Gingrich wants the United States of America to default on its national debts. That is not only a disgrace, it is something that will hurt working families across America. It will raise interest rates, causing that mortgage payment to go up. It will mean in some instances people will not see their checks coming from the Government on time. That is disgraceful.  That is why I have introduced the no-budget, no-pay plan. Quite simply, if we follow the Gingrich idea, default, close down the Government, Members of Congress are not paid. Pretty simple, but I think Members of Congress will get the message.                          ____________________
