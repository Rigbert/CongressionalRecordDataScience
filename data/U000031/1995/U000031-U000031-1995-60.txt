Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, there have been many efforts made in this Chamber to try and balance the budget. I can well remember the Freeze Budget, the 1992 Group Budget, the Pork Busters, our good friend Tim Penny who led many bipartisan efforts, and I can remember Gramm-Rudman. Every one of these was to no avail.  Remember this button: ``108 in '88?'' That meant under Gramm-Rudman our deficit was going to be by law no greater than $108 billion in 1988.  Well, guess what? It was $187 billion, not $108 billion.  Promises, promises, promises, promises, and every one of them was broken.  It is time to keep our promise. The deficit today is over $200 billion, and it is as far as the eye can see $200 billion. In fact, by the turn of the century it is not going to be $200 billion, it is not going to be $300 billion. The OMB, the Office of Management and Budget is projecting over $400 billion.  I had a town meeting a couple of weeks ago and I had a very activist Democrat stand up and say:       Fred, I have been against the balanced budget before      because I did not think it would work. I thought we had laws      that made it work, but I've given up. When you get back to      Washington, please, please, please, for our children and for      our jobs, pass a balanced budget amendment.  It is time now to keep our promises. It is time to pass a balanced budget amendment, a constitutional one.
