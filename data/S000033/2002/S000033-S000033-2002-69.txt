 Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Last summer, I worked with my very good friend, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) on issues relating to the Export-Import Bank. In fact, we introduced a bill, H.R. 2517, that would have gone a very long way in protecting the taxpayers of this country from corporate welfare and in protecting American workers, and I want to thank the gentleman from Nebraska for his support of that effort. A markup was scheduled to take place on that bill but, out of nowhere, the markup was canceled, and my suspicion is that the moneyed interests who like the Export-Import Bank as it is right now sent down the word from on top that that markup never take place. What we have in front of us is an outrageous example of corporate welfare.  Mr. Speaker, my feeling is that the American people who, in many instances, are working longer hours for lower wages than was the case 20 or 30 years ago, many of whom have no health insurance, our seniors do not have prescription drugs, we face a housing crisis, a child care crisis; in the midst of all of this, people are saying, why are the taxpayers of this country providing huge subsidies and loans to the largest multinational corporations in the world who pay their CEOs huge salaries, give them huge benefits, and companies that take this money from the taxpayers say, thank you very much and, oh, by the way, we are laying you off because we are going to China and hiring somebody at 20 cents an hour.  I think the American people want us to protect their dollars. I think they want us to protect American workers.  What is so bad about saying to a corporation, if you want taxpayers' money, then you have to protect American jobs? What a radical idea. But it is an idea that has not yet come to the Export-Import Bank.  There are a number of reasons why we should vote ``no'' and send a message to the Export-Import Bank.  Number 1, major corporations take the money, lay off American workers, and run abroad.  Number 2, the Export-Import Bank, as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) indicated, has provided $673 million in financing to questionable Enron-related projects, projects, in some instances, that the taxpayers of this country may have to pick up the tab for.  Number 3, the Export-Import Bank is hurting steel workers. The Export-Import Bank has provided an $18 million loan to help a Chinese steel mill purchase equipment to modernize their plant. This Chinese company has been accused of illegally dumping steel into the U.S. According to the United Steel Workers of America, ``It is disgraceful that the U.S. Government is bankrolling Chinese steel production when U.S. steel companies are declaring bankruptcy and American workers are being laid off.''  Number 4, the Export-Import Bank is helping the Chinese military. The Export-Import Bank is subsidizing Boeing aircraft sales to the Chinese military. According to the President of Machinist Local 751, ``Boeing used to make tail sections for the 747s in Wichita, but they moved the work to a military factory in Xian, China. Is this Boeing's definition of free trade, to have American workers compete with Chinese labor making $50 a month under military discipline?''  Number 5, the Export-Import Bank is helping General Electric ship jobs to Mexico.  Number 6, the Export-Import Bank is helping AT ship jobs to China. And on and on and on it goes.  Mr. Speaker, in my view, if we keep the Export-Import Bank, we should have firm guarantees from the companies that receive the money that they are going to grow American jobs, they are going to hire more and more workers, not lay them off. In my view, a much larger percentage of money from the Export-Import Bank should go to the small business community, the people who are creating jobs in America, not to the big corporations who are sending our jobs abroad.  So, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the time is now to send a message to the Export-Import Bank who have, for so long, ignored the needs of the American taxpayer and have ignored the needs of American workers. Let us shut them down. Let them think. Give them some time to think. This is going to be a very good reflective time, contemplative time. They could take the time off, go home, meditate, and try to understand how they can represent American workers and American taxpayers, rather than just the multinational corporations.  So I urge a ``no'' vote. I will insert into the Record at this time a statement from the United States Business and Industry Council, which opposes the extension; a statement from the Cato Institute that opposes the extension; and a statement on behalf of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers representing 320,000 American workers who want to keep their jobs in this country.  The statements are as follows:         United States Business and Industry Council,                                                   April 29, 2002.Oppose The 30-Day Extension Of the Export-Import Bank--Require That It            Support Jobs and Industry in America, Not Overseas       On Tuesday, April 30, 2002, a 30-day extension of the      Export-Import Bank will be on the House Suspension Calendar.      On behalf of our domestic American member companies, we urge      that you vote against S. 2248.       The Export-Import Bank was created in 1934 to increase U.S.      jobs through exports. Today, the Export-Import Bank has      strayed from this mission. It is now providing billions of      dollars to multinational companies that are laying-off      hundreds of thousands of American workers and shipping their      jobs overseas.       By opposing the 30-day extension, you will be sending a      message to the Export-Import Bank that it should only support      companies and projects that increase jobs in the United      States.          Export-Import Bank's Top Clients Cut Their Workforce       Time Magazine reports the top 5 recipients of Ex-Im      subsidies over the past decade have reduced their workforce      by 38%--more than a third of a million jobs lost. These five      companies, which include giants Boeing and General Electric,      have received more than 60% of all Ex-Im subsidies.         The Export-Import Bank Has Helped Chinese Steelmakers       The Export-Import Bank has provided an $18 million loan to      help a Chinese steel mill purchase equipment to modernize      their plant. This Chinese company has been accused of      illegally dumping steel into the American market. The U.S.      government should not bankroll Chinese steel production when      U.S. steel companies are being forced into bankruptcy by      imports.         The Export-Import Bank Is Helping the Chinese Military       The Export-Import Bank is subsidizing Boeing aircraft sales      to China. Yet, Boeing has been increasing the amount of      aircraft production it does in China. It used to make tail      sections for the 737 in Wichita, but then moved the work to a      military factory in     Xian, China. Besides being questionable on commercial      grounds, such deals amount to the Ex-Im Bank subsidizing      Beijing's defense industry at a time when China's military      buildup threatens the stability of Asia.       These practices must end. Oppose the 30-day extension of      the Export-Import Bank.                                  ____                                           The Cato Institute,                                                   April 30, 2002.      Time To Retire the Export-Import Bank, Cato Study Concludes       Washington.--The House of Representatives faces a vote this      week on whether to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the      United States. A recent study published by the Cato      Institute, ``Rethinking the Export-Import Bank,'' finds that,      ``the Ex-Im Bank is a Great Depression-era agency that has      little relevance in a time of increasingly open and      sophisticated global markets.''       According to the study:       Generous export subsidies don't equal better export      performance. The United States exported roughly twice as much      in 2000 as it did in 1990. By comparison, Germany's exports      increased by 34%, Japan's by 66%, the U.K.'s by 51%, and      France's by 36%. Yet according to a 1997 GAO analysis of      official export support, the United States subsidized a much      smaller share of its exports than any of these other nations.      In addition, most (more than 80%) beneficiaries of Ex-Im      financing do not face subsidized competition.       Export subsidies don't increase net employment or      ``improve'' the trade balance. By overriding the market, the      Bank directs credit to less efficient uses, creating      distortions in the national economy, and imposing opportunity      costs that are higher than the added value of the Bank's      intervention.       It is neither fair nor constitutional that taxpayer dollars      are being used to support particular businesses, including      Enron, GE, and numerous other multibillion-dollar      beneficiaries. Indeed, in FY2000, the top 10 recipients of      the Bank's loans and long-term guarantees were large      corporations that got 86% of those services. Private credit      markets are far deeper and are more accessible than during      the Great Depression when the Bank was founded, and large      corporations should have no trouble financing creditworthy      projects.       ``Rethinking the Export-Import Bank'' can be found at      http://www.freetrade.org/pubs/briefs/tbp-015es.html.

U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Paper, Allied-     Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union      (PACE) and our 320,000 members I would like to express our      opposition of the bill to provide for a 30-day extension of      the Export-Import Bank. The bill will be on the Suspension      Calendar for Tuesday, April 30, 2002. We urge that you vote      against this legislation.       The Export-Import Bank was created in 1934, in the midst of      the Great Depression, to increase U.S. jobs through exports.      Unfortunately, the Export-Import Bank has reversed this      strategy and is now providing billions of dollars in      corporate welfare to large, multinational companies. In many      instances, the companies that receive Export-Import Bank      support are precisely the ones that are laying-off hundreds      of thousands of American workers and shipping those jobs      overseas to China and Mexico.       By opposing the 30-day extension, we will be sending a      message to the Export-Import Bank and its supporters: start      protecting American workers, stop financing Enron-related      projects, support our struggling steel industry, and only      support companies that are working hard to increase jobs in      the United States--not the ones that are exporting jobs. If      we are successful, the Export-Import Bank may have to close      its doors for one day. Hopefully, this 24-hour period will      enable the bank to consider changing its policies to help      American workers--not the multi-national companies that are      shipping jobs overseas.       Here are the top five reasons to oppose this bill:       1. The Export-Import Bank Provides Corporate Welfare To      Companies That Ship jobs Overseas.       On August 8, 1996, the director of the AFL-CIO task force      on trade said that: ``Ex-Im financing is corporate welfare      with a fig leave of U.S. jobs.''       According to Time Magazine, the top 5 recipients of Ex-Im      subsidies over the past decade which include Boeing and      General Electric have reduced their workforce by 38%--more      than a third of a million jobs down the drain. These same 5      companies have received more than 60 percent of all Export-     Import subsidies.       2. The Export-Import Bank Has Provided $673 million in      Financing to Questionable Enron-related projects.       Since 1994, the Export-Import Bank has provided $673      million in loans and loan guarantees for projects related to      the Enron Corporation leaving taxpayers exposed to $514      million. The Ex-Im Bank approved a $300 million loan for an      Enron-related project in India even though the World Bank      repeatedly refused to finance this project because it was      ``not economically viable.''       According to Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International,      Friends of the Earth and the Indian media, ``Enron      subsidiaries paid local law enforcement to suppress      opposition to its power plant in which they arbitrarily beat      and arrested dozens of villagers.''       3. The Export-Import Bank Is Hurting Steelworkers.       The Export-Import Bank has provided an $18 million loan to      help a Chinese steel mill purchase equipment to modernize      their plant. This Chinese company has been accused of      illegally dumping steel into the U.S. According to the United      Steelworkers of America, ``It's disgraceful that the U.S.      government is bankrolling Chinese steel production when U.S.      steel companies are declaring bankruptcy and American workers      are being laid-off.''       4. The Export-Import Bank Is Helping Boeing Ship Jobs to      China.       The Export-Import Bank is subsidizing Boeing aircraft sales      to China. According to the President of Machinists' Local      751: ``Boeing used to make tail sections for the 737 in      Wichita, but they moved the work to a military factory in      Xian, China. Is this Boeing's definition of free trade, to      have American workers compete with Chinese labor making $50 a      month under military discipline?''       5. The Export-Import Bank Is Helping General Electric Ship      Jobs to Mexico.       The Ex-Im Bank insured a $3-million loan to aid General      Electric build a factory where Mexican workers will make      parts for appliances to export back to the United States.      This project is responsible for the loss of 1,500 American      jobs in Bloomington, Indiana. Their jobs will now be      performed by Mexican workers who are making $2 per hour.       These practices must end. Oppose the 30-day extension of      the Export-Import Bank bill.           Sincerely,                                          Lowell ``Pete'' Strader.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
