President, the FDA asked for this knowledge and information. What am I asking them to disclose? The name of the product, the ingredients of it, and a copy of the label. If a Chinese manufacturer wants to sell a dietary supplement in Des Moines, IA, shouldn't they have to report to the FDA the name of the product and its ingredients? It is not required by law now. Let's give the FDA this extra information to keep Americans safe.
