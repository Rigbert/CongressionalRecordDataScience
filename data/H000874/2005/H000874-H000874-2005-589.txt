Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Before we conclude, I would like to ask a couple of questions. I understand the gentleman may not know the answers.  Our side, as you probably know, is very concerned about what transpired this week on the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act. We are very concerned because three Members on our side offered amendments. Those amendments were pretty straightforward, subject to, obviously, an up-or-down vote. They were allowed by the Committee on Rules. But the report of the Committee on the Judiciary starkly mischaracterized those amendments. As the gentleman knows, a motion has been filed on those. A ruling was not made in order as to whether or not that filing will be in order Tuesday or the next day. We raised this issue at the time of the consideration of the bill. We raised it again, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member on the Committee on the Judiciary raised it.  Has the gentleman had an opportunity to discuss this, and does the gentleman know whether or not there is a possibility or probability that what we believe to be egregious language that was substituted for astraight definition, which, by the way, the Committee on Rules did correctly, but which the Committee on the Judiciary did not, does the gentleman know whether that is being corrected?                              {time}  2045
