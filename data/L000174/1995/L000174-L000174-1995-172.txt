President, I rise as an original cosponsor and strong supporter of Senator Dorgan's bill, the ``American Jobs and Manufacturing Preservation Act.''  Mr. President, many people in Washington talk about cutting corporate welfare. But my colleague from North Dakota has actually written legislation that will cut corporate welfare by $1.5 billion over the next 5 years. I applaud his commitment to ending corporate welfare as we know it.  Over the years, big business and other special interests have lobbied hard for tax subsidies for specific industries. And, unfortunately, they have been successful on occasion. These wasteful special interest tax subsidies do not increase economic growth. To the contrary, wasteful special interest tax subsidies only add to our deficit, which puts a drag on our whole economy.  Like an old-fashioned pork sausage, it is amazing what is actually in our Internal Revenue Code. This bill repeals one of the most infamous examples of ``corporate pork'' in our tax laws today--the tax deferral on income of controlled foreign corporations .  Our tax laws allow U.S. firms to delay tax on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries until the profit is transferred to the United States Many U.S. multinational corporations naturally drag their feet when transferring profits back to their corporate headquarters to take advantage of this special tax break. But the millions of small business owners--who make up over 95 percent of businesses in my home State of Vermont--do not have the luxury of paying their taxes later by parking profits in a foreign subsidiary.  The American Jobs and Manufacturing Preservation Act closes this tax loophole by taking aim at past abuses. It would end the tax deferral where U.S. multinationals produce abroad and then ship those same products back to the United States As a result, the bill terminates the current tax incentive for corporations to ship jobs overseas.  The Progressive Policy Institute, a middle-of-the-road think tank, along with the liberal Center On Budget And Policy Priorities and the conservative Cato Institute, have all recommended that Congress repeal the tax deferral on income of controlled foreign corporations. Budget experts on the right, center, and left all agree that this tax deferral is a pork-barrel tax loophole just as wasteful as pork-barrel programs.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the American Jobs and Manufacturing Preservation Act.                           ____________________
