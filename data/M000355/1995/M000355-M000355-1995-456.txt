 President, I am just going to reclaim the floor very briefly, and then I am going to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Indiana.  The Senator from Minnesota cites no cases--because there are none--for the proposition that he suggests. I cited four or five. This is not in the gray area. This is clearly unconstitutional. The Senator argues that because of the perception problem, the rights of lobbyists should be taken away. My guess is there may be a perception that labor unions contribute to campaigns, too. Maybe we should take their rights away. Or others may think we ought not to have trial lawyers contribute to political campaigns and maybe we should take their rights away.  The Constitution does not make it possible to pick on people by taking rights away in legislation. This is not a close call, Mr. President. This is clearly, blatantly unconstitutional.  Mr. President, what time do I have remaining?
