President. I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Warner, and his ranking member, Senator Levin, for their endurance and patience.  This is an extremely important bill with many important issues. I say to the Senators, you have served the Senate well, both of you, in the manner you have handled this bill. Many of us with amendments that we consider of importance have stepped back, somebecause of events, such as the departure and the demise of President Reagan, and others because of other issues.  It is my understanding that there will not be a unanimous consent request tonight in terms of the order of business. I am not going to make one. I thank Senator Reid for acknowledging that I do have several amendments pending. I am anxious to call up the amendments. I will agree to time limits on debate so this will not go on for a lengthy period. I would just like to bring the matters to the floor for resolution.
