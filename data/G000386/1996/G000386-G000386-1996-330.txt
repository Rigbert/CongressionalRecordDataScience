 President, tomorrow morning at 9:15 a.m., the Senate will begin a series of rollcall votes on or in relation to the amendments to the budget resolution. That series of votes is expected to continue throughout the day in an attempt to complete action on the budget early Wednesday evening. All Senators are asked to remain in or around the Senate Chamber during Wednesday's session in order to facilitate the numerous votes. As a reminder, all votes following the first will be limited to 10 minutes in length.                          ____________________
