Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert extraneous matter at this point in the Record.  Chairman Archer of the Committee on Ways and Means and I had an understanding that arose as a result of my request to him that his committee forgo markup of H.R. 2854 that had been referred to the Ways and Means Committee as an additional referral. Chairman Archer agreed to this letter in writing and I requested that our exchange of letters be printed in the Record. I wish to comply with that request at this time.
