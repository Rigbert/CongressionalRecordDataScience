President, if the Senator from Vermont will yield, I might comment on that.  The Senator from Vermont and I have joined together in an awful lot of fights for our State and for our area during the past 21 years. And I think it is the one that I am most proud of and join with him in. He and I throughout those years, with our former colleague, Senator Stafford, joined to keep Amtrak going up in our area. He is absolutely right to praise them. I know he uses the train. It is not just a case of saying, ``I want it for others.'' He uses it as I do on occasion. This is something for which Amtrak deserves that credit.                          ____________________
