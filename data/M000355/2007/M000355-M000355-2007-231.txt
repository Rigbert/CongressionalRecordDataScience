 President, there is one thing I think virtually everybody in the room will agree with, and that is that we can't leave here without a bill signed into law by the President of the United States. There is only one of these proposals before us that he will sign. He indicated earlier today that he will only sign a bill that Admiral McConnell, whom we all profess to greatly respect, believes will get the job done, at least for the next 6 months. There is one proposal which does that, and only one.  So if we don't want to be back here tomorrow and next week still dealing with this problem--and I think we certainly agree we cannot leave town without addressing it--there is only one way to get a Presidential signature, and that is for the Bond-McConnell proposal, upon which we will vote in a moment, to get 60 votes. That is the only way to get the job done. There may be merit in both proposals, but that is not the way Admiral McConnell sees it. He enjoys widespread respect throughout this body. If we want to get the job done and get the President's signature, the Bond-McConnell proposal is the one that should be supported.  I yield the floor.
