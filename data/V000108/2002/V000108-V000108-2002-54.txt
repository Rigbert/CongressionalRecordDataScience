Speaker, it is with great sincerity and pride that I wish to honor the late Jim Knight of East Chicago, Indiana. His dedicated service to the City of East Chicago and to the entire Northwest Indiana community until his unfortunate death in May, 1998, has resulted in the city dedicating the new East Chicago Public Safety Building in his name. I had the privilege of knowing Jim for many years, and he was an inspiration to anyone who had the privilege to meet him.  Jim Knight was born in East Chicago on March 13, 1925 and spent his youth attending St. Mary's Elementary School and Catholic Central High School, which is now Bishop Noll Institute. After graduating from high school, Jim prepared himself for a future in the United States military by attending the U.S. Navy Sonar School in San Pedro, California. He continued his higher education by attending Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  After completing his studies, Jim served his country in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1945. His devoted service during World War II left Jim with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, so after the war he decided to re-enlist in the United States Army, where he actively served from 1949 to 1953, and then continued his military service in the reserves.  Although his experiences in the military took him to many places around the world, Jim Knight's heart was always in Northwest Indiana. He spent his time exploring many different occupations, including working as an ironworker for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, earning his real estate license, serving as a Lake County Deputy Sheriff, and finally as the East Chicago City Controller, a position he held from 1972 until his death in 1998.  Jim Knight dedicated his personal and professional life to making East Chicago and Northwest Indiana a better place. He developed a love for politics while lobbying for the Lake County Fraternal Order of Police. He was also involved with many professional associations, including the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, the Indiana Controllers' Association, the Lake County Convention and Visitor's Bureau, and the East Chicago Board of Public Works. Jim was also the President of the East Chicago Waterway Management District.  When he was not with his wife, June, their six children and twelve grandchildren, Jim spent much of his personal time as a member of various social clubs. He was the Past Exalted Ruler of East Chicago Elks Lodge #981, and was a member of the East Chicago Goodfellows Club, American Legion Post 369, and many others.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Jim Knight and commending the City of East Chicago for dedicating their new public safety building in the memory of an outstanding citizen of the East Chicago community. Jim devoted his time to improving the quality of life in his native city, as well as Northwest Indiana, and his legacy will continue for generations to come.                          ____________________
