I cited a specific example with Senator Hatch where we were able to make a real difference by working in a bipartisan way. It is making a difference in community health centers for their liability coverage. Is there any reason why efforts to come up with creative solutions that are bipartisan could not begin right now, rather than going this route that is going to polarize the Senate once again?
