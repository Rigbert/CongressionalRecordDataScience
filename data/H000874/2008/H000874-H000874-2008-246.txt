 On Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected, and I underline ``expected,'' in the House.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The final list of suspension bills will be announced, as is our practice, by the close of business tomorrow. We will consider legislation to address the housing crisis, including bills reported out of the Financial Services Committee regarding the Federal Housing Administration and H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. We also hope to consider the farm bill conference report.
