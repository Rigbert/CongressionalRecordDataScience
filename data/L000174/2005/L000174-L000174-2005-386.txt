President, I certainly want to extradict or bring back to America people who have committed crimes here. But I understand and I agree with the Bush administration, which is strongly opposed to this amendment. The administration letter says, in part, for example, Israel, in some cases, has refused to extradict its nationals. Jordan, with whom we have a treaty, has a court ruling that the treaty is not in force. The amendment does not take into account that the Government does not have treaties in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, and elsewhere.  Under this amendment, for example, a few years ago when a young man committed a heinous murder in Maryland--he had dual citizenship with Israel and fled to Israel--Israel would not send him back; in that case, we would have had to cut off all aid to Israel.  That may be what Senators want to do. I point that out. That is why the administration so strongly opposes the amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
