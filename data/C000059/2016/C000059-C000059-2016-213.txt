Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district, United States Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Louis F. ``Louie'' Cardin. Today we ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to our country.  SSG Cardin was from Temecula, California, where he graduated from Chaparral High School. He was the second youngest of seven siblings, siblings whom he looked up to and followed including following one brother into military service. Staff Sergeant Cardin is remembered fondly by family and friends, who knew him for his humor and love of family and life. He is survived by this parents and siblings.  SSG Cardin was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He was killed in action in Makhmur, Iraq on March 19, 2016. Staff Sergeant Cardin was 27 years old. He had an illustrious military career where he was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, three Afghanistan Campaign medals, an Iraq Campaign Medal, and three Sea Service Deployment ribbons.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Staff Sergeant Cardin, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The day the Cardin family learned of their son and brother's death was probably the hardest day they have ever faced and our thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for Staff Sergeant Cardin's sacrifice go out to them. There are no words or actions that can ease their grief. What words we can offer only begin to convey our deep respect and highest appreciation for the sacrifice Staff Sergeant Cardin made for our great nation. His sacrifice is forever etched in the history of freedom triumphing over oppression.  Staff Sergeant Cardin's family has given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and we hope they know that the goodness he brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
