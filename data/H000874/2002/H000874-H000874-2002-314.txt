Speaker, Dr. Martin Eichelberger is a Professor of Surgery and of Pediatrics at George Washington University and Director of Emergency Trauma and Burn Service at the Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, DC. He is also president and cofounder of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign, and a nationally recognized pediatric trauma surgeon.  The reason Dr. Eichelberger is so highly regarded became evident on Monday, October 7, when he was called out of a skin graft surgery to begin preparing for a 13-year-old shooting victim who was on his way to Children's Hospital from the Bowie Health Center. The boy had been shot by the Washington-area snipers in front of Benjamin Tasker Middle School, and the dozens of fragments from the sniper's bullet had done extensive and life-threatening damage to a number of the boy's vital organs.  Dr. Eichelberger and his team immediately began to make critical decisions about which organs could be saved, and which ones were beyond repair and needed to be removed. The right decisions were made, and the two and a half hour operation saved the boy's life. Although this brave young man faces a long and challenging road to recovery, I am pleased to report that he has been released from the hospital, and I am hopeful that he will in fact make a full recovery from his injuries.  Mr. Speaker, this 13-year-old young man is one of the countless youngsters who have been touched by the gifts of Mr. Eichelberger and whose lives have been saved or made better by his compassionate dedication to public service. The 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that ``Mankind owes to the child the best it has to give.'' I am proud to say that in Dr. Eichelberger, we have given Washington area youngsters the best we have.                          ____________________
