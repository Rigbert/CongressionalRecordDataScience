 President, I wish to brief my colleagues on Democratic gridlock in the Senate, and the only reason I feel comfortable using that word is that in 1993, I remember the headlines in the papers referred to ``Republican gridlock'' in the Senate when certain provisions and portions of President Clinton's program were not being acted upon, at least the way the newspapers believed they should be, in the Senate. It seems to me we have a similar situation now, but I do not see the newspapers writing about Democratic gridlock in the Senate.  I wish to address my colleagues on a few provisions on the Senate calendar that are not being enacted, and these are the ones which I feel some expertise in talking about because they come from the Senate Finance Committee and deal with the legislative tax agenda.  I am ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, and I am pleased to report that the committee has completed action on a number of bipartisan tax relief measures. The items I am going to discuss happen to have cleared the committee unanimously, which ought to say something about why they should be acted upon on the floor of the Senate, and I raise the question then: Why are they being held up?  I will refer to two of many pieces of legislation about which I could talk.  The first is a charitable tax reform bill known by the acronym CARE. By the way, this bill was introduced as a bipartisan bill. Senator Lieberman on the Democratic side and Senator Santorum on the Republican side worked closely with the White House because it is very high on the President's agenda.  The second item I am going to refer to is one that is Enron related.  Starting about a year ago, until about 3 months ago, Enron was voiced by everybody in the Senate as reason for doing certain actions--corporate governance, pension reform, 401(k) reform, et cetera. For some reason, we do not hear anything about it now, particularly from the other side of the aisle, because there is some legislation on the agenda that is Enron related that reforms the pension statute that would help protect future Enron employees from losing their retirement nest egg.  Again, both of these items--the charitable tax reform bill and the pension reform bill--were passed out of our committee unanimously. That is quite a reputation for a bill to have, considering how difficult it is to get even a majority view sometimes on the Senate Finance Committee.  I wish to briefly describe the merits of this legislation. The charitable tax reform act is part of the President's compassionate, conservative initiative. The CARE Act has been carried forward on a bipartisan basis under the very energetic leadership of Democratic Senator Lieberman and Republican Senator Santorum. Others, including our own leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, have pledged their efforts to pass this bill. The House passed this bill over a year ago, and did it on a bipartisan vote. Several months ago, the Senate Finance Committee reported this bill to the full Senate.  Most of the focus on the bill has been on provisions that reduce taxes. For instance, those who take the standard deduction--and that is about 70 percent of our taxpayers--will for the first time under this legislation be encouraged to contribute more to charities, and the incentive for doing that is the deductibility of these small contributions from their income taxes regardless of the fact that they take the standard deduction.  As we know, people who tend to take the standard deduction are in the middle or lower income tax brackets. So the key provision of this bill provides a broad-based tax benefit to lower income taxpayers.  This provision and others are obviously meant to, and will, enhance resources for charities to do their good work. This empowers people who are taxpayers to help charities, to empower the private sector of our economy to do more in humanitarian ways, and to have the resources to do what these organizations are already inclined to do.  Even though this is a tax reduction measure, because obviously there is some lost revenue when these deductions are taken, we have offsets in this bill so there is not a net reduction in revenue to the Federal Treasury. The Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis as well, decided this should be done so that it was not subject to a point of order requiring 60 votes, or that we would be fiscally irresponsible in putting this tax benefit for charities into the individual tax law.  I say to my fellow Senators, unlike a lot of spending legislation, the appropriations bills that have come before this body recently, this proposal does not add to the deficit. The Finance Committee found two important tax policy initiatives to offset this bill. All of these are related to corporate or individuals doing things to avoid taxes that may, in fact, be legal but are not necessarily moral or ethical. So we use these income-raising measures to offset the revenue loss in the Charitable Contribution Act.  The first offset shuts down what are called corporate expatriations, also known as inversions. Let me explain to my colleagues that what we are talking about is corporations that over a long period of time have paid their taxes into the Federal Treasury exactly the way they were intended to be paid but there has been a recent trend of some corporations setting up a shell corporation in a place such as Bermuda for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.  We do not have any problems with people using our tax laws the way they were intended to meet international competition, but we are very chagrined at the act of people setting up a shell corporation for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.  On the one hand, we have corporations that have traditionally abided by the laws and not tried to finesse those laws to their own benefit. They basically stayed here and they paid. Then on the other hand, there is the whole trend of corporate tax filings to avoid paying taxes. They basically have dashed from the country, and they have stashed the cash somewhere else to avoid taxation. That is what is called an inversion.  Passing the CARE Act will use the inversions as an offset so the money that would not be paid by corporations because they dashed and stashed the cash will still come to the Federal Treasury and will, in fact, offset revenue loss through the Charitable Tax Reform Act.  I started talking about these inversions in January. I made my intention very clear then, and ever since, to shut down shell corporations being set up in Bermuda for the sole purpose of avoiding legitimate taxation. For me, it is critical that we act on inversions before we shut down this place this fall. Now is our chance on the CARE Act.  We have people holding up this bill. They have to understand that they are responsible for holding up action on inversions. There are no two ways about it. They are not willing to shut down the immoral and unethical trend of corporate accounting by setting up shell corporations, going overseas to avoid taxation.  We have another important offset in this CARE Act. It is also an important bipartisan Finance Committee initiative. It deals with tax shelters. This bipartisan proposal--and it was drafted in concert with the Treasury Department--is a result of over 3 years of work. It is a result of careful consultation with key professional organizations such as the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Tax Executive Institute. This proposal was developed methodically and puts a premium on enhanced disclosures of tax shelter transactions. It also imposes tough penalties on those who undertake abusive tax shelter transactions.  So as in the case of inversions, those who are right now blocking the Senate, under this Democrat gridlock, from considering the CARE Act are also blocking action to shut down tax shelters.  I am pleased my colleagues on the Republican side are ready to proceed. Unfortunately, it is being blocked fromthe other side of the aisle. I am hopeful we will see cooperation from the Democratic side and get a chance to debate this bill, but time is running out. If we do not act on the Charitable Reform Act, called the CARE Act, including shelters being shut down and including expatriations from being stopped, it will be clear where responsibility lies. It lies with those who are blocking the bill now.  A second piece of tax legislation that is caught in this Democratic gridlock is the pension reform bill. The pension reform bill is because of Enron-like corporate mismanagement, corporate greed, corporate fraud, corporate felons doing what they should not be doing, and that is mismanaging the money entrusted to them by stockholders and bondholders.  What happens when there is this sort of corporate mismanagement? Thousands of Enron employees see their 401(k)s decimated. I know Enron is basically a Texas corporation, but there were 150 Enron employees in my State of Iowa who found that to have happened to their 401(k)s. How did it happen under their 401(k)s? Because under corporate laws there are corporate rules that do not allow a 401(k) holder to actually control their own account; for instance, having to be 55 years of age before someone can get rid of their stock or control their stock. Through this legislation, we want to protect people from Enron-like occurrences in the future. We do that through the legislation we call the pension reform bill, with the acronym NESTEG. That was considered by the Finance Committee over the spring and the summer subject to hundreds of hours of bipartisan staff discussion.  That is how we get bills out of the Senate Finance Committee, through consensus. Every Member of the committee and even Members not on the committee with interests in this issue had input. It took several weeks. The discussions bore fruit. The chairman's markup with some amendments passed out of committee without opposition. This was all as a result of Members of this body saying Enron problems had to be solved. A lot of the people on the other side of the aisle were trying to fault President Bush's administration. They have not succeeded in doing that.  That is intellectual dishonesty. If you look at a lot of the corporate mismanagement problems and follow the calendar back to when the first decisions were being made to do some of these things, they go well back into the Clinton administration.  Our constituents, my 150 Enron employees, do not care who is to blame--Clinton, Bush, or whether nobody is to blame--except the corporate mismanager. The point is, they expect us to do something about it. A lot of this discussion was started on the other side of the aisle that brought us where we are now. There does not seem to be any interest on the part of the Democrat majority moving the pension reform and 401(k) bills that are so necessary to make sure future Enron-decimated 401(k)'s do not occur.  I described how this bill was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee. There was another committee, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, known as the HELP Committee, chaired ably by Senator Kennedy, also working on some legislation in this direction. Chairman Kennedy took a little different route. He decided, for whatever reason, to refuse to engage Republicans on his committee, and the result was a raucous markup and a party-line vote. As I have said so many times, contrasting the work of the Senate Finance Committee, which was very bipartisan, from the work of the HELP Committee, which was more partisan, we cannot get anything done in a Senate that is divided 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 1 independent on a partisan plan. If you try to do that, the whole product is doomed. That was and is the fate of the HELP Committee bill on pension reform that came out of committee on a partisan vote.  I digress for a minute. We are all legislators. Our job is to legislate. It is our responsibility, especially in these times, to use our legislative resources to actually accomplish something for the American people. However, I am the ranking minority Member on the Senate Finance Committee. Republicans are in a minority in this bed. The Democratic leadership runs the Senate. Like a point guard in basketball or a quarterback in football, the Democratic leadership has the ball. They call the plays. Unfortunately, serious legislating is not a game. When the Democratic leadership puts legislating the people's business ahead of partisan interests, they will get a product out.  By the way, to be fair, that applies to Republican leadership, as well.  Two examples come to mind. One is the bipartisan tax relief legislation of last year. The Republican leadership cleared the way for the bipartisan Finance Committee package, cleared the floor, became law June 7, 2001.  Another example is the Sarbanes-Oxley corporation accountability bill. The Democratic leadership let Senators Sarbanes and Enzi craft a bipartisan compromise that cleared the Senate floor and became law.  On the other hand, if the Democratic leadership wants to score political points and send a bill into the Senate ditch, that is their choice. Do not work with the other side, do not recognize that 49 of 100 Members of the Senate; somehow they do not exist. Do not respect 100 Senators. Do not respect Republican input on issues at hand. Just try to program your caucus poll-driven agenda down the throats of 100 Members.  In the words of the distinguished majority leader, politicize it. The path is clear on pensions. The Democratic leadership is facing a fork in the road. The left fork is to play the partisan card. Pursuing that path means bringing up a bill that is designed to be controversial. It means bringing up a bill like the bill that came out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on a partisan vote. Then there is the right fork, bring up the Finance Committee bill, perhaps even with some bipartisan measures from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Frankly, Senators Baucus, Gregg, Kennedy, and myself made good progress. There is a bipartisan basis for proceeding. If the Democratic leadership follows this fork in the road, we can get a bill through the Senate, the very sort of thing people on the other side of the aisle have been clamoring for since last fall and for sure since January.  Where are we? The Enron bankruptcy occurred about a year ago. Enron employees' retirement accounts have been devastated. People across the country rightly demand action. Shortly after the new year, the President proposed a multipoint plan to reform retirement plans. I don't know how many times I have heard since the President made that statement last spring from the other side of the aisle that the White House needs to be engaged. The White House engaged the Congress is the way I look at it. I did not hear much talk about doing anything about pension retirement plans until after the President said we ought to be working on it. The House acted very quickly in April on pension reform. But the full Senate has not acted. We cannot send the President a bill until the Senate acts. Choosing a partisan course means the Senate has default. That is very regrettable.  Let me be clear. Republicans stand ready to work on this priority, and as we have already done, as indicated by the bill coming out of our committee on a unanimous vote, in a bipartisan manner, and even doing that in conjunction with committees that have tried to do the same thing in a partisan way.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a letter dated August 30 this year from the Finance Committee Republicans to Senator Daschle, on pension reform.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: We understand that you intend to bring      pension protection legislation to the floor soon after the      Senate reconvenes in September. As you know, both the Finance      Committee and the HELP Committee have produced differing      versions of pension protection legislation. Although both      committees have acted, only one committee has acted in a      bipartisan fashion and produced a bipartisan product: the      Finance Committee. The Finance Committee's bill, S. 1971, was      reported out unanimously. By     contrast, the HELP Committee reported a partisan product, S.      1992 on a party-line vote of 11-10.       We do not believe that a partisan approach is the way to      proceed on such important legislation that will affect the      retirement savings of tens of millions of Americans.       In the spirit of bipartisanship, therefore, we respectfully      request that you call up the Finance Committee bill to serve      as the underlying bill for the Senate's debate on American's      retirement security. This good-faith gesture would expedite      the Senate's action. Furthermore it would solve concerns due      to the limited scope of S. 1992, which was due to HELP      Committee's restricted jurisdiction in the retirement      security area.       Using the Finance reported bill would facilitate, not      preclude, the full Senate's involvement in the retirement      security debate. It would send an important signal of      bipartisanship to American workers and retirees who will be      keenly watching this debate and would reassure them that we      are working together in their best interests. And, as you      said in your press conference with Senator Kennedy, ``this      isn't about political points.'' We agree with you, Senator      Daschle. This shouldn't be about political points. It should      be about good public policy and good pension policy for all      Americans.           Sincerely,         Chuck Grassley, Don Nickles, Craig Thomas, Orrin Hatch,            Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Frank H. Murkowski, Phil Gramm,            Olympia Snowe.
