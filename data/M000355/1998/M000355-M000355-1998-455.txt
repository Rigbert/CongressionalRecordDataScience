  Let me read a short provision. This is from the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.       The term ``expenditure'' does not include a news story,      commentary, or editorial--which is what was happening on that      cable station--or editorial distributed for the facilities of      any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other      periodical, or publication unless such facilities are owned      or controlled by political party, or political committee, or      candidate.  So, I say to my friend from Kansas, to the extent that proposals like Snowe-Jeffords put groups in a position where they would have to disclose significant numbers of their membership and/or donors as a precondition for criticizing or expressing themselves in proximity to an election, the perfect outlet would be to go into the newspaper business.  I am not suggesting that we put restrictions on newspapers. I don't want to put restrictions on citizens, which is what this debate is all about today. But the first amendment applies to everybody, not just to the press. We get the impression reading the editorials on this issue across the country that the first amendment is the sole province of the press. In fact, the courts have been quite clear about this; it applies to all of us.  So I would say my friend has put his finger right here on a good way around this growing regulatory environment that is being proposed. Just go into the newspaper business and you are free of it all. You can go out and trash whomever you want. You are not going to have to be regulated by the FEC or anyone else. Have at it.  And my guess is there would be a proliferation of so-called newspapers under this.
