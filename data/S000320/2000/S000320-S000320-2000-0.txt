 President, I rise in tribute to a friend and colleague, Julian Dixon. Congressman Dixon honorably represented the 32nd District of California for more than 22 years. Julian and I were members of the Congressional Freshman Class of 1978. It was my pleasure to serve with him for more than two decades.  Everyone in the Senate knew him and I know no member of the House or Senate who did not like him, as well as respect him. His life exemplified public service and his actions were always motivated by truth, justice and compassion. He was without question a Distinguished Gentlemen.  During his tenure in office, Congressman Dixon accomplished many things. He was always magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat and accepted difficult assignments, such as the Chairmanship of the House Ethics Committee in 1989. It is a responsibility that few members seek and only the most selfless accept. Congressman Dixon did so, and the House of Representatives is a better place for his service.  From 1957 to 1960, he served as an enlisted man in the United States Army, rising to the rank of sergeant. This experience made him a life long advocate for the men and women in the Armed Forces. He understood their hardships and needs as well as any member of the Congress. The military services have lost a good friend.  At the conclusion of the Cold War, our defense expenditures were cut dramatically. Literally, hundreds of military installations, large and small, around the Nation were slated for closure. Thousands of small businesses depended entirely, or mostly on work generated by the defense industry, and they were in danger of failure.  In an effort to help these businesses, Congressman Dixon sponsored legislation to assist small businesses in making the difficult transition to new markets. His efforts saved innumerable small businesses from going under and now many are thriving because of his foresight and stewardship. Most recently he was the very able Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was a voice of reason and restraint in an arena that often lends itself to hyperbole and grandstanding. Julian served his country well in this capacity.  Congressman Dixon was known for his intelligence, political savvy and strong character. While Julian surely had much lift to accomplish, he truly made a difference while he walked among us. He was a family man and a man of the people. He will be missed. Our prayers are with his family, friends and people he served so well.                          ____________________
