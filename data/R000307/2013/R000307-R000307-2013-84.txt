President, I thank my dear friend and colleague more especially for highlighting what K State is all about, and that is family. If one chooses to attend Kansas State, as many do--many come from small town America, and many come from big cities, but I think they are all struck by the family atmosphere.  The thing I think is rather remarkable, even in having the privilege of talking to some of K State's football team and some of the athletes, both basketball and football--all sports at K State--I am always able to tell the thousands and thousands of fans from K State who know their history, know where they are coming from, and always support them regardless of the outcome. So K State is a family.  K State's legendary coach Bill Snyder, who has achieved miracles on the football field with team after team, always stresses family and togetherness and the proper role of athletics in education.  My son David went to K State, and he fell in love with K State. He didn't have much of a choice as far as I was concerned, but he did really enjoy himself at K State. Basically, I am struck by the fact that many of his friends who are graduates--when that day comes when you graduate or when you leave K State, those generations really stick together, and they are friends for life. It is in that vein that I think the Senator's remarks are certainly right on target.
