Chairman, there is a simple reason for voting against the Hutchinson substitute. A vote for it destroys the first and only bipartisan piece of campaign finance reform ever to be passed in this Chamber. It destroys the only bill that will close the soft money loophole. Should this bill pass, it will pull the rug out from under Shays-Meehan. We cannot let that happen. The Hutchinson substitute does not stop soft money from influencing our Federal elections. It only does half the job. While this amendment calls for a ban on Federal soft money, it does not stop State parties from spending soft money on Federal elections.  That is like bolting the front door to protect yourself from burglars while hanging a neon sign on the back door that says, ``Come on in.'' It is a shell game. You are only moving the soft money from the Federal parties to the State parties.  The American people deserve better. The substitute leaves in place the current loophole through which unlimited dollars are funneled into Federal elections through sham issue ads as well.  Please vote against the Hutchinson substitute. America must do better. Vote against the substitute.
