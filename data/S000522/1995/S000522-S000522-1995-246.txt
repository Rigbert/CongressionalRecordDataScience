Mr. Speaker, as I noted yesterday, Russia has now passed the hundredth day of its armed intervention in Chechnya. The brutality continues. Moscow gives soothing words about a cease-fire, but the shelling and the bombing continue unabated.  With this in mind, I would call attention to an open letter that I recently received, courtesy of the American Foreign Policy Council. This letter was written by three of the most prominent scientists currently living in the former Soviet Union. In this letter, A. Belavin, a physicist, and two mathematicians, V. Drinfeld and B. Feigin, characterize Moscow's actions as ``genocide and crimes against humanity'' and say, as I have maintained all along, that ``these actions cannot be considered merely an internal affair of Russia.'' I urge President Clinton and others in his administration to keep in mind the powerful message in this letter, and hope that it would be included in the President's briefing book for his upcoming trip to Moscow.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the full text of this letter be inserted in the Record at this time.       Dear Friend: We are compelled to write to you from the      feeling that terrible crimes committed by Russian authorities      and armed forces in Chechnya are not accidental, and that we      are all responsible for them. These crimes, according to the      testimony of journalists, human rights defenders, and mothers      of the soldiers fighting there, include not only the bombing      of towns and villages inhabited by civilians, but also the      capturing of hostages, robberies, [and] the organization of      filtration camps where people, incarcerated on the basis of      their race, and cruelly beaten, tortured, maimed and      murdered.       All these actions should be characterized as GENOCIDE and      crimes against humanity. They cannot be considered merely an      internal affair of Russia.       The Chechen crisis is not accidental. It reveals the      criminal essence of the political regime that is being formed      in Russia. The most dangerous aspect of the present situation      is the absence of a clear appreciation of this fact.       Instead, in the public opinion, especially in the West,      there still exists the myth that Russia is moving toward      democracy and reforms and, unless Yeltsin is supported,      fascists of the type of Zhirinovsky will take over.       We consider this opinion as deeply erroneous. Supporting      democracy and human rights by words, the regime is      persecuting them in a cynical and brutal way [sic]. Many      facts give evidence for this, such as beatings and killings      of honest journalists and human rights defenders who get and      publish information dangerous for the regime, the criminal      and corrupted methods of privatization, and many other      things. Now there is an attempt of annihilation of a whole      nation.       Acting by fascist methods, the regime uses Zhirinovsky and      the threat of fascism for manipulating public opinion.       Russia is not moving by the path of democracy and human      rights. A new regime, unusual in its cruelty and falsehood,      is being born. Whether the criminal regime or democracy with      a human face will take over in Russia, will, in the first      place, depend on people in Russia, our ability to understand      the danger and take responsibility, [and] our courage and      will to stand against evil.       However, the realization by people in the West of the true      state of affairs of Russia and the support of democracy, not      Yeltsin, are also crucial.       We ask your help in spreading our letter.     A. Belavin,     V. Drinfeld,     B. Feigin.                               ____________________
