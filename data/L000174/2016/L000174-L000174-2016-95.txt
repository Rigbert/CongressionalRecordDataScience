President, I would answer my friend and colleague from Vermont--especially, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I am well aware of this--that there was not one single hearing, not one single witness.  Unlike Vermont, with 50 hearings and 130 witnesses who expressed every single view, over 2 years of time and debate, we didn't have 2 minutes of debate and discussion. Vermont did 2 years.
