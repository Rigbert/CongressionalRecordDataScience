 President, I would like to start this morning by remembering another deadly shooting, one that hit very close to home for most of us.  It was 14 years ago today that Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson of the Capitol Police were shot dead in the line of duty right here in the Capitol by a lone gunman.
