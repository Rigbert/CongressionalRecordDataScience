 I would only say that it is not very often you get total agreement from all of the commanders in the field, all of the CINCs in the field, as well as all the chiefs. All four chiefs are on record right now saying this is absolutely necessary to have as part of our training.  One of the things I have been trying to do is to quantify in terms of American casualties when you go from low to high to very high risk--what that means. There is no question there is not one who will not say if we send our troops in there without this very valuable training that they can only get at the Vieques, it is going to be at a higher risk, which means American lives.  I certainly hope the people of Puerto Rico understand we are talking about their lives, too. So we should all be focused on the same thing.
