 President, first, I want to thank the Chairman for taking the time to discuss an issue that is very important to my colleagues, myself, and national security--the modernization our strategic airlift fleet.  In this year's Defense Appropriations report, there is a restriction on using procurement funds for avionics upgrades of the C-5As. The Report also appears to restrict the High Pressure Turbine Replacements. I do not believe that was the Committee's intent.
