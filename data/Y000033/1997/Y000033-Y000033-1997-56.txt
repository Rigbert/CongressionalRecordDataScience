Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, if the Vento amendment does what it says it does, it is not germane. It was written, so it does not really say anything.  I do not want it in the Record to say that we happen to agree that we have to enter, if you read in this section the term ``international agreement'' means any compact, executive agreement, conservation, bilateral agreement, or multilateral agreements between the United States or any agency of the United States, any foreign entity.  And I am suggesting, respectfully, that the attempt of the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Vento] is to preclude any type of activity under treaty, including the other treaties, such as NAFTA, and allowing other countries into our lands, as well we go into their lands.  So I adamantly oppose the amendment because all it is is including commercial, and I am suggesting, respectfully, it is written very cleverly, but if it does what he says it does, and I do not believe it is, it would have been nongermane and I would have made a point of order. But it does not do that.  So I, very frankly, urge a strong ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
