President, I am pleased to introduce the National Farm Animal Identification and Records Act or the FAIR Act, with my friend and colleague Senator Specter. This legislation would establish a uniform national electronic animal identification program to trace animals from birth to slaughter, within 48 hours, in order to combat animal disease outbreaks.  As the recent discovery of a cow infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, or mad cow disease, in Washington State demonstrated, a verifiable nationwide animal identification system is urgently needed to enhance the speed and accuracy of USDA's response to disease outbreaks. Unfortunately to date only, 23 of the 81 cows that came from Canada with the infected mad cow have been able to be located because of inadequate records. The National Farm Animal Identification and Records Act FAIR Act would require the Department of Agriculture to establish a national animal identification program for individual animals that could trace an animal's history within 48 hours.  As a senior member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, I have long advocated for the establishment of a national animal identification system. For the last 5 years I have worked with the Holstein Association in Brattleboro, Vermont to begin the process of creating a national animal identification program. The Holstein Association's pilot program, a precursor to this national animal identification program legislation, electronically identifies individual animals and tracks their movements from birth to slaughter within 48 hours. To date Holstein's pilot program has close to a million bovines enrolled from over 7000 farms in 42 States and has proven its electronic animal tracking capabilities.  The Holstein project demonstrates electronically tracing individual animals immediately is achievable. The technology and expertise developed by the Holstein Association is a prime example of how the Department could immediately begin tracking individual newborn animals electronically with a system similar to National FAIR. The Holstein Association could be an important partner with USDA in reducing the impact of future animal diseases.  I would also like to applaud Secretary Veneman's announcement last month of additional mad cow safeguards, including moving toward a national animal identification system. I believe this was a positive step toward protecting American farmers and consumers. Unfortunately USDA's current plans do not call for individual animal identification to be completed until mid 2006. The FAIR Act would require the Department to begin implementation of a national system within months of passage. In addition, it is clear USDA will need additional resources to carry out a national animal identification program, thus our legislation will provide additional funding for USDA to begin this work immediately. Furthermore to ensure producers are not hurt by the potential costs of a national system, our bill will provide financial assistance for producers to carry out a national identification system.  It is time for the United States to take serious steps to combat animal diseases, like BSE, that have broad public health implications for our Nation. A national animal identification program is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
