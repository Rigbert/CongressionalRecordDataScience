I appreciate the hard work of the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from Oregon on this important legislation.  I mentioned earlier the reservist pay amendment which I will be offering at some point on this legislation, but there is another amendment which I will be offering which I would like to alert the sponsors of so it comes as no surprise. It is our understanding that if there is a tax moratorium on Internet operations, which I would support with carefully defined circumstances, it will result in a substantial savings to telecommunications companies across the United States. I am going to be offering an amendment during the course of consideration of this bill which says that the savings to these companies shall be passed on to the consumers in America.  It strikes me that at a point in time when we are in a recession, when families are struggling, some facing unemployment, others trying to make ends meet, that if we are going to relieve this industry of substantial taxation, millions if not billions of dollars over time, the savings ought to go to families, the customers. I think that would be a good move on our part.  So if we want to talk about invigorating the economy, then why not reduce the telephone bill or the tax bill that a family faces on a monthly basis?
