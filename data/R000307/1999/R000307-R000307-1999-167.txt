Amendments are expected to that legislation, and therefore rollcall votes can be expected during tomorrow afternoon's session of the Senate. As always, Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to this legislation.  Members who intend to offer amendments to the juvenile justice bill are encouraged to work with the chairman and the ranking member to schedule a time to come to the floor to debate those amendments.                          ____________________
