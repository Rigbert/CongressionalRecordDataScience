Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. Alan VanderMeer on his retirement from the Plumbers Local Union 210. Alan has spent over 40 years dedicating his life to the interest of the Plumbers Union as well as his community in Northwest Indiana. There will be a celebration of his accomplishments on June 10, 2004 at the Plumbers Local Union 210 in Merrillville, IN.  Alan has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. After being initiated into Plumbers Local 130 in Illinois, Alan admirably served in the Armed Forces in 1962. He also served as an Apprentice for Plumbers Local 130 from 1960 to 1964, and in 1978 he transferred to Local 519 in Miami, FL.  Alan later demonstrated his loyalty by his outstanding service to Plumbers Local 307 in Hammond, IN. He transferred to Local 307 in 1980 and was appointed J.A.T.C. member in 1984. In July 1990, he was elected as Business Manager and he served as J.A.T.C. Chairman, Retirement Trustee Chairman, Welfare Trustee Chairman, Arbitration Board Chairman, Property Trustee Chairman, Local 307/433 Joint Organizing Trust Co-Chair, PAC Chairman, and Golf Committee Chairman. During the years 1991, 1996, and 2001 he was a Delegate to the United Association Convention. He is presently a Delegate to the Indiana State Pipe Trades, where he served as Vice President from 1990 to 2000.  Alan was initiated into Plumbers Local 210 in July 2000 and was appointed Business Agent. He currently serves as J.A.T.C. member, Retirement Fund Trustee, Welfare Fund Trustee, Vacation Fund Trustee, Market Recovery Fund Trustee, Arbitration Board Member, Property Fund Trustee, and Golf Committee Chairman.  While Alan has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members he has always found the time to serve his community as well. Since 1990 he has been the Chairman of Plumbers Local 307 and Local 210 Children's Christmas parties. Alan currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Lake County Contractors Licensing Board, the Hammond Urban Enterprise Association, and the Workforce Investment Board. He is a member of Pirates and the American Legion. Alan was also awarded the 2004 Sagamore of the Wabash by Governor Joe Kernan.  Mr. Speaker, Alan VanderMeer has given his time and efforts selflessly to the people of Northwest Indiana throughout his years of service. His family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. I sincerely wish Alan VanderMeer a long, happy, and productive retirement. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Mr. Alan VanderMeer for an outstanding career, not only with the Plumbers Union, but in service to his community as well.
