 President, I rise today in opposition to the Breaux amendment for a variety of reasons, but I will limit my remarks to the provision dealing with increased funding for mass transit security.  I commend the Senator from Louisiana for bringing attention to this important issue. While I believe that transit security is an issue deserving of increased investment, the approach taken in the amendment is not one that I can support at this time.  Existing Federal transit law already requires that a percentage of formula funds be used for safety and security needs. The Federal Transit Administration has made transit security a priority. FTA has already conducted assessments for the 33 largest systems and has provided a ``tool box'' to help systems develop their own individualized security programs. Further, FTA has developed and distributed a checklist of the most important measures that transit agencies should implement to ensure that their systems are as secure as possible. FTA has made it a priority to work with agencies to assist in implementation of those measures.  Mass transit is perhaps one of the most difficult modes of transportation to secure. By its very nature, transit must operate in an open environment in order to provide its customers with mobility and access. We need to carefully consider how we develop transit security measures to ensure that we do not risk stranding those who depend on transit for their day-to-day mobility needs.  As chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I am cognizant of the unique need for further analysis of transit security issues. As the committee reauthorizes the Federal transit program this Congress, we intend to make the issue of transit security a high priority.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Breaux amendment.
