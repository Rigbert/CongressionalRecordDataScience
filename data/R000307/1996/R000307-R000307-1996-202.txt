Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3562, a bill to authorize the State of Wisconsin to implement the demonstration project known as Wisconsin Works. Gov. Tommy Thompson is a recognized leader in the area of welfare reform. He, and other Governors across the United States, have worked diligently to improve the manner in which public assistance benefits are provided to our neediest citizens. However, they cannot do this without reducing the mandates of the Federal Government. Governor Thompson and other Governors need our help in getting relief from the heavy hand of Washington bureaucrats.  The Federal waiver process is time consuming and States are pressured to drop certain waiver requests, thereby changing the design of State reforms. That is why we are here today.  The bill before the House of Representatives today provides that relief to Wisconsin. The Federal waivers that are necessary to implement the Wisconsin Works Program are granted through this bill. The bill ensures that no additional cost will accrue to the Federal Government.  The Wisconsin Works Program offers its participants the opportunity to earn wages and to learn how to increase their value to employers. Wisconsin has been testing various methods of reforming the welfare system for several years. Its other demonstration projects include, Work Not Welfare, Work First, Children First, and Pay for Performance. The consistent theme throughout all of these projects, and incorporated in the Wisconsin Works Program, is the expectation of personal responsibility and the goal of independence and a promising future for welfare participants.  Governor Thompson's proposal for Wisconsin Works includes waivers applicable to the Food Stamp Program. As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, which has responsibility for the Food Stamp Program, I certainly appreciate the need for reform of this program.  The first hearing held when I became chairman of the Committee on Agriculture was on the Food Stamp Program. Our committee has developed a comprehensive reform of the program and it is incorporated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. This reform emphasizes work for able-bodied persons, promotes real jobs with incentives, allows States to harmonize welfare programs with the Food Stamp Program, and curbs trafficking and fraud with increased penalties.  The waivers to the Food Stamp Program incorporated in this bill provide Wisconsin the ability to match its program with the Food Stamp Program in the areas of certification, employment, and training programs and work requirements. Additionally, for those persons in the Wisconsin Works Program who also receive food stamps, food benefits will be provided in cash. The Wisconsin program includes a mandatory nutrition education program. Wisconsin believes that for its participants to become self-sufficient, they need to know how to budget for food purchases, without the parameters specified by the use of food coupons. Wisconsin estimates that approximately half of the families receiving food stamps will be provided cash instead of food stamps.  I am not generally in favor of substituting cash for food stamp benefits. One of the important tenets of our welfare reform proposal was that food stamps would remain as the safety net program during the transition of reforming welfare. Food is a basic need and must be available to low-income families.  I am encouraged the Wisconsin Works Program includes a mandatory nutrition education component so that families will receive education on how to budget funds to ensure good diets. In addition, the cash-out of food stamps is linked to a program with strong work requirements.  USDA, over the years, has approved several demonstration programs that issue cash instead of food stamps and almost half of the States operate some form of a cash-out program. As with those other programs, I intend to watch the Wisconsin program so that we will know that Federal dollars provided for food are indeed spent on food.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 3562 and the Wisconsin Works Program. The President has expressed support for the Wisconsin Works Program and Congressman Kleczka's substitute amendment, provided for in the rule, urges the administration to approve waivers necessary to allow Wisconsin to carry out its program.                          ____________________
