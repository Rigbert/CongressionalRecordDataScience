Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5454, to provide a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges in fiscal year 2007.  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost of Living Adjustment Act to give judges and Members of Congress and high-ranking executive branch officials automatic COLAs accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress amended the statute by enacting section 140 of Public Law 97-92, which requires specific congressional authorization to grant judges a COLA. The legislation we consider today is substantially similar to other cost-of-living increases for Federal judges approved in previous fiscal years.  Mr. Speaker, I believe in fairness, which is why I introduced this bill to ensure that Federal judges receive a COLA when other civil servants, including Members of Congress, receive theirs. I urge Members to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
