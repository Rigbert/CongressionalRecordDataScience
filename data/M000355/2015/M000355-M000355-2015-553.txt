 President, I wish to say a few words about the Protecting Affordable Coverage For Employees--or PACE--Act.  The PACE Act is smart legislation from my colleague, Senator Tim Scott, and my Kentucky colleague over in the House, Congressman Brett Guthrie, that will help protect small- and medium-sized businesses that provide health care to their employees. It would give States more flexibility to define what constitutes a small business for health insurance purposes so as to protect health benefits for workers, lower health premiums, and reduce costs for taxpayers.  So let me repeat that. The PACE Act is a smart health care bill aimed at protecting workers' benefits, lowering premiums, and reducing costs to taxpayers.  I hope colleagues will join me in applauding the bill's lead sponsors, our colleague, Senator Tim Scott, and his counterpart over in the House, Congressman Brett Guthrie, for their hard work in developing this very important proposal.
