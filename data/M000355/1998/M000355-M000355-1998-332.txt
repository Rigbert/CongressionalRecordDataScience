 President, I rise today to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of Dr. Vince Davis, who is retiring this spring after 27 years at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.  Since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1984, Vince and I have had occasion to discuss important issues of the day in foreign affairs, as well as the underlying trends and currents that shape and guide world events looming just over the horizon. I have never failed to find his views both penetrating and insightful, and have always appreciated his counsel over the years.  But now, Vince has decided to pursue new interests after nearly three decades of toiling in the academic vineyard, and so it's appropriate that we bid him adieu with fondness and with gratitude.  Thinking back over the span of his career, I believe Vince Davis's mark on Kentucky and the world has been and always will be the enormous store of labor and love he poured into the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce. It's clear to me that Vince's tireless and inspired stewardship of the program has fashioned the Patterson School into the glimmering jewel of excellence for which it is now justly famous. Vince has given his all to the School, and two generations of bright young students have been immeasurably enriched by his exertions.  Mr. President, there is an old Irish proverb that says, ``The work praises the man.'' In that spirit, each time I think of the Patterson School, I will remember Vince Davis, for the Patterson School is his work, and we all should praise that which he leaves as his legacy.  Mr. President, I also ask that an article from the Lexington Herald Leader of Sunday, April 19, 1998, be printed in the Record.  The article follows:            Teacher Praised for Years at UK Diplomacy School                          (By Holly E. Stepp)       For years, the University of Kentucky's Patterson School of      Diplomacy and International Commerce has urged the state's      residents--from the business community to average Joes--to      think globally.       And one of the leaders behind that charge was retiring      professor and former director Vincent Davis.       Last night, Davis, the Patterson Chair professor, was      honored for his dedication to that mission during a black-tie      dinner at Lexington's Wyndham Garden Hotel. More than 200      alumni and friends of the 39-year-old-school came out to      celebrate Davis' commitment to the program.       His retirement becomes effective at the end of this      semester.       ``With Vince's retirement, not just the Patterson School,      but the University of Kentucky, loses one of their academic      giants of the past half century,'' said current director John      D. Stempel.       Davis, 67, was the school's second director for 22 years      after an active and reserve career in the U.S. Navy. He      receives much of the credit for building the school's      prestige as a world-class international relations program.       ``Patterson School has a unique combination of superior      foreign-affairs training and related community outreach,''      said David D. Newsom, former ambassador and adviser to the      Patterson School. Newsom, who was undersecretary of state      during the Carter administration, was the featured speaker.       Although the Patterson School was founded in 1959, it was      the brainchild of UK's first president, James K. Patterson,      who served from 1878 to 1910.       Patterson died in 1922 at the age of 89. In his will, he      ordered that his estate's assets go to the university for the      creation of such a school, with the proceeds invested for a      prolonged period before UK could gain the money.       The school, Patterson also ordered, should be named in      honor of William Andrew Patterson, his son.       Davis worked to build the program into one nationally known      for the quality of its graduates. Although enrollment is      limited to 25 to 30 students, the Patterson School is often      compared to similar but larger programs at prestigious      universities, such as Harvard and Princeton.       Current and past students of the school praised Davis as an      interested mentor with a quick wit.       Davis, himself, didn't dwell on the accolades bestowed on      him, including a $100,000 endowed trust to support Patterson      students' internships.       ``All I have done is to work to carry on the great      tradition started by my predecessors,'' Davis said.       On his retirement, he said he got a hint from a former      student a couple of months ago that it was time to retire.       ``When your former graduate students start to retire,      perhaps it's wise to consider joining them.''                          ____________________
