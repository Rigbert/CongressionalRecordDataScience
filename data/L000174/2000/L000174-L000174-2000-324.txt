President, while the Senator from Arizona is still on the floor, I was going to say at the beginning of my remarks, the Vermont press showed very clearly how well respected the Senator from Arizona is in Vermont and how well received he was. He was one of the biggest vote getters our State has ever had. He did an extremely good job. He won his party's primary overwhelmingly. In Vermont his victory was declared within, I think, 5 minutes after the polls closed on primary day because the number was so overwhelming.  I say this because, while I was not at the convention where he spoke, as he can imagine--it was the Republican State convention--many of my dear friends and supporters were there. They told me also how much they respected what the Senator from Arizona said, as they had when he had been in Burlington earlier in his campaign and spoke to an overflow crowd. Montpelier is where I was born, so I always watch what happens there. I say to my friend from Arizona, the calls and e-mails I got after his appearance about him were all positive.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.                      Nomination of Timothy B. Dyk
