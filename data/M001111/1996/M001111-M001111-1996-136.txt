 President, I rise today to remind all of my colleagues that one of the most important amendments that we are considering tomorrow is the Kerry-Murray amendment that adds $56 billion to function 500. That is the function in the budget that covers education and the investment in our young people.  I wanted to rise today to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record articles from the Seattle PI that did a survey that shows the No. 1 issue in my home State is education. I believe this is replicated around the country. In fact, USA Today had a poll recently that said this is the No. 1 issue to voters.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 20, 1996]              Daily Worries Concern Voters Most, Poll Says                 schools, jobs overshadow other issues                            (By Neil Modie)       Meat-and-potatoes concerns--taxes, jobs and the economy--     loom large in the minds of Washington voters as they look      toward this fall's elections. As a single issue, however,      education tops them all.       A new poll, the Mood of Washington, shows the electorate      cares far less about the hot-potato issues--abortion, gun      control, gay rights--that apparently heat up political party      caucuses, TV screens and news pages more than they do the      voting booths.       Most voters polled said they feel less safe than they did      four years ago. They think the public school system is      declining and feel they must struggle harder to maintain      their standards of living.       When family and pocketbook issues preoccupy people, they      show little interest in the hot-button topics, observed Bruce      Pinkleton, a public opinion researcher at Washington State      University.       ``When people are concerned about job security and other,      related issues, then some of the other (more emotional)      issues become less central to their decision making,'' said      Pinkleton; who conducted the poll along with Joey Reagan, a      fellow researcher who also works at WSU.       Surveyors polled 556 of the state's registered voters      between April 24-30 in a collaborative project by The      Associated Press     and 12 state newspapers, including the Post-Intelligencer,      the Olympian, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Herald in Everett      and the Sun in Bremerton.       Worry about the state of public schools is widespread.      Nearly six in 10 voters polled believe public education is      worse than it was four years ago. And a slightly higher      number agreed that the education in Washington is      underfunded.       I think education should get a better slice of the budget      pie and I would be willing to pay more taxes (to pay for      it),'' Judith Jenkins Harlin, a poll respondent from Redmond,      said in a interview. She is a homemaker, mother and school      volunteer who has been trained as a teacher.       Cricket Hamilton, an Olympia search-and-rescue officer,      also thinks schools are in trouble but is unwilling to pay      more taxes to let educators spend more money.       ``Definitely not,'' Hamilton said. ``reading, writing, and      arithmetic has to be brought back, not pottery.''       Pinkleton, the researcher, observed: ``A lot of people feel      that education is underfunded, a big majority, and yet people      aren't terribly excited about paying more taxes, either. So      we kind of want to have our cake and eat it, too.''       The poll didn't specifically ask voters whether they would      be wiling to pay higher taxes to support education. But it      did affirm Washingtonians' long-standing opposition to a      state income tax.       Asked if they ``would support a state-income tax if state      taxes would be cut in other areas,'' 56 percent said no.      Barely more than one-third replied favorably. The rest had no      opinion.       When asked how important they consider education in      deciding which candidate to vote for, nearly nine voters in      10 ranked important by more than three-fourths of the votes.      Then came welfare reform, the candidate's moral character, a      candidate's ability to work with political opponents, the      environment, and illegal immigration, in that order, with      each rated important by more than half those polled.       At the bottom were gun control, important to barely half      the voters; abortion, mentioned by two out of five, and gay      rights, cited by just over one-fourth of those polled. The      voters weren't asked on which side of those issues they      stood.       When the voters were asked, without mention of any specific      issue, to identify the most important concerns in this fall's      gubernatorial election, education again was the most-often      mentioned single concern, even above such perennial worries      as the economy, taxes and crime.       However, although 125 voters named education, even more--     191--said, ``I don't know.''       That surprised Pinkleton.       ``Clearly, issues are still developing in the minds of the      voters. . . . It's still fairly early (in the campaign      season),'' the researcher observed.       After education, mention of other issues dropped off      steeply. Ranked below education, in order of the number of      times they were mentioned, were taxes, environment and      conservation, crime and law enforcement state spending and      the budget, the economy, health care and unemployment and      jobs.       Other issues, including welfare reform, moral issues, gay      rights and prayer ranked far lower. None of the 556 voters      mentioned such volatile topics as abortion or gun rights.       The responses suggested that voters trust their state      government more than they trust their fellow citizens.       Asked whether they agree that ``voters usually make      informed voting decisions,'' only 43 percent did. But 53      percent said they trust state government to ``side with the      public interest'' in deciding between public interest and      special interests.       The poll showed plenty of worry across a range of social      ills.       Asked whether they agreed with the broad statement that      ``deteriorating social values are responsible for today's      crime problem,'' nearly eight in 10 said they did.       One who emphatically agreed was Vern Dollar, 52, a      Vancouver resident, who declared: ``Our social values have      decreased. All the neighbors knew one another when we moved      in here 28 years ago, and I don't know the new ones who move      in. . . . There's an influx of California people and they      aren't very sociable, Good neighbors help neighbors.''       Despite the worry about declining social values, one      finding of the poll might surprise Washingtonians aware of      the Pacific Northwest's long-held reputation--bemoaned by the      Rev. Billy Graham, among others--as something of a religious      wasteland.       Asked whether they agreed with the statement that      ``religious values play a role in my everyday      decisions,''nearly two voters out of three did agree.       Religion plays the strongest role in the lives of the      oldest voters, with more than seven out of 10 of those age 62      and older saying it did. But nearly six in 10 voters in the      least religious age group, those 18 to 39, said religious      values were part of their lives.       Conservative voters were most apt to say religion is part      of their lives, and the most liberal voters were the least      likely.       The poll revealed deep concerns across a broad topical      spectrum. For example:                                 crime       Nearly two out of three agreed they feel less safe then      four years ago, and nearly four in five favor stronger      penalties for criminals.       That tough stance applied to youthful criminals, too. Asked      whether they agreed with the statement that ``criminals under      18 should be exempt from the death penalty,'' six in 10      disagreed. Even a majority of voters who identified      themselves as politically ``liberal'' disagreed that      criminals under 18 should be exempt. However, four-fifths of      voters labeling themselves ``very liberal'' said criminals      that young should be exempt.       Men were less in favor of exempting criminals from the      death penalty than women were, with 72 percent of men      opposing that exemption while only 53 percent of women did.       ``Even the death penalty is kind of a joke; it takes years      and years,'' remarked Trina Henifin, 22, a Bellingham      resident who was polled. ``How did they (carry out the death      penalty) way back before there was the appeals system? Do it      right away like they did in the old days.''       Asked whether ``state government should spend more money      building prisons,'' 57 percent disagreed.                            economy and jobs       Nearly one in four of those surveyed said they were      concerned about losing their jobs. The worry was highest      among people with less than a high school degree.       A majority of voters disagreed with the statement that if      they lost their jobs, it would be easy to find jobs with      similar pay. The least educated were most likely to be      pessimistic.       And more than three voters in four agreed with the      statement that they have to work harder today to maintain      their standard of living than they did four years ago.       ``The cost of living is higher, the cost of gas,      electricity has gone, up, food too,'' said Gerald Barnett, a      Spokane-area machinist and father of two, who first      registered to vote last year. ``I work overtime, and that      helps, but the more you make, the more they take out in      taxes.''                           health and welfare       Asked whether they agreed that limits should be imposed on      the length of time welfare recipients can receive state      assistance more than eight voters in 10 said they did. And      three-fourths agreed that ``welfare recipients should be      forced to work'' if they receive assistance.       Without being asked specifically whether state government      should pay for health care, just under three-fourths of the      voters agreed that ``state make sure that health care is      available to everyone.''             environment, property rights and other issues       Washingtonians were lukewarm about environmental issues in      their responses to several queries on the subject.       A plurality, 48 percent, disagreed with a statement that      ``protecting the environment is more important than      protecting jobs''--a choice that most conservationists argue      society needn't make--while just under one-third agreed. The      rest didn't answer. And a majority of the voters disagreed      with a statement that ``government agencies do an acceptable      job of balancing land use with environmental protection.''       A plurality, 49 percent, agreed that ``public money should      be used to pay people when the government restricts how they      use their land,'' while 39 percent disagreed.       Only one-third of the voters agreed that the state is more      racially divided than it was four years ago while nearly half      disagreed. More nonwhites than whites--but still less than a      majority--believe the state is more divided.       A clear majority of voters, 58 percent, said ``acceptance      of homosexuals or bisexuals'' should be taught in the public      schools.''       But support for the teaching of other values was much      higher: more than nine voters in 10 favor teaching      ``acceptance of people who hold different beliefs'' and      teaching ``moral courage;'' nearly as many want      ``responsibility to prevent unwanted pregnancy'' taught, and      nearly three-fourths support teaching ``sexual abstinence      outside marriage.''       Many voters seem to yearn for the values they grew up with,      values they see as eroded today.                           *   *   *   *   *                                                                    ____          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 20, 1996]               Education Rated No. 1 of All State Issues                            (By Neil Modie)       The Mood of Washington poll confirms what the state's 1996      political candidates already seem well aware of: Voters are      plenty worried about public education.       ``There's just a whole different intensity about the issue      this year,'' observed Terry Bergeson, executive director of      the state Commission on Student Learning and a candidate for      superintendent of public instruction.       So far in the still-early campaign for governor, most of      the 10 major candidates--four Democrats and six Republicans--     have been talking more about education than anything else,      even such tried-and-true issues as the economy, taxes and      crime.       That's logical, since public education, including colleges      and universities, accounts for nearly 60 percent of the state      general fund budget.       And candidates who survive the primary will be sharing the      general election ballot with two controversial education-     related initiatives dealing with school vouchers and charter      schools.       Whatever the reasons, some of the candidates' and political      parties' own polls are showing deep concern about the state's      school system, more so than in past years.       In the Mood of Washington poll, 88 percent said education      was important to them in deciding who to vote for, and four      of every five in that group said it was ``very important.''      No other issue rated such a response in the survey.       ``That's amazing. That's the highest I've ever seen'' in      any poll, Bergeson said.       The poll was a collaborative project by The Associated      Press and 12 state newspapers, including the Post-     Intelligencer, the Olympian, the Tacoma News Tribune, the      Herald in Everett and the Sun in Bremerton.       Nearly three in five voters polled said the quality of      public education is worse today than it was four years ago.      That view was strongest among the youngest and least educated      voters--those in the 18-to-39 age group and with less than a      high school education--as well as among the most politically      conservative voters.       Slightly more than three out of five voters, and especially      the youngest and the most politically liberal voters, said      education is underfunded.       When voters were asked to name the most important issues in      the gubernatorial election, education was mentioned most      often--by a long shot.       Cheryl Causey, 49, a Mercer Island mother and a student in      interior design, thinks schools have improved ``in the area      of critical thinking skills rather than just role learning.''       But she is concerned about a lack of classroom discipline      and ``a basic `dumbing down' in some areas. I've read some of      the textbooks used by my daughter and have found that some of      the language used isn't very challenging. It plays down to a      lesser intelligence and doesn't encourage the kids to really      think and go beyond.''       Verna Kloehn, 73, a retired barber and Kennewick resident,      thinks kids nowadays are ``damn dumb. They can't assimilate      knowledge worth a darn.''       Voters' concerns about public schools had to do not only      with the quality of education, but also crime and violence.       And that was a worry expressed not only in urban areas, but      in smaller communities as well.       ``We need more teachers, more guards,'' said Trina Henifin,      22, a Bellingham resident, ``I think it's terrible you have      to have guards in schools, but you do.''       Bergeson, who directs a commission created to develop      statewide academic standards, surmised that voters might      think schools are worse than they were four years ago because      ``people are seeing more in the news about violence in      schools, about weapons.''       ``It doesn't have so much to do with education'' as with      safety, she said.       Bruce Pinkleton, one of two Washington State University      researchers who conducted the Mood of Washington poll,      suggested the concern about education might stem largely from      the public's tendency ``to look to the educational system to      rectify the ills of society.''       Judith Jenkins Harlin, a Redmond ``stay-at-home mom'' and      school volunteer, agrees.       ``I think public education has been asked to do too much,      and public education doesn't turn anyone away,'' said Harlin,      who is trained as a teacher. ``Teachers in public education      are trying to be mother, father, social worker, teacher,      legal enforcer--we are asking teachers to do too much.''
