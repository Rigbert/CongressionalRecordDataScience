Let me repeat that. We have never lost an investor dispute case and have never paid a dime in penalties. Here is our record: 17 cases, 17 victories.  These provisions are about raising the world to our economy's level of safety for investment. Without these protections, our small businesses with investments abroad will have nowhere to turn if a corrupt government steals a factory or a crooked judge targets them unfairly.  Each of our States has businesses that started in a garage, grew up, and looked abroad for new chances to expand. Let's make the world safer for the American brand.  I urge rejection of this amendment.
