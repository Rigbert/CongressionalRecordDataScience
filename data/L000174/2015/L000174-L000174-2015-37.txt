President, I have had the privilege of serving with several hundred Senators in this body over the years I have been here, and Senator Grassley has been a very special friend during that time. He has represented the voices of Iowans for nearly three and a half decades. I think we have been friends for that three and a half decades.  When I think of Senator Grassley--12,000 votes, hundreds of hearings, countless tweets, and probably four dozen sweater vests later--he is the same down to earth Iowa farmer who visits every one of the State's 99 counties every year. He is also the Iowa farmer who, when Vermont was hit with terrible flooding a few years back, was the first person to contact me to say, ``Vermont stood with Iowa when we were hit with a natural disaster. Iowa now stands with Vermont.''  He and I have worked together, and we have had a productive relationship that spans those decades. On the Judiciary Committee, we take our leadership responsibilities seriously. We have both made sure that, both as chairman and ranking members, that every Senator has a chance to be heard. We have found ways to come together on meaningful legislation. We enjoy each other's company. We are able to kid eachother, as I did on his recent birthday. But more importantly, we do what I was told to do when I first came to the Senate, and I am sure what Senator Grassley was told when he did--we keep our word. We have always kept our word to each other.  It also helps that we both married above ourselves. His wonderful wife, Barbara, and my wife, Marcelle, are very close friends.
