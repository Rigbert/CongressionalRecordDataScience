Speaker, I rise tonight on the topic of jobs in America and the trade deficit, an issue which, after 10 years of very hard work, has finally made it into the headlines during this Presidential primary season, and it could not have come too soon.  Last week, in our local newspaper, the Toledo Blade, one of the headlines read, ``Trade Deficit Highest in 7 Years.'' In fact, last year, 1995, the amount of imports coming into this country versus exports going out ballooned to over $111 billion, the worst performance of this economy since 1987, and, in fact, last year's goods deficit, that means the part of the trade deficit that deals with hard merchandise, grew to $175 billion, an increase of over 5 percent from the prior year. That means we are digging ourselves deeper in the hole.  Trade deficits like these have turned our country from being the largest creditor in the world, that means that people borrowed from us, rather we have become the largest debtor nation in the world, importing much more than we export and having to monetize, pay for those imports with our hard-earned dollars. Is it any surprise that the kind of lingering trade deficit has served to act as a downward push on wages in this country, contributing as well to the loss of millions of jobs across our country as we see not just low-skilled jobs but high-skilled jobs moving abroad and a general decline in our own living standards?  And if you think about that for a second, with interest rates even at the level that they are today, is it not harder for you to afford a car than it was for your parents? That is because goods cost more here now.  I just want to show you a chart, I will put it up here, which in the red, which is the part I want to reference here, shows what has been happening for the last 20 years in our country. We have not had a year where we have had more exports going out of our country than imports coming in here. In fact it has been getting worse and worse. Last year, 1995, will be worse than the year of 1994. In fact, if you look at our entire balance of payments, the measure of all of the inflows and outflows of capital, goods and services to and from our country, our position has been deteriorating, as this chart indicates, since the 1970's, largely as a result of a lack of domestic savings and investment here at home, but more important, the rising penetration of foreign imports into this country and the literal displacement of jobs in our country.  I cannot tell you how many Members have come up to me on this floor since NAFTA's passage, which we fought so hard against. They said, ``Marcy, we lost 3,000 jobs in northern Alabama. We have lost 2,000 jobs in east Tennessee. We have lost 14,000 jobs in Florida,'' and the automotive parts companies of my State of Ohio, 1,000 jobs gone already just as a result of that one trade agreement and as well as the lack of access we have into other closed markets in the world.  Much attention has been put on the impact of a long-term budget deficit in our country, and that is important. However, very little has been said about this structural trade deficit, the other pillar of the twin deficits on which our economic house and our futures stand. And I am very happy this has become a Presidential issue. It is being talked about in the Republican Party. It is being talked about in the Democratic Party.  I guess it just goes to show that when you run for President, probably the most important power you have is to focus attention on something important.  The trends are not encouraging. Since 1990, even though we cut our budget deficit by 23 percent and further cuts are expected in the coming years, our trade deficit has grown by 54 percent. At this rate, the trade deficit will overtake the budget deficit within the next 2 years, and, in fact, it already has.  The same logic that is used to support cutting the budget deficit could be equally applied to the argument for cutting this trade deficit. Any borrower or buyer of a foreign good knows that debt has a price. The U.S. trade deficit technically represents a liability on our national balance sheet, a loan from a foreign seller or creditor that must be financed.  As noted economist Wynne Godley has stated, the main causes for concern are the financial constraints that occur when countries become heavily indebted and the loss of national income that results from rising interest payments.  In the past, even though you may go and buy a car and it may come from another country, you purchase it with your credit card, when you make those interest payments, those go to the foreign manufacturer. This is what I talk about when I say monetizing that debt.  In the past, increased flows of foreign investments into our country as well as their purchases of our securities, our Treasury bills, were necessary to pay for our trade deficit. Now the willingness and capability of these foreign creditors, especially Japan, to continue these investments and purchases is on the wane. As foreign direct investment and purchases of our securities decrease, the United States will still need to attract foreign capital to pay for this deficit.  If the trade deficit remains at the same level, by the year 2010 we will be paying the equivalent of 2.5 percent of the entire amount of goods and services produced in this country and interest payments and capital outflows to foreign countries.  Now, the 2.5 might not sound like a lot, but it represents the amount by which this economy is growing. It isnot enough to catapult us into the high standard of living we would hope for our people.  Only with the goal of cutting our exploding trade deficit and making sure it remains a part of the Presidential race this year will we be able to cure the other part of the twin deficit that is causing the downward pressure on wages and living standards in this country.                          ____________________
