 President, yesterday dozens of Republican Senators came to the Senate floor one after the other to register their complete frustration with the way Democrats are running this place. Never before--never--has a President and a majority party in the Senate done so little to address challenges as great as the ones our Nation faces right now--never.  I mean, we have a $16 trillion debt and they haven't bothered to put together a budget in 3 years.
