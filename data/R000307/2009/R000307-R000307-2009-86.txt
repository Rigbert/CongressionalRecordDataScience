I thank the leader for raising the subject.  I rise today to speak about Guantanamo Bay, but I wish to point out that I am speaking about a Guantanamo Bay that some of my colleagues and some citizens of our great country might not recognize.  Obviously, the Guantanamo Bay I am speaking of houses ``terrorists.'' I have been there, and there are terrorists at Gitmo. I have seen them. As a matter of fact, I have seen interrogation procedures with the terrorists.
