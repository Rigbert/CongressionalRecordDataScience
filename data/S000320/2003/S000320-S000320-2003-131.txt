 President, I rise today in honor of Dr. Betsy (Dawson) Rogers, a teacher from Leeds, AL. On April 30, 2003, in the Rose Garden at the White House, President George W. Bush presented Dr. Rogers with the esteemed National Teacher of the Year award. Dr. Rogers was selected for this honor from among the best teachers in the Nation based on her compassion for the children she teaches.  Dr. Rogers, a teacher of first and second grade students at Leeds Elementary School, began teaching in 1985. She was compelled by the needs of many of her students, some from less fortunate families just needing someone to encourage them to strive to their greatest potential. Dr. Rogers invests her time and energy in everyone of her students. Day in and day out, she goes above and beyond the call of duty, because for her students to achieve their greatest potential, some may need individual attention starting from long before the school day begins and lasting until hours after the last bell rings.  Dr. Rogers has had many opportunities to teach at most any school of her choice. Yet, she has humbly chosen to stay at Leeds Elementary School, knowing that her compassion is best put to use by these children who need it the most.  She loves everything about teaching, because Dr. Rogers is shaping the future for each child who comes into her classroom. She doesn't take this responsibility lightly, and for that she is to be commended. I am grateful to Dr. Rogers and teachers all over Alabama and the Nation just like her, who understand the immense responsibility they have as educators.  Dr. Rogers is blessed with an incredibly supportive family. Her parents, Elenor and Dick Dawson, are friends of mine from Birmingham, and I know they are very proud of their daughter's fine accomplishment. Her two sons, Rick and Alan, have benefitted tremendously from her gifted ability to teach. And her brothers, Richard and Eric, are close to her and celebrate with her on this important award.  Alabama is honored to be home to Dr. Rogers, and I hope that when my grandchildren enter elementary school they will have the fortunate experience to have a teacher just like her.                          ____________________
