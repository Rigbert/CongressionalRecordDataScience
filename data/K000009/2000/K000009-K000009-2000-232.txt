Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and in utter consternation that the Republican majority has not allowed Democrats to offer worthy amendments under this so-called open rule.  First of all, allowing only 10 minutes to debate war in Colombia and a major U.S. commitment that will be long term is absolutely reprehensible.  Secondly, on the domestic scene, when we look at oil prices and our total dependence on foreign sources of supply into this economy, and the fact that we have not been allowed to offer amendments that would ask our Secretary of Energy to begin to move toward renewables here at home, giving him the right to purchase ethanol and bio diesel, to fill that strategic petroleum reserve, which, by the way, 90 percent of it has been imported foreign oil.
