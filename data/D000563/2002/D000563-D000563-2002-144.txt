I have become increasingly concerned that the current method for updating Medicare payments to physicians and other health care providers does not accurately reflect the costs associated with delivering high-quality patient care. Reimbursement levels for providers participating the Medicare Program this year will decline by 5.4 percent. There is little to suggest that the cost of providing care has declined. In fact, costs to various providers have actually increased over the past year.  These payment reductions could have strong repercussions on access to essential health services. A flawed payment update system potentially jeopardizes access to medically necessary services for millions of seniors and disabled Americans who rely on Medicare for their health care. In addition, a flawed payment system makes practicing medicine, particularly in underserved areas, all the more difficult, if not impossible for providers participating in the Medicare Program.  Reductions in Medicare physician reimbursement forced Ronald Johnson, M.D., an Illinois physician, to borrow money to keep his practice operating. All told, the loan necessary to sustain his practice for an additional year was equivalent to two-thirds the value of his family farm.  I share the view of many health care analysts, including MedPAC, that the methodology used to update physicians payments is flawed. Although this system was designed to accurately compensate providers for the care they provide while controlling overall program spending on physician and other providers services, it has become apparent that the current system struggles to meet each of these goals. The volatility of physician payments is also a persistent problem for those providers attempting to gauge expected revenue from one year to the next.  Until 1989, Medicare physician payments were based on a reasonable charge payment system. This system was thought to be responsible for escalating program costs, and the Medicare physician fee schedule was adopted in response to these concerns.  The current method for updating Medicare physician payments is unique because the annual increase or decrease in physician payments does not simply reflect changes in the cost of medical goods and services. Unlike other payment systems, an expenditure target for physician services, know, as the sustainable growth rate, (SGR), is calculated each year. Annual payment updates for physician services, that reflect the changes in the costs of medical goods and services, are then increased or reduced to meet targeted expenditures for the program. In other words, physician payment updates only reflect actual changes in the cost of medical goods and services when actual costs equal the target growth rate in physician payments.  Setting target expenditures, or the SGR, for physician payments that do not depart from the actual costs associated with delivering patient care has proven difficult. Methods for calculating the SGR have contributed to this divergence. The SGR is calculated using estimated changes in spending due to fee increases, changes in Medicare fee-for-service enrollent, gross domestic product GDP per capita and the cost of new laws and regulations. Moreover, many of the factors that strongly influence the overall cost of services are difficult to measure including patient preference, technological advances, and changing demographics.  In particular, the inclusion of the GDP in SGR calculations is problematic. Economic downturn may lead to sharp reductions in GDP that are far more dramatic than changes in Medicare beneficiary need. This volatility can have devastating effects on the program and threaten beneficiary access to critical health care services. At a time when beneficiary need is growing due to an aging U.S. population, providing physicians and other health care professionals with adequate reimbursement levels is an the more important.  Also, erroneous CMS enrollment and spending data collected in previous years has exacerbated and already difficult financial situation. Although the necessary corrections were made, the changes have a disproportionately negative financial impact over the coming year.  Efforts to control Medicare spending should not jeopardize the integrity of the health care system. Designing a physician reimbursement system that is less volatile and reflects the actual cost of delivering high-quality patient care is absolutely necessary. Now is the time to take a closer look at the way Medicare payments affect those serving some of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Further delay could make it financially untenable for doctors such as Ronald Johnson to practice in areas like Pittsfield, IL.  I ask that the article from FPReport be printed in the Record.                       [From FPReport, May 2002]  Lower Payments Force FPs To Risk Personal Loss for Their Patients,                                Practices                            (By Jody Gloor)       For a growing number of family physicians, Medicare payment      cuts ultimately could break up the ``families'' dependent on      them--families composed of patients, employees and entire      communities.       While some FPs have stopped accepting new Medicare      patients, others are putting personal loss on the line to      keep their ``families'' intact.       One rural doctor in Illinois who borrowed money to meet his      payroll is now borrowing against his dream farm to repay      those loans and protect his practice from financial failure.       Medicare patients make up one-third of the Pittsfield      practice of Ronald Johnson, M.D., and the area's only      hospital claims nearly 80 percent of its patients use      Medicare. With an average age of 58 in the two counties      Johnson serves, ``we don't have the choice of not taking      Medicare patients. That's our life here,'' he said in a      recent telephone interview. ``They are our neighbors; they      are our friends. We have to take care of each other.''       When he added the losses from Medicare reimbursements and      accounts receivables that have doubled in the past six      months, Johnson realized he needed to borrow an amount that      nearly equaled the value of his farm.       ``I got lucky,'' he said, ``because the farm has been      taking care of itself financially. Now, it's going to take      care of us and our patients.''       Johnson is finalizing a loan for two-thirds of his farm's      value. It's an amount that realistically, he said, can      sustain his practice for another year--two at the most--     depending on factors including future Medicare reimbursement      rates, the local economy and land values.       ``I'd never thought I would spend this much of my time      being a businessman,'' he said. ``It's such a joy to sit down      and see a patient. I thought that was what I was training      for.''       AAFP Director Arlene Brown, M.D., of Ruidoso, NM., said she      and her staff ``saw the writing on the wall'' when Medicare      physician payments dropped and accounts receivables      increased. Something had to happen to keep her ``frontier      medicine'' practice open.       Brown serves 8,000 patients, some of whom must drive 50      miles on a dirt road to reach a paved road--then must drive      another 100 miles to her office. At least 30 percent rely on      Medicare, she said, ``and we can't stop accepting these      patients.''       So Brown took a pay cut and turned to her staff for help.      The employees--a close-knit ``family''--didn't want to see      anyone lose his or her job, she said. Instead of eliminating      a position and/or cutting patient services, all staff members      agreed to cut their hours and pay by 15 to 18 percent.       ``We must stay open,'' Brown said. ``We now if my patients      have to get their primary care 200 miles away from home, they      won't go get it. They depend on me, and on us.''       How long can her practice hold out for a permanent      financial solution? Not long, Brown said. She's hoping      efforts to get the federal government to rethink Medicare and      correct the physician payment formula will succeed soon.       ``If not, we'll be cutting some services we don't have to      provide,'' she said. ``The first to go will be flu shots.''      Next to go will be the free assistance older and low-income      patients get when they need help to buy prescription drugs.       ``It all makes for bad medicine,'' Brown said, ``but it      could help keep our doors open.''       If her practice closes, the entire community--her      community--could collapse, she said. ``A majority of      Americans eat, live, sleep and die in small communities. If      we shut down the very things that help small communities      survive, like medicine, then those communities will die.''  (At the request of
