Speaker, lastly, the gentleman indicated that we may be meeting Friday night. Is the gentleman pretty confident that our Members need to make definite plans to be here on Friday, or is there an expectation that we could get our work done on Thursday? Is Friday a contingency or is the majority sure that we are going to be meeting on Friday?
