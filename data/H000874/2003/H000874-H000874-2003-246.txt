Leader, obviously this will be one of the most important bills that we consider during this session of the Congress of the United States, and I would ask if it is the gentleman's intention and the leadership on your side's intention to provide a rule which will allow the minority to offer such amendments as it deems to be appropriate, to offer a substitute that it deems to be appropriate, and to provide sufficient time to debate those amendments?  I yield further to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding further.  As the gentleman knows, this gentleman is very hesitant to speak for the Committee on Rules, but we do understand how important the Medicare Modernization Act is, how important it is to the seniors of this country, and we would give the minority every consideration to provide a substitute.
