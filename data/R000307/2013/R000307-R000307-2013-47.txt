This isn't what we were promised. This wasn't the understanding of the full committee and the bipartisan effort.  I don't know what we are going to have to do. We are going to have to do some drastic action if this is any indication of what we are taking.  The Senator pointed out that we have been thorough, we have been bipartisan, and we have kept absolute integrity with this. The key word was ``painstaking.'' If we have this information, there is a lot of pain, but there is no take.
