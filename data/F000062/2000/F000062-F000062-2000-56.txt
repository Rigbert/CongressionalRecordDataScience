 President, I wish to submit for the Record letters from two young children in support of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. These children, Brendon Fisher, age 6 and a half, and Paige Fisher, age 8 and a half, are the nephew and niece of Betsy Mullen, Chairperson of the Women's Information Network--Against Breast Cancer. These letters eloquently state why it is so important to continue this program.  The letters follow.                                                    July 16, 2000.       Dear Congress, I think it's very important to keep the      stamp because if we don't every girl is going to worry about      it or maybe get breast cancer. But if we keep it we will get      money to cure to stop it. My Aunt Betsey risked her life on      it and I'm proud of her. If you think about it no one likes      it because you can die from it. I think, and a lot of other      people agree with me, that it would be best to keep the stamp      and then things will go perfect. Hope my letter makes a      difference because not just me is counting on this.       By Paige Fisher, 8\1/2\ years old.       Dear Congress, girls and boys can get breast cancer and I      don't want girls and boys and the president and his wife, cat      and dog to get sick. Keep the stamp going.       From Brendon Fisher.                          ____________________
