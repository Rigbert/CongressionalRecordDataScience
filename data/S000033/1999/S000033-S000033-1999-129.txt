 Speaker, that sounds like a pretty good proposal to me, and let us see how many of our colleagues here who tell us day after day how the Social Security system is going bankrupt, which certainly is not true, let us see how many of them are going to join us in that type of an approach.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. In fact, I went before the Committee on Ways and Means. They would only accept bills that the actuaries had certified as meeting the 75-year requirement, so they only had testimony I believe on five pieces of legislation before the Committee on Ways and Means, and mine was one of the five certified by the trustees of Social Security. The chairman of that committee, who is also I believe for a flat tax, he did not just like latch on to it. I said, well, Mr. Chairman, this is going to be right down your alley; this is a flat tax. People are going to pay the same if they earn $1 million, if they earn $75,000 a year. Would that not be fair? And, we fix the system and we do not have to go through this whole disassembly and reassembly and rolling the dice and taking chances on whether something else would work, and whether the ``something else'' that theymight put in place of Social Security, the system that is responsible for lifting millions of Americans, older Americans out of poverty, disabled Americans out of poverty, survivors of workers who died at a young age; we would lose or risk all that in the newly fractioned, independent sort of account kind of system.                              {time}  1915  Yes, a few people would do better, but most would not. Here is an option that would provide tax relief and save the system, but it just somehow did not capture the chairman's attention right off. I do not intend to drop the idea. I have final legislation and I am ready to introduce it soon. I am hoping to begin a debate about a better way to fix social security.
