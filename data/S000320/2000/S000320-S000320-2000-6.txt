 President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Robert L. McCurley Jr., of Tuscaloosa, AL for his dedicated work on behalf of the Kiwanis International Foundation. Mr. McCurley retired on September 30, 2000 after two terms as the president of Kiwanis International's charitable arm. I commend him for his commitment to helping the less fortunate throughout the world.  Bob McCurley's duties as Kiwanis International Foundation president have taken him around the world in his efforts to improve the lives of the underprivileged. Under his leadership, the foundation has provided grants to meet the needs of children from Bulgaria and Haiti to India and Cambodia. In particular, the Kiwanis International Foundation has raised millions of dollars to combat iodine deficiency disorders, the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the world today.  Mr. McCurley earned degrees in both engineering and law from the University of Alabama. He is director of the Alabama Law Institute and an adjunct professor at the Alabama School of Law. He has also served as a municipal judge and has authored 12 books on law and government.  Mr. McCurley has been a member of Kiwanis in Gadsden and Tuscaloosa for more than 30 years. He led the Kiwanis organization in Alabama in 1983-1984, served as Trustee and then Vice President of Kiwanis International from 1987-1992, and since 1994 has served the Kiwanis International Foundation as a Trustee, Treasurer, and President. In addition to Kiwanis, he has served his community as a volunteer in leadership positions with the March of Dimes, Boys Club, Focus on Senior Citizens, and Association for Retarded Children.  Robert L. McCurley Jr.'s charitable work has made a difference in countless lives in Alabama and throughout the world. UNICEF estimates that Kiwanis support of iodine deficiency disorder programs is saving more than 8 million children each year from mental and physical disabilities. I would like to congratulate Mr. McCurley on a stellar term as President of the Kiwanis International Foundation, and wish him and his family the best in the future.                          ____________________
