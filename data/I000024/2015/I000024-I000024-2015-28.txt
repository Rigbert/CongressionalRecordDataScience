President, let me first of all thank the Senator from Wyoming. It is interesting that every time we are involved in something--it could be reconciliation, the budget or the highway bill--he is always in the center and he has always been the anchor that holds us all together, and we appreciate that so much.  I will recognize the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell.                          ____________________
