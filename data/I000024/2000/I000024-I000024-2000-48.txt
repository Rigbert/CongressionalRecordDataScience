As he knows, during the mark-up in February, the Committee adopted the Crapo/Baucus/Bennett amendment to solve this situation. However, as we later learned, the amendment was insufficient in the eyes of FEMA to resolve this issue. I think that the language contained in the legislation unequivocally addresses the issue and there can be no ambiguity in the wishes of the Senate concerning FEMA's policy affecting private nonproit irrigators in the states. Therefore, I reiterate my commitment to enacting legislation that creates equity for PNP irrigators in the implementation of FEMA policies.
