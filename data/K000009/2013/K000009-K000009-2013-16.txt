Speaker, now that the Republican shutdown is over, Congress should be addressing the most pressing issues facing our Nation--faster economic growth, putting our people back to work at living-wage jobs, balancing the budget, and investing in our future. But so far, there is no Republican budget deal completed to set the frame for all of this, to give confidence to businesses that they can invest, and to assure the American people that there is some certainty that Congress has done its job.  The first step is completion of a responsible budget resolution for 2014 which starts in just a few weeks; and, in fact, the Federal fiscal year started October 1. From that resolution would follow, if we had regular order in this House, 12 appropriation bills constrained within the limits of that important budget. But rather than completing the budget bill, I observed the chairman of the House Budget Committee making political speeches out in Iowa rather than getting the job done here. My message today is get the job done of the Budget Committee.  We know that the economy will grow when more people are working; and when that happens, the Federal debt will go down.  The first chart I have here actually shows that during the Clinton years when employment went up, we were able to balance the budget. It was followed during the Bush year with the terrible recession where unemployment went up and, guess what, the budget deficit increased and our accumulated debt grew at extraordinary proportions.  Now, think about what happens to the U.S. debt when unemployment goes up; and during the Bush years, we had over 8.8 million jobs that were eliminated because of the Great Recession. When people don't have a job, they aren't paying taxes. They aren't buying a new car or spending money at department stores or other consumer spending that drives employment growth and job creation. Increased wages drive investment. Moreover, people who don't have a job are likely relying on government for help--unemployment benefits that are extended, or other parts of the Federal safety net, the social safety net such as health insurance, and health care. That causes a drawdown in Federal spending.  So the message to my Republican colleagues is get the job done. That's the only way you are going to be able to reduce the debt. We cannot balance our budget with unemployment hovering at over 7 percent nationally.  Although the Obama administration has successfully led 42 months of consecutive job creation compared to the Bush years when we went so much into the hole, we still have not dug ourselves out and replaced those 8.8 million jobs that were eliminated. That is a lot of jobs. Over 2 million manufacturing jobs alone were eliminated. If we think about that, we have done a good job month by month. in crawling out of the recession. But the pace of this is not what I would call robust, but it definitely has been steady.  Piled on top of this gigantic effort to try to create jobs is a nagging trade deficit. In my part of America, people know well what job outsourcing has occurred to foreign countries. We have had continuing hemorrhaging of U.S. jobs because of trade agreements like NAFTA, China PNTR, Korea, all in the negative, all in the red, not in the black. We have not had a positive trade balance in this country since 1975, and the numbers show it. The deficits just keep getting worse.  Can you find anything made in America any more? There is $9 trillion in accumulated trade deficit since 1975. That actually equals half of our long-term debt because our monthly trade deficit now hovers around $39 billion more imported goods coming in there than we are able to export. This means more foreign goods, fewer U.S. jobs. Over time, these foreign subsidized products from closed markets replace American products and the jobs that go with them. The word ``outsourcing'' has become all too familiar.  Mr. Speaker, if my Republican colleagues want to tackle the Federal debt, then they need to bring a completed budget deal to the floor. It is months, almost a year, too late. We need to tackle the Federal debt by growing jobs. Bring economic growth and jobs bills to the floor. We need to no longer bring trade deals to this floor that result, through fast track, in the kind of job killing that we have had over the last quarter century. Shouldn't we focus on what the American people have been saying to us year after year after year: it is the economy; it is job creation. This institution ought to be focused laser beam on what the American people are telling us. Why is that so hard to do?  I urge my colleagues on the Budget Committee, get back to work. Stop the politicking around the country; get those committees reaching compromises between the House and the Senate. Let's get the big frame; and then let's, through regular order, bring up the 12 appropriation bills within those budget restraints so we can eliminate the debt by making this economy grow fully again.                          ____________________
