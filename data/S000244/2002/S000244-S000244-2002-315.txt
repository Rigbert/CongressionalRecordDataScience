Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2431) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to ensure that chaplains killed in the line of duty receive public safety officer death benefits, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
