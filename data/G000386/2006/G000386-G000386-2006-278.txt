 President, I spoke this morning about the bipartisanship and the origination of the idea behind the Roth IRA conversions, and how Senator Bentsen was the inventor of that idea, and how it had such broad bipartisan support. I supported it. It also had bipartisan support when Senator Roth introduced the bill. It had passed the Senate so many times by big, bipartisan margins.  We hear people on the other side of the aisle badmouthing an idea of one of the most esteemed Members of their party in the history of the Senate, Senator Bentsen of Texas, who was chairman of this committee in 1991, 1992, and was going to be chairman in 1993 and 1994, but he became Secretary of the Treasury. Now all of a sudden it becomes partisan that we are including that idea in this legislation. I don't understand it.  I have this response to what was said. I heard my friend on the other side try to argue that the provisions in the conference report that will allow taxpayers to make Roth IRA conversions is a budget gimmick. Was it a gimmick when Senator Bentsen introduced it? It is not a gimmick. Nothing could be further from the truth.
