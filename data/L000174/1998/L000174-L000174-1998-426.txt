President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has spent the last twenty four years of his life working to ensure that Vermonters who are struggling to make ends meet, can afford to keep a roof over their heads. Richard Williams is far too humble to ask for recognition for those years of service, but that service has meant too much to go unrecognized.  The Vermont State Housing Authority (VSHA) was the first statewide housing authority in the United States, and Richard has been with it almost from the beginning. He came to VSHA in 1974 as an accountant when the organization itself was only six years old. Through the years he has served as Director of Fiscal Management, Deputy Director, and since 1984, Executive Director.  Under his leadership, VSHA has grown considerably. Today it administers the Section 8 program providing 4,585 families with rental assistance. The organization's non-profit arm, The Housing Foundation Inc. (HFI), which Richard helped to establish, created additional units of affordable housing and mobile home park lots. Through the HFI and various partnerships 1,050 units of affordable housing are now available for low-income families in Vermont. Just recently, Richard oversaw a creative interpretation of the tax code which, with the help of the Howard Bank, produced an $8.1 million tax exempt bond to refinance most of the mobile home parks in The Housing Foundation portfolio, to the benefit of 565 Vermont households.  But Richard was never content to limit himself to the work of VSHA. He sits on more boards and has served in more associations than I could recount here today. Among them are the Governor's Housing Council, the Advisory Group for the Consolidated Plan, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Committee. With all of these commitments, it amazes me that he gets any rest at all. Vermonters are fortunate indeed to have someone so dedicated to making housing affordable for all, and who apparently needs so little sleep.  This year, the Vermont State Housing Authority is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, and that is indeed cause for celebration. I applaud VSHA for thirty years of outstanding service to Vermont, and at the same time recognize Richard Williams for the large part he has played in that success. I know I speak for thousands of Vermonters who have a roof over their heads today because of his efforts, in saying thank you to Richard for twenty four years of service to Vermont.                          ____________________
