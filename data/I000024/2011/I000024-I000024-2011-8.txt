President, I appreciate that. First of all, I don't recall seeing the majority and minority working so closely together and in the right way for a while. Several of my amendments have been accepted. I think they agreed to this one. It directs DOD to have a report on the effect of boycotts against our domestic contractors. It is modified, and I ask for its adoption.
