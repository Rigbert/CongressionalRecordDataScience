 Mr. President, we will come very soon to a vote. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia does deserve enormous credit for standing up each time for the Constitution. Really, that is what I am urging Senators to do. There is no question in my mind that if we took a public opinion poll, the popular thing, the easy thing would be to vote for this constitutional amendment, and we can say, then, as soon as the States ratify it, it is somebody else's problem.  If we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to protect the Constitution, if we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to bring down the deficit, if we don't stand up and cast the tough and unpopular votes, well, then, somebody can go to court and let the courts straighten it out.  Mr. President, when I first announced for the U.S. Senate in this week--this very week--in 1974, I was a 33-year-old prosecutor in the only State in the Union that had never elected a member of my party. I told the people of Vermont, ``You may not always agree with me on every single thing I will do, but I will make you one pledge: I will hold your interests and the interests of the country foremost. I will follow my best judgment. I will follow my conscience. I will not allow myself to be swayed by passing polls and fancies, and I will always try to do right.''  I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate than any Senator in Vermont's history. I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate, by far, than any Senator in Vermont's history. If I went back through those thousands of votes, I bet I could find a vote or two or three or four that might come as close. Some come to mind, because some of these votes were votes, if I could have cast it on a balance, I would have cast 51 percent one way, 49 percent the other, they were that close.  I remember the wise advice of the majority leader when I first came here, Senator Mansfield of Montana, who said, ``Don't worry if maybe you have some difficulty on a very close vote. Do what you think is right, and if later you determine maybe you made a mistake, the issue will come up again.'' It usually does.  So if I go back to the thousands of votes, I could find one of those 51 to 49 votes, but this is not one of those 51 to 49 votes. On this vote, I have no question in my mind what is the right vote. It is not the popular vote, but it is the right vote, and that is the vote I will cast against this amendment, because we have amended the Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights, and two of those amendments crossed each other out: One was for prohibition; one was to end prohibition. All the other amendments have stayed there, because the men and women who came before us carefully considered what was best for the country, what was best for our Constitution, and even though during this time the temptation, the siren song of constitutional amendments has been heard through the Halls of the House and the Senate hundreds and hundreds of times, the siren song has been heard by those campaigning, by those elected and by those defeated, but the siren song was resisted. We are a better country for it.  This is not a time to try to manipulate the Constitution of the United States of America. This is not a time to put into the Constitution an amendment so flawed, an amendment that leaves more questions unanswered than questions answered, an amendment that may look good on a bumper sticker but stinks like a dead mackerel on the shores of the Constitution. This is not an amendment this Senate should send to the States.  Rather, what we should do, Republicans and Democrats alike, is join together and pass real budgets, pass those budgets that allow the United States to continue to have the world's strongest economy, an economy that is the envy of every other country, and an economy, incidentally, which has a smaller deficit as part of its gross domestic product than any of the rest of the industrialized world, an economy which is unmatched in recorded history, and realize that there are things that we should spend for.  Thomas Jefferson borrowed an amount, I think, equal to about twice what the whole budget of the United States was to make the Louisiana purchase. Is there anybody here who would like to see what this country would be like had we not made that Louisiana purchase, had we not had that westward expansion? If we had not been able to go out to our Western States, why, there are some Senators even currently in this Chamber today who might not have States to represent had we not had the Louisiana purchase.  I ask Senators to think back to when the Constitution was put together. Small States and large States were given an equal voice in this body so that they could maintain their identity. What a great compromise that was, what that did to allow this country to hold together--an advantage, obviously, to my own State of Vermont. But under this constitutional amendment, on matters of spending, on matters of crises, on matters of natural disasters, we would no longer have that parity. We would be left at the whim of the minority, not of the majority.  So, Mr. President, on this vote, I am sure in my heart and soul I am voting the right way, the right way for the State of Vermont. But I must say to my fellow Vermonters, even more important, it is the right way for our country and our Constitution.  I was raised in a household brought to revere the Constitution. I have taken an oath to support it in each of my terms in the U.S. Senate, in each of my terms as a prosecuting attorney. I remember each and every time I took that oath because I stopped and thought of what I was swearing allegiance to. It is what sets us apart from all other countries on Earth. It is why we have a Constitution that every one of us should stop and read and reread periodically. It is why, if we have a matter where we want to bring down the deficits, then do it the honest, old-fashioned way, vote to bring it down, vote the hard choices, vote against the special interest groups on the right or left, vote for what is best for the country, but do not pass the responsibility off to our Constitution, to future generations, to the courts to do what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do, and, more important, what we are sworn to do for this country.  This is something that should unite Democrats and Republicans. When this debate is over and after this vote has gone by, I hope that before we go to more bumper-sticker kinds of debates, that we go to the issues where we can join. Certainly the financial status of this country is one.  Mr. President, earlier today, I was summarizing the debate that the Senate has had on this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I would like to continue that discussion to complete the Record on this historic debate.                 REID, FEINSTEIN AND DORGAN AMENDMENTS  Senator Reid offered a perfecting amendment to exclude the Social Security trust fund from Senate Joint Resolution 1. Senators Feinstein and Dorgan also offered substitute constitutional amendments that would have excluded the Social Security trust fund from the balanced budget mandates. The Reid, Feinstein and Dorgan amendments all focused on removing any threat to Social Security by this proposed constitutional amendment.  The Social Security Program is America's contract with its senior citizens. Were the underlying resolution to become the basis for a constitutionally-mandated budget balancing act, Social Security would be rendered just another Government program and have its place on the chopping block with everything else.  Since 1983, Congress has acted to protect Social Security from overall budget cuts. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 required Social Security to be placed off budget within 10 years. That protective legislation passed the Senate 58 to 14 with a strong bipartisan majority. In fact, Congress accelerated this process. Rather than wait 10 years, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, commonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, placed Social Security off budget beginning in 1986. This means that the congressional budget resolution in 1985 was the last time that Social Security was included in the Federal budgets that Congress approves each year.  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings permitted across-the-board spending cuts--sequestration--when budgetary goals are not achieved. By its actions placing Social Security off budget, Congress explicitly and intentionally exempted Social Security from the sequestration process. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings--with its protections for Social Security--passed the Senate 61 to 31 with a strong bipartisan majority.  The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 reinforced earlier protections by placing Social Security even more clearly off budget. This bill, too, passed the Senate 54 to 45 with the bipartisan support of 35 Democrats and 19 Republicans.  The proposed constitutional amendment turns its back on these many years of bipartisan progress in protecting Social Security from the ebb and flow of efforts to eliminate the deficit. I believe that our senior citizens deserve better.  When the Government overestimates revenues for an upcoming year, or underestimates expenses, or something changes in the course of the year to influence either, the budget goes out of balance and, under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the Government is out of money. The amendment's mandates would make continued expenditures into constitutional violations of law. If this proposed constitutional amendment were enshrined in the Constitution, it could force the Federal Government to stop making payments for any number of obligations, possibly including payment of Social Security checks, until the budget imbalance could be corrected.  Treasury Secretary Rubin warned the Judiciary Committee of this great risk, when he testified:       [T]he amendment poses immense enforcement problems that      might well lead to the involvement of the courts in budget      decisions, unprecedented impoundment powers for the President      or the temporary cessation of all federal payments. Any of      these options could disrupt Social Security and Medicare      payments.  Further, if the President and Congress reached a budget impasse under the proposed constitutional amendment, Secretary Rubin cautioned:       Some proponents have suggested that under these      circumstances, the President would stop issuing checks,      including those for Social Security benefits. Alternatively,      judges might become deeply involved in determining whether      Social Security or Medicare checks would be stopped.  This would be a disaster for senior citizens on fixed incomes who live on Social Security and Medicare from check to check. When they miss a check, they will not have the funds to pay the rent or meet the mortgage, buy groceries, pay their utility bills, heat their homes, pay for medical care or needed pharmaceutical drugs, or meet other expenses.  That is the dilemma that the Social Security system would face if Social Security is not protected under this proposed constitutional amendment. In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, the President stated:       I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the      constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose      grave risks to the Social Security System. In the event of an      impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be      waived nor met, disbursements or unelected judges could      reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate.      No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social      Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment      overrides statutory law.  The 1983 bipartisan Social Security Commission headed by Alan Greenspan recommended converting the Social Security system from a pure pay-as-you-go program to one that builds up surpluses to pay for the future retirement of the baby boom generation. The Greenspan Commission recommended taking Social Security off budget in order to meet this goal without subjecting the program to the vicissitudes of Federal budgeting for other programs. Congress concurred with the Greenspan Commission's recommendations in passing the Social Security Amendments of 1983.  Just as families save for their retirements, the Social Security Program currently is building up surpluses while baby boomers are still working in order to be able to afford their retirements in the next century. This proposed constitutional amendment would encourage, even necessitate, Congress, the President, and the courts using Social Security as a way to comply with the amendment. When the trust fund begins to shrink after the year 2020, this proposed constitutional amendment would add pressure on the Government to cut Social Security rather than risk constitutional violation. Instead, we ought to be working on ways to honor our commitments and ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.  A recent analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is telling. It says:       The Leadership version [of S.J. Res. 1] would be virtually      certain to precipitate a massive crisis in Social Security      about 20 years from now, even if legislation has been passed      in the meantime putting Social Security in long-term      actuarial balance. To help pay the benefits of the baby boom      generation, the nation would face an excruciating choice at      that time between much deeper cuts in Social Security      benefits than were needed to make Social Security solvent and      a much larger increase in payroll taxes than would otherwise      be required. There would be only one other alternative--to      finance Social Security deficits in those years not by      drawing down the Social Security surplus but by raising other      taxes substantially or slashing the rest of government      severely. As a result, the government might fail to provide      adequately for other basic services, potentially including      the national defense.  Congress can balance the budget while protecting Social Security, but the sponsors of the underlying resolution tabled the Reid, Feinstein and Dorgan amendments. I do want to acknowledge Senator McCain and Senator Specter for voting their conscience on the Reid and Dorgan amendments to protect Social Security. I respect their decisions to buck their party's no-amendments strategy on this point. Their votes not to table these amendments were, I believe, the only times Republicans voted to do anything other than march lock-step with their leadership in support of the original language of Senate Joint Resolution 1.                  TORRICELLI AND FEINSTEIN AMENDMENTS  Before he announced his determination how he would vote on the underlying resolution Senator Torricelli offered an amendment that highlighted another serious flaw in Senate Joint Resolution 1. The underling resolution prohibits capital budgeting.  As Senator Torricelli so forcefully pointed out during the Judiciary Committee deliberations on Senate Joint Resolution 1, we as a nation are suffering from a capital investment crisis. In 1965, more than 6 percent of our Federal expenditures were invested in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and mass transit systems. By 1992, that share of capital investment had fallen by more than half to about 3 percent of our Federal budget and this year it will approach barely 2 percent.  At the same time as our infrastructure funding has been shrinking, our Nation's needs have continued to grow. The result is that we are becoming a nation in disrepair. For instance, more than a quarter of a million miles of roads need repair and more than 25 percent of our bridges have exceeded their lifespan.  This failure to maintain adequate infrastructure is hurting our competitiveness in the global economy. We are competing against other countries with the foresight to repair their roads and bridges, modernize their transit systems, maintain their ports, build new schools, and make the investments in telecommunications infrastructure that are the keys to success in today's global competition. The United States is dead last among the G-7 nations in public infrastructure investment as a percentage of gross domestic product.  We must reverse this trend and make the long-term investments needed to support a strong economy. We must be able to invest in education if we are togive our children their best chance to compete and win in the coming century.  Sections 1 and 7 of the underlying resolution prohibit capital budgeting. All expenditures, whether the equivalent of operating expenses or capital investments, are tallied the same for purposes of this proposed constitutional amendment. The sponsors and proponents of this measure refuse to permit any exception and future Congresses will be forever barred from solving our infrastructure crisis by creating a capital budget for long-term investments.  Senate committee hearings in 1995 established an extensive record in support of maintaining a separate capital budget. Herbert Stein, of the American Enterprise Institute and former economic adviser to President Nixon; Edward V. Regan, of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute and former New York State controller; and Dr. Fred Bergsten, on behalf of the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Carter administration; differed on the wisdom of enacting a constitutional amendment on the budget but all agreed on one thing: If such an amendment were to be considered it should separate capital investments for any annual balance requirement.  Nonetheless, when the majority had the opportunity to consider amendments that would have allowed for a separate budget for capital investments, it rejected them. This was a principal thrust of the Torricelli substitute and an important aspect of the Feinstein substitute. They were flatly rejected by the majority and their no amendments approach to consideration of the underlying resolution. Both of these amendments were tabled with all Republican members who voted, voting against capital budgeting.  This inflexibility is one of the principal objections of the more than 1,000 economists who oppose Senate Joint Resolution 1. It is also one of the reasons President Clinton opposes this constitutional amendment on budgeting. As the President so clearly stated:       We must give future generations the freedom to formulate      the federal budget in ways they deem most appropriate. For      example, some believe that the federal government should do      what many state governments do: adopt a balanced operating      budget and a separate capital budget. Under this      constitutional balanced budget proposal, the government would      be precluded from doing so.  During the Judiciary Committee's January 17 hearing, Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained:       What families do when they balance their budget is families      say that all of their income, including money they borrow,      equals all the cash they pay out. Families borrow money when      they purchase a house through a mortgage, when they buy a      car, and especially when they send a child to college. If      families had to operate on the basis that this amendment      does, they would have to pay for all of college education out      of the current year's income, all of the entire cost of a      home, not the down payment, the whole thing, out of the      current year's income. Nobody operates that way.  The actions of Thomas Jefferson as President, as opposed to his oft-quoted ruminations about the evils of public debt, are also instructive but ignored by the majority. In 1804, President Jefferson had the United States borrow $15 million, in 1804 dollars, by selling bonds to finance the Louisiana Purchase. That amount approximates more than $225 billion in 1993 dollars and exceeds every Federal budget deficit except for the final 2 years of the Bush administration.  Was President Jefferson wrong to invest in the Louisiana Territory that provided this country with 15 States? Of course not. But had the provisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 been included in the Constitution, our Nation's westward expansion might well have ended at the Mississippi River.  Under the underlying resolution, the failure to permit a capital budget would have severe consequences by discouraging long-term investment and ignoring our infrastructure crisis. Just as a budget deficit unfairly harms future generations so, too, does the failure to differentiate capital investments from operating and consumption expenditures. The inevitable result will be less investment in our country's future, pressure to operate through inefficient leasing practices and gimmickry.  The majority ignores the fact that 42 States, most cities, and businesses exclude from their balanced budget requirements capital, enterprise, or trust funds that are financed primarily by borrowing rather than by current revenue. Moreover, most States with balanced budget requirements use capital funds that finance major capitol projects by issuing long-term debt.  The Nation's leading economists agree that a capital budget is an essential part of the State experience with balanced budget requirements and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed constitutional amendment is a major flaw. These economists note:       Unlike many state constitutions, which permit borrowing to      finance capital expenditures, the proposed federal amendment      makes no distinction between capital investments and current      outlays. . . . The amendment would prevent federal borrowing      to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education,      research and development, environmental protection, and other      investments vital to the nation's future well-being.  Having defeated all attempts to allow for capital budgeting within the underlying resolution over the last several weeks, the weekend papers are again hinting that the Republican leadership is rethinking its strategy and may be willing to reconsider whether capital budgeting can be incorporated into the underlying resolution. These vacillations by the majority illustrate why this matter is not appropriate for a constitutional amendment. The Constitution cannot be made to say and require one fiscal policy one week and the opposite the next. That is not the stuff of the Constitution. These are matters of public interest that can be addressed by policy and statutes that serve the times and the needs of the American people.                            BOXER AMENDMENT  Senator Boxer offered an amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 1 that again pointed out a serious and substantial flaw with this proposed constitutional amendment. The Boxer amendment would have permitted Congress to response to emergencies and natural disasters by a majority vote.  The proposed constitutional amendment can no more prevent a recession than it can an earthquake, but it will restrict our ability to deal with the effects of both. A natural disaster, such as a large-scale flood, earthquake, or fire, could require the Federal Government to expend large sums to assist the victims and begin to rebuild the ravaged area. We need only look to the devastation suffered in Arkansas and Mississippi over the last few days to be reminded of nature's power.  The proposed constitutional amendment would make these kinds of sudden emergency expenditures impossible because they would cause an unauthorized increase in the deficit. Humanitarian efforts could and would be held hostage while the requisite supermajorities were rounded up in each House of Congress. A minority in either House could block such efforts altogether or extort other paybacks.  In recent years, the Federal Government has been called on to give critical aid to supplement State and local efforts to protect the public health and safety in response to major disasters and emergencies. Much of this aid has been paid for by supplemental appropriations because of the unexpected nature of major disasters and emergencies.  From fiscal years 1989 to 1996 Congress had to appropriate supplemental major disaster and emergency relief in every year but one. For example, in 1992, Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriation over $4 billion to help victims of the Los Angeles riots, the Chicago floods, and Hurricane Andrew. In 1993, Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriation of $2 billion to help victims of the Midwest floods. In 1994, Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriation of more than $4 billion to help victims of the Los Angeles earthquake.  Relief for major disasters and emergencies must be flexible. Usually, a swift response from the Federal Government is needed to aid local relief efforts. Disaster and emergency relief by constitutional mandate is a prescription for gridlock, not swift action. When your State is hit by a major disaster or emergency, do you want critical Federal assistance to hang on the whims of 41 Senators or 175 Representatives?  Our Founders rejected requirements of supermajorities. We should look to their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements before we impose on our most vulnerable and neediest citizens a three-fifths supermajority requirement to provide them Federal relief from major disasters and emergencies.  Alexander Hamilton painted an alarming picture in ``Federalist Paper No. 22'' of the consequences of the poison of supermajority requirements. Hamilton said that supermajority requirements serve ``to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.''  These supermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, not more efficient action. As Hamilton noted long ago: ``Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.'' Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion.  I fear that a supermajority requirement will lead to some in Congress playing politics with critical relief from disasters and emergencies. Even with today's simple majority requirement for supplemental appropriations for disaster and emergency relief, we see the potential for partisan politics.  In the last Congress a multibillion-dollar disaster aid package for California was caught in the budget wars between President Clinton and House Republicans. The House Republican leadership delayed action on a request from the President for supplemental appropriations for emergency relief for victims of the California floods and Los Angeles earthquake. Fortunately, public outcry forced the House Republicans to relent. That political gamesmanship happened with only a simple majority requirement for supplemental appropriations for disaster and emergency relief. Think what would happen if Congress had to clear a supermajority hurdle to pass disaster and emergency relief.  Again, instead of addressing the serious and substantial concerns raised by the Boxer amendment, the sponsors and proponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 simply opposed its consideration as creating a loophole in the underlying resolution. They did not offer alternative language to address the emergency and natural disaster concerns surrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, with lock-step voting, they tabled the Boxer amendment by a vote of 60 to 40.                           FEINGOLD AMENDMENT  Senator Feingold offered several amendments to Senate Joint Resolution 1, including one that would have permitted the use of a ``rainy day'' fund. Simply put, the Feingold amendment would have allowed the use of an accumulated surplus for necessary expenditures during any fiscal year.  Section 6 of the underlying resolution states: ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' [Emphasis added].  What happens when these estimates of outlays and receipts fail to come true during the fiscal year? As is ususally the case each year, Congress is wrong on its economic forecasts. For example, in June 1995 the Congress adopted a budget resolution that anticipated a deficit of $170 billion in the 1996 fiscal year. In August 1995, the Congressional Budget Office anticipated a deficit of $189 billion for the 1996 fiscal year. But the deficit for the 1996 fiscal year was actually $107 billion.  To respond to the usual budget forecast corrections, several of the majority's witinesses during Judiciary Committee hearings recommended that Senate Joint Resolution 1 be amended to allow the Federal Government to establish a rainy day fund or stabilization fund. This fund would adjust to budget shortfalls or overruns during the fiscal year.  For example, James C. Miller III, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget during the Reagan administration, testified:       I would urge you to consider incorporating a ``rainy day      fund.'' Thus, if one year revenues fell short (or outlays ran      over), you could dip into this fund without violating the      balanced budget requirement.  If the experience in the States is instructive, then a rainy day fund is a necessity for any balanced budget requirement. According to the American Legislative Exchange Council, 45 States have budget stabilization funds or rainy day funds to respond to unanticipated shortfalls in revenue or over-runs in outlays.  The majority, however, ignores the advice of its own witnesses and the experience in the States, and prohibits the use of a rainy day fund under this proposed constitutional amendment. Instead of adopting the Feingold amendment, the majority simply marched forward lock-step in their no-amendments strategy and tabled the Feingold amendment by a vote of 60 to 40.                           KENNEDY AMENDMENT  Finally, Senator Kennedy offered an amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 1 that revealed perhaps its most serious flaw. The Kennedy amendment was a sincere effort to confront the matters of enforcement of the underlying resolution, which would have limited the enforcement of the proposed constitutional amendment to Congress.  As James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 48, ``the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people.'' Our Constitution now gives Congress the primary authority, and responsibility, with regard to the raising and expenditure of outlays. The proposed amendment would dramatically alter the allocation of powers set forth in article I, sections 7, 8, and 9.  It risks casting the Federal and State courts in the role of Federal budget czars deciding in myriad cases whether the Federal budget is impermissibly out of balance, and where it is, forbidding spending and ordering what remedies it deems appropriate for the constitutional violations occasioned by circumstances in which outlays exceeding revenues in any year without supermajority approval of the Congress.  Although the proponents of the proposed constitutional amendment have left it silent with regard to the role of the courts in its interpretation, implementation, and enforcement, that silence is deafening.  Section 1 of the amendment contains a flat prohibition on total outlays exceeding total receipts in any fiscal year, except as expressly authorized by a supermajority in each House of Congress. Having embedded this mandate in the Constitution, this proposed constitutional amendment invites the courts to become actively involved in determining when this constitutional command is being violated and how such violations are to be remedied.  In the memorable words of Chief Justice Marshall: ``It is, emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department, to say what the law is.'' Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S., 1 Cranch, 137, 176 (1803). Since that historic decision, the Supreme Court has had the preeminent role in articulating the scope and meaning of our Constitution. The majority report concedes the fundamental obligation of the courts to say what the law is.  If the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting were ratified, the fulfillment of this role by the Supreme Court, and other courts, could require them to address complex budgetary issues that courts are ill-suited to resolve. As de Tocqueville wrote more than 148 years ago: ``Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.'' If the proposed constitutional amendment were ratified, several of its provisions would give rise to cases and controversies that the courts would be called upon to resolve.  Supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment, in fact, desire judicial involvement and enforcement of its terms. The representative from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified before the Judiciary Committee:       [T]here is a legitimate and necessary role for the courts      in ensuring compliance with the amendment. Congress could      potentially circumvent balanced budget amendment requirements      through unrealistic revenue estimates, emergency      designations, off-budget accounts, unfunded mandates, and      other gimmickry. It is our view that the need to proscribe      judicial policy making can be reconciled with a constructive      role for the courts in maintaining the integrity of the      balanced budget requirement.  In response to questions, the representative of the National Taxpayers Union, another advocate for the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting in spite of its potential to lead to tax increases in order to achieve balance, observed:       We oppose denying judicial review authority, and believe      that it would be more difficult to enforce the provisions of      S.J. Res. 1 if Congress were to add such language to the      Balanced Budget Amendment.  The representative of the Family Research Council opposed adding express language on the role of the courts, noting that they ``would not object to language that would prevent judges from raising taxes'' and observed:       Under our system of government, each branch has certain      limited means to require legal compliance by one of the other      branches. The use of this legal authority is somewhat      dependent on the political will of each branch to exercise      their proper authority. Each branch of government will have      its prerogatives to enforce the amendment, subject to      appropriate checks and balances.  Similarly, in 1995, in response to questions from me, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted: ``The BBA would be policed by the same balance of powers that the Framers so carefully crafted in the Constitution. Thus, excesses by the Congress would be controlled by both the executive and judicial branches.''  The former Government attorneys who support the proposed constitutional amendment and have been called to testify before the Judiciary Committee over the last several years on the problem of defining the judicial role have been unanimous about only one thing: Court involvement is not prohibited by the amendment.  Stuart M. Gerson, a former Acting Attorney General, and William Barr, the official he replaced at the end of the Bush administration, differed in what they regarded as the principal dangers posed by judicial intervention and in how they would seek to reduce the risks of courts involvement, but they did not say and could not say that the courts would not be involved in interpreting, implementing, and enforcing the proposed constitutional amendment were it to be ratified.  Mr. Gerson testified he thought judicial intervention would be ``limited in scope'' but conceded that our constitutional law ``does not remove the courts from the picture entirely where there is manifest abuse or disregard of unequivocal legal pronouncements.'' He noted, in his written statement, that ``there is a category of case--that involving whether objective statutory terms have been satisfied--which always has been cognizable and will remain so under the Balanced Budget Amendment,'' and, in his oral presentation, that ``in those few cases where a cognizable departure from the specific terms of the amendment can be shown, courts, indeed must intervene.''  He went on, in response to questioning from Senator Torricelli, to concede that standing for certain individuals and Members of Congress is possible under this amendment:       So, the answer to your question is that I think that the      standing of individuals and members of Congress is very      limited. I do concede--that there is a category of cases as      to which I would not deny jurisdiction to the courts to make      certain that the Constitution was being enforced.  When asked by Senator Torricelli, as an example, whether the Senate sponsors of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting would have standing before a Federal court to bring a suit to compel compliance with its terms, Mr. Gerson said:       In fact, I think that situation is the most likely      situation in which Congressional standing, which has never      before been recognized, might be recognized and I say so in      my prepared testimony. . . . That is the one situation that      even Judge Bork in the D.C. Circuit recognized might allow      Congressional standing.  The other witness who testified before the Judiciary Committee on questions of law and judicial review was Alan B. Morrison of the Public Citizen Litigation Group. He observed:       [I]n the absence of a clear statement of the contrary in      the Amendment itself, it is likely that parties who claimed      that, for example, the requirements for revenue increases in      Section 4 had not been satisfied, could show sufficient      injury to meet the case or controversy requirement in Article      III of the Constitution. The same is true for those objecting      to a Presidential impoundment.  Mr. Morrison thus concluded his testimony:       Senator, you will note that Section 1 of S.J. Res. 1 is not      put in terms of the Congress shall enact and the President      shall sign into law. It's put in absolute terms--total      outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed.       It seems to me that is a very unusual kind of      constitutional command and that despite what the courts have      done in other cases, no person sitting at this table or any      place else in this country can accurately predict what the      courts will do, which is the reason why I say it is so      important that the Congress, in the first instance, assume      responsibility, take it on, of saying what they want about      judicial review and that would be enforced in the courts.  Written testimony was received by the Judiciary Committee from Dawn E. Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice. In that statement, the current head of the Office of Legal Counsel indicated that ``primary concern of the Department of Justice is how a balanced budget amendment would be enforced--an issue that none of the proposed amendments thus far has adequately addressed.'' The statement continues:       If a balanced budget amendment were to be enforced by the      courts, it could restructure the balance of power between the      branches of government and could empower unelected judges to      raise taxes or cut spending--fundamental policy decisions      that judges are ill-equipped to make.  The Department of Justice testimony also referred to prior statements by a former Solicitor General for President Nixon and Federal judge, Robert H. Bork, and another former Solicitor General for President Reagan and Harvard law professor, Charles Fried. Both men have observed that judicial self-restraint, based on doctrines of standing and political questions, did not overcome the possibilities of significant litigation over interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting.  The Department of Justice has not varied much from that of Robert H. Bork, 10 years ago:       In the end, there is a range of views about the extent to      which courts would involve themselves in issues arising under      the balanced budget amendment. Former Solicitor General Bork      believes that there ``would likely be hundreds, if not      thousands, of lawsuits around the country'' challenging      various aspects of the amendment. Similarly, Professor      Archibald Cox of Harvard Law School believes that ``there is      a substantial chance, even a strong probability, that * * *      federal courts all over the country would be drawn into its      interpretation and enforcement,'' and former Solicitor      General Charles Fried has testified that ``the amendment      would surely precipitate us into subtle and intricate legal      questions, and the litigation that would ensue would be      gruesome, intrusive, and not at all edifying.'' Other      commentators, such as former Attorney General William Barr,      believe that the political question and standing doctrines      likely would persuade courts to intervene in relatively few      situations, but that ``w]here the judicial power can properly      be invoked, it will most likely be reserved to address      serious and clear cut violations''.       Former Attorney General Barr may well be right that courts      would be reluctant to get involved in most balanced budget      cases. However, none of the commentators, included General      Barr himself, believes that the amendment would bar courts      from at least occasional intrusion into the budget process.      Accordingly, whether we would face an ``avalanche'' of      litigation or fewer cases alleging ``serious and clear cut      violations,'' a broad consensus exists that the amendment      creates the potential for the involvement of courts in      questions that are inappropriate for judicial resolution.  The proponents and sponsors do nothing to resolve this problem. They concede that the text of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting is silent with respect to judicial review, contending that silence ``strikes the right balance.''  Mr. Morrison is correct to challenged the Congress to say what it intends and what it means in the text of the proposed constitutional amendment itself. Instead, the majority is leaving to the courts themselves the determination of the challenges arising under the proposed amendment and its implementation and what they will hear and determine. They are to be guided by the vagaries of general, judicially-created doctrines of justiciability.  The sponsors and proponents also suggest that Congress may revisit this issue later through implementing legislation. Not only would such subsequent implementing legislation require agreement in both Houses and signature by the President or a supermajority override of a presidential veto, but even if ultimately enacted, it may not be able to restrict constitutionally-derived judicial power and responsibilityand may itself be overridden by the commands of article III and this proposed 28th amendment. Former Solicitor General Charles Fried has testified that a subsequent legislative effort to limit judicial power, ``itself might very well be unconstitutional.''  Further, as Mr. Barr pointed out in 1995, the State courts are not limited by the Federal requirement of ``case or controversy'' and its attendant justiciability doctrines:       Before moving on, I should point out for the Committee one      area that I believe does hold some potential for mischief and      that Congress may wish to address. That is the area of state      court review. The constraints of Article III do not, of      course, apply to state courts, which are courts of general      jurisdiction. State courts are not bound by the ``case or      controversy'' requirement or the other justiciability      principles, even when deciding issues of federal law,      including the interpretation of the Federal Constitution.      Asarco, Inc., 490 U.S. at 617. Accordingly, it is possible      that a state court could entertain a challenge to a federal      statute under the Balanced Budget Amendment despite the fact      that the plaintiff would not satisfy the requirements for      standing in federal court.  Although Mr. Gerson's written statement included the same point, almost verbatim, the proposed constitutional amendment and majority report are conveniently silent on this significant dimension of the judicial review problem. Nowhere do the proponents of this constitutional amendment confront the problem of uncontrolled judicial review by State court that has been articulated by their own witnesses on judicial review, who conclude that ``the State court in such a circumstance would have the authority to render a binding legal judgment.''  The proponents' dilemma may mirror that admitted by Mr. Barr at the 1995 hearings: Having acknowledged the concern that courts might order taxes raised as in Missouri v. Jenkins, Mr. Barr was asked by Senator Biden whether the proposed constitutional amendment ought not be revised to include an express limitation on court power and their authority to order certain types of remedies, Mr. Barr responded:       If I were a Senator, I would put it in the amendment. But      if I felt that would mean the amendment would not pass      because it would generate these arguments, oh, gee, this is      sort of like Eastern Europe, then I would without hesitation      support the amendment as written * * *  The proponents are refusing to confront the possibility of State court involvement and the possibility that courts in different States might reach inconsistent determinations or order contradictory remedies because it is difficult, its discussion might offend, and its solution might cost them a vote or two.  This is no way to amend the Constitution. Such ambiguity and conscious disregard of potential problems disserves the process, the proposed amendment, the American people and, possibly, the generations to come who will suffer under its unintended consequences.  In court challenges in which a constitutional violation were found by the court to exist, the question of appropriate remedy will loom large. Indeed, it is the possibility of judicially-imposed remedies to ensure compliance with the proposed constitutional amendment's command for balance each fiscal year that has raised the most concern historically as Congress considers this matter.  In 1994, Senator Danforth of Missouri successfully modified the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting. He sought to restrict judicial involvement to issuing declaratory judgments unless Congress specifically authorized another form of relief through implementing legislation and his amendment was accepted by the floor manager.  In 1995, the Senate likewise modified the proposed constitutional amendment when the floor manager adopted an amendment proffered by Senator Nunn of Georgia on judicial review. The Nunn amendment called for restricting the judicial power of the United States to matters specifically authorized by implementing legislation.  Neither the Danforth nor the Nunn language nor anything like them was included in Senate Joint Resolution 1. Indeed, in spite of these past attempts to limit judicial remedial authority in the proposed constitutional amendment and the only successful floor modifications to its text since 1993, the proponents now reject all such efforts. Instead, the proponents choose to remain silent on the many important issues surrounding judicial involvement in the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the proposed constitutional amendment.  They try to dismiss Missouri v. Jenkins, 496 U.S. 33 (1990), and the dangers it portends for this proposed constitutional amendment. In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the power of a Federal District Court Judge in Kansas City, MO, to order tax increases in order to improve the public schools. The Supreme Court upheld a district court order that a local school district levy taxes to raise funds to comply with the Court's order to remedy unconstitutional school segregation.  This case has spawned concern about what is sometimes referred to as judicial taxation and the Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the issue and on suggested legislation in the area in the last several years. Senator Danforth cited this case in the course of offering his amendment in 1994:       So after the case of Missouri versus Jenkins, decided by      the Supreme Court, it is clear that under certain      circumstances, the Federal courts have assumed the power to      impose taxes. And my concern was that Missouri versus Jenkins      could be the model for some future action by the Federal      courts.  The authority of the Federal courts to remedy constitutional violations is broad, as was demonstrated in Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990). In suits where a constitutional violation of the proposed budgeting amendment were found, courts would be left to make similar remedial decisions.  In light of the deliberate omission of limiting language like that previously included by Senator Danforth and Senator Nunn, the underlying proposal is more likely to be construed to authorize courts to enjoin spending, order taxes or issue a negative injunction maintaining the status. That will appear to be the intention of Congress. The absence of any limitations on the power of the judiciary to review and remedy violations supports the interpretation that Senate Joint Resolution 1 is intended to authorize the courts to engage in judicial review without the limitations those amendment included.  In the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton described the judiciary as ``the least dangerous branch'' because it ``has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or the wealth of the society.'' He then qualified his description, quoting Montesquieu as warning ``that `there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. ''  Adopting this proposed constitutional amendment would create precisely the peril warned against by Hamilton, because it would invite unelected judges to decide funding policy questions and exercise powers heretofore largely reserved to the legislative and executive branches. It would be a mistake of historic proportions.  This is a constitutional amendment that is being proposed. In other settings in which constitutional rights are being vindicated, when legislation enacted by Congress did not provide an effective remedy, the courts have created judicial ones. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971); Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). Thus, if Congress were to adopt enforcement legislation that failed to provide an effective remedy for violations, the courts might proceed on their own authority as required to fulfil their constitutional duties.  In addition, the underlying resolution would allow the President vast authority to deal with implementation, and possibly even to impound, funds obligated by Congress. The circumstances that would prevail after ratification of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting will not have previously existed. The President will have a lot to do with determining how the President's constitutional duties under article II, section 3, to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' and article II, section 7, to ``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution'' will be fulfilled.  Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment commands that ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of thewhole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.'' In any fiscal year in which it becomes apparent that in the absence of congressional action, ``total outlays'' will exceed ``total receipts,'' the President would determine how best to proceed and might well proceed as if required by the Constitution and the oath of office it prescribes to act to prevent the unauthorized deficit.  This common sense reading of the proposed constitutional amendment is shared by a broad range of highly regarded legal scholars. Then Assistant Attorney General (now Solicitor General) Walter Dellinger testified in 1995 before the Judiciary Committee that the proposed constitutional amendment would authorize the President to impound funds to insure that outlays do not exceed receipts.  Similarly, Harvard University Law School Professor Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, testified that in a year when actual revenues fell below projections and a bigger-then-authorized deficit occurred, section 1 ``would offer a President ample warrant to impound appropriated funds.''  Others who share this view include former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Stanford University Law School Professor Kathleen Sullivan, Yale University Law School Professor Burke Marshall, and Harvard University Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe.  This year the Secretary of the Treasury reinforced this prospect when he noted in his testimony before the Committee:       Some proponents have suggested that under these      circumstances, the President would stop issuing checks,      including those for Social Security benefits. . . . The      President might also impound funds of his choosing. . . . All      of these potential outcomes are extremely undesirable.  The impoundment power that would be conferred on the President by the proposed constitutional amendment is far broader than any the presidential line-item veto authority temporarily granted the President last year. As Assistant Attorney General Dellinger testified in 1995, the impoundment authority implied within the proposed constitutional amendment might allow a President to order across-the-board cuts in all Federal programs, target specific programs for abolition, or target expenditures intended for particular States or regions for impoundment. He testified that he would advise the President that he not only had the right but the constitutional obligation to prevent the violation of a constitutional mandate against budgetary imbalance.  The text of the proposed constitutional amendment does not address these matters. The majority report says that is not the intent of the Committee to grant the President any impoundment authority and suggests that ``up to the end of the fiscal year, the President has nothing to impound because Congress in the amendment has the power to ratify or to specify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that fiscal year.'' The majority report, thus, assumes there can never be an unauthorized deficit, because Congress always has a theoretical possibility of stepping in before the last minute ending the fiscal year and ratify whatever deficit has occurred. Under this construction, the proposed constitutional amendment is a cruel joke.  Moreover nothing in the proposed constitutional amendment prevents the Executive from acting to implement its terms. A President may not be willing to withhold based on a theoretical possibility of what the President knows or has reason to believe will not occur. Moreover a President may choose not to risk having all of the expenditures undertaken by the Federal Government for a portion of a fiscal year declared to have been expended in violation of the Constitution. It is more likely that a President, sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, would not view the Executive as powerless to prevent such a result.  Key House sponsors of the proposed constitutional amendment circulated materials on the role of the Executive that add context to the majority report's isolated declaration of intent and are consistent with this view of continuing involvement by the Executive in the implementation of the proscriptions contained within the proposed constitutional amendment. Representatives Schaefer and Stenholm acknowledge that the proposed constitutional amendment is intended to create ``an ongoing obligation to monitor outlays and receipts'' and to require the President ``at the point at which the Government `runs out of money,' to stop issuing checks.''  We also have experience to instruct us. This Administration's senior advisers have testified both in 1995 and in 1997 that their advice, against the backdrop of the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting having been ratified and an emerging deficit, would be to terminate or delay expenditures.  James C. Miller III, former OMB Director under President Reagan, echoed that advice. He revealed legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice that without congressional mandated spending priorities, the President could apply across-the-board reductions in outlays. Finally, he furnished a legal memorandum on presidential authority to forestall default on the public debt that was coauthored by a former Assistant Attorney General and head of the Office of Legal Counsel during the Reagan administration that asserts ``the President has inherent constitutional authority to choose which nondeferrable obligations to pay in the absence of a statute specifying a priority.''  A memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 21, 1995, that is now publicly available, reinforces these lines of reasoning:       Although this Office has consistently taken the position      that as a general matter the President does not possess      inherent authority to impound funds, we have carved out an      exception to the general rule for the situation in which the      President faces a debt ceiling and does not have any other      feasible method of raising funds. We have said that in such a      situation, because the President would be faced with      conflicting statutory demands, to comply with the direction      to spend yet not exceed the debt limit, he would be justified      in refusing to spend obligated funds. See Memorandum from      William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Re:      Presidential Authority to Impound Funds Appropriated for      Assistance to Federally Impacted Schools (December 1, 1969).      We believe that the President's power to reconcile      conflicting laws according to his best judgment could be      derived from his ultimate power as Chief Executive ``to take      care that the Laws be faithfully executed.''  The OLC Memorandum concludes:       Finally, at some point, after all other options have been      considered, consideration should be given to a program of      deferral of obligations and expenditures by the President.      Such a program would provoke considerable public controversy,      perhaps a constitutional confrontation with Congress, and      most certainly would be subjected to legal challenge. On the      last point, although we have not had an opportunity to arrive      at a definitive conclusion, we believe a strong argument can      be made both on statutory grounds and on the basis of his      inherent authority, that the President would have the power      to engage in such a program.  Similar analysis and reliance on inherent Executive authority could be expected to arise should the proposed constitutional amendment be ratified and the President faced with circumstances in which the legislative and executive branches are in gridlock over budgetary or spending matters or it appears to the President that the prediction for a balance between expenditures and revenues in any fiscal year is tilting toward deficit.  The proponents alternatively comment that Congress could specify in implementing legislation how it wanted the President to proceed in a budgetary or debt limit crisis. Reliance of subsequent implementing legislation is risky, at best. Such legislation would be subject to Presidential veto and the need for a supermajority override in both Houses. Moreover, such legislation would have to be comprehensive enough to foresee and control all possible future contingencies to be effective.  Further, the President's obligation to faithfully execute the laws is independent of Congress's. That duty is not ``limited to the enforcement of acts of Congress  * * * according to their express terms,  * * * it include[s] the rights, duties and obligations growing out of the Constitution itself,  * * * and all the protection implied by the nature of the government under theConstitution[.]'' In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 64 (1890). If an unconstitutional deficit were occurring, Congress could not constitutionally stop the President from seeking to prevent it.  Finally, any reliance on the 159-year old case of Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 542 (1838), would be misplaced. That case can as easily be read to support presidential impoundment authority under the proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting. In that case, Congress had ordered the Postmaster General to pay the claimant whatever sum an outside arbitrator determined was the appropriate settlement. When the Postmaster General paid a smaller amount, the Supreme Court held that the Postmaster General could be ordered to comply with the congressional directive. The Court ruled that the President, and those under his supervision, did not possess inherent authority to impound funds that Congress had ordered to be spent: ``To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the Constitution and entirely inadmissible.'' Id. at 611.  If the proposed constitutional amendment were ratified and became a part of the Constitution, the President's obligation to execute the laws would arguably have a constitutional fulcrum from which to leverage. The President could argue that when the constitutional duty to ensure fiscal year balance came into conflict with a statutory obligation to expend authorized, appropriated, or obligated funds, the constitutional responsibility had to be given priority as predicated on superior authority.  The proposed constitutional amendment's mandate to ensure budget balance for each fiscal year specifies no role or limitation on the power of the President. The majority report concedes that implementation and enforcement will necessarily involve the Executive Branch beyond the President's obligation pursuant to section 3 to have transmitted to the Congress a proposed budget prior to each fiscal year in which total outlays do not exceed total revenues.  The majority report noted:       Both the President and Members of Congress swear an oath to      uphold the Constitution, including any amendments thereto.      Honoring this pledge requires respecting the provisions of      the proposed amendment. Flagrant disregard of the proposed      amendment's clear and simple provisions would constitute      nothing less than a betrayal of public trust. In their      campaigns for reelection, elected officials who flout their      responsibilities under this amendment will find that the      political process will provide the ultimate enforcement      mechanism.  If this proposed constitutional amendment were to become the supreme law of the land, some future President may well choose to enforce its terms, in the absence of binding limitations in implementing authority, to make greater use of Executive Branch discretion and authority than this Congress has taken the time to consider.  This fundamental shift in the allocation of power and authority among the Federal branches is neither wise nor necessary. It risks despotism at the very times when despots are most likely to arise and in which our fundamental guarantees of liberty and individual freedoms has been the checks and balances that the branches of our Federal Government exert over each other.  In spite of these acknowledged problems with the underlying resolution, the sponsors and proponents voted lock-step to table the Kennedy amendment without any effort to cure any of the serious constitutional flaws that it highlighted.  We cannot legislate political courage and responsibility. No amendment to the Constitution can supply the people's representatives with these essential attributes. Indeed, the majority report concludes that the ultimate enforcement mechanism that can lead to balancing the budget is the electorate's power to vote. That power already exists. Moreover, the underlying resolution would undercut rather than enhance our democratic principles of majority rule and separation of powers and would ultimately lead to a loss of political accountability to the electorate.  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us achieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past 4 years--recent history that the majority report seeks to ignore. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit every year of the past four. We have cut the deficit by more than 60 percent in that time while pursuing sound economic and strong fiscal policies.  Now we need to stay the course and work in a bipartisan way to make further progress. We should now be focusing our attention and energies on the strenuous tasks of building a working consensus on budget priorities and achieving agreement on how to balance the budget.  This crusade for an illusionary quick-fix by constitutional amendment only makes that job more difficult. The time and resources devoted to reconsidering a constitutional amendment on the budget merely serve as a distraction from the real task at hand.  Let us not be distracted from the true means to deficit reduction: Let us proceed to consider and adopt a budget and deficit reduction package consistent with the progress made since 1993. As Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testified before the Committee on January 17, ``politically, historically, and economically, the forces are in place to balance the budget. We are not far apart. Now we need to get the job done.''  Let us not sacrifice the Constitution or our Nation's fiscal policies to a siren song but turn to the work needed to continue reducing the deficit without sacrificing our Nation's commitments to seniors, veterans, education, the environment, public infrastructure and our fundamental constitutional principles. There is no need for a constitutional amendment to achieve our goals.  The questions raised during the debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1 will not go away and cannot be ignored. They point to a series of fatal flaws in proposing to conduct our Nation's economic and budgetary functions by means of a simply-sounding constitutional declaration. A recent editorial in the Burlington Free Press said it more succinctly: ``amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget would be like using a sledgehammer to nail a picket in a fence.''  Two years ago Senator Mark Hatfield's decisive vote against a constitutional amendment on budgeting was a contemporary profile in courage. Senator Hatfield had wisdom gained from his years as a public servant and personal fortitude and integrity that sustained him through very difficult times before and after that vote. Here was a man and a representative who was put to the test and not only survived but emerged as a powerful example for us all.  On February 8, 1995, Senator Hatfield came to this Senate floor to explain how he would vote. He said:       As I explain my thoughts on the balanced budget amendment,      I want to make it very clear that I believe the deficit must      be reduced and that a balanced budget is worth achieving. It      is possible that I will be the lone Republican to vote      against the balanced budget amendment, but I say now to my      colleagues that I share my party's goals, but happen to      disagree on the means.       The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about      reducing the budget deficit, it is about amending the      Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick.      This amendment that is before Members now puts new Senate and      House rules regarding voting procedures into the      Constitution. It does not balance the budget and gives no      indication of how this might be done. Furthermore, it will      not force Congress to budget responsibility. If indeed this      is an amendment requiring a balanced budget, then how can we      allow Congress to essentially suspend the Constitution with a      three-fifths vote? This was a dangerous idea last year, and      it is a dangerous idea this year as well. What other      constitutional requirements would we like to waive with a      three-fifths vote? Freedom of religion? Free speech? What      other civil liberties shall we waive? A balanced budget      amendment would allow the Congress to ignore the requirement      for a balanced budget and to ignore the Constitution. This      idea of Congress suspending a constitutional requirement cuts      against the separation of powers principle so crucial to the      foundation of the Constitution.       A balanced budget can come only through leadership and      compromise. This compromise must come from each one of us.      But, most importantly, it must come from those we represent--     those who do not want their taxes raised any more than we      want to raise them--those who do not want their benefits cut      any more than we want to cut them. In the end there is no      easy answer, and there never will be. Regardless of the      procedural restraint in place, where there is political     will to create a balanced budget we will create one, where      there is will to avoid one, we will avoid it* * * .  As I stated during the debate on a balanced budget amendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote for a fig leaf.       If I am skeptical about the ability of a gimmick to fix our      budget, I am not skeptical about the ability of the people to      demand and keep demanding that we respond to the budget      challenge with real action. Real action is not a vote for an      amendment to the Constitution which calls for a balanced      budget by the year 2002. Real action is rolling up our      sleeves and getting our fiscal house in order. Real action is      working together, in a bipartisan fashion, to create a      balanced budget, not to simply promise one. Real action means      ending some programs--programs with popular appeal and vocal      constituencies. Balancing the budget will result in an impact      on each and every one of us--do we have the will to do that?       Bipartisan negotiation, leadership, and compromise have      been the cornerstones upon which we have built all effective      decisions on tough issues since the formation of our      Government. Compromises are difficult to reach, but they are      not impossible to reach. We have just received the      President's budget. The ensuing debate on the budget will      provide the chance for the Congress to work together to      balance the Federal programs of this budget. I hope the      Congress does not miss this opportunity to debate the real      issue of balancing the budget. Voting for a balanced budget      amendment is easy, working to balance the budget will not be.       The Congress should not promise to the people that it will      balance the Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If      the Congress has the political will to balance the budget, it      should simply use the power that it already has to do so.      There is no substitute for political will and there never      will be.  In May 1995, not long after his historic vote and after he had retained his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee after being attacked by fellow Republicans for his vote of conscience and in defense of the Constitution, Senator Hatfield had occasion to repeat the following observations about balancing the Federal budget:       I believe that a balanced budget can come only through      leadership and compromise. This compromise must come from      each one of us. More importantly, it must come from those we      represent. In the end, there is no easy answer. If there is a      political will to create a balanced budget, we will create      one, and if there is will to avoid one, we will avoid it.  I am deeply disappointed to learn that the Republican National Committee has been running attack advertisements in newspapers and on the radio over the past few days regarding the final vote on this proposed constitutional amendment. These attack ads are aimed at blackmailing specific Members of Congress to ignore their consciences and vote for this flawed constitutional amendment. It is wrong to play politics with the Constitution of the United States. It is wrong to try to punish any Member in this body who may choose to vote his or her conscience on this matter of constitutional proportion with its serious consequences to our system of checks and balances. I am disgusted by it.  We should all remember the courageous example of Senator Mark Hatfield, and vote our own conscience and use our own best judgment on this matter of constitutional amendment. I commend the Senators who are not blindly voting for a poll-tested bumper sticker, but who instead are exercising their best judgment and voting to defeat a seriously flawed proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States. These Senators are those acting with courage.  By our Senate oath of office we each commit to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' We owe to our constituents our best judgment on matters of this importance. We owe to our children and future generations the protections of separation of powers and checks and balances from our Constitution that have served us so well without diminution for political expediency.  Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?
