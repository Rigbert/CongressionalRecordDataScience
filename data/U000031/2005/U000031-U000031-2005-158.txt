Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Civil War Veteran Elisha Johns, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his courage and valor as a Corporal during the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi. This Saturday, May 28th, the Porter Township Board and the folks of Union, Michigan will honor Mr. Johns during a ceremony at his gravesite in Plum Grove Cemetery.  Elisha enlisted with the Union Army on August 9th, 1862, with whom he served until his discharge on June 6, 1865. After his enlistment, his leadership and courage was recognized by his superiors as he was made Corporal and promoted to Sergeant soon thereafter. His true valor was demonstrated on May 22, 1863, the date he earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.  It was the beginning of the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi and there was a call for volunteers to bridge a dike that was essential for a Union victory. Corporal Johns was one of 150 men that felt called to duty and valiantly set out to construct the bridge. Before they succeeded in bridging the dike, two-thirds of Elisha's fellow soldiers were shot and unable to go on. However, Corporal Johns and his peers boldly continued, while under intense Confederate fire, only to find his supporting soldiers had retreated. As it was early in the day, and military support lacking, Elisha was forced to hide along the base of the dike until darkness fell, when he was able to successfully get back to the Union lines. Forty years after his brave act, Corporal Johns was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As we come together as a Nation this Memorial Day, we honor the heroes of yesterday like Elisha Johns, who gave so much to our great Nation, and to honor those brave men and women of our armed forces who are on the front lines today, sacrificing so much in the name of freedom.  I commend all the folks of Union, Michigan, who are committed to preserving the history of our veterans, such as Corporal Johns, so generations to come will remember the sacrifices of their forefathers that played such a vital role in making our great Nation.                          ____________________
