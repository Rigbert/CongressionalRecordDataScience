Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Walter Capps as well. Congressman Capps served on the Committee on Science for the last 10 months, and I got to know the quality of this individual during our rather lengthy meetings in an attempt, successfully, to achieve bipartisan policy to advance the cause of science and education.  Mr. Capps was a tremendous asset to the committee, not only because of his ethical principles, but also because of his background in education and knowing what works in the educational arena and what does not.  But I think the true mark of this man was a conversation that I had with him about 4 months ago after a very long, productive and bipartisan session in the Committee on Science, where he told me that he was so pleased with seeing how Congress should work actually working out.  After our session in the Committee on Science was over with, he said he was invited to participate in a meeting by some people on the Democratic side of the aisle who were not quite as bipartisan in outlook as Mr. Capps was, and the Committee on Science has been. And he said, ``You know, after seeing how productive the Science Committee was working on a bipartisan basis, I just could not attend the meeting to try to disrupt the operations of the House.''  Walter Capps was one of the most principled people I have ever met, and this House and this country has really suffered a great loss with his passing.
