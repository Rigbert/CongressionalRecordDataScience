 This was the first amendment adopted 2 weeks ago and the Senator from Illinois is here at the last minute trying to unravel an amendment that got 70 votes. A Domenici amendment was passed 70-30 2 weeks ago and here at the last minute we are trying to unravel it.  It is no surprise that there is some confusion about what is going on. My conclusion is that a vote that got 70 Members of the Senate maybe ought to stand. I think the Durbin amendment should be opposed.                     Amendment No. 164, as Modified
