Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Solomon amendment and in strong support of the substitute language.  Mr. Chairman, English is fast becoming the language of the world. It is not we English speakers who need to fear the integrity of our language; it is, indeed, others who have concerns.  We, as I said earlier in this debate, who support so strongly the principles of the Helsinki Act, have advocated in country after country after country that they give to people within their country respect of their cultural and their national identities. Of course, language is a critical component of that.  The Soviet Union, my friends will recall, tried to have everybody speak Russian on the concept that if everybody spoke Russian, there would be a sense of unity within the Soviet Union. But that unity was at the point of a sword. It will not get you what you want.  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the substitute, and opposition to the Solomon amendment.
