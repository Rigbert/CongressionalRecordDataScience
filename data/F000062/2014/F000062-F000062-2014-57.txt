 President, I am very pleased to express my strong support for two highly qualified nominees to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California:  Superior Court Judge Beth Freeman, and James Donato.  I recommended these candidates to President Obama after my bipartisan screening committee gave them both strong recommendations.  I am very pleased they will soon fill two longstanding vacancies in the Northern District of California.  Judge Freeman earned her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1979, and she served in the County Counsel's Office in San Mateo for 18 years.  She has spent the last 12 years on the San Mateo Superior Court, including as presiding judge and assistant presiding judge. She has presided over more than a thousand trials, and she has experience in both civil and criminal cases.  I have received letters of support for Judge Freeman from Don Horsley, president of the San Mateo Board of Supervisors and former chair of the County's Domestic Violence Council, and from Stephen Wagstaffe, San Mateo District Attorney.  These letters are strong endorsements for Judge Freeman, and I will simply quote what Mr. Wagstaffe said: ``In 36 years as a prosecutor in San Mateo County, I have not seen a better judge in all respects than Judge Freeman.''  That is very high praise, and I am pleased Judge Freeman soon will be confirmed and begin her service as a Federal judge in San Jose.  Let me now describe Jim Donato, who once confirmed will serve in San Francisco.  Mr. Donato earned his law degree from Stanford Law School where he was a Senior Editor of the Stanford Law Review. He clerked for Judge Procter Hug on the Ninth Circuit.  He served for 3 years in the City Attorney's Office in San Francisco. He has built a distinguished record over two decades as a private practitioner handling complex civil cases such as antitrust cases, at Cooley LLP and Shearman & Sterling LLP.  Complex civil experience is especially important in Northern California because the Northern District's docket is 84 percent civil, according to the most recent statistics.  Mr. Donato also is a leader in the San Francisco legal community where he has devoted much of his time to the Bar Association of San Francisco, including as its President in 2008.  I have great confidence Mr. Donato will be an outstanding federal district judge.  Let me close by noting that each of these nominees will fill a judicial vacancy that has been designated as a ``judicial emergency'' by the Judicial Conference of the United States.  The Northern District's weighted caseload per judgeship is over 13 percent above the national average. Filings per active judge are up 17 percent since 2008. In fact, it now takes 27 percent longer for a civil case to get to trial than it did in 2010.  The vacancy Judge Freeman would fill has existed for over 800 days. The vacancy Mr. Donato would fill has existed for over 500 days.  It is long past time for these seats to be filled. Indeed, each of these nominees should have been confirmed in 2013--but, unfortunately, each had to be renominated in this session and voted out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time. This wasted several months during which each could have been serving as a Federal Judge.  Nevertheless, I am very pleased that, today, Judge Freeman and Jim Donato will be confirmed and will be able to assume their duties shortly.  I urge my colleagues to support both of these fine nominees.                          ____________________
