 Mr. Speaker, despite a President that has been unwilling to negotiate in good faith, the Agriculture Committee, on both sides of the aisle, has produced a solid compromise. And for the first time, under Chairman Collin Peterson's leadership, this House has provided authority for the agricultural interests of this country to lead America forward into a new energy age.  The committee also has provided $1 billion to secure specialty crop production in America for a change, to try to stunt foreign imports, while also providing critical increases for farmers markets to help empower local family farmers. And while there are some trade provisions that were airdropped into this bill, not by the Agriculture Committee that should have been considered in a different manner, the agriculture provisions of this bill are critical for transforming our economy into the 21st century.  In a world of increasing trade deficits and economic instability, the production of food, fiber, forestry and now fuel, are all critical for protecting America's economic independence, and her food security.  I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson for his incredible leadership. He is the right man at the right place at the right time. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the base bill. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.
