  Madam President, this amendment and this discussion both are not about the cost of production of agricultural commodities. This amendment and this discussion are about payment limits and the need to prevent public funds from being used by the biggest producers to become even larger by bidding up cash trends and capitalizing their extra profits from production into land values.
