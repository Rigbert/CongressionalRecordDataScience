SCOTT. Mr. President, it is not a secret that our party and this body have been working on healthcare for about 10 years. Anyone who doesn't understand and appreciate that the individual mandate and its effects in our bill take nothing at all away from anyone who needs a subsidy, anyone who wants to continue their coverage--it does not have a single letter in there about preexisting conditions or any actual health feature.
