Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Again, I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, chairman of the subcommittee, ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the staff members, the leadership in the House, everyone who has contributed to what I think is an extraordinary product in this bill.  This bill is going to make vital investment in the crumbling infrastructure of the country to refurbish it, maintain it, improve it. It is going to anticipate growth needs and congestion. It is going to contribute to the growth of our economy. It is going to put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people to work, and we do all this without borrowing any money, creating anymore deficit or debt. That is the most extraordinary thing about this bill and the most notable achievement.  We, unlike many other Federal programs, have an investment that is totally paid for by the taxpayers and will be of tremendous benefit to those same taxpayers. The money will be spent in the manner in which it was intended when it was collected from individuals and from commercial drivers at the pump, and this will be, I believe, the signature domestic legislation of this Congress in terms of the positive impact on the economy of our country.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
