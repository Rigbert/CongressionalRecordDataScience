President, I ask the Senator this question: When you put it in terms of what they actually do, when you say the Republican approach in the House and Senate favors large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, while the Democratic approach tries to provide a benefit to working families, to those who have been recently unemployed, and to smaller businesses to deal with depreciation, clearly what emerges from this is a question of justice and fairness. Why in the world would you reward a profitable corporation with over a billion dollars in tax cuts when they don't even promise to create a job? Why would you send a massive amount of tax rebate to somebody making a million dollars a year when, clearly, they are not sacrificing, and then ignore those who are struggling?  That justice and fairness argument is one that we have heard on the floor. I have made it myself. I think most people would react positively to it. We are talking about stimulating the economy, and a question that has to be asked and answered is: Regardless of to whom you give the money, will you get the desired result? If you gave the money to the wealthiest corporations, whether it was fair or not, and America's economy went flying forward, you would say it worked; conversely, if you gave it to those who were recently unemployed, whether it was fair or not, and the economy moved forward, you would say it worked.  Let me ask about the economic effectiveness of the approach of the Republicans versus the approach of the Democrats when it comes to stimulating the economy.
