Every previous change that I know of, and you and I have been here about the same time. I have been here perhaps a couple of years longer than you. Every change that I know of in the ethics rules have been affected by a bipartisan agreement until this one. There were only a few votes, I think we were almost unanimous on our side, which is not unusual, which is why the ethics rules has historically been separate and apart, perhaps in the rules package, but agreed to in a bipartisan fashion. And that is my concern.  Mr. DeLAY. Will the gentleman yield?
