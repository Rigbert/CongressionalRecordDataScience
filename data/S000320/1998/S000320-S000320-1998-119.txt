 President, I would just like to tell my colleagues in the Senate, some of them are here on the floor and in their offices, Senator Lautenberg and I are ready to move this bill toward third reading. We haven't heard from anyone. We will give a few more minutes in case somebody wants to get in, or offer an amendment to this bill, but we believe this is a well put together bill, as I said earlier. Both sides have put a lot of work into it. We should not keep Senators here all evening. We will move as soon as we can.  If we don't hear from somebody on the floor in just a few minutes, it is my idea, if Senator Lautenberg concurs at that time, to move to third reading.
