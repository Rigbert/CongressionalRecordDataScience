Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 2872, the Indian Arts and Crafts Enforcement Act of 2000. This bill will facilitate the initiation of suits by Indian tribes pursuant to the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this, and why we did not roll all these bills into one, I will never know, but that is not my pay grade. I urge the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
