Mr. Speaker, I have worked with many people in my life, and one thing about Mollie Beattie, she and I had our differences at one of our hearings, and she came to my office the day after the hearing and apologized to me for not having all her information correct and saying, in fact, that will never happen again, Congressman. And I have always respected her from that moment on, and we had this working relationship. The only thing I can suggest is it is just unknown in this town for many, many years. I just wish that other Federal agency heads that are appointed would understand one thing: This is a legislative branch and executive branch, and the ability to achieve goals is what we should be seeking. I cannot say that for everyone else that works in the Department of the Interior, but I could say it for her, and I said it prior to her demise, in fact, while she was still in office I spoke to her on occasion in my State, which was not too popular, I know, with this administration. But the truth of the matter, she always was there in a straightforward position, presented her view as she saw it without being arrogant or without being abrasive and was always being honest, and to me that meant a great deal.
