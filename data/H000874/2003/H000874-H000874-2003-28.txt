Speaker, reclaiming my time, as the majority leader knows, there is substantial concern on this side of the aisle in this part of the House that some 206 or more districts, perhaps, will be left out of this bill in terms of consideration for individualeducation and/or health projects. I want to express our great concern about that. There has been a lot of discussion about it in the press, a lot of discussion about it on the floor. The gentleman does not necessarily need to comment on it, but I want to emphasize to him the great concern that we have, as two people who have served on the Committee on Appropriations. The majority leader is not on the Committee on Appropriations now, but he has served on that committee. I am not sure he has been on there 2 decades, but a long time. If that occurs, in my memory that would be the first time.  Now, of course when Mr. Natcher was the Chair, there were no specific projects delineated for individual districts listed in that bill. But from the time that that started to be done in the mid-90s, this is the first time that I can recall on this bill or any other bill, that there has been a blanket preclusion of over 200 districts from participation in the investments made in those bills in the welfare of the American people. So I want to express that. The gentleman does not need to respond to that. I will yield to him if he wants to make a comment. He does not need to respond, but I want to reiterate that.  Mr. Leader, on the conference report on energy, I also want to ask you about the labor-health because of the magnitude of these bills.                              {time}  1230  The energy bill, obviously, is a major piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation. For the past several weeks you and I have been talking about conferences. You indicated this bill is coming to the floor. I again bring to your attention, Mr. Leader, that our Members appointed by the Speaker to the conference have no knowledge of a meaningful conference having been held on this bill. They do not have any meaningful knowledge of what might be in the bill.  That is true as well, I will tell the leader, of the labor-health bill. I am a conferee on the labor-health bill. I have received no notices of meetings. I have attended no meetings. I have learned of no meetings with respect to that bill. The lack of the ability of Democrats to participate in these conferences, again, I tell the leader from my perspective, is unprecedented. It is certainly not unprecedented when Members meet with them. One side of the aisle would talk about their strategies, their priorities, their objectives. But, historically, when conferences have met, both sides have been invited to attend. There has been discussion about issues.  The energy bill which is contemplated to come to this floor next week, I tell the gentleman, our side does not perceive that has happened. They have not participated. And I know that there has been a pledge that the conferees will at least, even though they are not participating, not invited, not able to articulate their view, will at least get 48 hours receipt of the conference report for the opportunity to review it for 2 days before it comes to the floor.  I ask the leader in the case of the energy bill, will that be the policy on this side of the aisle and, therefore, if the energy bill is coming on Wednesday or Thursday, will the conferees receive at least a copy of the conference report no later than Monday?  Mr. DeLAY. After consulting with the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), I am confident that the House will be able to take up this conference report next week; and if we go forward with that schedule, I can assure the gentleman that the language of the conference report will be circulated sometime on Monday so that the conferees will have the opportunity to review it before the conference committee completes its business.  This schedule should also allow plenty of time for all Members of the House to review the conference report before it is scheduled. As the gentleman also knows, the conference is a long time coming. There was a full conference formal meeting on September 5. All Members were invited and I think all Members attended. But I would like to point out to the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, that in House committees alone there have been 80 public hearings, 11 markups and 224 amendments considered on this bill. And since 2001 the House has dedicated 5 legislative days to debating the energy bill on the floor with 39 amendments considered.  Since 2002, the energy conferees have held nine public meetings to debate the comprehensive national energy bill for a total of 24 hours and 47 minutes. And in 2003 alone, Republican and Democratic energy conference staff have met no less than 10 times for more than 48 hours of discussions. And, ultimately, the decision on whether or not there will be additional conference committees does not lie in the House because the Senate is chairing the conference. And should there be an additional meeting, I can assure the gentleman that all the Members on the House side of that conference will be invited to attend.
