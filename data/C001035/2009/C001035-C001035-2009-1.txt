President, today, along with my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, I am introducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. This bill will ensure the Environmental Protection Agency has accurate information about the extent of mercury pollution in our nation as it works to enforce regulations about this toxic chemical.  Mercury is a dangerous substance that can cause serious neuron-developmental harm, especially to children and pregnant women. Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, estimate that some 630,000 infants are born each year with blood mercury levels higher than what is considered safe.  Mercury is hazardous not only to people, but also to wildlife. As of 2006, States issued 533 new fish advisories bringing the nationwide total advisories to 3,851. These advisories cover 38 percent of the Nation's total lake acreage and 26 percent of the Nation's total river miles. Almost 65 percent of the U.S. coastline, except Alaska, is under advisory, including 92 percent of the Atlantic coast and 100 percent of the Gulf coast.  Each new scientific study seems to find higher levels of mercury in more ecosystems and in more species than we had previously thought. We must have more comprehensive information and we must have it soon; otherwise, we risk making misguided policy decisions.  For example, in 2005 the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new mercury regulation based on computer measurements that were not peer-reviewed and that were not verified with actual measurements. The effect of the regulation was to allow power plants to continue spewing unlimited amounts of mercury into our air until the year 2018. Many experts, including the EPA Inspector General, sharply criticized the science underlying that new regulation and recommended that EPA develop and implement a mercury monitoring plan. That was a major reason why I am introducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act.  Specifically, my mercury bill would establish mercury monitoring sites across the nation in order to measure mercury levels in the air, rain, soil, lakes and streams, as well as in plants and animals; authorize about $30 million annually for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 for the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Geological Survey, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Park Service to perform scientific mercury measurements; and create a ``Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee'' to advise the Administrator of the EPA in choosing the monitoring sites.  We must establish a more robust national mercury monitoring network to provide EPA the data it needs to make decisions that protect the people and environment of Maine and the entire Nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2913       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive National      Mercury Monitoring Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that       (1)(A) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant      ecological and public health concern;       (B) exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of      contaminated fish;       (C) children and women of childbearing age who consume      large quantities of fish are at high risk of adverse effects;       (D) it is estimated that more than 630,000 children born      each year in the United States are exposed to levels of      mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair      neurological development; and       (E) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have      found that 8 percent of women in the United States of      childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of      values determined to be safe by the Environmental Protection      Agency;       (2)(A) as of 2006, 3,080 fish consumption advisories due to      mercury contamination have been issued for 48 States,      including 23 statewide advisories for freshwater and 12      statewide advisories for coastal waters;       (B) that is a 26 percent increase over the number of      advisories issued in 2004;       (C) those advisories represent more than 22,000 square      miles of lakes and 882,000 miles of rivers;       (D) however, fish and shellfish are an important source of      dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important      to the economy of the United States; and       (E) the extent of fish consumption advisories underscores      the extensive human and ecological health risk posed by      mercury pollution;       (3)(A) in many locations, the primary route for mercury      input to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions,      transport, and deposition;       (B) the cycling of mercury in the environment and resulting      accumulation in biota are not fully understood; and       (C) computer models and other assessment tools provide      varying effectiveness in predicting mercury concentrations in      fish, and no broad-scale data sets exist to test model      predictions;       (4)(A) on September 14 through 17, 2003, the Environmental      Protection Agency cosponsored a Society of Environmental      Toxicology and Chemistry workshop involving more than 30      international experts to formulate a system to quantify and      document mercury changes in the various environment fields      resulting from anticipated reductions in mercury emissions in      the United States; and       (B) the resulting plan proposes a holistic, multimedia,      long-term mercury monitoring program that is documented in 2      sources--       (i) on January 1, 2005, the article entitled ``Monitoring      the Response to Changing Mercury Deposition'' was published      in the journal Environmental Science and Technology; and       (ii) in 2008, the book entitled ``Ecosystem Responses to      Mercury Contamination: Indicators of Change'' was published      by CRC Press;       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, many      regulations limiting mercury emissions from different sources      have gone into effect or will be implemented, but ongoing      monitoring programs are not adequately measuring the      environmental benefits and effectiveness of mercury emission      controls;       (6) on May 15, 2006, the Office of Inspector General of the      Environmental Protection Agency issued a report entitled,      ``Monitoring Needed to Assess Impact of EPA's Clean Air      Mercury Rule (CAMR) on Potential Hotspots'' , Report No.      2006-P-0025, which states, in part--       (A) ``Without field data from an improved monitoring      network, EPA's ability to advance mercury science will be      limited and `utility-attributable hotspots' that pose health      risks may occur and go undetected''; and       (B) ``We recommend that the EPA develop and implement a      mercury monitoring plan to assess the impact of CAMR, if      adopted, on mercury deposition and fish tissue and evaluate      and refine mercury estimation tools and models'';       (7)(A) on January 1, 2007, the articles entitled      ``Biological Mercury Hotspots in the Northeastern U.S. and      Southeastern Canada'' and ``Contamination in Remote Forest      and Aquatic Ecosystems in the Northeastern U.S.: Sources,      Transformations and Management Options'' were published in      the journal BioScience; and       (B) the authors of the articles--       (i) identified 5 biological mercury hotspots and 9 areas of      concern in the northeastern United States and southeastern      Canada associated primarily with atmospheric mercury      emissions and deposition;       (ii) located an area of particularly high mercury      deposition adjacent to a coal-fired utility in southern New      Hampshire; and       (iii) concluded that local impacts from mercury emissions      should be closely monitored in order to assess the impact of      Federal and State policies; and       (8)(A) building on previous efforts in 2003, on May 5      through 7, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency      coconvened a workshop with experts from the United States      Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service,      the National Park Service, State and tribal agencies, the      BioDiversity Research Institute, the National Atmospheric      Deposition Program, industry, and other institutions;       (B) more than 50 workshop scientists participated and      agreed on a goal and major design elements for a national      mercury monitoring program, including a national distribution      of approximately 20 intensive sites to understand the      sources, consequences, and trends in United States mercury      pollution;       (C) the consortium found that ``policy makers, scientists      and the public need a comprehensive and integrated mercury      monitoring network to accurately quantify regional and      national changes in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem      contamination, and bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and      wildlife in response to changes in mercury emissions.''; and       (D) the workshop findings are published in a report of the      Environmental Protection Agency (430-K-09-001).
