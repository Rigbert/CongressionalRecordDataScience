Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition to Section 3145 of the House reconciliation bill that will deny health care to our poorest Americans who desperately need and deserve it. This provision would require people who apply for Medicaid to prove that they are citizens, by producing a birth certificate or a passport. This may not sound like a difficult task to some, but the reality is much, much different.  Many older Americans do not have birth certificates because their parents did not have access to hospitals, and so, they were born at home. This was true in rural America, and is still true in some places today. Also, in the last century, all over the south, because of segregation and racial discrimination, many hospitals would not take minorities. Many minorities, including African Americans, were born at home and don't have a birth certificate.  These people were kept out of the health care system when they came into. the world. To keep these same people off of Medicaidand further deny these men and women health care is yet another slap in the face. The health system failed these people once, and it should not fail them again.  This rule is arbitrary. It is dangerous. And it is wrong.  Even the Department of Health and Human Services agrees that it is unnecessary. There is no evidence that illegal immigrants are getting Medicaid illegally.  This is very dangerous. If this becomes law, state and county officials will decide how to enforce this rule. Therefore, anyone with dark skin, or an accent or who looks like an undocumented immigrant will be at great risk for discrimination.  American citizens, particularly the poor, minorities, and the very old, who are eligible for Medicaid, will be denied the health care that they need. All for a misguided attempt to keep undocumented immigrants from receiving health care. It is unjust and it is wrong. It is un-American and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this provision.                          ____________________
