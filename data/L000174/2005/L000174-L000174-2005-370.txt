President, I wish to take a few moments to bring people up to date on where we are on the John Roberts nomination to the Supreme Court.  It is now a little over a week since President Bush made a dramatic evening announcement of his intention to nominate John Roberts to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. In the Senate, we haven't received this nomination. It has not come up yet. Nonetheless, we are well on the way to preparation for the Senate's process in considering the nomination.  During the past weeks, some of us have met with Judge Roberts. We have urged him to be forthcoming at his upcoming hearing.
