President, I thank the distinguished manager and chairman.  I have listened to the speech of my distinguished colleague from Missouri, and if this indeed was simply a question of whether the States could make the decisions or not, it would be one thing, but it is not. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Under the bill of the distinguished Republican leader, the States have the right to make a decision--a decision to choose to take a block grant instead of food stamps, or to participate in the Food Stamp Program. The amendment, No. 2562, by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, removes that right.  I think, also, it removes an option available to many of the elderly and disabled. If somebody has received 24 months of assistance in their lifetime, then food stamps can no longer be made available unless they are working. We see where, if somebody has had assistance years before, worked many, many, many years before becoming disabled, they are told ``You got your bite of the apple a long time ago.'' They lose their food assistance under this amendment. States no longer have the option, under this amendment, of choosing a block grant instead of food stamps, and participating in the Food Stamp Program.  The bill does impose on States, whether they want it or not, an unfair formula for providing funds. If you look at the formula, it penalizes growth States but also penalizes States that face recessions. During the last recession, when millions of people lost their jobs, they turned to food stamps to help feed their children. Under this amendment, when there is a recession, then benefits would be cut. Just when a temporarily out of luck family would need assistance, the amendment says, ``Too bad, have a hungry day.'' For example, if you are an industrial State and large manufacturing plants suddenly close, that is when this could cut in. It seems, when fewer people need food stamps, the benefits increase again.  Let me give an example. In California a couple of years ago, there was a massive earthquake. Mr. President, 40 percent of all the food stamps issued in California were issued in L.A. County for that month. Basically, what we would say under this is we are going to allow the people who lost everything they had in L.A. County because of the earthquake to eat. But all the rest of the State is going to go hungry.  One of the things the Food Stamp Program is supposed to do is to help even out those kinds of peaks and valleys because the earthquake that occurs in California may be the hurricane that occurs in Florida or the recession that occurs in Illinois or the flood that occurs along the Mississippi or Missouri River.  So I think we should not eliminate the choice of whether States should decide to take the block grant. Congress should not impose that on them. There are a lot of decisions that Governors and legislators have to make, so I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. It removes the State"s right to decide, hurts the elderly and disabled, and hurts some States at the expense of the others.  I like the original Agriculture Committee bill written by Senator Lugar. It gives the States plenty of flexibility. It does not abandon the Federal-State partnership.  We have worked for years, constantly, to improve aspects of the food stamp program. The bill I talked about before that I introduced, on electronics benefits transfer, will do that. We have tightened and limited eligibility. But in the only major power on Earth that can not only raise enough food to feed 250 million people but have food left over for export and for storage, I question whether we should tamper with the most basic program for feeding hungry people--the elderly, disabled, those temporarily out of a job.  There are those who rip off the system and we can nail them. We have laws to do that. But let us not say you are going to be removed. And let us not say this is something that encourages more babies. What are you going to say, that if we do not feed a hungry baby, if we cut off the food, that baby will suddenly go away? Are we saying do not have the baby, abort the child, or do something else? The fact of the matter is, a hungry child is a hungry child. That child does not make that decision to be hungry. That child does not make that decision to be born. Let us not think that child will go away if we simply cut the food stamps or any other benefits for them.  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana for his courtesy and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Indiana is recognized.                         Privilege of the Floor
