 This is a provision that I have also supported. The provision included in the bill will go a long way for those seniors who live in the affected CCRCs. I also want to clarify one point with Senator Baucus. It is my understanding that the purpose of the amendment is to bring the tax treatment of those CCRCs described in section 7872(g) into alignment with the treatment that has historically been afforded to those CCRCs that are not described in section 7872(g). In other words, there is no intent to alter the treatment that the IRS has historically provided for CCRCs that are not described in section 7872(g). I am committed to working with Senator Graham as we move this legislation forward.
