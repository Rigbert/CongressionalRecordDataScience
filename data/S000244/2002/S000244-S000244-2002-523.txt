Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, I am really disappointed in the argument of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), who is a distinguished former member of the State Supreme Court, saying that this has to do with Enron. Enron is in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a Federal law. The Federal bankruptcy court will determine the rights of all people who have got claims against Enron, and there is an automatic stake that is entered by the Federal court when a bankruptcy is filed against proceeding in any other court, State or Federal, besides the bankruptcy court.  Now, I think what we are really getting down to is, how are consumers being protected? I do not think most consumers really care whether a class action suit is litigated in State court or Federal court; they care what kind of recompense they get, should the class action suit be resolved.  I have this box of Cheerios here, because General Mills, which owns Cheerios, was sued in a class action suit alleging that there were harmful additives in Cheerios. When the case was settled, what did all the members of the class get? A coupon to buy another box of Cheerios. If Cheerios had food additives that were so damaging, that caused millions of dollars in lawyers' fees to settle this suit out, then why would the lawyers sign off to require people who wanted to cash in on their settlement to eat more Cheerios? It does not make any sense.  The amendment ought to be rejected.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
