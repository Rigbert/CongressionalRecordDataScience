Speaker, November 11, Veterans' Day, more than 130,000 of our troops are in Iraq and at risk, thousands more in Afghanistan and elsewhere and around the world; and here at home we have 25.3 million veterans, 376,000 in my State.  What are we doing in celebration of Veterans' Day? Well, unfortunately, the Congress has done little. In fact, I would say this is the most antiveteran Congress under the most antiveteran administration in recent history.  Mr. Speaker, 150,000 veterans have waited 6 months or longer for basic health care appointments; 14,000 veterans have been waiting 15 months or longer for their expedited disability claims; 560,000 disabled veterans are subject to the disabled veterans tax. Yes, that is right. They are taxed because they are disabled veterans. It is a special tax levied on them.  The President refused to spend $275 million in emergency money, but they have figured out a way to cut down the waiting list for health care. We can thank President Bush for that. His administration actually cut off 164,000 veterans from eligibility for health care this year, those who do not have service-connected disabilities but make as little as $25,000 a year. He did find a way to reduce the waiting list by eliminating the eligibility of yet another group of veterans. Not the first time this administration has done that, not the last.  They proposed to double the drug copayment for veterans from $7 to $15. That was the President's and the Republican majority's proposal in this House. Luckily, it has not gone forward.  Finally, the House majority Republicans in their budget resolution cut $14 billion over the next 10 years from veterans programs.  Now, to focus particularly on the disabled veterans tax, it is odd in a Congress that can borrow money, which is what we are doing because we are running deficits, that can borrow money to give each millionaire an average tax cut of $93,000, that can borrow money to relieve the horrible burden from people who invest for a living, do not work for wages, but invest for a living, of paying taxes on the dividends on their dividend-paying stocks. Not too many of these vets that are disqualified have dividend-paying stocks. In fact, most Americans do not have dividend-paying stocks. But that investor class, they are going to get exempted from paying that horrible burden. The millionaires, $93,000. We are going to borrow the money to give them that benefit. But somehow we cannot repeal a tax on disabled veterans which says that they will be offset dollar for dollar their veterans disability benefit which they earned against their military retirement pay. These are people who gave a career, a lifetime in service for their country, and somehow we cannot do that.  Now, there is a bill pending that would actually repeal the entire tax.We tried to do this last year. The President threatened to veto the bill. He said we cannot simply afford to take care of those veterans. We can afford as much or more per year to exempt people who earn dividends on stock. We can afford as much or more per year to give millionaires an average of $93,000 each in tax relief, but somehow we cannot afford that for our disabled veterans.  In fact, for the lifetime of these veterans, it would cost $40 billion. Now, that is still a lot of money here. That is almost half as much money as the Congress borrowed just the other day to send to Iraq. That is a lot of money. But somehow the President says we cannot afford $40 billion to deliver on our promises to these veterans for their lifetime for their disabilities.  There are, in fact, in the House 373 cosponsors of the bill. Then what is the problem? That is almost the entire House of Representatives on the bill. Well, the Republican leadership is the problem. They will not let the bill come up. And, of course, the President is a problem because he is threatening to veto the bill because we cannot afford to take care of these disabled veterans.  Now, there is a way to bring a bill to the floor when the Republican leaders refuse to bring a bill to do away with the disability tax on veterans. It is called a discharge petition. Need 218 people to sign it. Force the bill to the floor of the House over the objections of the Republican leadership. 203 people have signed it. Only two of those are Republicans. There are 158 Republicans who put their name on this bill, go home and tell their disabled veterans they want to help them, but they will not sign the discharge petition. They will not force the bill to the floor of the House.  Now, that would be a wonderful gift for our veterans for Veterans' Day if just another 15 Republicans who are cosponsors of the bill, claiming credit for it, have the guts to come down here and sign the petition, which is right behind me, to recognize our veterans properly for their service to our Nation. Now that would be a real Veterans' Day celebration.                          ____________________
