Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt).  Section 5 of H.R. 9 contains a sentence that states: ``The purpose of subsection B of this section is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice.''  Is it your understanding that this language in the text of the committee report that accompanies this legislation is consistent with the understanding that the purpose of this section of H.R. 9 is to ensure that no voting procedure changes will be made that will lead to a retrogression of the position of racial or language minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise, and that this determination shall be made without consideration of political party control or influence in any elective body?  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.
