President, I think what the Senator from Massachusetts said is very important for our colleagues to focus on as we go to this conference, which I think will be starting in a few minutes.  My understanding is that the bipartisan proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts and Senator Specter does not, in any way, preempt State and local authority in this area. My understanding is that it is only if and when State and local authorities don't act against these morally repugnant crimes that the Senator from Massachusetts has described--that only then would the Federal Government come in. I will say, from my standpoint, what the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about certainly meets my definition of what ought to constitute compassionate conservatism.  I am very pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, has joined with Senator Specter and others on the other side of the aisle. I so appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Massachusetts. I want him to know that I plan to stand shoulder to shoulder with him until we get this law passed. This is unacceptable. It is grotesque that this Congress would not take up this issue, and we cannot allow this issue to be ducked any further.  I thank my friend for yielding.
