Speaker, I rise to pay tribute and deeply thank on her retirement from our congressional staff Ms. Lindsay Potts of Toledo, Ohio, who, for nearly 3 decades of exemplary and extraordinary patriotic service to the people of our district, State, and Nation has turned in her retirement papers.  I'd like to thank Lindsay publicly for her exceptional honesty and work ethic, her abiding kindness, her aptitude and inquiring mind, her patience, her fine writing skills, her insatiable intellectual curiosity. She truly is a renaissance woman.  Lindsay is also a devoted wife to David Beckwith, and they are parents to two marvelous young people, Schuyler and Judson, and she is sister to Leslie and to brothers near and far.  Lindsay's gifts are unmatched, her smile, her sparkle, her uncanny ability to connect to people from all walks of life and draw the best from them for community betterment, as well as empowerment of marginalized people in the days that she wrote ``People Building Neighborhoods'' for the National Neighborhood Commission.  I wish her well, as does our entire staff, in the coming days and years. She will always have a home in our congressional family and will be missed by all who value her precious life. From the bottom of my heart and our hearts, Lindsay, thank you always. God bless you, Lindsay Potts.                          ____________________
