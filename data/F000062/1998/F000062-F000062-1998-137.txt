 Not only are we not playing a game, certainly no one in this body has asked me, representing the State, what would be the impact of a bill on the largest State in the Union with the most smokers by far in California, with the most young people.  I came to this body to use my brain, to try to work for my State and try to see that whatever it is that I vote for doesn't have unintended consequences.  I think all the purpose of this colloquy is to say that there may very well be serious, unintended consequences, heightened by the fact that we are moving so fast without any major governmental analysis of the long-term, per-pack costs and what those costs might do when you measure elasticity, diminished market demand and a diminution of nicotine in a regulatory order by the FDA.  These are very serious things. I think they deserve consideration, and I thank you very much.
