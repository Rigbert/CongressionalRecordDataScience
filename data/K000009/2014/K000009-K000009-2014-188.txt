Speaker, I rise today to introduce a House Resolution Calling for Free and Fair Elections in Ukraine. Ukraine will hold a presidential election this Sunday, May 25, 2014, with the goal of once again reinforcing a democratic legitimacy within the country.  On February 22, 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove Victor Yanukovych from the post of President of Ukraine. This election to replace the former president is planned amidst political upheaval that has included violent street protests, Russia's invasion and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and Russian instigated separatist rebellions throughout the eastern portions of the country.  The prospects this presidential election hold cannot be overstated. It is a decisive marker for a fresh start for Ukraine. Free and fair elections are fundamental for regaining economic and political stability throughout the nation.  The importance of free and fair elections is not lost on the American people. With this resolution we are reaffirming the commitment of the United States' support of the expression of freedom, human rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law in Ukraine, embodied through elections that are free and fair. Further, we condemn the interference of foreign agitators in pre-election activities and behavior that could adversely impact voter participation during polling.  In the remaining days prior to the election, the focus of the international community will remain on supporting the preparations and ensuring the Ukrainian people understand they are supported in these democratic efforts. Promoting access and participation in free and fair democratic processes must be a priority for America. I encourage my colleagues to support these ideals through this resolution.  No nation across our world suffered more or endured more in the last century's bloody European wars than did Ukraine. Freedom loving people hold a moral obligation to right the wrongs of the past in the present for Ukraine through these historic elections.  May they occur peaceably as thousands of election monitors from across our globe travel to Ukraine to assure that nation a better future.  This weekend in our own Nation, as Memorial Day commemorations ensue, including the 10th Anniversary ceremony here in Washington, D.C. of the dedication of the World War II Memorial, in which I will gratefully participate, let us remember those whose sacrifices made our freedoms possible. And let us pray for those who dream of opportunities America is blessed to enjoy, like the people of Ukraine who have yet known full freedom and whose moment is now.                          ____________________
