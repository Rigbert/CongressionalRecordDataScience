 President, I wish to say a few words this afternoon on some of the issues with which the Senate is dealing.  Last week, I believe I was the first Member of the Senate to suggest very strongly that Michael Mukasey should not become the next Attorney General, and I am very pleased that in the last week, more and more of my colleagues are coming to that same conclusion.  The Attorney General of the United States must be a defender of our constitutional rights. Because President Bush thinks he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants in the name of fighting terrorism, we need an Attorney General who can explain to the President what the Constitution of this country is all about. We need an Attorney General who does not believe the President has unlimited power. We need an Attorney General who will tell President Bush he is not above the law. We need an Attorney General who clearly understands the separation of powers inherent in our Constitution.  Regretfully, I have concluded that Michael Mukasey would not be that kind of Attorney General. I am gratified that more and more of my colleagues are coming to that same conclusion.  Let me be very clear. It goes without saying that the U.S. Government must do everything it can to protect the American people from the very dangerous threats of international terrorism, but we can do that in ways that are effective and are consistent with the Constitution of our country and the civil liberties it guarantees. We do not have to give up our basic freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.  The Bush administration and the lawyers who have enabled it for the past 7 years cannot be bothered, it appears, with such technical legal niceties as the Bill of Rights. This administration thinks it can eavesdrop on telephone conversations without warrants, suspend due process for people classified as ``enemy combatants,'' and thumb its nose when Congress exercises its oversight responsibility. That is why I called on Roberto Gonzales to resign. I had hoped that the confirmation process for a new Attorney General would give the President and the Senate an important opportunity to refocus on the core American principles embodied in our Constitution.  Unfortunately, it appears Judge Mukasey doesn't get it. At his 2-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he suggested that eavesdropping without warrants and using ``enhanced'' interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects might be constitutional, even if they exceeded what the law technically allowed. Mr. Mukasey said Congress might not have the power to stop the President from conducting some surveillance without warrants. He even, incredibly, claimed to be unfamiliar with the technique known as waterboarding.  ``If Judge Mukasey cannot say plainly that the President must obey a valid statute, he ought not to be the Nation's next attorney general,'' wrote Jeb Rubenfeld, a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School, who had appeared before Judge Mukasey as a prosecutor. And he has that right. It has become an American aphorism that ours is a government of laws, not men. We need an Attorney General who understands that so, unfortunately, he can explain it to a President who does not.                            Control in Basra  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that appeared in the Los Angeles Times today.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 1, 2007] Britain To Hand Over Control in Basra--British Defense Secretary Says       Iraqis Are Ready To Address the South's Persistent Violence                     (By Doug Smith and Said Rifai)       Baghdad.--Saying that Iraqi forces are now capable of      dealing with the violence that persists in the south,      Britain's defense secretary said Wednesday that his      government intended to hand over security for the area by      mid-December.       Defense Secretary Des Browne acknowledged that sectarian      power struggles and gangsterism continue in oil-rich Basra      province, but said Iraqi forces were best able to address      them now.       Browne, who spoke to reporters in Baghdad a day after      reviewing the security situation in Basra, said he saw      increasing evidence that Iraqi security forces, particularly      the army but increasingly the police as well, were improving      in their response to the infighting and violence.       ``Unequivocally. I can see progress,'' Browne said.       British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced last month      that his government, the main U.S. foreign partner in Iraq,      would pull out half its remaining troops by June, leaving      2,500 soldiers stationed outside Basra.       Browne said that contingent would be adequate to fulfill      its primary responsibility of guarding the lone British base      and would be capable of providing support to Iraqi forces.       In meetings with Iraqi officials Wednesday, Browne pledged      Britain's continuing assistance in the economic development      of the south.       Also Wednesday, Iraq's foreign minister said Baghdad was      holding indirect talks with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or      PKK, that would soon lead to the release of several Turkish      soldiers the group seized in recent border clashes with      Turkey. The PKK, fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey,      has bases in the far north of Iraq.       Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, an ethnic Kurd, made      the comments after conferring with Iranian Foreign Minister      Manouchehr Mottaki before this weekend's regional security      conference in Istanbul.       In contrast to the tension surrounding a visit to Baghdad      by Turkey's foreign minister, Ali Babacan, the atmosphere was      cordial at a joint appearance after their talks. Both      diplomats said the border disputes between Turkey and the PKK      should not be allowed to destabilize the region.       Meanwhile, a car bomb exploded in the Alawi neighborhood      near Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, killing one person and      injuring four. The bodies of six unidentified victims of      violence were found in the capital.       In the north, a policeman was killed and two others injured      in an attack on a checkpoint about 12 miles south of the city      of Kirkuk, police Brig. Gen. Sarhad Qadir said.       Iwo Iraqi army soldiers were killed in Tuz Khumatu, 110      miles north of Baghdad, when a bomb went off under their      patrol vehicle, Qadir said.
