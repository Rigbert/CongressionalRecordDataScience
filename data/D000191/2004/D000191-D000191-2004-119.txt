They have set yet another record. This complements their previous record of the largest job loss and the worst job record since Herbert Hoover was President of the United States in the 1920s. But their latest is notable also: 1.1 million jobless workers by the end of this month will have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits without receiving an extension or additional aid. If we go all the way back, we have been keeping data on extended unemployment since 1971, 33 years ago, there have never been so many people who have exhausted unemployment benefits without successfully finding work.  Now the Bush administration and the Republican leaders in Congress are refusing to extend unemployment benefits. Is that because we are in such adeep economic hole? After all, their tax cuts have dug us into a $650 billion deficit in the coming year, so maybe we just cannot afford unemployment benefits any more. No, actually there is $17 billion in the Unemployment Trust Fund, money paid in by workers and their employers, sitting on deposit, or actually not, they borrowed the money and spent it on something else.                              {time}  2000  But at least there is a credit for $17 billion; and, in fact, they are expecting that because of the taxes levied for unemployment benefits, that that fund will actually grow in the coming year, as 1.1 million people exhaust their benefits, do not find jobs, and cannot get an extension.  Now, the Republicans have a couple of arguments as to why they think this is a good thing. They think it is a good thing because the unemployment rate is low. Well, yes, actually, the way they keep the books, the unemployment rate is low. All of these workers, these 1.1 million who will have exhausted their benefits will no longer be considered to be in the workforce, and they will not be counted as unemployed. It is sort of a beautiful thing they have created here. If everybody in America lost their job today, a year from today, when they had all exhausted their unemployment benefits and no one had gotten a job back, if they had all been outsourced to India or somewhere else, we would have zero unemployment, according to the Bush administration, the way they keep the books. So that is a pretty phony argument, and you do not have to travel very far in America to find people who want work and cannot find it. Certainly in my State, that is not hard at all.  Then they say, now the Republicans have decided that unemployment benefits are welfare. Yes, that is true: an earned benefit for people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, most often through trade policies that exported their jobs or misplaced budget priorities on the part of this administration and tax policies and trickle down economics. Those people, they say, are just a bunch of welfare cheats, because they say that this would discourage people from going out and finding work if we extended unemployment benefits.  Mr. Speaker, that is the most outrageous thing. I mean, I guess a lot of these Republicans and the Bush administration do not know real people and they have not gone out and walked the streets and gone into the malls and talked to people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, cannot find work, and just wanted a little bit of help so that they can keep their household together, so they can make the bare minimum payments on their house, their utilities, and put food on their table for their kids. The Bush people think, well, that is welfare. It is an earned benefit. People paid these taxes. There is money sitting in the unemployment trust fund. They should just give us a straight up-or-down vote.  Well, that is sort of the third thing here, is the Republican leadership does not want a straight up-or-down vote on this issue. Why? Because if we had a straight up-or-down vote in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate on an extension of unemployment benefits, to spend some of the money out of the trust fund to help these 1.1 million people who cannot find jobs and their benefits are exhausted, it would pass overwhelmingly. So they will not allow us a vote. We managed to attach an amendment to an unrelated bill and finally did trigger a vote on that, and it was amusing to watch all of the Republicans line up on the other side of the aisle after they had been beat to heck by their leadership to change their votes one after another after another after another, because they did not want to be on the wrong side of the issue.  But then their leader got up at the end of the day and said, do not worry, that will never come out of conference. Why will that not come out of conference? Why will not the will of the people of the elected House of Representatives, who voted 227 to 179 in a tangential way of extending unemployment benefits, and who voted more overwhelmingly to up front extend those unemployment benefits, why will he not let that come out of conference? The money is in the trust fund, the suffering is real, people need some help. Let us have an up-or-down vote and extend unemployment benefits for all Americans.                          ____________________
