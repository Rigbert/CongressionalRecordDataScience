 President, today I am pleased to say that S. 1965--what we call the meth bill--has finally passed. I want to thank all Members for letting this important piece of legislation get through the Senate.  S. 1965, a bipartisan bill, takes aim at a rapidly growing problem in America and in Iowa--the abuse of methamphetamine, known on the street as ``meth'' or ``crank.''  I am from Iowa--a rural state which most people do not associate with rampant crime or drug use. But in Iowa today, meth use has increased dramatically. According to a report prepared by the Governor's Alliance on Substance Abuse, seizures of meth in Des Moines increased an astounding 4,000 percent from 1993 to 1994. I repeat: meth seizures in Des Moines increased by 4,000 percent. The increase statewide was 400 percent.  These numbers are scary, Mr. President.  And according to the Iowa Department of Public Health, 7.3 percent of Iowans seeking help from substance abuse treatment centers in 1995 cited meth as their primary addiction. That's up over 5 percent from 1994, when only 2.2 percent cited meth as their primary addition.  Why has meth become such a problem? I don't think anyone knows definitively, but experts have been able to identify some of the reasons.  Meth is cheap. A meth high lasts for a very, very long time, so you get morefor your money. And perhaps most disturbingly, meth does not have the stigma associated with cocaine and crack. Kids know that crack is dangerous. But they haven't yet learned that meth is.  In Waterloo, Iowa, though, people are beginning to learn this sad and painful lesson. According to the New York Times, a 17-year-old Iowan who had been a good boy, descended into meth addiction. His behavior changed for the worse. Last October, this young man checked himself into the hospital because he believed that he had the flu. He died only days later because meth had so destroyed his immune system that he developed a form of meningitis. I'll never forget the words of this boy's mother: ``He made some wrong decisions and this drug sucked him away.'' I wonder how many more young Americans are going to be ``sucked away'' before we get a handle on the meth problem.  Mr. President, what America is facing today with the explosion in meth use is nothing short of an epidemic. Meth is cheap and easily manufactured from commonly available chemicals. Today, the Senate is striking at the root of the problem: Chemical suppliers who sell chemicals to illegal meth labs. The harder it is for criminal chemists to get the raw material to make meth, the more difficult it will be to produce. This in turn will make it more expensive. And this will reduce consumption. And that will help keep our kids alive a little longer.  Importantly, this bill preserves the flexibility of States to enact their own laws to deal with the manufacture of meth. Some very powerful chemical companies have tried to weaken this bill by preempting the States. I think that is just wrong-headed and I am pleased that the Senate has rejected this effort.  Some of the chemical companies also tried to create so-called safe harbors so large that enormous bulk purchases of meth ingredients would never have to be reported to the DEA. That means criminals could go to the corner drugstore, purchase legal products like pseudoephedrine in large quantities and make poison with no one the wiser. And then that poison is sold to our kids.  While the Senate has had to make some compromises I wouldn't have wanted to make in a perfect world--like the blister-pack exception for pseudoephedrine--I think that this bill represents a major step forward.  This is a good, strong bill and I'm proud that it has passed.  Finally, Mr. President, I especially want to take my hat off to Senator Feinstein for her work on this bill. More than any other Senator, Dianne Feinstein worked tirelessly to make sure that we could get the strongest possible meth bill. I just want the American people to know what a tremendous job she's done.  Mr. President, in the 1980's, we almost lost a generation to crack and powder cocaine. Let's not get that close to the edge again. I'm proud that the Senate today has stood up to the chemical companies, stood up to the drug dealers and passed this crucial piece of legislation.                          ____________________
