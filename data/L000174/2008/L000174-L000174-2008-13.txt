President, I have long been a champion of the intellectual property rights enshrined in the Constitution, and have sponsored much of the significant legislation in that realm over the decades I have served in the Senate. On October 24, 2008, Judge Richard Linn of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the court entrusted exclusively with Federal appeals involving patent issues, gave the keynote address before the American Intellectual Property Law Association's annual meeting. In that address, Judge Linn discusses the challenges facing the intellectual property system in the coming years, offers advice on moving forward as a nation to meet those challenges, and provides food for thought for anyone interested in this important part of our national economy.  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Judge Richard Linn from October 24, 2008, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Challenges Ahead       I would like to thank the AIPLA for the invitation to speak      before you today. I am truly honored to speak before the      AIPLA, an organization I have belonged to since the late      60's. I see in the audience many of my friends and former      colleagues of the patent bar. I feel very much at home here,      and it is nice to be asked to speak before this distinguished      group.       Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to personally      recognize someone who has played a unique role in the      progress of the U.S. patent system for over 40 years, someone      who has led this organization for the past decade and a half,      someone who has been a special friend to so many of us, and      someone who is now moving on to a well deserved retirement--     Mike Kirk. Please join me in a round of applause to show our      appreciation for Mike and all that he has done.       We all know that Mike has done some very special things for      the AIPLA. But the best thing he did was to bring his wife,      Mary Catherine, into our AIPLA family. I think she, too,      deserves to be recognized for all she has done.       One measure of a leader is the caliber of the person      selected to replace him. And here again, the AIPLA has risen      to the challenge of Mike Kirk's departure in selecting one of      the few members of our profession who has the character,      knowledge, and recognized leadership skills to honor Mike's      legacy of accomplishment. That person is, of course, Q. Todd      Dickenson, and I think he deserves a vote of confidence with      a round of applause.       The program lists my topic as ``Challenges Ahead.'' I      selected that topic intentionally to give me lots of latitude      in what I might say. If that phrase was a limitation in a      patent claim, the meaning would be hard to discern with      specificity and no doubt would generate considerable      litigation. In a way, it's the perfect topic. So, what is it      that I am going to talk about?       John Whealan yesterday focused on recent history and ended      with a few comments on the future. Instead, I will focus on      some of the challenges I see for the future and will begin      with a few comments on the changes of the recent past.       We hear a lot about change these days. Change in our      economy, global climate change, and of course, change in our      government. Change has been in the air for some time. It      seems like the only thing we have heard, or seen, or read in      the media for the past 20 months or so has been about change.      And intellectual property law has been no stranger to it in      the past few years. While one can debate the extent of the      changes and the reasons underlying them, there is no question      that the rights of patentees have been impacted in one way or      the other by a number of recent decisions. And while the pace      of change may slow down at least for a while, the fallout of      all of this change will directly impact all of us. This is      evident, for example, from an examination of three key      decisions: KSR v. Teleflex, dealing with the test for      obviousness; eBay v. MercExchange, dealing with the test for      injunctive relief; and In re Seagate, dealing with the      standard applicable to prove willful infringement. There have      been others, such as Medlmmune v. Genentech, which made it      easier to challenge patents in declaratory judgment      actions, and DSU v. JMS, requiring proof of specific      intent for induced infringement, but I will limit my      remarks to the holdings and possible implications of KSR,      eBay, and Seagate.       In KSR, the Supreme Court reviewed the test for obviousness      under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 103. The Supreme Court began by      emphasizing that its 1966 decision in Graham v. John Deere      informed the obviousness inquiry. It went on to reject what      it perceived to be a rigid approach taken by our court in      applying the teaching, suggestion and motivation test. The      Supreme Court observed that ``when it first established the      requirement of demonstrating a teaching, suggestion, or      motivation to combine known elements in order to show that      the combination is obvious, the Court of Customs and Patent      Appeals captured a helpful insight.'' It then noted, however,      that helpful insights need not become rigid and mandatory      formulas, and ``when a court transforms a general principle      into a rigid rule that limits the obviousness inquiry, as the      Court of Appeals did here, it errs.''       The Supreme Court summed up its position on obviousness in      observing that what is important is to use common sense and      to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of      ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements      in the way the claimed new invention does. It added that any      need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of      invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason      for combining the elements in the manner claimed.       The court also made some interesting observations on the      propriety of summary judgment on issues of obviousness. The      court said that ``where, as here, the content of the prior      art, the scope of the patent claim, and the level of ordinary      skill in the art are not in material dispute, and the      obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these      factors, summary judgment is appropriate.'' ``The obviousness      of the claim is apparent in light of these factors?'' What      does that mean? Does this mean obviousness is sort of like      obscenity--you know it when you see it? I'm not sure what it      means, but I am sure someone is going to ask me for an answer      to that question in a brief in the not too distant future.       The net result of KSR is that defendants may have a renewed      interest in raising and pressing obviousness contentions,      despite the high ``clear and convincing'' standard that      applies to validity challenges. They can now argue that      ``reasons'' and common sense support a conclusion that the      claimed invention doesn't pass muster even when application      of a teaching, suggestion, and motivation test might      otherwise have failed. It also means that patentees will have      to be more prepared to gather up evidence to show secondary      considerations as a way to overcome expected challenges from      accused infringers. Finally, the Supreme Court's comments      about summary judgment will mean that patentees will have to      start thinking about how to assist courts in answering      questions about what the Supreme Court's comments on summary      judgment meant as to the way obviousness issues should be      presented to juries, if at all. For example, is it still      proper for a district court to present the ultimate question      of obviousness to the jury or is the district court required      to decide obviousness as a matter of law in every case,      leaving only the factual underpinnings for the jury? No      matter how all this is sorted out, KSR makes evident that      patentees are likely to face more challenges based on section      103. We are already seeing this in recent cases filed with      our court.       In eBay, the Supreme Court rejected the categorical grant      of injunctive relief in patent cases and held that in those      cases, just as in other cases, a plaintiff seeking a      permanent injunction must demonstrate that it has suffered      irreparable injury; that remedies available at law are      inadequate; that the balance of hardships warrants injunctive      relief; and that the public interest would not be disserved      by a permanent injunction. What the Supreme Court did not      tell us is what happens after infringement is found and a      court determines that the equitable remedy of a permanent      injunction is not warranted. This is already presenting      patentees and the courts with interesting new challenges.      eBay also leaves open the question of whether there remains a      rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm in patent cases.      The bottom line for patentees is that they, like all other      plaintiffs, will have to tow the line and be prepared to make      a convincing showing on each of the four equitable factors.      This will present new challenges, particularly to non-     practicing patentees and alters some of the leverage      patentees assumed they enjoyed before the eBay decision.       In re Seagate presented our court with the opportunity to      pick up where Knorr-Bremse left off and to reconsider the      question of the duty of due care owed to patentees and the      standard for determining when infringement is willful and      subject to treble damages. The case came to us on a motion      for a writ of mandamus seeking to overturn an order from a      district court that would have given the patentee's counsel      virtually unfettered access to all attorney-client      communications and work-product of the accused infringer.      That order stemmed from the patentee's assertion of willful      infringement and the accused infringer's good faith reliance      on the advice of counsel. Because of the abuses we perceived      in the routine allegation of willful infringement and the      tension it produced between assertion by the accused      infringer of the attorney-client privilege and reliance on      the advice of counsel, we overruled the duty of due care      standard set out in Underwater Devices and held that proof of      willful infringement, permitting enhanced damages, requires      at least a showing of objective recklessness. Because we      abandoned the affirmative duty of due care, we also remarked      that in the context of willful infringement, there is no      affirmative obligation to obtain an opinion of counsel.       Following Seagate, it can be anticipated that there will be      continuing debate over application of the objectively      reckless standard and the parameters of willful infringement.      The one thing that is no longer in debate, however, is that      patentees can no longer bank on a determination of      willfulness and enhanced damages merely because infringement      was found against an accused who had prior notice of the      patent.       The net result of all of these decisions is that patentees      are likely to have to confront more obviousness challenges,      patentees are less likely to obtain enhanced damage awards      based on willfulness, and patentees will be more challenged      to obtain injunctive relief than just a few years ago. These      cases thus will cause patentees to reassess their strategies      and to revalue their patent portfolios.       But patentees are not only struggling to cope with recent      decisions of the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit.      Patentees continue to suffer needlessly from self-inflicted      wounds. These are the walking wounded, who regularly report      to the MASH units-the district courts-for help. And if they      don't get the help they need at the district court MASH unit,      they come to the general hospital-the Federal Circuit, to      cure all that ails them.       What self-inflicted wounds am I talking about? There are      two in particular that I want to highlight. The first relates      to the continuing propensity of patentees, particularly in      the electrical and mechanical arts, to disclose in their      applications only one embodiment of the invention, while      arguing that the claims cover something broader than the one      disclosed embodiment might suggest. I have no idea why so      many patentees continue to limit the number of embodiments      disclosed when, in so many cases we hear, the entire      controversy is about the scope of a claim supported only by      a single disclosed embodiment. Patentees who desire broad      coverage and only disclose a single embodiment are      shooting themselves in the foot.       Scientists and engineers are familiar with the concept that      an area cannot be defined by a single point or even two      points. To define an area requires at least three points. It      is surprising, then, that patent attorneys, who are trained      both in the law and in science or engineering, often forget      this three-point concept in drafting patent applications.      Careful prosecutors follow a general rule and include in      patent specifications not merely one embodiment of an      invention, but multiple embodiments to better illustrate the      full area of the discovery embraced by the claims. This is a      sound practice that helps to inform the public of the proper      scope of the claims and avoids uncertainty and interpretive      disputes. The uncertainty of single embodiment specifications      has brought us a steady stream of cases, and I urge all of      you not to shoot yourselves or your clients in the foot by      disclosing only one embodiment, particularly in mechanical      and electrical cases.       The second example of a self-inflicted wound is the      continuing practice of adding terminology to claims,      particularly after an interview, to place the claims in      condition for allowance without explaining the reason for the      change or pointing out where in the specification support for      the added language can be found. Again, in case after case      before our court, we are called upon to construe the scope of      claim language which appears nowhere else but in the claims.      Without any support in the written description, we are left      to infer meaning from parts of the specification that often      do not directly relate to the limitation in question or from      the prosecution history of events leading up to the      amendment. These are often poor guides for interpretation and      frequently lead to protracted and costly litigation, not to      mention unpredictable outcomes. Here again, the wound is      self-inflicted and patentees are well advised to avoid      shooting themselves in the foot by leaving the meaning of      critical limitations to unguided inference.       The message for those who regularly write and prosecute      patent applications for clients is that while the swinging of      the patent pendulum of court decisions is largely beyond any      patentee's ability to alter, there are things that are      entirely within your control, such as including multiple      embodiments in patent applications to make broad construction      of claim terms more likely and providing support or an      explanation for claim terms added during prosecution. Those      things you can control. And they will help your client avoid      going through life as a walking wounded patentee.       I would like to turn now to some challenges I see for the      PTO. With a new administration soon to occupy the White      House, a change in leadership at the PTO can be expected      within the next year. The new leaders at the PTO will face      many difficult challenges. The past leadership has much to be      proud of. Director Dudas successfully oversaw the completion      of a modern new facility and the end to fee diversion. He and      his colleagues have upgraded technology resources for      examiners, have ramped up hiring, and have instituted      comprehensive training programs, to name just a few of their      many accomplishments. All of that is commendable.       But it seems to me that what is needed now goes beyond      facilities or finances to the heart of the PTO's mission to      thoroughly, carefully, and promptly examine the applications      of those who seek the protection of patents and who rely on      the effective operation of our patent system. With the solid      foundation of the achievements of the current Director, the      PTO now needs the leadership of those with intimate knowledge      of patents and patent law. People who understand first-hand      the problems faced by users of the system and who have the      ability to comprehensively relate to the practicing bar. That      leadership is best found in the ranks of experienced      practitioners, many of whom are in this very room.       The next group of leaders at the PTO will need to be      creative in finding new ways to improve not only productivity      but quality as     well. The number of new applications that are projected over      the next several years is staggering. Technology will      continue to get more complicated. And the demands of managing      such a sizable organization will be rigorous. To keep pace      will take bold new measures to improve efficiency and      effectiveness of almost every aspect of PTO operations. That      may entail cooperative efforts with other patent offices      around the world to find ways to share search results. It may      entail establishing a program of deferred examination to give      applicants an opportunity to fully evaluate the need for      patent protection before the office is called upon to conduct      any examination. My point here is not to suggest specific      initiatives. It is not my place to tell the PTO how it should      operate. I only cite these as examples of the kinds of things      the new leadership of the PTO will need to seek out if it is      to avoid getting buried in the avalanche of new applications      looming on the horizon.       I know the PTO has engaged in a vigorous effort to hire and      train new examiners. I have been privileged to speak at a      graduation ceremony for an impressive class of new examiners      from the PTO's new patent academy. But that's only half of      the equation. It serves no real purpose to hire new examiners      if an equal number of examiners--especially experienced      examiners--resign. The PTO will need to go back to basics and      creatively apply a new version of the Three R's we all      learned as kids. The rule for how to treat examiners couldn't      be simpler: Respect, Reward, and Retain. In this regard, it      may be time for the PTO to develop new standards of examiner      performance that mirror the standards of attorney performance      used by law firms and corporate law departments. Just as      attorney performance is not measured by billable hours alone,      examiner performance measured principally by the number of      disposals may not be the best approach. Counting disposals      may be a raw indicator of performance but does not recognize      the judgment, thoroughness, and legal skills provided by      first-rate examiners and expected by the public.       Other patent offices around the world are involved not only      in giving birth to patents but in assessing questions of      validity raised over the life of a patent. That may explain      why examiners in many countries are treated differently than      U.S. examiners. It is not that U.S. examiners are less      competent or any less dedicated. Far from it. But if the      primary role of an examiner is limited to ex parte matters      that end on the day the patent issues, there will      understandably be a different interest on the part of the      public in what examiners do and who they are than if they      played an essential role in the determination of validity      challenges throughout the life of the patent. One way U.S.      examiners would have a greater opportunity to be recognized      in much the same way as their counterparts in other countries      is if the new leadership at the PTO decides to energize the      current reexamination system to make it the attractive      alternative to litigation it was originally intended to be.      This would require a much expanded corps of experienced      reexamination examiners and the implementation of streamlined      procedures to accelerate the processing of all reexamination      applications.       While it is evident that the PTO will face unprecedented      challenges in the years ahead, the leaders and examiners I      know are capable, dedicated, and clearly up to the task. I      have every confidence that the PTO will meet the challenges      ahead and will continue to be a model for the rest of the      world.       Many have said that this is the golden age of intellectual      property. In the years to come, we can expect to see      significant advances in energy technology, green technology,      nanotechnology, and a host of other things. The need for      effective protection for the discoveries of tomorrow's      scientists, engineers, and researchers will be greater than      ever before. And the changing legal landscape and the pace of      technological progress will present us all with new and      difficult challenges. The challenges ahead are many, but we      are all fortunate to have the chance to enjoy the      opportunities and to confront the challenges the golden age      of IP offers to each of us.       I have enjoyed being with you and thank you for your      attention.                          ____________________
