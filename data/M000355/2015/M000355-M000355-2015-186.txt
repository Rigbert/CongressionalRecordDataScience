 President, on another matter, in the past few days I have noted some of the achievements of a new Congress that is back to work on the side of the American people. We have passed bills no one ever thought Washington could touch. We have made reforms that have previously languished for years without result. Even more remarkably, we have often done so on a bipartisanship basis.  Consider just the bills I have mentioned already:  A landmark, bipartisan education bill that would take decisionmaking away from distant Federal bureaucrats in order to empower parents and teachers instead. The pundits said we would never pass it. We did, 81 to 17.  A breakthrough, bipartisan highway bill that would finally provide States and local governments the kind of certainty they need to focus on longer term road and bridge projects. After years of short-term extensions, this long-term highway bill passed the new Senate 65 to 34.  A milestone, bipartisan cyber security bill that would protect the personal information of people we represent by defeating cyber attacks through the sharing of information. The issue languished in previous Congresses, but this Senate passed it with 74 votes.  Today, I would like to mention another important bill this new Congress has passed. It is hard for many Americans to believe that human trafficking--modern-day slavery--can happen where they live, but it does right here in our country. It happens in all 50 of our States. In Kentucky alone, the Commonwealth has been able to identify more than 100 victims since they began keeping relevant records in 2013. This kind of abuse often begins around the age of 13 or 14.  The victims of modern slavery deserve a voice. They deserve justice. After years of inaction, the new Congress was determined to give them both. Of course, there was an unforeseen impediment, to put it mildly, to getting this bill done, but success was possible because the new majority kept its focus on facts, on substance, and on good policy for the people who have always remained our focus throughout the debate, the victims of modern slavery.  The bill we ultimately passed with strong bipartisan support, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, represents a vital ray of hope for the countless victims of modern slavery who need our help. Victims groups and advocates told us that this human rights legislation would provide unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking. They urged the Congress to pass it. We did. The President signed it into law as well. It proves that with unwavering compassion and unbowed determination--something Senator Cornyn knows a thing or two about--justice can prevail. I am grateful to him and so many other Senators for working so hard to ensure that it ultimately did.  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was another important step forward for our country. It is another example of what we can achieve in a new Congress that is back to work for the American people.                          ____________________
