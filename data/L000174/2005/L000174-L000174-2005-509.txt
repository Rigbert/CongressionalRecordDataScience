President, I probably would not object. I would point out that I was responding to the distinguished Republican leader who had spoken an equal amount of time on Mr. Griffith. I had spoken yesterday considerably less time, on the same nomination, than the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. I also know both the Republican and Democratic cloakrooms have notified their Members that we are going to vote at 10.
