President, on this first legislative day of the new session, I am joining Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee to introduce a bill to help protect satellite TV viewers. I know it also has the support of subcommittee Chairman, Senator DeWine, and its ranking member, Senator Kohl. I appreciate the fact that Republicans and Democrats are working together on this issue. I also want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for his assistance on this issue as well as the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain and their ranking member, Senator Hollings. I look forward to working with all Senators on this matter.  I have received hundreds of calls from Vermonters last year whose satellite TV service was about to be terminated. I am still hearing from Vermonters from all over the state. They are steaming mad and so am I.  This is an outrageous situation--the law must be changed and the Federal Communications Commission has to do its job.  I have worked to change the law over the last two years to try to avoid the situation we now face. I have also insisted that the FCC change its unrealistic rules that will result in needless terminations of service to Vermont families.  Unfortunately, we are on a collision course because of two Court orders affecting CBS and Fox signals offered to home dish owners, an inability to pass needed legislation last year, and the unwillingness of the FCC to step in and alleviate this situation.  Before I go into the details I want to point out that this bipartisan bill represents very good public policy. It will increase competition among TV providers, give consumers more choices, preserve the local affiliate TV system, act to lower cable and satellite rates, and will eventually offer local news, weather and programming over satellite TV instead of programming from distant stations. Over the next couple years, this initiative can solve the problem of losing satellite service by allowing satellites to offer a full array of local TV stations.  It will lead to lower rates for consumers because the bill creates head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers. The bill will allow households who want to subscribe to this new satellite TV service, called ``local-into-local''--to receive all local Vermont TV stations over the satellite.  The goal is to offer Vermonters with more choices, more TV selections, but at lower rates. In areas of the country where there is this full competition with cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower.  Thus, over time this initiative will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of all local TV channels to viewers throughout most of Vermont, as well as the typical complement of superstations, weather and sports channels, PBS, movies and a variety of other channels. This means that local Vermont TV stations will be available over satellite dishes to many areas of Vermont currently not served by satellite or by cable.  Under current law, it is illegal for satellite TV providers to offer local TV channels over a satellite dish when you live in an area where you are normally likely to get a clear TV signal with a regular rooftop antenna. This means that thousands of Vermonters living in or near Burlington cannot receive local signals over their satellite dishes.  In addition, under current law many families must get their local TV signals over an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. This bill will remove that legal limitation and allow satellite carriers to offer local TV signals to viewers no matter where they live in Vermont.  To take advantage of this, satellite carriers over time will have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow. This will mean that they must carry all local Vermont TV stations and not carry distant network stations that compete with local stations.  Presently Vermonters receive network satellite signals with programming from stations in other states--in other words receive a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate.  By allowing satellite providers to offer a larger variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers.  All the members of the Judiciary Committee have worked on this matter and I appreciate their efforts. On November 12, of 1997, Chairman Hatch and I held a full Committee hearing on satellite issues to try to avoid needless cutoffs of satellite TV service while, at the same time, working to protect the network affiliate TV broadcast system.  Soon after, on March 5, 1998, we introduced the Hatch-Leahy satellite bill (S. 1720) to address these concerns. This bill was amended in Committee with a Hatch-Leahy substitute and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998.  In the meantime, in July 1998, a federal district court judge in Florida found that PrimeTime 24 was offering distant CBS and Fox television signals to more than a million households in the U.S. in a manner inconsistent with its compulsory license that permits such satellite service only to households who do not get at least ``grade B intensity'' service. Under a preliminary injunction, satellite service to thousands of households in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October 8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed.  To avoid immediate cutoffs of satellite TV service in Vermont and other states, the parties requested an extension of the October 8, 1998, termination date which was granted until February 28, 1999. This extension was also designed to give the FCC time to address these problems faced by satellite home dish owners.  The FCC solicited comments on whether the current definition of grade B intensity was adequate.  I was very concerned about the FCC proposal in this matter and filed a comment asking the FCC to come up with a realistic and workable system to protect satellite dish owners. I criticized the FCC rule in that it would cutoff households from receiving distant signals based on ``unwarranted assumptions'' in a manner inconsistent with the law and the clear intent of the Congress. I complained about entire towns in Vermont which were to be inappropriately cut off and insisted that FCC issue a final rule that permits ``a smooth transition to `local-into-local' satellite TV service.''  I said in my comment to their proposal that: ``The Commission's proposal raises a number of complex issues, yet the guiding principle that the FCC should follow is simple: No customer's `distant' satellite TV signals should be cut off if the customer is unable to receive local TV broadcasts over-the-air.''  I also pointed out that: ``The clear purpose of the law was, and is, to protect those living in more rural areas so that they can receive TV signals using satellite dishes when they are unable to receive a strong signal using an antenna. Your final rule should reflect that purpose. I have heard from constituents in two Vermont towns where I am told that almost no one can receive a clear TV signal, yet all families with satellite dishes were being targeted for termination of their satellite TV channels.''  I also noted in my comment: ``A second area that concerns me relates to who should bear the cost of any testing that is done. I have heard from Vermonters who are justifiably furious that they are being asked to pay for these costs. The burden of proof and the burden of any additional expenses should not be assessed upon the families owning the satellite dishes.''  ``While the hills and mountains of Vermont are a natural wonder, they are barriers to receiving clear TV signals over-the-air with roof top antennas. For example, at my home in Middlesex, Vermont, we can only get one channel clearly and the other channel with lots of ghosts.''  In yet another development, the Florida district court filed a final order which will also require that households signed up for satellite service before March 11, 1997, be subject to termination of CBS and Fox distant signals on April 30, 1999, if they live in areas where they are likely to receive a grade B intensity signal, as defined by the Court and FCC rules, and are unable to get the local CBS or Fox affiliate to consent to receipt of the distant signal. My understanding is that each subscriber that is to lose service must receive notice 45 days in advance.  I want to make clear, as I did in my comment to the FCC, that I strongly believe in the local affiliate television system. Local broadcast stations provide the public with local news, local weather, local informational programming, local emergency advisories, candidate forums, local public affairs programming, and high quality programs. Local broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community.  I strongly believe that when the full local-into-local satellite system is in place, this system will enhance the local affiliate television system.  I, thus, urge my colleagues to cosponsor this effort.                                 ______                                  By
