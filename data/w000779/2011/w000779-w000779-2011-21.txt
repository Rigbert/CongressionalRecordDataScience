President, I come to the floor today to talk about creating more good-paying jobs in America and how tax reform can play a key role in job creation if it is done right. As we all know, no Member of Congress has a piece of machinery on their desk that is a job creation device. We cannot just start something like this, press a button, and then after it whirs around a bunch of times it creates a lot of new jobs. New jobs do not just come shooting out that way. Nobody has a contraption like that in the Senate, and the reality is the President does not have one nor does anybody else in America.  But there are policies that are relevant to how we create more good-paying jobs, and those involve first looking at what has worked in the past and, second, what hard, objective data is relevant to the future. Nobody can know the ideal, sure-fire way to create jobs, but we can document what has worked in the past.  In the case of comprehensive tax reform, what we know is that after the 1986 Tax Reform Act where Democrats and Republicans cleaned out scores of tax preferences to hold down marginal rates and keep progressivity, our country created 6.3 million new jobs in those 2 years after that tax reform was enacted. I am not going to say on the floor of the Senate that each and every one of those jobs was the result of tax reform, but certainly independent authorities point to that tax reform effort as a key factor in creating those jobs. With at least 14 million Americans out of work in our country right now, it would be legislative malpractice for Congress to ignore the facts that document the results of the last tax reform effort in job creation.  When we look at the possibilities should we not pay special attention to what has worked in the past?
