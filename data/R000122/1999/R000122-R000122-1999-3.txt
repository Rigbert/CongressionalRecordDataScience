President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Providence Gay Men's Chorus, which celebrated its fourth anniversary on November 14, 1999. I would like to thank the Chorus for its four years of community involvement, during which time the members have shared not only their melodious voices with the citizens of Rhode Island, but also their hopes and ambitions for a better world.  The Providence Gay Men's Chorus, which began in 1995 as a group of eight, now has 50 members. In addition to their musical talent, one of the attributes that is most unique about the Chorus, and most appreciated, is the group's mission to promote tolerance. As we know, the real work of fostering support for people with diverse backgrounds and lifestyles usually happens slowly, and within the context of shared activities and community. The Providence Gay Men's Chorus reaches out with its concerts to expand the bounds of community. By helping to create an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, their work benefits not only the citizens of Rhode Island, but ultimately the entire nation.  I am pleased to make it known that November 14, 1999 was not only the fourth anniversary of the Chorus, but also was declared Providence Gay Men's Chorus Day in the State of Rhode Island. Mr. President, I ask that a gubernatorial proclamation from the Governor of my home state of Rhode Island proclaiming November 14th as ``Providence Gay Men's Chorus Day'' be printed in the Congressional Record.  I join in the chorus of voices supporting the Providence Gay Men's Chorus' dual mission of creating beautiful music and promoting mutual respect and understanding. I know this talented musical group will continue its good work and I wish them many, many more birthdays.  The proclamation follows:    State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations--Gubernatorial                               Proclamation       Whereas, the Providence Gay Men's Chorus was first      conceived in a karaoke bar in Providence in October 1995. The      first meeting of its original eight members from Rhode Island      and Massachusetts was held in November 1995, in a home in      Pawtucket. The name Providence Gay Men's Chorus (PGMC) was      decided on after some deliberation and the group was then      underway with a music director and an accompanist; and,       Whereas, the mission of the PGMC is to provide and foster      continuing growth of men's voices. Through the sharing of      song concerts, the PGMC hopes to foster mutual understanding,      tolerance and support of people with diverse backgrounds and      lifestyles; and,       Whereas, the membership started to blossom during the first      year and moved to St. James Episcopal Church in North      Providence. During this year, the first board was also formed      and the first concert was held in Warcham, Massachusetts with      12 members; and,       Whereas, the chorus kept growing and moved again. This time      to the Bell Street Chapel in Providence, where the now 35-     member chorus was performing two seasons per year with three      concerts per season. It was at the Bell Street Chapel that      the PGMC achieved their first sell out audience; and,       Whereas, as membership approached 40 members, the chorus      moved once again to the First Unitarian Church in Providence.      During this time, the PGMC joined the national choral      organization for gay and lesbians called GALA and received      its first corporate sponsorship; and,       Whereas, the chorus is now approaching its fourth birthday,      has a membership of 50 and is back at the Bell Street Chapel.      The members will be performing series of concerts in      November, singing at First Night 2000, and initiating a      scholarship program. Future plans for the chorus are to bring      a program to the Hasbro's Children's Hospital, perform to      mainstream audiences throughout the city and state, and      attend the national GALA conferences; and,       Whereas, on November 14, 1999 the chorus will hold a      concert at the Newport Congregational Church, under the      direction of Charles Pietrello and the accompaniment of Bruce      Ruby;       Now, therefore, I, Lincoln Almond, Governor of the State of      Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, do hereby proclaim      November 14, 1999, as Providence Gay Men's Chorus      Day.                          ____________________
