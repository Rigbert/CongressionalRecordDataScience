Alan Greenspan, which addressed this issue.  Mr. Greenspan came before Congress endorsing President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America and now that we have rid the world of those tax cuts which have created record deficits that we have never seen in the history of the United States, Mr. Greenspan is now coming back to us saying the way to start resolving these budget problems is to cut Social Security benefits.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he would respond to whether Krugman accurately notes that during the 1980s it was the Greenspan commission that persuaded Congress to increase the payroll tax for Social Security which supports the program, a tax which is regressive, falls more heavily on middle- and lower-income families.  In fact, Mr. Krugman goes on to write that Greenspan's suggestion in the 1980s that raised the retirement age in America and raised the payroll taxes in America is generating record surpluses in the Social Security trust fund with the regressive payroll tax. Now that Social Security has generated the money it needs, it is Mr. Greenspan who says now we need to reach into the Social Security trust fund and make certain we pay off our debt, and also we need to cut benefits and raise the retirement age even further.  I ask my friend from North Dakota, the Senator who has come to the Senate to address this issue, is it disingenuous for Mr. Greenspan to, on the one hand, call for higher payroll taxes so the Social Security trust fund grows, and then when it grows to such a point, to allow tax cuts to be funded by Social Security trust fund that go to the wealthiest people in America? The working families are paying into the Social Security trust fund, but it is the wealthy families who are taking the money out from the Bush tax cuts.  I ask the Senator his response.
