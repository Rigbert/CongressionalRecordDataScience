 I now have the privilege of serving on the committee but not as ranking member or chairman, just as a member. I compliment Senator Baucus for his leadership on this whole business of tax reform and for holding the hearings he is holding.  Today, a very important hearing is being held on the question of is the distribution of tax burdens and benefits equitable.
