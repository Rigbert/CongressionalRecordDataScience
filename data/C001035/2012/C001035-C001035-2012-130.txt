President, I too am opposed to the amendment offered by Senator Paul. I do think the idea of a certification is a good one, but, unfortunately, Senator Paul's amendment would strike the provisions of the bill that affirm the duty we have to the American people and that scholars who testified before the committee said was necessary.
