San Clemente has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated young people who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Oscar Gutierrez is one of these young leaders. On February 25, 2010, Oscar will be honored at the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting and Award Ceremony where he will receive the 2009 Citizen of the Year Award.  Eighteen year old Oscar Gutierrez resides with his mother and sister in San Clemente. Sadly, Oscar lost his father in 2005. At age 13, Oscar started working to help financially support his family. In addition, he joined the Orange County Sheriffs Explorer Program, Post 449. On December 4, 2008, Oscar was home doing his homework when he heard screams coming from outside. He looked out and saw smoke and flames billowing from the apartment building next door. Oscar grabbed a fire extinguisher, and along with his sister and a cousin, who are also Explorers, and ran to help. Sheriffs deputies were evacuating the building so Oscar began checking around to make sure everyone was safe.  It was then that he noticed an elderly couple on a second floor balcony waiting for assistance. Smoke was pouring out of their apartment and they were beginning to panic. The woman was in a wheelchair and the husband seemed frail. The only way down was an exterior flight of stairs. Oscar did not hesitate: he recruited the help of another neighbor, ran up the stairs and carried the woman in her wheelchair down the stairs to safety.  Oscar graduated from San Clemente High School in 2009 and is attending college at California State San Marcos as a Sociology Major. He has received multiple scholarships and also works at Pedro's Tacos. He continues to attend the Explorer Program four times a month. He is the first one in his family to go to college.  Oscar Gutierrez at the young age of 18 is a hero and a model citizen. He is a hard working individual who cares deeply about San Clemente and its citizens. Oscar is truly an incredible young man who has a very bright future. Oscar's actions and selflessness have contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of San Clemente, California. I join the many community members who are grateful for Oscar and salute him as he receives the 2009 Citizen of the Year Award.                          ____________________
