We often talk about Senators who have completed their terms. In that regard, a number of my friends will be leaving the Senate and I am making statements about them.  Today, I want to talk about a woman who has served the Senate and the American people for three decades, and whose career sets a high standard of professionalism and public service that inspires countless others. She was not elected to serve as a Senator, but she has been essential to the work of the Senate for a number of years.  Lula Johnson Davis began her Senate career as a legislative correspondent for Senator Russell Long of Louisiana. She later worked for the Democratic Policy Committee. In 1993, she became a key member of our Democratic floor staff The floor staff is critical to the proper functioning of the Senate.  They advise Senators on floor procedure and help keep the Senate operating within the formal Senate Rules and the informal Senate practices that honor our traditions of courtesy and civility. When Senators are not bollixing up the proceedings, the floor staff facilitates the business of the Senate.  They are the unseen and unrecognized teachers for new Senators. They help guide all of us through Senate consideration and voting on every measure that comes before this body.  She leaves the Senate having started as a legislative correspondent and having risen to become the Secretary of the Majority of the U.S. Senate.  Through the decade of the 1990s and this first decade of the new century, as the assistant secretary and now secretary, it has been this woman from Louisiana who has helped guide the Senate. We each, Senators on both sides of the aisle, owe her our gratitude. She is a professional who helps set the right tone for all of us--Senators, staff, and pages.  The young people, high school students from around the country, who continue their studies while serving as Senate pages for a semester or a summer are another group of beneficiaries of Lula' s tutelage. She is a tough but fair taskmaster. Democratic pages learn that every job, no matter how small, needs to be done right.  They learn lessons that will serve them throughout their lives. She has been a mentor, friend and role model to hundreds of youngsters from around the country over the years. At the end of their tour of duty, they appreciate what she has given them and, I hope, share her respect for the Senate.  She has never failed to fulfill her duties as she has steadfastly served with a succession of Democratic leaders. In truth, she has served not just the Democratic Senate caucus but the Senate and the country.  I will miss Lula Davis and wanted to say how much I appreciate all she has done for each of us.                          ____________________
