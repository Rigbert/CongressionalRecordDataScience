Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1957, as amended, the Taxpayer First Act of 2019.  I would like to begin by thanking my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the chair of the Appropriations Committee for her support and helping move this important bill.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican or a Democratic bill. It is an American one. I am proud of the process and the product. I also want to thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady; the Oversight Subcommittee Ranking Member Kelly, my good friend; and all members of the Subcommittee on Oversight for joining me on this bill.  I also would like to thank our former subcommittee chairs, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Buchanan) and our former colleague from Kansas, Ms. Jenkins, for their great work.  In addition, I am pleased that Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Wyden introduced a companion bill in the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to congratulate all of the House Members and Senators who have bills and ideas that are included in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and as I know, and as other members of the committee know, this is a good bill. It is a necessary bill to do what is right and what is fair.  In particular, I would like to thank our staff, Karen, Rachel, Susan, Isabella, Zach, Lindsay, Jason, Lori, Michael, and Jamila. They worked so hard on this important bill, and I have faith that this time we will cross the finish line. We have been trying for years. Three times this bill passed the House. These individuals worked so hard on this important bill, and I have faith that this time we will do more than just cross the finish line.  For many years, the Oversight Subcommittee worked in a bipartisan manner to improve the IRS. This bill is the result of many hearings, thoughtful oversight, and help from stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, we took our time and we did it right.  We asked Democrat and Republican Members to provide feedback. We reached out to taxpayers and advocates. We asked questions and listened to the response. We listened to the answers. We learned that we all share the common goal of finding ways to help American taxpayers, and there is no time like the present.  Mr. Speaker, this is the season when millions of Americans are working around the clock to file their taxes by April 15. I am proud that this Congress will respond to their concerns with this bill to improve taxpayer services, protect taxpayers during enforcement, and strengthen the appeals process.  Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act contains many commonsense policies to achieve these goals. For example, the bill provides for matching grants for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program which help low-income and moderate-income taxpayers complete and file their taxes.  This bill also protects low-income taxpayers and people who receive Social Security disability insurance, benefits from the private debt collection program.  Above all, the Taxpayer First Act serves as an example of the good and thoughtful policy that Congress can produce when both the process and the product are bipartisan.  Mr. Speaker, with this bill, we show taxpayers and IRS public servants that their frustration does not fall on deaf ears, blind eyes, and hard hearts.  With this bill, Congress heard their concerns and responded to their calls, to their cries for action, and we did act.  Mr. Speaker, this bill should be an inspiration to us all. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                              Committee on Financial Services,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2019.     Hon. Richard E. Neal,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1957, the      ``Taxpayers First Act of 2019.'' Because you have been      working with the Committee on Financial Services concerning      provisions in the bill that fall within our Rule X      jurisdiction, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the      bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.      I do so based on my understanding that the Committee on Ways      and Means will work to ensure that the text of H.R. 1957 that      will be considered by House of Representatives will include      changes that have been discussed between the two Committees.       The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to      forego formal consideration of H.R. 1957 with our mutual      understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.      1957 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and      that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and      involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our      Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an      appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation and request      your support for any such request.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the      Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 1957.           Sincerely,                                                    Maxine Waters,     Chairwoman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2019.     Hon. Maxine Waters,     Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 1957, the Taxpayer First Act of 2019. As you know, the      bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Ways and      Means, with an additional referral to the Committee on      Financial Services.       I thank you for agreeing to waive consideration of      provisions that fall within your Committee's Rule X      jurisdiction. The Committee on Ways and Means confirms our      mutual understanding that your Committee does not waive any      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or      similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation      moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues      within your Committee's jurisdiction.       I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the      bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this      legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you      as this measure moves through the legislative process.           Sincerely,                                                  Richard E. Neal,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2019.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing with respect to H.R. 1957,      the ``Taxpayer First Act of 2019.'' As a result of your      having consulted with us on provisions on which the Committee      on Appropriations has a jurisdictional interest, I will not      request a sequential referral on this measure, an opportunity      to raise a point of order under clause 4 of rule XXI of the      Rules of the House, or further amendment to the bill when it      is considered on the House floor.       The Committee on Appropriations takes this action with the      mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction      over the subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation, we do not agree to future suspension or waivers      of the House rule restricting the carrying of appropriations      in measures and amendments thereto, and the Committee will be      appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or other      legislation carrying appropriations moves forward so that     we may address any issues within our jurisdiction and      provisions giving rise to a point of order--regardless of      whether a measure is similar to legislation passed by the      House in a previous Congress, or represents the product of      negotiation between parties or chambers.       The Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment      of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation, and request      your support for such a request.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1957.           Sincerely,                                                    Nita M. Lowey,     Chairwoman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2019.     Hon. Nita M. Lowey,     Chairwoman, Committee on Appropriations,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Lowey: Thank you for consulting with the      Committee on Ways and Means on provisions of H.R. 1957, the      Taxpayer First Act of 2019, for which the Committee on      Appropriations has a jurisdictional interest. I appreciate      your agreement to not pursue a sequential referral or assert      any point of order so that the legislation may proceed      expeditiously to the House floor.       The Committee on Ways and Means confirms our mutual      understanding that your Committee does not waive any      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or      similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation      moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues      within your Committee's jurisdiction.       I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the      bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this      legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you      on this measure and future legislation.           Sincerely,                                                  Richard E. Neal,                                                         Chairman.
