First, Mr. Chairman, let me congratulate the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for this amendment, and more than that for being able to communicate with the ranking member and myself on your wishes in your district, and being so kind to me when I was in your district this last year. I do thank you for that.  I have reviewed this amendment with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), and we are willing to accept the amendment.
