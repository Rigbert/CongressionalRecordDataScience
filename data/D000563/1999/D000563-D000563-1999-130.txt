 I offered a substitute which related strictly to late-term abortions, those occurring after viability, after a fetus could survive, and said that we would only allow an abortion in an emergency circumstance where the life of the mother was at stake or the situation where continuing the pregnancy ran the risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. I believe, of course, the Court will, if it comes to that, ultimately decide what I have offered, being postviability, is consistent with Roe v. Wade which drew that line. Before that fetus is viable and can survive outside the womb, the woman has certain rights. When the viability occurs, then those rights change, according to Roe v. Wade.  To make sure I understand, the Senator from Iowa is offering an amendment that is not antagonistic to my amendment but, rather, wants to put the Senate on record on the most basic question about Roe v. Wade as to whether or not the Senate supports it.  My question to the Senator is this: Is the Senator saying in his amendment, in the conclusion of the amendment, Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an important constitutional right, and such decision should not be overturned--that is the conclusion of his amendment--is he saying that if we are to keep abortion legal in this country and safe under Roe v. Wade, we vote for his amendment and those who believe abortion should be outlawed or prohibited or illegal would vote against his amendment? Is that the choice?
