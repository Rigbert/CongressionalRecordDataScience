I voted for NAFTA, but I voted for it with the understanding that we could impose the same health and safety standards on companies and countries exporting to the United States that we impose on American companies; that that would be fair trade. We would be treating ourselves the same way as we treat others.  I want to make it clear for the record, and I think the Senator from North Dakota has made this point, all we are trying to establish is that Mexican trucks and Mexican drivers will be held to the same standards of safety and competency as American trucks and American drivers. Is that the case?
