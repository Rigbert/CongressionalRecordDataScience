 President, Iowa has lost another native son fighting for our liberty on foreign soil. I am sad to announce that on Monday, November 5, just as our Nation was preparing to cast our ballots in the election, PFC Brandon Buttry of Shenandoah, IA, gave his life defending our freedom. He was only 19 years old but had felt a calling to join the military since he was a young child. I thank God for such patriots as Brandon Buttry. Without such brave and selfless Americans in each new generation, our liberty and way of life could not have been sustained.  My prayers go out to his parents, Don and Pam, his many brothers and sisters, and all those who knew and loved Brandon. He is described as having a mischievous smile and a twinkle in his eye as well as a slight contrarian streak. By all accounts, he was liked by all who knew him, and I know he will be missed very deeply in his community.  I understand he had an interest in American history, and his love of his country is evident from his deep desire to serve. He has now given the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his fellow countrymen, and his name will be immortalized alongside all those other American patriots who have laid down their lives in the name of freedom.
