Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Marlan Bourns, who passed away on Tuesday, March 18, 2014. Marlan was a pillar of the community in Riverside County and he will be deeply missed.  Marlan was born May 28, 1920, not far from Milford, Michigan, to Frank and Bernice Bourns and was raised from humble beginnings. He grew up in the same home his mother was raised in, which stood on 40 acres of farmland. Marlan was enrolled in the local school, Picket School, which only consisted of one room, but provided him with a quality education. While growing up, Marlan took on many jobs on the farm including counting sheep, collecting eggs from the hen coup, and bringing in water from the well. Marlan also developed an interest in the technical fields and started reading the magazine Popular Mechanics at a young age.  This interest quickly manifested itself into a passion and a hobby. Marlan took the technical knowledge he gained through reading and began building things by himself. He built a shooting gallery to practice his BB gun shot, a small working submarine, and eventually two working automobiles that could fit full-sized adults. Marlan also took up an interest in musical performance, and developed a knack for playing the saxophone during his high school years. He also honed his skills playing the clarinet and piano and created both a band and a lucrative business by playing his instruments at weddings. Soon, Marlan would go on to graduate high school with a perfect record and earned a spot at the University of Michigan where he would graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Physics and a lifetime membership with the Phi Beta Kappa Academic Honor Society. Throughout his time in high school and as an undergraduate, Marlan's interest in technology was manifested during his shop classes and he was known for being able to convert innovative ideas into hardware.  Marlan also met the love of his life, Rosemary, during his time at the University of Michigan, whom he would marry in her parent's living room shortly after she graduated from the same university in 1947. After being selected for a top secret U.S. Navy program at the California Institute of Technology, which was instrumental in the development of the Manhattan Project, Marlan and his new bride made the cross-country trek to California with the help of her parents. The couple purchased an older home in Altadena, California, and started Bourns Laboratories, which recently celebrated its 65th Anniversary, in their single car garage.  Rosemary ran the business side of the operation and Marlan was the innovator, and together, they made an unstoppable team. The Bourns family worked diligently making and testing products with what little resources they had. With the creation of one successful prototype, made out of a Whitman's candy box, they earned a massive contract with Consolidated Vultee in San Diego for many of their projects including linear motion potentiometers, vane transducers, accelerometers and bourdon tube pressure transducers. Though the company would rapidly grow over the coming years, Rosemary and Marlan remained very personally involved in its development and made sure to establish relationships with their employees. They built manufacturing plants for their products all over the world, and found a passion for traveling as they regularly visited them.  Marlan, who holds over 100 patents to his name, was often honored throughout his career for his significant contributions to growth of the electronic components industry. He washonored as the ``Fellow of the Bourns College of Engineering'' by the college he helped establish at University of California, Riverside. He and Rosemary were also honored as Sensors Magazine's 1996 Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010 and as Cal State University, San Bernardino's recipients of the Spirit of the Entrepreneur Award and Lifetime Achievement Award.  Marlan is survived by his son Gordon; daughters Linda Hill, Anita Macbeth and Denise Moyles; 14 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren who will fondly remember his sense of humor and compassion for others.  Marlan will always be remembered for his incredible contributions to business, his work ethic, generosity, and love of family. His dedication to his work and community is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Marlan's family and friends; although Marlan may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
