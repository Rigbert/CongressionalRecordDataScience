Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 40 seconds to respond briefly.  The plain text and the implementation by the Clinton administration and by the Reagan-Bush administrations proves that the Mexico City Policy has nothing whatsoever to do with counseling for abortions. That is not on the table, it is not being considered. As much as I would rather it be the case, it is not part of this amendment.  Secondly, the Mexico City Policy does provide for abortions for rape, incest, or life of the mother with their own funds.  Finally, the Policy reflects our intent that every effort to treat a woman suffering from an incomplete abortion be done and is fully authorized by this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).                              {time}  1045
