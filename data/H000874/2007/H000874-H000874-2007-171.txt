It does not help, in my opinion, the debate to impugn the integrity of those who are serving our country in uniform in harm's way.  I believe that General Petraeus is an honorable man of great integrity who has served our country well. I may disagree with him; he may disagree with me on issues. But that does not in any way, any more than you and I might disagree and we are good friends, undermine our respect for each other's opinion.  And as I say, I want to articulate, because you bring up the issue, that I believe that that impugning of his integrity and of his patriotism and of his commitment to this country was inappropriate.
