 President, I can understand why the Senator may think we have had hearings because we have had hearings on other subjects that implicate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is mentioned by witnesses. But we have never had a hearing on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--a treaty of great consequence to the United States and the world--conducted in the traditional way. We never had a hearing where we said this is what we are going to talk about. We need a hearing where we bring up the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, or major voices in America who oppose this treaty--fortunately, I think there are not that many--or significant figures and scientists who have spoken and know about this issue. We haven't had one of those hearings at all.  I submit for the Record, again, a letter from the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee sent to the President of the United States on January 21, 1998, with a concluding paragraph, which reads as follows:       Mr. President, let me be clear. I will be prepared to      schedule Committee consideration of the CTBT only after the      Senate has had an opportunity to consider and vote on the      Kyoto Protocol and the amendments to the ABM Treaty.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                               Committee on Foreign Relations,                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 1998.     The President,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: As congress prepares to reconvene      shortly, I am convinced that it is important to share with      you the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's agenda relating      to consideration of treaties during the second year of the      105th Congress.       There are a number of important treaties which the      Committee intends to take up during 1998, and we must be      assured of your Administration's cooperation in making      certain that these treaties receive a comprehensive      examination by the Senate.       Mr. President, the Committee's first priority when Congress      reconvenes will be to work with you and Secretary Albright to      secure Senate ratification of NATO expansion. The expansion      of the Atlantic Alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the      Czech Republic is of critical importance, and we have come a      long way in resolving some of the concerns that I, and other      Senators, had raised about various details of this expansion      (e.g., ensuring an equitable distribution of costs, limiting      Russian influence in NATO decision making, et al.)       While much work remains to be done, I am confident that if      we continue to work together, the Senate will vote to approve      the expansion of the Atlantic Alliance early this Spring.       Following the vote on NATO expansion, the Committee will      turn its attention to several other critical treaties which      could affect both the security of the American people and the      health of the United States' economy. Chief among these are      the agreements on Multilateralization and Demarcation of the      1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, and the Kyoto      Protocol to the UN Convention on Climate Change.       Mr. President, I feel obliged to make clear to you my      concern that your Administration has been unwisely and      unnecessarily engaged in delay in submitting these treaties      to the Senate for its advice and consent.       Despite your commitment, made nearly eight months ago, to      submit the amendments to the ABM Treaty to the Senate, we      have yet to see them. As our current stand-off with Iraq      clearly demonstrates, the danger posed by rogue states      possessing weapons     of mass destruction is growing--and, with it, the need for a      robust ballistic missile defense.       The Senate has not had an opportunity to consider the      rationale behind the ABM Treaty since that treaty was      ratified nearly 26 years ago, in the midst of the Cold War.      The world has changed a great deal since then. It is vital      that the Senate conduct a thorough review of the ABM Treaty      this year when it considers and votes on the ABM      Multilateralization and Demarcation agreements.       Similarly, the Senate is forced to continue to wait for any      indication that your Administration intends to submit the      Kyoto Protocol for the Senate's advice and consent. Indeed, I      have heard a great deal of discussion from supporters of this      treaty indicating that the Administration may attempt to      circumvent both the Senate--and the American people--by      simply imposing the treaty's requirements on U.S. businesses      by executive order. Mr. President, I must respectfully      counsel this would be extremely unwise.       This treaty clearly requires the advice and consent of the      Senate. further, because the potential impact of the Kyoto      Protocol on the American economy is so enormous, we owe it to      the American people to let them know sooner, rather than      later, whether they will be subject to the terms of this      treaty.       Ironically, while the Administration has delayed in      submitting these vital treaties to the Senate, some in your      Administration have indicated that the White House will press      the Senate for swift ratification of the Comprehensive Test      Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately following the vote on NATO      expansion.       Such a deliberate confrontation would be exceedingly unwise      because, Mr. President, the CTBT is very low on the      Committee's list of priorities. The treaty has no chance of      entering into force for a decade or more. Article 14 of the      CTBT explicitly prevents the treaty's entry into force until      it has been ratified by 44 specific nations. One of those 44      nations is North Korea, which is unlikely to ever ratify the      treaty. Another of the 44 nations--India--has sought to block      the CTBT at every step: vetoing it in the Conference on      Disarmament so that it could not be submitted as a Conference      document. India has opposed it in the United Nations. And,      India has declared that it will not even sign the treaty.       By contrast, the issues surrounding the ABM Treaty and the      Kyoto Protocol are far more pressing (e.g., the growing      threat posed by nuclear, biological, or chemical tipped      missiles, and the potential impact of the Kyoto Protocol on      the U.S. economy).       Mr. President, let me be clear: I will be prepared to      schedule Committee consideration of the CTBT only after the      Senate has had the opportunity to consider and vote on the      Kyoto Protocol and the amendments to the ABM Treaty.       When the Administration has submitted these treaties, and      when the Senate has completed its consideration of them,      then, and only then, will the Foreign Relations Committee      consider the CTBT.       Mr. President, please let's work together, beginning with      the effort to secure Senate ratification of NATO expansion      this Spring, and then with your timely transmittal of these      treaties.           Sincerely and respectfully,                                                      Jesse Helms.
