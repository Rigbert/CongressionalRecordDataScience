I thank my friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 514 will raise the status of the J/TIP Office to that of a bureau, ensuring that the leadership of J/TIP is present and has an equal voice at meetings with the other bureaus and the Secretary of State.  Former colleague, John Miller, an Ambassador at Large from 2002 to 2006 said:       Upgrading the status of the Office to a bureau will not      create additional bureaucracy--it will simply give J/TIP and      the Ambassador at Large who heads it equal standing with      regional and functional bureaus at the State Department. That      standing is absolutely essential for the issue to remain a      priority, especially when multiple U.S. interests are      engaged.  We are not authorizing the J/TIP Office to be larger, but for the excellent work of the Office to be consistently heard at a higher level.  In addition, the bill stops countries and other State Department bureaus from gaming the tier ranking system by limiting the time problem countries can use promises of action to avoid a tier downgrade.  Currently, a country can sit on the Tier 2 Watch List for up to 4 years with Presidential waivers, effectively stringing the U.S. along with promises to take action, but never actually taking action. After 4 years, by law, the country must be automatically downgraded to Tier 3.  The law worked very well in its first implementation in the 2013 reporting cycle, but we discovered a problem in 2013, when China was prematurely upgraded from Tier 3 to the Tier 2 Watch List. As the law is currently written, Mr. Speaker, China can, again, game the system with promises and no action for 4 years.
