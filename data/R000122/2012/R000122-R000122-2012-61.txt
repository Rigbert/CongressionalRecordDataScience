It will deny critical services to families all across this country, and it will do something else--it will deny us the chance to bend that proverbial cost curve. If we do not control those costs, we will be in a fiscal disaster. The proposal they are making does not make sense. We have proposed to close a tax loophole that has been described by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration as a multibillion-dollar employment tax shelter.  We have restricted it to the people who are receiving over $200,000 a year. This is not small business men and women. This is not the corner hardware store. These are lobbyists. These are lawyers who have craftily used subchapter S corporations to avoid paying payroll taxes.  This loophole has been criticized on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal. This is no ``just raise taxes.'' This is trying to find a loophole which has been criticized by the right as well as the left to pay for and ensure that we do not double the interest rate on students. I cannot think of a clearer choice: Reject the Republican proposal; accept our proposal; do not allow the subsidized student loan interest rate to rise on July 1.
