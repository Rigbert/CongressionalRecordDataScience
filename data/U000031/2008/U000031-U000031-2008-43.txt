Gloria Cooper of Niles, Michigan for over two decades of broadcasting excellence.  For nearly a quarter century, we in southwest Michigan welcomed Gloria into our homes as the hostess of the popular ``Here's Gloria'' and ``Gloria's Place'' radio programs on WNIL-AM 1290. Since she first hit the airwaves in 1966, Gloria's in-depth interviews and community focus through the years earned her the reputation as the ``Voice of Niles.''  In 2006, Gloria took her show to the Web where she has continued to educate and entertain her faithful listeners. On November 24, Gloria will record her final interview, marking the end of an era. We will all miss Gloria's voice over the airwaves and Internet. She is a treasure of our community, and I will miss being ``grilled'' by my friend on the pressing issues of the day.  Once again, I would like to congratulate and express my gratitude to Gloria Cooper for her many years of distinguished service to the residents of Berrien County. I wish Gloria and her husband Richard all the best. May God continue to bless the entire Cooper family. Gloria's gift of communication has enriched us all.                          ____________________
