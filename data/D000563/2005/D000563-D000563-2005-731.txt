President, I will tell you, when we hear about the contracts that are being let for Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters, it raises similar questions. Just last week, the head of procurement in the White House, Mr. Safavian, was arrested. He was the top man in the White House when it came to procurement and contracts. Because of some misrepresentations that he apparently made--it has been alleged that he made these misrepresentations--he has been asked to step down from this spot in the White House.  But we have to ask about the contracts that are being let now for Hurricane Katrina.
