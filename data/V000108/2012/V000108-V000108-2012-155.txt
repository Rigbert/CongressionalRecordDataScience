Speaker, it is with immense sadness and great respect that I rise to remember Staff Sergeant David P. Nowaczyk for his bravery and willingness to fight for his country. Sergeant Nowaczyk was assigned to A Company, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, out of Fort Carson, Colorado. While serving on his third tour in Afghanistan, Sergeant Nowaczyk was killed when his vehicle struck an enemy improvised explosive device in Kunar Province, Afghanistan.  David Nowaczyk, from Dyer, Indiana, graduated from Lake Central High School in 1997, where he was a member of the wrestling and football teams. Later, in September 2005, he enlisted in the Army. Throughout his career, Sergeant Nowaczyk earned several medals, honors, and commendations for his service, including: a National Defense Service Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, an Army Service Ribbon, two Army Commendation Medals, two Bronze Stars, and the Purple Heart, awarded posthumously.  Friends describe David as a loyal, kind man who would be willing to do anything for the people in his life. His family describes him as a good son and a great father who was willing to drop anything to be there for his family. Residents in the community are remembering Sergeant Nowaczyk as a dedicated warrior and a true American hero. Sergeant Nowaczyk leaves behind a beloved host of family and friends. He is survived by his devoted wife, Rachel, his adoring daughter, Kiley, and his loving stepson, Conner. David also leaves to cherish his memory his dear mother, Patti, and proud father, Andrew. He will also be greatly missed by his sister, Megan, with whom he was very close. Sergeant Nowaczyk also leaves behind many other friends and family members, as well as a grateful, yet deeply saddened community.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Staff Sergeant David Nowaczyk. Sergeant Nowaczyk sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his death comes as a great loss to our nation, which has once again been shaken by the realities of war. Sergeant Nowaczyk will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
