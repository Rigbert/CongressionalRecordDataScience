Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the efforts of the Lakeshore Areas Regional Recovery of Indiana, or LARRI for short, and to recognize its esteemed partners for their dedication as this organization reaches the end of its third, and final, year of operation. Although LARRI has served the Region admirably since the widespread flooding of Northwest Indiana in September of 2008, its work has come to an end, and the organization ceased operations on September 30, 2011.  LARRI was formed by a coalition of dedicated non-profit organizations in response the heavy flooding of Northwest Indiana in September of 2008. As the Little Calumet overflowed its banks, LARRI went into immediate action for its neighbors in need, and by the time it closed its doors, LARRI had coordinated more than 6,000 volunteers in removing 15,920 pounds of debris, building 5 homes, restoring another 600 more, and relocating 26 displaced families to new homes throughout the area. In short, LARRI has have helped to get a struggling region back on its feet withnothing more than volunteer time and donations. They are true examples of a civic spirit to which we can all aspire. Notable contributors to LARRI's philanthropic mission include: the Lake Area United Way, United Way of Porter County, Ridge United Methodist Church, Northwest Indiana Community Action Corporation, American Red Cross of Northwest Indiana, the Salvation Army, Dyer United Methodist Church, Gary Neighborhood, the Geminus Corporation, Continuum of Care Northwest Indiana, Lutheran Church Charities, Catholic Charities, McShane's Business Products and Solutions, and the Gary 411 newspaper, as well as individuals John Beebe and Ted Prettyman.  Mr. Speaker, Northwest Indiana is fortunate to have such an impressive array of willing humanitarians, and I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing this outstanding organization on its campaign. Although LARRI's efforts lasted a mere three years, this should only add to the profound impact the organization had on Northwest Indiana. I ask that you join me in honoring its individual members who freely gave so much of their time in service to their community.                          ____________________
