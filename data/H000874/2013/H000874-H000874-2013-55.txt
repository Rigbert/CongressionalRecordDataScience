Speaker, I heard from my friend, former Congressman Norm Dicks, today, and he asked me to submit this statement on his behalf. He had the privilege of serving with Chairman Bill Young for over thirty years on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee, and said this about him:       Chairman Young did more for the men and women in the armed      forces than anyone in Congress. Bill and Beverly made weekly      trips to Bethesda and Walter Reed to see our wounded warriors      and offered personal help to their families. Bill Young      believed in bi-partisanship; the Defense Subcommittee almost      always reported the Defense Appropriation bill with all      Members, Democrats and Republicans, in full support. Bill was      a great American, a great leader, and a great friend and he      will be truly missed.
