 President, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the fact that an American activist has been chosen as the recipient of the 2003 United Nations Population Award for only the second time in the history of the honor. This year's beneficiary, Werner Fornos, president of the Washington, DC-based Population Institute, is a well-known figure on Capitol Hill and a long-time advocate for international access to voluntary methods of family planning.  I ask that the following press release honoring Mr. Fornos' receipt of this prestigious award be printed in the Record.  The press release follows.        Werner Fornos Wins 2003 United Nations Population Award       Werner Fornos, a longtime Washington, D.C. resident and      special advisor to former U.S. House of Representatives      Speaker John W. McCormack, has been named the winner of the      2003 United Nations Population Award in the individual      category.       ``The selection is in recognition of your outstanding      contribution to the awareness of population growth,'' Thoraya      Ahmed Obaid, secretary of the award committee and executive      director of the U.N. Population Fund, wrote to Fornos      informing him of his selection.       The Family Planning Association of Kenya will receive the      award in the institutional category. Founded in 1962 as a      volunteer-based nongovernmental organization, it has      pioneered the family planning movement in Kenya, promoting      the provision of sexual and reproductive health services      within the     context of reproductive rights and the empowerment of young      people.       Under the chairmanship of Jean-Claude Alexandre, Haiti's      Ambassador to the United Nations, the award committee also      consists of representatives of Burundi, Cape Verde, the      Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, the Republic of Moldova, and the      Netherlands, together with a representative of the U.N.      Secretary-General and Mrs. Obaid.       The citation is the only regular United Nations award of      its kind and consists of a medal, a diploma and a monetary      prize of $12,500 to each of the winners. The committee      selected the Family Planning Association of Kenya as the 2003      laureate in the institutional category.       The award ceremony and reception is tentatively scheduled      for June 18 at United Nations Headquarters in New York.       Born in Leipzig, Germany, in November 1933, Fornos was      separated from his family when the apartment building in      which they were living was destroyed in an allied bombing      raid.       He later became the ``mascot'' of the 29th Infantry      Division of the United States Army, and stowed away four      times on troop ships and airplanes in efforts to emigrate to      the United States before he was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Jaime      Fornos of Newton, Massachusetts.       A 1965 graduate of the University of Maryland University      College, which recently named him Alumnus of the Year, with a      degree in government and politics, Fornos has served in the      Maryland state legislature and as the state's Assistant      Secretary of Human Resources and Manpower Administrator. He      also served as a special assistant to U.S. Assistant      Secretary of Labor for labor-management relations and Deputy      Assistant Manpower Administrator.       Prior to being named as president of the Population      Institute, Fornos was executive director of the Population      Action Council; executive director of Planned Parenthood of      Washington, D.C.; and assistant professor at George      Washington University, where he headed its Population      Information Program.       Fornos has been a management consultant in family planning      implementation and effectiveness to the U.S. Agency for      International Development, the American Public Health      Association, and Westinghouse Health Services. He has worked      on population and family planning projects for Tunisia,      Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Mexico, the Philippines, China,      Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Kenya.       He has addressed plenary sessions of virtually every major      international population meeting since the 1974 World      Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania, including the      1984 International Population Conference in Mexico City, and      the 1994 International Conference on Population and      Development in Cairo, Egypt. Fornos has been named Humanist      of the Year by the American Humanist Association and he is a      recipient of Germany's Order of Merit, the highest      distinction granted by the German government to a non-German      citizen in recognition of humanitarian efforts.       He is an honorary professor of international relations at      Szechuan University in China; a member of the board of      directors of the United Nations Association of the United      States; an elected member of the International Union for the      Scientific Study of Population; and he is the recipient of      several Paul Harris Fellowships from Rotary      International.                          ____________________
