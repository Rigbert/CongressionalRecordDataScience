President, you have heard me recount numerous stories on the importance of agriculture in my home State of Kansas. Many of these stories center around the fact that cattle outnumber people by more than two to one, and I often joke that cattle are usually in a better mood. In recent years, the Kansas livestock industry has accounted for nearly 50 percent of all agricultural cash receipts within the State.  Mr. Lee Borck, chairman, and Mr. Andrew Murphy, president and chief executive officer, of Innovative Livestock Services have played a key role within the livestock industry. I want to take this opportunity to recognize part of the Innovative Livestock Services operation, Ward Feed Yard, on celebrating 50 years of feeding cattle. Great Bend Feeding and Ward Feed Yard, both part of the Innovative Livestock Services operation, have now been in business for more than 50 years. There is no doubt in the strong heritage, optimistic outlook and positive economic development this cattle feeding company has created in Kansas. Just as the beef industry is a leading segment of the agriculture industry in Kansas, with the leadership of Mr. Borck and Mr. Murphy, InnovativeLivestock Services is a true champion within the beef industry.  Today I wish to say congratulations to all of those who have helped over the past 50 years and to wish Ward Feed Yard nothing but the best for the next 50 years. Congratulations to all of the partners, employees, customers, community leaders and industry representatives on a job well done.                          ____________________
