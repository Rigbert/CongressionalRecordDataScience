 President, this morning the Senate will resume debate on the budget resolution. Under the order from last night, 40 hours remain for consideration of the resolution. We anticipate the amendment process will begin today and, therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout today's session.  I remind my colleagues that the majority leader has stated we will finish the budget resolution this week. Therefore, late night sessions, obviously, can be expected, and Senators should make their plans accordingly.  Having said that, I believe we are ready for the resolution to be reported.                          ____________________
