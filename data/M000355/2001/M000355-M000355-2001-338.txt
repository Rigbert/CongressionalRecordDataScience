 President, that is where we stand for the evening. I believe the Senator from Illinois would like to dispose of his amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask what the parliamentary procedure will be?  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, what I thought I would do is give the Senator from Illinois a chance to withdraw his amendment; is that correct?
