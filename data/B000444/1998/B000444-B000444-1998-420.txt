 I am trying to define--I mean, I am trying to get a clearer picture of what the Senator means by ``urgent.'' He is not suggesting it requires there be a Russian division breathing down the throat, making threats to come across the line, merely that there was this power, this entity, that existed that, if it chose to exercise its military strength, was a real threat.
