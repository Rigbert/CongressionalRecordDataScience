Chairman, I am more than happy to work with the young lady to get additional funding for Indian education at any time in the future, and we can continue to work together to do that.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I also appreciate the Parliamentarian's patience and the majority's patience while we get another copy of the amendment presented to the body for consideration. I thank everyone for their courtesy.  Mr. Chairman, Minnesota is a great State, and we would like to have the gentleman from California there so the gentleman can see our great lakes and our great water.  I yield to the gentleman from California.
