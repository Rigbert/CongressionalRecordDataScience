 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Lautenberg to introduce the Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act of 1999. This bill will reclassify powerful .50 caliber military sniper rifles under the National Firearms act, thus making it much more difficult for terrorists, doomsday cults, and criminals to obtain these guns for illegitimate use.  Let me just talk a little bit about what a .50 caliber gun is, and then I will describe why I believe it is vital to tighten the rules surrounding their use and purchase.  These .50 caliber firearms are weapons of such range and destructive capability that it seems unthinkable for them to fall into civilian hands. These.50 caliber guns, manufactured by a small handful of companies and individuals, are deadly, military style assault rifles. The M82A1, one common example of these guns, was manufactured with one purpose in mind--the efficient destruction of enemy armaments and personnel. These guns, weighing 28 pounds and capable of piercing light armor at more than 4 miles, enable a single shooter to destroy enemy jeeps, tanks, personnel carriers, bunkers, fuel stations, and even communication centers. As a result, their use by military organizations worldwide has been rapidly spreading during the course of this decade.  But with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also seen increased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists around the world.  The weapons are deadly accurate up to 2,000 yards. This means that a shooter using a .50 caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than a mile away. In fact, according to a training manual for military and police snipers published in 1993, a bullet from this gun ``even at one and a half miles crashes into a target with more energy than Dirty Harry's famous .44 magnum at point-blank'' range.  And the gun is ``effective'' up to 7,500 yards. In other words, although it may be hard to aim at that distance, the gun will have its desired destructive effect at that distance--more than 4 miles from the target.  The weapon can penetrate several inches of steel, concrete, or even light armor.  Many ranges used for target practice do not even have enough safety features to accommodate these guns--it is just too powerful.  This gun was used extensively in the gulf war by American troops. Ideal for long range destruction of personnel, light armor or communications, there is no question that this gun is an effective wartime tool.  Recent advances in weapons technology, however, allow this gun to be used by civilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and even aircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the gun apparently promoted the weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars' worth of jet aircraft with one or two dollars' worth of cartridge.''  One new version of the .50 caliber weapon is a modified machine gun capable of accepting ammunition belts, and yet is still allowed for civilian use by BATF.  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover GAO investigators ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time before someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits a school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50 calibers. This gun is just too powerful.''  Mr. President, a recent study by the General Accounting Office revealed some eye-opening facts about how and where this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained.  The GAO reports that many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and international terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, drug traffickers, and violent criminals.  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns and stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition and other guns.  At least one .50 caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities after a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. The gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the guns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide.  Accoring to a recent news story, another .50 caliber sniper rifle, smuggled out of the United States, was used by the Irish Republican Army to kill a large number of British soldiers.  And ammunition for these guns is also readily available, even over the Internet. Bullets for these guns include ``armor piercing incendiary'' ammunition that explodes on impact, and even ``armor piercing tracing'' ammunition reminiscent of the ammunition that lit up the skies over Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war.  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing ammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the investigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored limousine or maybe to ``take down'' a helicopter.  In fact, our own military helps to provide thousands of rounds of .50 caliber ammunition, by essentially giving away tons of spent cartridges, many of which are then refurbished and sold on the civilian market.  The bill I offer today will begin the process of making these guns harder to get and easier to track.  Current law classifies .50 caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to the least government regulation for any firearm. Sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and even handguns are more highly regulated than this military sniper rifle.  In fact, many states allow possession of .50 caliber guns by those as young as 14 years old, and there is no regulation on second-hand sales.  Essentially, this bill would re-classify .50 caliber guns under the National Firearms Act, which imposes far stricter standards on powerful and destruction weapons.  For instance:  NFA guns may only be purchased from a licensed dealer, and not second-hand. This will prevent the sale of these guns at gun shows and in other venues that make it hard for law enforcement to track the weapons.  Second, purchasers of NFA guns must fill out license transfer applications and provide fingerprints to be processed by the FBI in detailed criminal background checks. By reclassifying the .50 caliber, Congress will be making a determination that sellers should be more careful about to whom they give these powerful, military guns.  ATF reports that this background check process takes about 60 days, so prospective gun buyers will face some delay. However, legitimate purchasers of this $7,000 gun can certainly wait that long.  Clearly, Mr. President, placing a few more restrictions on who can get these guns and how is simply common sense. This bill will not ban the sale, use or possession of .50 caliber weapons. The .50 caliber shooting club will not face extinction, and ``legitimate'' purchasers of these guns will not lose their access--even though that, too, might be a reasonable step, since I cannot imagine a legitimate use of this gun.  The bill will simply place stricter requirements on the way in which these guns can be sold, and to whom. The measure is meant to offer a reasoned solution to making it harder for terrorists, assassins, and other criminals to obtain these powerful weapons. If we are to continue to allow private citizens to own and use guns of this caliber, range, and destructive power, we should at the very least take greater care in making sure that these guns do not fall into the wrong hands.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
