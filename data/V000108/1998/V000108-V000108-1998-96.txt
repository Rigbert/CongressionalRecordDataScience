Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate a prominent humanitarian activist, the Reverend Charles Doyle, of Beverly Shores, Indiana, for his lifetime of service, compassion, and leadership in Northwest Indiana. After forty-five years of service with the Catholic Church, Father Doyle is retiring. On Sunday, June 28, 1998, a celebration will be held in Father Doyle's honor at St. Ann's Church, where he has served as pastor for the last thirty years.  Father Doyle has never believed that his work as a priest was limited to Sunday mornings. Even though he is extremely dedicated to the people of his parish, Father Doyle has never restricted his humanitarian activities to only his parishioners. Instead, he aids as many people as he can, no matter their situation. Indeed, Father Doyle's activism spans four decades and includes service as Chaplain at the Indiana State Prison, Chaplain of the Beatty Memorial Hospital in Westville, Indiana, priest for seven different parishes, Public Defender in LaPorte County, Indiana, and a member of the Indiana State Bar, with a specialization in criminal defense. In addition, Father Doyle has served as a board member of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, the Calumet Chapter of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, the Indiana Coalition Against the Death Penalty, and the Northwest Indiana Open Housing Center. He was also Counsel to the Michigan City Human Rights Commission, the Chairperson of the Indiana Chapter to the Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants, and a founding member of the Northwest Indiana Coalition to Abolish Control Unit Prisons. Father Doyle has been honored as an Honorary Chaplain for the Indiana House of Representatives. He has also received numerous awards including: the Whitlock Award, from the Indiana Civil Liberties Union; the Artisan Award, from the Academy of Fine Arts and Friends; and the Life Achievement Award, from the Indiana Public Defender Council.  Born in Nappanee, Indiana in 1927, Father Doyle is a lifelong Hoosier, As a young man, he chose to serve God and graduated from St. Meinrad College and Seminary, with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, followed by his ordination. In 1962, Father Doyle continued his education by earning a Master degree in counseling from Loyola University. After marching with Martin Luther King, Jr., from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965, Father Doyle decided to turn to law as another way to further his ministry and to aid people. Turning this dream into reality, he graduated from Valparaiso University's Law School in 1974 and soon passed the bar examination.  One of the true activists of the region, Father Doyle may be leaving the pulpit, but he will never abandon his work for social justice and prison reform. He plans to work for the goals of prison reform, abolition of the death penalty, and an end to the spirit of vengeance that pervades our society. Toward these ends, Father Doyle plans to write articles and lecture in high school and college classrooms to raiseawareness and educate people about the true conditions in prison as well as on death row.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Reverend Charles Doyle for his lifetime of service and dedication to the people of Northwest Indiana and the citizens of the United States. Father Doyle's unceasing service has left an indelible mark on Indiana's First Congressional District and serves as a shining example for activists all over the world.                          ____________________
