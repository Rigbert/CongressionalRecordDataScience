Hilary will step down at the end of this year, after 17 years with the RIAA. She leaves a legacy of remarkable efforts to ensure that innovations are protected while finding legitimate new venues in the Digital Age. She has accomplished a great deal while at the same time ushering the organization, and the music industry, through extremely trying years.  After matriculating at George Washington University and earning a Bachelor of Arts in International Business, Hilary devoted her energies to working for a former Governor of New Jersey in addition to two senatorial transition teams, those of my distinguished colleague and former colleague, Dianne Feinstein and Bill Bradley. She was an accomplished advocate and began her own consulting firm in 1987. Hilary's hard work and talent were rewarded in 1998 when she assumed the position of Chair and CEO at the RIAA.  She has represented the music industry with both tenacity and good humor. While the Internet has ushered in a new era of information and communication capabilities, we are now well aware of the dangers posed by this innovation. These dangers take many forms: the security issues that result when we have achieved so much interconnectedness, the proliferation of child pornography that seeks to exploit society's most vulnerable, and of course the threat posed to copyright holders by those who distribute, for free, the work products of artists. Hilary has made genuine headway, sometimes single-handedly, in harnessing the power of the Internet to further the goals of the music industry while helping in the fight against the worst abuses of technology.  But her political activities extend well beyond the boundaries of the organization she leads. She was a founding member of Rock the Vote, a group which has successfully sought to reach out to younger Americans, imbuing those coming of age with the belief that they can have a positive impact on our political processes. And she sits on numerous not-for-profit boards including the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Y.E.S. to Jobs, and the National Cancer Foundation. Looking at the list of groups she is involved with, the variety of causes she champions rivals the diversity of artists and labels she represents.  We know that her partner, Elizabeth Birch, and their twins, Jacob and Anna, will enjoy having more time with Hilary. If past experience is a predictor of future performance, she will shine in whatever endeavor she next chooses.                          ____________________
