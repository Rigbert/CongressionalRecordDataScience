 Chairman, in all honesty, I really sincerely believe this should not be a political debate for this reason: Any sensible business person invests in the future. He or she purchases, say, new machinery, new technology. If the only part of the equation that one looked at was the million dollars one invested in new technology without looking at the cost savings that are coming down the road, that would be a very poor business person. I do not think we disagree on that.
