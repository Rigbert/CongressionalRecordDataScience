I tell him, for the record, on May 25 of last year, we sent a letter to him about Goldman Sachs, asking that we have some information about the $140 billion figure, how it was arrived at, and how it will be paid for. So this is not the first time this issue has come up.  It is curious to me that we are writing a bill that is going to change the laws of all the States of America, and if we are going to close those courtrooms across America. Yet the Senator from Pennsylvania had to issue a subpoena to obtain a list of the names of the companies that are going to contribute to the trust fund. This is a very strange process.  Usually, legislation emanates from within Congress and affects the outside world. It appears that the secret list at issue emanated from the outside and whoever created it wasn't anxious to share it. So if there is skepticism by those of us critical of the bill, I think there is good reason.  We never received a reply to our May letter of last year. It is an indication to me that this whole process has been very unusual and very different from any process I have seen.  Somewhere, someone has come up with a number as to how much we need to compensate these victims, and someone has come up with a source on how that number will be arrived at, and the chairman had to go to the lengths of subpoenaing the information that was the basis for this bill that will affect hundreds of thousands of Americans and their lives.
