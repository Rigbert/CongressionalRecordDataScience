 President, if I could just say to my friend, I couldn't agree more. I think the debate was handled very nicely. Members got an opportunity to have their say, to get their votes, and the Senate has done itself proud. In spite of the mixed views about the outcome, the Senate did itself proud with the first two bills this year, and I hope it is a good recipe for the future.                          ____________________
