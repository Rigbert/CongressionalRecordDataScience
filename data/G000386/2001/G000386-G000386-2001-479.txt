 One of the tests, I suggest to the Senator from Minnesota, that my position might be right is the fact that this bill passed three Congresses ago, 97-1. It passed two Congresses ago, one time 84-13, another time 70-28. It would be the law of the land now because we had the votes to override a veto, except that it was pocket vetoed by President Clinton. It was not vetoed by President Clinton in the way that we could override it.  I hope, for the cynical people--maybe everybody is somewhat cynical about Congress, but some people are more cynical than others--they are a little less cynical on legislation that gets broad bipartisan support. In other words, what I am saying is, there are 31 Members of Senator Wellstone's party who voted for cloture on this bill yesterday to help us get it passed. That is a test that this legislation is well compromised--in my judgment, maybe too much compromised; I would rather have a stronger bill--and it is a good product to send to the President to be the law of the land.  This legislation should be passed. I hope it will. I am going to leave toother Republicans to speak about the merits or demerits of the Wellstone legislation because I have to go to a committee meeting. I do want to give a historical context of why we are here today.  I pursued this bankruptcy legislation because I have a real conviction that when you are right, you eventually win out. This is the third Congress. It would be the law of the land now except for President Clinton's pocket veto. President Bush has said he will sign it. The bipartisanship shows the rightness of it. We are going to have an example this year of right winning out.  I thank the Senator from Utah for coming to the floor. The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has done so much to help move this legislation along, particularly when I have been so busy as the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I thank Senator Hatch for doing that.
