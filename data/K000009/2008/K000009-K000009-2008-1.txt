Congresswoman Marcia Fudge will become an outstanding Member of this House. She is an attorney, a businesswoman, and a mayor--indeed, the first female mayor, and first African American mayor of Warrensville, Ohio--since the year 2000. That alone constitutes major accomplishments.  She has her law degree from Cleveland State University, and she will become the ninth female Member ever elected to this Chamber from the great State of Ohio, and only the second African American woman ever to be elected from our State.  As Mayor of Warrensville, Ohio, she has been heavily involved in economic development. In fact, she said, ``I believe people started to feel really good about where they lived because of the results of our economic development efforts, and I think when people feel good about where they live, that pride transitions into so many positive things.''  Congresswoman Fudge formerly served our beloved colleague Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones as her Chief of Staff during her early years. She also worked early in her career on Carl Stokes' Cleveland bid for mayor, as a teenager, heading up Young Folks for Stokes.  She has been a law clerk; a tax attorney; county prosecutor's office attorney; held Cuyahoga County Budget, Tax, and Finance positions; and she is Immediate Past President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, serving from 1996 to 2000. We know what a powerhouse that is.  She's also a board member of the famous Cleveland Public Library and, perhaps most important of all, she's a member of the Baptist Glenville Church of God. We know she's come this far by faith.  We welcome her here today and join her among our Buckeye ranks.  I would be pleased to yield to the fine dean of our delegation from the Republican side of the aisle, Congressman Ralph Regula, who we will say goodbye to as a Member this year, but not as a former Member, and we expect to see him and his beautiful wife, Mary, very often.
