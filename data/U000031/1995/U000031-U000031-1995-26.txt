Chairman, the premise of our amendment is very simple, and it is also fair. If our European allies do not begin paying their fair share of nonpersonnel costs for maintaining U.S. troops in Europe, then we are going to gradually reduce our troops.  A few years ago we had the same argument on this floor with regard to Japan. In fact, we heard exactly the same arguments against what we are doing today back then, but guess what? We passed that bill that day, and, when we begin talking about burden sharing, let us emphasize the word ``sharing.'' It should be understood that our regional interests are the shared interests of the nations in which we house our troops, and guess what? Because of what we passed several years ago, the Japanese contribute today 76 percent of the nonsalaried costs of U.S. troops. What is that figure? It is $4 billion. What are the Europeans doing today? Not 76 percent, where we are with the Japanese, not 50 percent, not 40 percent, not 30. It is a puny 20 percent.  As we have to work in this body towards a balanced budget, we have heard over and over that we have got to make some tough choices. Well, how on earth can we continue to spend billions and billions of dollars for the defense of wealthy European nations like the United Kingdom and others when it is time for them to begin to share their responsibility? This is a year when Members in this Congress are asking taxpayers to tighten their belts. It is only fair that we ask the Europeans to do the same.  Some have suggested to me today that perhaps, if this amendment passes, we would lose the authority to control our troops overseas. Nothing could be further from the case. U.S. control exists, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment that we passed on this House floor last year by a two to one margin.
