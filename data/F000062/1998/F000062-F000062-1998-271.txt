''  Resolve, the National Infertility Organization says, ``go slow.''  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Resolve,                                 Somerville, MA, January 30, 1998.     The Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: RESOLVE expresses its strong      support for the cloning bill being co-sponsored by you and      Senator Edward M. Kennedy. This bill, consistent with      RESOLVE's position, includes an important provision      specifying that research using somatic cell nuclear transfer      technology should not be banned while recommending a      moratorium on the cloning of a human being until further      review.       RESOLVE is pleased to note that the proposed legislation      does not ban embryo research. Embryo research has been      instrumental in the development of procedures that allow many      couples to overcome the difficulties they experience as they      strive to build families. The emotional and physical      consequences of this struggle can be overwhelming. In vitro      fertilization is an amazing technology which would not have      been possible without the knowledge gained through embryo      research. This effective treatment has brought about the      birth of thousands of much-wanted babies. Continued embryo      research has the potential to further the understanding of      the causes of infertility, including the tragedy of      miscarriage, as well as provide information which can lead to      new breakthroughs.       As a national organization which provides support, advocacy      and education to those experiencing infertility, RESOLVE is      contacted by thousands of people from all walks of life who      are struggling with this disease. The stories about their      struggles can be heart-wrenching. The success stories about      the joy and overwhelming appreciation of the children that      are brought into this world are enormously heart-warming.       Avenues for further research to help couples must not be      halted. RESOLVE joins with many other organizations across      the country in expressing its opposition to any attempts to      ban embryo research. We applaud your efforts to develop      carefully-constructed legislation which will not impact the      potential for medical advances that will help the many      couples struggling to build much-wanted families.           Sincerely,                                                 Diane D. Aronson,                                               Executive Director.
