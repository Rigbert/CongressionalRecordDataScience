Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to say that it is altogether fitting and proper that this legislation today is offered by the gentleman from Richmond, Virginia (Mr. Bliley), and this is certainly worthwhile and I urge its unanimous passage.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
