President, the Free Flow of Information Act is a bipartisan bill that goes a long way towards protecting the freedom of the press and the public's right to information without compromising national security or the work of law enforcement. It strikes the right balance between these competing priorities, and it deserves this body's support. I want to commend Senator Specter and Senator Schumer, the authors of this legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor.  During the last 30 years, many of our most important news stories were revealed to us by reporters who obtained their information from confidential sources. Often, these stories exposed government and corporate waste, fraud and abuse. Let me give you a few examples of what these confidential sources enabled journalists to report to the public: the President's warrantless surveillance program; the unsafe and deteriorating conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; the treatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib; the Enron accounting fraud scandal; the rampant abuse of steroids in major league baseball; and the government's misleading statements to the American people about the Vietnam war, as documented in the Pentagon Papers.
