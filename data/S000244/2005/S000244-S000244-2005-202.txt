Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 196, a resolution recognizing the anniversary of the ratification of the 13th amendment and encouraging the American people to educate and instill pride and purpose into their communities and to observe the anniversary annually with appropriate programs and activities.  In his Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, President Lincoln declared that, ``All persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thence forward and forever free.''  However, it took the ratification of the 13th amendment on December 6, 1865 to put an end officially to our Nation's tragic history and to extend to all citizens the promises and guarantees upon which this country was founded.  The first of three amendments known as the Civil War amendments, the 13th amendment liberated African Americans, enabling them and all Americans to experience the full meaning of citizenship and equal treatment under the law, including participation in the most fundamental aspects of our Democratic system of Government without regard to race or previous condition of servitude.  It is against this backdrop that the modern civil rights moment was born, and in this spirit that the Committee on the Judiciary, under my direction, is now examining certain provisions of the Voting Rights Act that are set to expire in 2007.  The 140th anniversary of the 13th amendment is an important mark in our history, and should serve as a reminder to all of our Nation's past. Most importantly, this anniversary provides an opportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to continue striving toward a color-blind society.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
