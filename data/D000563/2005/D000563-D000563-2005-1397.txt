The amendment she is proposing--and we hope will be embraced by both sides of the aisle--will set a goal to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I can't think of a single person in America who wouldn't agree with that goal. We can all understand that as we wait every day for a press release from the OPEC nations to try to determine whether or not the price of gasoline is going to go up or down. This proud, strong, leading nation in the world goes hat in hand to the Saudi peninsula looking for oil. We wait for them to determine what the price will be. It affects every individual and family and business and airline, right down the line.  Is it not true that the bill before us, S. 10, has a goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil over the next 10 years by 1 million barrels a day, which is not as ambitious or as far reaching as the goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent over 20 years? Is it not also true that the President sent a letter to Congress yesterday and said if we include this provision--the weaker provision that is already in the bill--reducing the barrels of oil by 1 million a day over 10 years, the President will veto the bill? Is that the message that we have received from the Bush White House about our goal in reducing dependence on foreign oil?
