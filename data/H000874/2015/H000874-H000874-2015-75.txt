The President has made it clear he is going to veto this bill not because he is against national security.  Ironically, Republicans have come to the number that the President proposed. There is a difference. The President paid for his number. He didn't pass it along to our children.  We must recognize this conference report for what it is: a vehicle for partisan messaging and an instrument for breaking with the Murray-Ryan principle of parity in defense and nondefense sequester relief. It is not a bill that makes America safer and a stronger force for justice around the world. Therefore, I will oppose it.  I thank my friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) once again for his work in trying to improve this bill in committee, on this floor and in conference, and for his untiring work in support of the men and women of our Nation's armed services.  I thank the chairman of the committee for the same thing. He was dealt a bad hand. I understand the hand he has to play. It is not good for our country.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
