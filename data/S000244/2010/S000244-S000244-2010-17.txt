Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1257, and I support the goals of Financial Literacy Month. I recognize the importance of encouraging Americans to educate themselves on financial responsibility.  However, the irony of this legislation is not lost on me. If April is to be recognized as Financial Literacy Month, might I suggest that Congress take the time to educate itself on fiscal responsibility and restraint? Last year, the federal deficit reached $1.4 trillion, undoubtedly an unsustainable figure. Additionally, asthe House considers this resolution, the chairman of the Budget Committee ponders whether to forgo a budget resolution for the next fiscal year.  While Americans across the country evaluate their priorities and make tough choices to responsibly adhere to their budgets, Congress ought to do likewise. When times get tough, it's not the American way to stick our head in the sand, but to address our issues head-on.  This resolution ``recognizes the importance of managing personal finances, increasing personal savings, and reducing personal debt in the United States,'' yet this Congress has consistently operated counter to the principles of managing, saving, and reducing debt. I encourage my colleagues to heed the advice we are giving the American people, and take a serious look at our finances. I believe the time has come for Congress to manage our nation's finances, increase our national savings, and reduce our national debt.
