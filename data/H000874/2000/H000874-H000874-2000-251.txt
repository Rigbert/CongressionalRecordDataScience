Chairman, was to add this money, which the President included in his bill, $14 million, to reach out to those with disabilities.  When George Bush, Republican President of the United States, signed the disabilities act on July 26, 1990, he said to all those with disabilities in America, 43 million people then, over 50 million now, he said to all those folks that we want to include them in; we want to give them the opportunity to work. But we have not succeeded. Why? Because we have not made the effort.  We passed the bill. Very nice. As the American public knows, to say in a statute rhetoric that they are free or they can work or they are going to be educated is fine, but if we do not work to make that happen and it is not reality, our country loses, and those with disabilities lose.
