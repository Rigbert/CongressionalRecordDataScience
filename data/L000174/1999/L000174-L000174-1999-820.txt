President, the House Managers want to conduct depositions of at least four people and their requests to admit affidavits could very well lead to the depositions of at least three others and, indeed, many more witnesses. The three people they expressly ask be subpoenaed are Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. All three have previously testified before the Starr grand jury and Ms. Lewinsky has been interviewed or testified at least 23 times on these matters over the last year.  The fourth deponent requested by the House Managers is none other than the President of the United States. Although they characterize their requestas a ``petition'' that the President be requested to appear, in their Memorandum, the House Republican Managers are less coy about their request. They note that ``obtaining testimony from the witness named in the motion, and additionally from the President himself'' is what they seek.  The House Manager' request is unprecedented in impeachments. The Senate has never formally requested or demanded that a respondent testify in his own impeachment trial. Should the President decide that he wants to speak to the Senate, that would be his choice. But I cannot support an effort that would have the Senate reject over 200 years of our jurisprudence and begin requiring an accused to prove his innocence.  The presumption of innocence is a core concept in our rule of law and should not be so cavalierly abandoned. The petition of the House Managers is a clever but destructive effort to stand this trial on its head. As a former prosecutor and trial attorney, I appreciate the temptation to turn the tables on an accused person to make up for a weak case, but the Senate should not condone it. The burden of proof is on the House to establish why the Senate should convict and remove from office the person the American people elected to serve as their President.  I commend President Clinton for focussing on his duties as President and on moving the country forward. That the Congress remains immersed in this impeachment trial is distraction enough from the functions of our federal government. We have heard hours of argument from the House Republican Managers and the response of the President's lawyers. Senator Byrd has, pursuant to our Unanimous Consent Resolution governing these proceedings, offered a motion to dismiss to bring this entire matter to conclusion. If, on the other hand, the majority in the Senate wishes to continue these proceedings, that is the majority's prerogative.  The House Managers apparently want to excuse the weaknesses in their case by blaming the Senate for not calling the President to the stand or the President for not volunteering to run the gauntlet of House Managers. Having had the House reject their proposed article of impeachment based on the President's deposition in the Jones case, the House Managers are left to pursue their shifting allegations of perjury  before the grand jury. Their allegations of perjury have devolved to semantical differences and the choice of such words as ``occasional'' and ``on certain occasions.'' Their view of perjury allows them to take a part of a statement out of context and say that it is actionable for not explicating all relevant facts and circumstances. They view perjury by a standard that would condemn most presentations, even some of their own presentations before the Senate.  In addition to their request that the President be deposed, the House Republican Managers also propose to include in this record affidavits and other materials apparently not part of the record provided by Mr. Starr or considered by the House. Ironically, in so doing, they have chosen to proceed by affidavit. They must know that by proffering the declaration of an attorney for Paula Jones about that case and the link between that now settled matter and the Starr investigation, they are necessarily opening this area to possible extensive discovery that could result in the depositions of additional witnesses, as well.  Does anyone think that the Senate record can fairly be limited to the proffered declaration of Mr. Holmes without giving the President an opportunity to depose him and other relevant witnesses after fair discovery? The links between the Jones case and the Starr investigation will be fair game for examination in the fullness of time if the Holmes declaration proffered by the House Managers is accepted.  The Holmes declaration is at variance with the House Managers' proffer. The declaration suggests that the Jones lawyers made a collective decision, whereas the House Managers suggest that the decision to subpoena Ms. Currie was Mr. Holmes' decision. Mr. Holmes declares that no Washington Post article played any part in his decisionmaking to subpoena Ms. Currie and that the ``does not recall'' any attorney in his firm saying anything about such an article ``in the discussions in which we decided to subpoena Ms. Currie.'' This could lead to discovery from a number of Jones lawyers.  The Holmes declaration says that the Jones lawyers ``had received what [they] considered to be reliable information that Ms. Currie was instrumental in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with Mr. Clinton and that Ms. Currie was central to the `cover story' Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had developed to use in the event their affair was discovered.'' That assertion was strongly omitted from the House Republican Managers' proffer. That assertion raises questions abut what the Jones lawyers knew, when they knew it and whether there was any link to the Starr investigation. If the purpose of the declaration is to rebut the notion that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because the Jones lawyers were following the activities of the Starr investigation, this declaration falls far short of the mark. It raises more questions that it resolves.  I am surprised to see a judicial clerk submit an affidavit in this case. The one thing that is clear from Mr. Ward's affidavit is that it does not support the conclusions drawn in the House Managers' proffer. Mr. Ward says only that President Clinton was looking directly at Mr. Bennett at one moment during the argument by the lawyers during the deposition. He does not aver, as the House Managers suggest he would competently testify, that ``he saw President Clinton listening attentively to Mr. Bennett's remarks.''  While the affidavit of Barry Ward cannot convert the President's silence into statements, it does provide one perspective on the President's deposition in the Jones case. Accepting that proffered evidence may, however, prompt the President's lawyers to want to examine other perspectives to give the Senate a more complete picture and a fairer opportunity to consider what was happening during the discussions among Judge Wright and the lawyers. For that purpose, is the Senate next going to authorize the deposition of Judge Wright and the other lawyers who attended the deposition? The circumstances under which Mr. Ward came to take such an affidavit and what he knows about the variety of issues mentioned in the House Managers' proffer on this item will undoubtedly be fair subjects of discovery by the President's lawyers if this is admitted.  The House Managers characterized documents as certain telephone records and the participants in various telephone calls whose identifies are not revealed by the records. Indeed, those proffered documents are without authentification. The House Republican Managers' brief goes even farther, suggesting that the telephone records will prove what happened at the White House gate on December 6, and asserting the identity of those who participated in telephone calls and the content of those telephone calls and concluding that they prove meetings and conversations that were not even by telephone. The documents appear to be a series of numbers. Giving them content and context will require more than mere authentification and any such testimonial explanation can be expected to engender further discovery, as well.  Now let me turn to the witnesses that the House Managers have identified by name and for which they are expressly seeking subpoenas at the outset of this discovery period. I understand that under Senate Resolution 16 Senator must vote for or against the entire package of witnesses and discovery requested by the House.  The House Republican Managers have already interviewed Monica Lewinsky after Mr. Starr arranged for that interview and had her ordered to comply. In light of the circumstances under which she has already been forced to cooperate with the House Republican Managers, any doubt as to the coercion being exercised through her immunity agreement could not be more starkly seen. I seriously question Ms. Lewinsky's freedom to express herself in the present circumstances and suggest that her immunity situation will inevitably affect the credibility of anything that she might ``add'' to the House's case. Mr. Starr has the equivalent of a loaded gun to her head, along with her mother's and her father's.  Consider also the report in The Washington Post on Tuesday that Mr. Starrtore up her immunity agreement once before when she tried to clarify her February 1998 proffer to note that she and the President had talked about using a ``cover story'' before she was ever subpoenaed as a witness in the Jones case, not after. That is now a key point of the House Managers' proffer but it points now in the other direction by suggesting that she is now willing to testify that the President ``instructed'' her to invoke cover stories if questioned in connection with the Jones case. Would not such a shift in testimony necessarily lead to discovery into the impact of the immunity agreement on her testimony and the many twists and turns in the 7-month negotiation between Mr. Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's attorneys and the pressures exerted upon her over the last six months?  Moreover, press accounts of the celebrated interview of Ms. Lewinsky by the House Managers last weekend suggest that she may also have said things during that interview that were favorable to the President. The President's counsel are now in the untenable position of having to oppose the House Managers' motion without specific knowledge of any exculpatory information that Ms. Lewinsky may have provided that would weigh against the need to call her as a witness. That is unfair and contrary to basic precepts of our law. The House Managers created this circumstance and should not benefit from it.  The House Managers also insist that they must open discovery to take the deposition of Vernon Jordan. Mr. Jordan has been interviewed or testified under oath before Starr's grand jury at least five times already. The House Managers' proffer is merely that they expect that his live testimony will lead to reasonable and logical inferences that might help their case and somehow link the job search to discouraging her testimony in the Jones case. That is not a proffer of anything new but an attempt to take another shot at eliciting testimony that Mr. Starr could not.  The House Managers also insist that the Senate must depose Sidney Blumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal also testified before the Starr grand jury. The House Managers' proffer notes nothing new that he would be expected to provide.  If the President has been willing to forego the opportunity to cross examine the witnesses whose grand jury testimony has been relied upon by the House Managers, that removes the most pressing need for further discovery in this matter. After all, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan, and to a lesser extent, Mr. Blumenthal, were interviewed for days and weeks by the FBI, trained investigators, Mr. Starr's lawyers and then testified, some repeatedly, before the Starr grand jury. That is about as one-sided as discovery gets--no cross examination, no opportunity to compare early statements with the way things are reconfigured and re-expressed after numerous preparation sessions with Mr. Starr's office.  These witnesses testified under threat of prosecution by Mr. Starr. Ms. Lewinsky remains under a very clear threat of prosecution, even though she has a limited grant of immunity from Starr. This special prosecutor has shown every willingness to threaten and prosecute.  If the President has not initiated efforts to obtain more discovery and witnesses and is willing to have the matter decided on the voluminous record submitted to the House, the House Managers carry a heavy burden to justify extending these proceedings further and requiring the reexamination of people who have already testified.  I heard over and over from the House Managers that there is no doubt, that the record established before the House and introduced into this Senate proceeding convinced the House to vote for articles of impeachment to require the removal of the President from office last month. The House Managers have told us that they have done a magnificent job and established their case.  Based on the House Managers' Motion and their proffer in justification, I do not believe that they have justified extending these proceedings into the future through additional depositions and additional evidence. Can anyone confidently predict how many witnesses will be needed to sort through the evidentiary supplement that the House proffers and the issues that it raises? Can anyone confidently predict how long that discovery will take and how long this trial will be extended? And for what? What is the significant and ultimate materiality to the fundamental issues being contested at this trial of the materials the House is moving now to include in the record? Although the House Managers can say that they only sought to depose three witnesses, does anyone think that in fairness the President's lawyers and the House Managers together will not end up deposing at least 10 people if the Senate were to grant the House motion?  The Senate should not extend these proceedings by a single day. The Senate runs a grave risk of being drawn down into the mire that stained the House impeachment proceedings. Republicans and Democrats have all told me that they do not believe that there is any possibility that this trial will end in the conviction of the President and his removal. In that light, the Senate should have proceeded to conclude this matter rather than extend it.                          ____________________
