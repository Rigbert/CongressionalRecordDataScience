 President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer a perfecting amendment to Senator DeWine's amendment No. 383. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Dodd. It amends the pending amendment to add two additional categories of individuals who may be excluded under this amendment: First, members of the Haitian high command; and, second, members of the paramilitary organization known as FRAPH.  Both of these organizations were responsible for serious human rights abuses during the coup regime from 1991 to 1994.  I ask unanimous consent that the DeWine amendment be so modified to include the amendment which I send to the desk from Senator Dodd.
