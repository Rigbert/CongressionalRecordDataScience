President, I rise today to commend the fine members of the Union League Club of Chicago on the 125th anniversary of the organization's founding in 1879.  On behalf of the people of Illinois, I thank all of the members of the Union League Club of Chicago, both past and present, for their shining example of civic leadership. The Union League Club of Chicago has a proud history of patriotism and service to the Chicago community, the State of Illinois, and the Nation. Since its founding to rally citizens in defense of the Union during the Civil War, this organization has forged partnerships with other prominent civic organizations to support a broad range of social, military, and nonpartisan political activities.  The same organization that was instrumental in bringing the World Columbian Exposition to Chicago in 1893 today supports Chicago youth with four Boys and Girls Clubs, sustains the arts through grants from the Union League Civic and Arts Foundation, and supports our Armed Forces through the Armed Forces Council of Chicago, an American Legion Post and several support groups.  I know that my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating members of the Union League Club of Chicago on their accomplishments and commitment to their community. I am confident that this proud history and tradition will continue with future generations of like-minded members for another 125 years.                          ____________________[Page S733]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      UNION LEAGUE CLUB OF CHICAGO
