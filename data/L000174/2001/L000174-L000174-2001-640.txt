 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print additional editorials and material regarding the nomination in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [From Newsday]               Ashcroft's Rights Do Not Include Being AG                           (By Clarence Page)       Now that George W. Bush has nominated Sen. John Ashcroft      (R-Mo.) to be attorney general, it would not be inappropriate      for Ashcroft's fellow senators to treat him as fairly as he      treated Judge Ronnie White.       In other words, will they tar him as an extremist? Will      they roast him, not for his personal qualifications, which is      what confirmation hearings are supposed to be about, but for      his personal beliefs? Will they paint him as an extremist and      distort his record without giving him an opportunity to      respond? That was how Ashcroft handled President Bill      Clinton's nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the federal      bench in 1999. Civil rights groups are particularly angry      that Ashcroft led the successful party-line fight to defeat      White.       Ashcroft painted White's opinions as ``the most anti-death-     penalty judge on the Missouri Supreme Court'' and said that      his record was ``outside the court's mainstream.'' Actually,      whether you agree with him or not, White can hardly be called      ``pro-criminal'' or ``outside the mainstream.'' Court records      show that White voted to uphold death sentences in 41 out of      59 capital cases that came before him on the state supreme      court. In most of the other cases, he voted with the majority      of his fellow justices, including those appointed by Ashcroft      when he was Missouri governor.       In fact, three Ashcroft appointees voted to reverse the      death penalty a greater number of times than White did.       On the Senate floor, Ashcroft singled out two of the only      three death-penalty cases in which White was the sole      dissenter. In one of them, White questioned whether the      defendant's right to effective counsel had been violated.      Whether you agree or not, you don't have to be ``pro-     criminal'' to value the rights of the accused, especially in      a death-penalty case. In the other, White questioned whether      the lower court judge, Earl L. Blackwell of Jefferson County      was biased and should have recused himself in a trial that      began the morning after Blackwell issued a controversial      campaign statement.       Blackwell, explaining in a press release why he had      switched to the Republican Party, said, ``The truth is that I      switched to the Republican Party, said, ``The truth is that I      have noticed in recent years that the Democrat Party places      far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as      homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a      skin that's any color but white.'' Again, the judge has the      right to express his views, but you don't have to be an      extremist to understand why White, the first African American      to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court, might question that      judge's even-handedness.       When Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) asked White if he opposed      the death penalty, White said, ``Absolutely not.'' But White      did not get a chance to rebut Ashcroft's charges because      Ashcroft did not raise them until     months after White's confirmation hearings. This tactic was      characterized as ``delay and ambush'' by Elliot Mincberg,      vice president and legal director of People for the American      Way, one of several liberal groups that oppose Ashcroft's      confirmation.       To charge that Ashcroft is a bigot, as some have done,      misses the point. He has a right to express strong views      without being called names. He has a right to oppose      affirmative action and gay rights, as he has done in the past      with other nominations. He has a right to favor a ``right to      life'' until someone has been sentenced to death.       But he does not have a right to be attorney general.      Therefore, it is not surprising that the four pillars of the      liberal establishment--civil rights, abortion rights,      organized labor and environmental protection--have begun to      rally their opposition to his confirmation.       Why, they ask, should this country have an attorney general      who opposes sensitive laws that he is supposed to enforce?      Ashcroft will have a chance to answer that question in his      confirmation hearings. The Senate will let him offer his side      of the story. That's more than Ashcroft gave Ronnie White.                                  ____              [From the DesMoines Register, Jan. 5, 2001]                          Uneasy With Ashcroft     Will he enforce the laws even-handedly--even those he          disagrees with?       The record of Senator John Ashcroft inspires no confidence      that he'll enforce the laws of the land impartially as      attorney general of the United States.       The Missourian, who lost his re-election bid to the Senate      this fall, vigorously opposes abortion rights under virtually      all circumstances. So would he fully enforce federal laws      safeguarding abortion clinics from violence and harassment?      Will he actively protect the legal right of women to choose      even though he personally thinks women should not have that      right?       Ashcroft is President-elect George W. Bush's nominee to be      the next attorney general. As head of the Justice Department,      he would be in charge of overseeing the FBI, enforcing      antitrust laws, litigating on the government's behalf and      enforcing the civil rights of citizens, among other things.       How interested in assuring civil rights is Ashcroft? He's      been criticized for his opposition to the elevation of      Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White, an African-     American, to the federal bench. Ashcroft called White ``pro-     criminal,'' even though White had voted to uphold the death      penalty in 41 of 59 cases--said to be about the same share as      that of the judges whom Ashcroft appointed when he was      governor. Consider that along with Ashcroft's failed fight to      keep David Satcher, a respected black physician, from      becoming surgeon general because Satcher is against a ban on      late-term abortions. And in 1999, Ashcroft accepted an      honorary degree from Bob Jones University in South Carolina,      which at that time prohibited interracial dating.       Bush Cabinet selections such as moderate African-American      Colin Powell for secretary of state don't soften the hard-     line insensitivity Ashcroft presents. He is not a leader who      brings people together.       Those who share Ashcroft's religious conservatism are no      doubt heartened by the expectation that their points of view      will be well represented. But all Americans should at least      be comfortable that the next attorney general will be fair-     minded and even-handed as the nation's chief law-enforcement      officer.       Before confirming him, the Senate should expect a pledge      from Ashcroft that he will enforce the laws of the land as      they exist, not as he would like them to be.       The Missourian vigorously opposes abortion rights under      virtually all circumstances. So would he fully enforce laws      safeguarding clinics?                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 2001]                           Fairness for Whom?                            (By Bob Herbert)       We keep hearing that George W. Bush's choice for attorney      general, John Ashcroft, is a man of honor, a stalwart when it      comes to matters of principle and integrity. Former Senate      colleagues are frequently quoted as saying that while they      disagree with his ultra-conservative political views, they      consider him to be a trustworthy, fair-minded individual.       Spare me. The allegedly upright Mr. Ashcroft revealed      himself as a shameless and deliberately destructive liar in      1999 when, as the junior senator from Missouri, he launched a      malacious attack against a genuinely honorable man, Ronnie      White, who had been nominated by the president to a federal      district court seat.       Justice White was a distinguished jurist and the first      black member of the Missouri Supreme Court. Mr. Ashcroft, a      right-wing zealot with a fondness for the old Confederacy,      could not abide his elevation to the federal bench. But there      were no legitimate reasons to oppose Justice White's      confirmation by the Senate. So Mr. Ashcroft reached into the      gutter and scooped up a few handfuls of calumny to throw at      the nominee.       He declared that Justice White was soft on crime. Worse, he      was ``pro-criminal.'' The judge's record, according to Mr.      Ashcroft, showed ``a tremendous bent toward criminal      activity.'' As for the death penalty, that all-important      criminal justice barometer--well, in Mr. Ashcroft's view, the      nominee was beyond the pale. He said that Ronnie White was      the most anti-death-penalty judge on the State Supreme Court.       Listen closely: None of this was true. But by the time Mr.      Ashcroft finished painting his false portrait of Justice      White, his republican colleagues had fallen into line and      were distributing a memo that described the nominee as      ``notorious among law enforcement officers in his home state      of Missouri for his decisions favoring murderers, rapists,      drug dealers and other heinous criminals.''       This was a sick episode. Justice White was no friend of      criminals. And a look at the record would have shown that      even when it came to the death penalty he voted to uphold      capital sentences in 70 percent of the cases that came before      him. There were times when he voted (mostly with the      majority) to reverse capital sentences because of procedural      errors. But as my colleague Anthony Lewis pointed out last      week, judges appointed by Mr. Ashcroft when he was governor      of Missouri voted as often as Justice White--in some cases,      more often--to reverse capital sentences.       But the damage was done. Mr. Ashcroft's unscrupulous, mean-     spirited attack succeeded in derailing the nomination of a      fine judge. The confirmation of Justice White was defeated by      Republicans in a party-line vote. The Alliance for Justice,      which monitors judicial selections, noted that it was the      first time in almost half a century that the full Senate had      voted down a district court nominee.       The Times, in an editorial, said the Republicans had      reached ``a new low'' in the judicial confirmation process.      The headline on the editorial was ``A Sad Judicial Mugging.''       So much for the fair-minded Mr. Ashcroft.       A Republican senator, who asked not to be identified, told      me this week that he could not justify Mr. Ashcroft's      treatment of Ronnie White, but that it would be wrong to      suggest that the attack on his nomination was racially      motivated.       That may or may not be so. It would be easier to believe if      Mr. Ashcroft did not have such a dismal record on matters      related to race. As Missouri's attorney general he was      opposed to even a voluntary plan to desegregate schools in      metropolitan St. Louis. Just last year he accepted an      honorary degree from Bob Jones University, school that is      notorious for its racial and religious intolerance. And a      couple of years ago, Mr. Ashcroft gave a friendly interview      to Southern Partisan magazine, praising it for helping to      ``set the record straight'' about issues related to the Civil      War.       Southern Partisan just happens to be a rabid neo-     Confederate publication that ritually denounces Abraham      Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. and other champions of      freedom and tolerance in America.       This is the man George W. Bush has carefully chosen to be      the highest law enforcement officer in the nation. That      silence that you hear is the sound of black Americans not      celebrating.                                  ____                   [From Time Magazine, Jan. 2, 2001]                      The Wrong Choice for Justice                           (By Jack E. White)       What was president-elect George W. Bush thinking when he      selected John Ashcroft as his nominee for Attorney General?      That since he was designating three superbly qualified      African Americans for high-level positions--Secretary of      State Colin Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza      Rice and Secretary of Education Rod Paige--blacks would      somehow overlook Ashcroft's horrendous record on race? Or      that it was compassionately conservative for Bush to hire a      man who had just lost re-election as Missouri's junior U.S.      Senator to a dead man? (Governor Mel Carnahan, who died in a      plane crash during the campaign, won the seat, and his widow      is serving in his place.) It certainly couldn't have been      that appointing Ashcroft would enhance Bush's image as a      uniter, not a divider. Ashcroft's positions on civil rights      issues are about as sensitive as a hammer blow to the head.       It's puzzling, because the nomination of an extremist like      Ashcroft is so needlessly out of synch with the rest of      Bush's utterly respectable Cabinet choices. He could have      satisfied the right by selecting Oklahoma Governor Frank      Keating, who is as tough on crime as Ashcroft, yet far less      controversial. But as we are about to find out, Ashcroft      won't be confirmed without a fight. The angriest coalition of      liberal, civil rights and feminist organizations Washington      has seen since the 1987 battle over Supreme Court nominee      Robert Bork is lining up to oppose him. The opposition's      leaders concede that as a former member of the club, Ashcroft      would normally sail through the Senate. But since Ashcroft      has been on the wrong side of every social issue from      affirmative action to hate-crimes legislation and women's      rights, there may be a chance to peel off enough moderate      Republicans to make him the first Cabinet appointee to be      bounced since 1989, when John Tower lost his chance to be      Secretary of Defense for President Bush the Elder.       Pushing Ashcroft through will cost the younger Bush      considerable political capital, and might be only the start      of his headaches. As a leading G.O.P. strategist puts it,      ``The risk will be that about every six months, [Ashcroft]      will do something that he thinks is clever or politically      interesting, and they will open their papers at the White      House and say, ``What the hell is he doing?'' Certainly there      is plenty in Ashcroft's record to unsettle fair-minded      conservatives--and to     raise questions about the sincerity of Bush's attempts to      reach out to blacks. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted in      an editorial in December, Ashcroft ``has built a career out      of opposing school desegregation in St. Louis and opposing      African Americans for public office.''       When he served as Missouri's attorney general in the 1980s,      Ashcroft persuaded the Reagan Administration to oppose      school-desegregation plans in St. Louis, then used the issue      to win the governorship in 1984. Since his election to the      Senate in 1994. Ashcroft has consistently appealed to the      right wing of his party, even when his approach risked      appearing racist. He fought unsuccessfully against the      confirmation of David Satcher, a distinguished black      physician, as surgeon general, because Satcher proposes a ban      on late-term abortions. In 1998 Ashcroft told the neo-     segregationist magazine Southern Partisan that Confederate      war heroes were ``patriots.'' In 1999 he accepted an honorary      degree from South Carolina's Bob Jones University, which      hadn't yet dropped its ridiculous ban on interracial dating.       Most disturbing of all, as Ashcroft was gearing up a short-     lived campaign for the White House last year, he verbally      attacked Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White, an      African American whom Bill Clinton has appointed to the      federal bench, for supposedly being ``pro-criminal'' and soft      on capital punishment. The charge was outright slander. White      had voted to uphold the death sentence in 41 of the 59 cases      that came before him, roughly the same proportion as      Ashcroft's court appointees when he was Governor. No wonder      Gordon Baum, leader of white supremacist Council of      Conservative Citizens, in 1999 included Ashcroft along with      Pat Buchanan in the circle of politicians he'd like to see in      the White House.       Does Baum know something Bush doesn't? Can Ashcroft be      trusted to oversee the investigation of alleged voting-rights      abuses in Florida, which many blacks believe disenfranchised      them and delivered the presidency unfairly to Bush? This is      one nomination that, pardon the pun, should be consigned to      the Ashcroft of history.
