 President, I rise to discuss the tax relief that was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2001 and 2003, and to bring some reality to an upcoming debate this month that involves the budget resolution. Since that tax relief was enacted in 2001 and 2003, and especially since last November, we have heard from the liberal establishment in Washington and elsewhere that this bipartisan tax relief must be ended and that taxes should be increased on millions of Americans of all income levels.  Today, I am going to look at what is driving the tax increase crowd and talk about why they are wrong and why increasing taxes is a bad idea. The liberal establishment uses deficit reduction as a primary excuse for their craving to raise taxes, but before we applaud their efforts to balance the budget, let's think about their solution. When anyone says we need to increase taxes to balance the budget, what they are saying is they are unwilling to cut Government spending. In actuality, the tax increase crowd wants to increase Government spending.  Yesterday, I focused on what extending the bipartisan tax relief package means to nearly every American who pays income tax. So today, as I promised yesterday, I want to examine the tax relief and to look at the impact it has on our economy.  Regardless of whether you look at Federal revenues, employment, household wealth, or market indexes, the impact of tax relief has been overwhelmingly positive. I am going to put a chart up that gives the figures I want you to consider as I go through the points I am making.  The first chart illustrates the growth of revenue with the red line and the growth in GDP with the green line. As we can see, revenues are currently increasing, and are projected to increase in the near future, even before tax relief is scheduled to sunset under current law in the year 2010. Clearly, tax relief has not destroyed the Government's revenue base. I want to point out that this chart shows percentage changes in revenue and percentage changes in GDP. So if the lines are flat in places, it means revenues and GDP are increasing at a constant rate.  The next chart graphs the Standard & Poor's 500 equity price index over a period of several years. So, here again, the lowest point of both the red line, representing the weekly S, and the green line, representing an average, seems to correspond closely with May of 2003, which, not coincidentally, is when dividend and capital gains tax cuts were signed into law. Aside from benefiting Americans directly invested in the stock market, this is good news for anyone with a pension who invests in the stock market as well. Of course, that happens to be well over half the people. I think somewhere between 56 and 60 percent of the people, either through pensions or directly investing in the stock market, have money reserves in the stock market. So this is not something that affects 10 or 15 percent of maybe the wealthiest people in the country, as it did 20, 25 years ago; more people are vested in the stock market, mostly through pensions.  According to the Federal Reserve--I have another chart--net wealth of households and nonprofit organizations has increased from a low of around $39 trillion in 2002 to more than $54 trillion in the third quarter of 2006. Since tax relief went into effect, our Nation's households and nonprofit organizations have benefited from more than $15 trillion of new wealth.  This trend is also apparent when we are looking at employment. I show you yet another chart. Total nonfarm employment was calculated to consist ofaround 130 million jobs in the summer of 2003 but is projected to be 137 million jobs in January of this year. This shows a 7 million increase in nonfarm employment since the 2003 tax relief bill was signed into law.  I have just described to you four indicators of prosperity. All four of them have increased since bipartisan tax relief was passed by Congress and signed into law. I wish to emphasize that word ``bipartisan'' tax relief legislation of 2001 and 2003. Federal revenues are growing steadily at a rate, then, greater than the gross domestic product. The S 500 ended a downward slide and began moving upward around the time of the 2003 tax bill. Also, since the 2003 tax bill became law, household and nonprofit wealth has steadily increased, and literally millions of new jobs have been created. I think it is more than a coincidence that all of these positive economic indicators are correlated with tax relief. I do not think anything short of willful ignorance could lead anyone to say tax relief has been bad for this country.  Now, going back to what I was saying before, the liberal establishment wants to reverse the tax relief that has done all the good things I was just talking about and that we demonstrated by chart, and all in the name of deficit reduction. However, this same crowd has not expressed any interest in reducing the deficit through reduced spending. I believe the reason for this is that this crowd, comprised of lobbyists, the big-city press, and the entrenched Federal bureaucracy, wants to raise taxes--your taxes--to spend your money on growing Government rather than working to trim spending. In fact, the more Government spends, the more power these interests are able to accumulate. The Federal bureaucracy gets to control more money, which will lead to more people hiring high-paid lobbyists to apply pressure to take a bigger piece of the pie the taxpayers are paying for. While these interests have no trouble thinking of themselves, they are not thinking of America's families, America's senior citizens, America's small business owners, and hard-working workers across America. These people may not be able to hire lobbyists or write syndicated columns, but their welfare should be our top priority.  I am going to talk in greater detail about America's families, seniors, small business owners, and workers, but for now, I just want to mention some more about our economy as a whole and how rolling back the 2001 and 2003 tax relief would have dire consequences for our whole economy.  There is an old saying that goes something like this: Figures don't lie, but liars can figure. This saying is especially true in Washington, DC. Any given issue has champions on both sides of the aisle able to generate studies and research that just happens to support their position. I say this because the source for the information I am going to present now is not one of those groups but, rather, the Goldman Sachs Group.  Goldman Sachs is an enormously successful and well-respected financial services firm. I do not think it is possible for any Democratic politician, liberal think-tanker, or liberal journalist to accuse Goldman Sachs of being a tool of my party, the Republican Party. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin served as cosenior partner and cochairman, and current New Jersey Governor and former Senator Jon Corzine served as chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. Our current Treasury Secretary also enjoyed a prominent career at that firm. So I would recommend that Republicans, but especially Democrats, pay attention when a Goldman economist sends up a red flag.  In a report that is titled ``Fiscal Policy: Marking Time until the Tax Cut Sunsets,'' the U.S. Economic Research Group at Goldman Sachs, in this report, projects a recession--projects a recession--if the 2001 and 2003 tax relief is allowed to sunset. Now, this study actually came out in November of 2006, so I am a little surprised we have not heard more about it.  For this report, Goldman Sachs economists used the Washington University macro model. To give a little background on the Washington model, it is a quarterly econometric system of 611 variables, 442 equations, and 169 exogenous variables. The Washington model was developed and is maintained by Macroeconomic Advisers, Limited Liability Corporation, out of St. Louis, MO. Macroeconomic Advisers is where former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin serves as a senior adviser. Plus, the firm won the prestigious 2005-2006 National Association for Business Economics Outlook Forecast Award for their accurate GDP and Treasury bill rate forecasts. That ought to give them a great deal of credibility. Now, of course, Macroeconomic Advisers and their Washington model must be accurate enough for people to pay to use it, which is not true for every organization that has been modeling the effects on the economy of letting tax relief expire.  Getting back to the Goldman Sachs study, the authors assumed that Congress would let the 2001 and 2003 tax relief expire, so they reset taxes to their year 2000 levels, grossed them up slightly to match the Congressional Budget Office estimate of the revenue impact of letting the tax cuts expire, and allowed for an appropriate monetary response. For monetary policy, the study's authors assumed that the Federal Reserve would call for interest rate cuts when output falls below its trend and for interest rate increases when inflation rises above its comfort zone.  The study states that:       In the first quarter of 2011, real GDP growth drops more      than 3 percentage points below what it would otherwise be.      Absent a strong tailwind to growth from some other source,      this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession.  If tax relief is allowed to expire, this study shows that a recession is likely to result. By not extending or making tax relief permanent, Congress will be deliberately inflicting a recession on the American people. Is a lot of hollow, high-sounding rhetoric about balanced budgets worth the job losses or business closures that would result in such a recession?  The study eventually predicts higher output but notes that consumption would be lower.  So that everyone has the opportunity to review this study, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that it be printed in the Record, along with one of the very few news stories to note its findings.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the U.S. Economic Analyst, Nov. 10, 2006]         Fiscal Policy: Marking Time Until the Tax Cut Sunsets       Near-term changes in US fiscal policy are unlikely despite      the shift in control of the Congress. Key decisions on      extending tax cuts are not forced until 2010, after the next      election, while efforts to roll back these cuts before then      would surely trigger a veto.       As the tax cut ``sunsets'' approach, the Congress regains      power, as legislation will then be needed to extend the cuts.      The choice will not be easy given the magnitude of the tax      increase--about 1\1/2\% of GDP--that would occur if the tax      cuts all expired and its likely impact on near-term growth.       In a simulation exercise, we confirm that this ``do nothing      Congress'' scenario would quickly balance the budget but at      the cost of a sharp hit to growth in the short term. Farther      out, the benefits are higher output and lower inflation and      interest rates, at the expense of less consumption--an      inevitable price for this decade's tax cuts.       The Democratic Party has regained control of both houses of      Congress with a surprisingly strong showing in the mid-term      election. Although the new leadership will clash with      President Bush on many issues, several areas appear ripe for      compromise, including immigration policy, a minimum wage      hike, and Iraq policy. Each could have significant impact on      the economy.       Third-quarter real GDP growth could be revised up to about      2% (annualized), but the fourth-quarter prognosis remains      murky. Early reads on retail sales suggesting that October      spending was weak, and the factory sector must begin to work      off an inventory overhang. The labor market continues to      impress, though we expect the jobless rate to begin trending      higher soon as the housing correction triggers more job      losses.                    I. Return to Divided Government       The Democratic Party has regained control of both houses of      Congress with a surprisingly strong showing in the mid-term      election. Although the new leadership will clash with      President Bush on many issues, several areas appear ripe for      compromise, including immigration policy, a minimum wage      hike, and Iraq policy. Each could have significant impact on      the economy.       Third-quarter real GDP growth may have been a bit stronger      than first reported, with data in hand suggesting an upward      revision to about 2% (annualized). However, the fourth-     quarter prognosis is murky, with     early reads on retail sales suggesting that spending was weak      in October, and a substantial inventory overhang in the      manufacturing sector. The labor market continues to impress,      though we expect the unemployment rate to begin trending      higher soon as the housing correction triggers more job      losses.     Democrats Retake Congress       With surprisingly strong mid-term election gains, the      Democratic Party has retaken a majority not only in the House      of Representatives, but also in the Senate with a much      thinner 51-49 edge (counting two independents who will caucus      with the Democrats). This marks the first time that Democrats      have controlled both houses of Congress since 1994; the size      of the net changes (6 in the Senate, about 30 in the House)      approaches those of previous ``landslide'' mid-term      elections, especially given the relatively small number of      competitive races.       With Democrats setting the agenda, the initial focus of      Congress next year is likely to be on the six issues      highlighted in the campaign: (1) reinstatement of PAYGO      budget rules; (2) repeal of tax preferences for integrated      oil companies; (3) reductions in student loan rates; (4)      direct negotiation of Medicare prescription drug prices; (5)      an increase in the minimum wage, and (6) implementation of      the September 11th Commission recommendations.       Although President Bush and the Democratic Congress are      likely to clash on many fronts, several major issues with      ramification, for the economy appear ripe for compromise:       1. Immigration. Continued large inflows of undocumented      immigrants and bipartisan acknowledgement that current      policies are insufficient to address the situation have      created fertile ground for legislative progress. A potential      compromise on immigration policy would likely involve a      combination of increased quotas for legal immigration,      tougher enforcement of those quotas, and some sort of      procedure through which illegal immigrants could eventually      apply for US citizenship.       2. Minimum wage. As noted above, Democrats have targeted a      significant increase in the national minimum wage, to $7.25      from $5.15 per hour, as part of their initial agenda. A      majority in both houses of the current Congress had already      supported an increase even before the election, but the deal      was never consummated. More than half (26) of the states      already have higher minimums, covering a significant portion      of the US labor force.       3. Iraq. Iraq policy could see a fundamental shift, with      Donald Rumsfeld's departure as Secretary of Defense an      indicator of possible changes ahead. The upcoming report by a      special commission chaired by former Secretary of State James      Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton (who also co-     chaired the September 11 Commission) could offer both parties      political cover for a change of course. This might ultimately      reduce the drain on the federal budget from Iraq-related      expenditures.       However, compromise is less likely on many other issues.      The White House appeared to be considering making entitlement      reform its top priority in Bush's last two years in office,      but this now seems unlikely given the huge political      obstacles and the likelihood that lawmakers' focus will soon      turn to the 2008 presidential election. Federal spending is      unlikely to be dramatically different, though divided      government historically has meant more controlled spending      about in line with GDP growth (-0.02 points per year) versus      slightly faster (+0.23 points) when government was under      control of a single party.       Tax policy seems unlikely to change either. Most important      tax cuts don't expire until 2010, and there is little      Democrats in Congress can do to alter tax policy, given the      likelihood of a Bush veto. In addition, Democrats appear far      from unified on repealing many of these tax cuts, and the      resulting fiscal tightening would pose temporary downside      risks to the economic outlook. There is a small risk that      tighter budget rules could force the cost of extending these      cuts to be offset by tax increases elsewhere. Most likely,      these would come from the closing of corporate ``loopholes''      or other business-related revenue raisers. Relief from the      Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will be extended, but plans to      require the cost of any tax cuts to be offset could put two      of the Democrats' priorities in conflict (see this week's      center section for a fuller discussion of the fiscal      outlook).     More Growth Then, Less Now?       Economic news this week implied that third-quarter growth      might turn out to be a bit stronger than initially estimated.      In particular, better export performance and lower oil      imports resulted in a substantially narrower trade deficit      for September--$64.3 billion versus August's downward-revised      $69.0 billion shortfall. This, combined with more inventory      building than Commerce officials assumed, puts our best guess      for third-quarter real GDP growth slightly above 2%      (annualized). Upcoming reports on retail sales and      inventories could still swing this figure.       However, the market's focus is on the outlook, and here we      remain cautious. In theory, the sharp drop in energy prices      over the past three months should boost consumer spending in      the fourth quarter, but this acceleration has yet to      materialize. Early reads on retail sales activity--the      official government data are due out Tuesday--suggest that      October spending was weak. In fact, we have trimmed 0.2      points from our retail sales estimates, to -0.4% overall and      -0.3% excluding autos. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector      will have to begin working off a significant inventory      overhang.       The labor market continues to impress. For example, initial      jobless claims moved back down near the 300,000 level,      implying that last week's rise was a head fake and      reinforcing the generally strong tone of the October      employment report. Although the labor market is clearly tight      at present, we expect job losses--particularly from the      housing sector--to begin pushing up the unemployment rate      within the next few months.       II. Fiscal Policy: Marking Time Until the Tax Cut Sunsets       Near-term changes in U.S. fiscal policy are unlikely      despite the shift in control of the Congress. Key decisions      on extending tax cuts are not forced until 2010, after the      next election, while any efforts to roll back these cuts      before then would surely trigger a presidential veto.       As the tax cut ``sunsets'' approach, the Congress regains      power, as legislation will then be needed if the tax cuts are      to be extended. The choice will not be easy given the      magnitude of the tax increase--about 1\1/2\ percent of GDP-     that would occur if the tax cuts all expired and its likely      impact on near-term growth.       In a simulation exercise, we confirm that this ``do nothing      Congress'' scenario would quickly balance the budget but at      the cost of a sharp hit to growth in the short term. Farther      out, the benefits are higher output and lower inflation and      interest rates, at the expense of less consumption--an      inevitable price for this decade's tax cuts.     Near-Term Fiscal Policy: No Major Shift       Talk of imminent change in fiscal policy, focused on tax      hikes, has surfaced as Democrats have regained control of the      Congress. They netted about 30 more seats in the House of      Representatives, giving them a comfortable margin. In the      Senate, the Democratic margin is much thinner--a 51-49 edge.       However, this shift in control of Congress does not      translate into an immediate shift in fiscal policy for four      reasons. First, the budget deficit has narrowed sharply over      the past two years, as shown in Exhibit 1. This may reduce      the sense of urgency in the minds of many lawmakers, and      therefore their willingness to strike deals even though the      longer-term imbalance remains serious and unresolved. Second,      the main components of President Bush's signature tax cuts--     enacted with ``sunsets'' to contain their budget impact--do      not expire until the end of 2010. Hence, the thorny issue of      extending these cuts need not be addressed until after the      next Congress (and president) is elected in 2008. Third, any      effort to roll back these cuts before their scheduled      expiration would almost surely trigger a presidential veto,      which the Congress could not override, and it would provide      the GOP with an election issue to boot. Therein lies the      fourth reason, that the impending 2008 presidential election      will limit the time and scope for meaningful progress.       Similar logic applies to the spending side of the ledger,      where any efforts to trim outlays for defense or homeland      security would be fraught with political risk. Our working      assumption is that total spending on national security will      not change much, although the composition might shift; for      other discretionary spending we expect gridlock between a      Democratic majority that would like to restore some programs      and a Republican president whose veto pen will suddenly be      full of ink. The same probably holds for Democrats' announced      intention to push for direct negotiation of Medicare      prescription drug prices.       One issue the new congressional leadership will face is how      to handle the various tax measures whose renewal has become      an annual ritual in recent years. By far the largest of these      is the temporary fix of the alternative minimum tax (AMT),      without which the number of taxpayers affected by this      obscure tax calculation would soar. Although renewing the AMT      would boost the deficit by an estimated $65 billion for      fiscal year (FY) 2008, it enjoys bipartisan support. This is      because many of its unsuspecting victims live in ``blue''      states. Hence, the new Congress will probably find some way      to make it happen and pass most of the other ones (another      $16 billion) as well. In doing so, the Democrats risk      compromising another objective they have championed in recent      years, namely to reinstate pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules for      federal budget legislation. Unlike the administration and the      current congressional leadership, who favor PAYGO only for      outlays, Democrats have pushed to have these rules apply to      taxes as well. Notably, the decision to resurrect PAYGO does      not require the president to sign off, as it can be      implemented simply as part of the budget resolution. Hence,      an early test of the Democrats' resolve to control the budget      deficit will be whether they restore PAYGO or something      similar and, more critically, whether they adhere to it.     2010: A Year of Wreckoning?       On balance, our expectations for significant change in      fiscal policy during the next two years are low. Thereafter,      the calculus changes radically as the 2010 sunsets approach.      Absent legislative action, the tax     code essentially reverts to its pre-2001 provisions on      January 1, 2011. Marginal tax rates on ordinary income rise      significantly, dividend income loses its special treatment,      the capital gains tax rate goes back to 20 percent, the      marriage penalty reappears, the child tax credit drops, and      the estate--oops, death--tax springs back to life.       One implication of this situation is that the initiative      reverts to Congress, specifically the one to be elected in      2008. It can opt for fiscal balance simply by doing nothing      and letting the tax cuts expire, or it can pass legislation      to extend any or all of the cuts. Although the president--     whoever that may be--obviously still has the right of veto,      he/she obviously cannot reject a bill that has not reached      his/her desk.       More importantly, the stakes are high, as the sunsets      potentially telescope into one year the reversal of tax cuts      implemented in various stages between mid-2001 and early      2004. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO)      estimates, tax revenue would rise by $236 billion between FY      2010 and FY 2012 if all of the tax cuts were to expire.      Scaled to the estimated size of the economy at that time,      this is a fiscal drag of about 1\1/2\ percent of GDP.       Even the most die-hard fiscal hawks are apt to think twice      about the implications of this for the near-term performance      of the economy. After all, a tax increase of this magnitude,      imposed all at once, would likely throw the economy into      recession. How bad would it be, and what would the benefit be      in terms of budget improvement and longer-term economic      performance?     Costs and Benefits of Letting Tax Cuts Expire       To provide some perspective on these questions, we      simulated the effects of allowing all the tax cuts to expire      as scheduled--or, to twist Harry Truman's famous phrase, a      ``do nothing Congress'' scenario. Specifically, using the      Washington University Macroeconomic Model (WUMM), we reset      taxes to their 2000 levels, grossed them up slightly to match      CBO's estimate of the revenue impact of letting the tax cuts      expire, and allowed for appropriate monetary policy response.      On the latter, we assume that the Fed follows a rule calling      for rate cuts when output falls below its trend and rate      hikes when inflation is above its ``comfort zone.''       Exhibit 2 illustrates the main results of this exercise,      showing how key variables would diverge from a status quo      forecast in which the tax cuts are extended. The results are      as follows:       Reversing the tax cuts quickly closes most, if not all, of      the fiscal deficit. The immediate effect is to cut the      deficit by about 1\1/2\ percent of GDP, as shown in the top      panel of Exhibit 2. This is about three-fifths of the      shortfall we currently project for FY 2011, based on      assumptions we consider realistic. Under the more restrictive      assumptions underlying the CBO's baseline projections, the      budget comes very close to balance, as indicated in that      agency's latest budget update as well as its estimates that      extending the tax cuts would boost the deficit by 1.6 percent      of GDP relative to its baseline.       More budget progress occurs in the out years. The budget      improvement persists and even increases over time without      further changes in tax law. This reflects the beneficial      effects of a sharp reduction in interest expense, which      results both from reduced borrowing and lower interest rates.      Five years out, the budget improvement swells to about 2\1/2\      percent of GDP, covering about three-quarters of our      projected deficit and putting the budget into modest surplus      under the CBO assumptions.       The economy suffers a lot of short-term pain. The jump in      taxes on January 1, 2011 squeezes disposable income and hence      consumption. This feeds through to the rest of the economy,      sharply curtailing growth and prompting an aggressive easing      in monetary policy. The lower two panels of Exhibit 2 lay out      the major elements of the macroeconomic story.       In the fIrst quarter of 2011, real GDP growth drops more      than 3 percentage points below what it would otherwise be.      Absent a strong tailwind to growth from some other source,      this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession. In an      effort to resuscitate demand, the Fed immediately cuts the      federal funds rate, bringing it 250 basis points (bp) below      the status quo level over the next year and one-half, as      shown in the bottom panel of Exhibit 2. Despite this, output      growth remains well below trend over that period, putting      downward pressure on inflation as slack in the economy      increases. Inflation drops by 150 bp during the sag in growth      before coming back up as the monetary stimulus pushes output      back toward, and eventually above, trend.       In the longer run, economic growth benefits from ``crowding      in.'' When the government runs a large deficit, ``crowding      out'' occurs in the capital markets: Its borrowing, backed by      the power to tax, takes priority over private borrowing and      therefore denies some companies the funds they need for      investment that is usually more productive than the      government's use of the funds. As a result, growth suffers      and real interest rates rise.       The opposite occurs in our simulation. Restoring better      balance to the government's books reduces the deficit and      hence the growth in its debt. This frees funds that now flow      to the private sector allowing the capital stock to grow more      rapidly and pushing down interest rates. As shown by the gap      between the lines in the bottom panel, real interest rates      end up substantially lower. This, eventually, raises output      by about 1 percent above the level that would have prevailed      without the tax increase.       At first glance, this seems like a straightforward case of      short term pain (recession) leading to longer term gain      (higher output). Unfortunately, this assessment is a bit too      optimistic. Although output is higher than it otherwise would      be, consumption is lower. Since the 2001 tax cuts helped      thrust the budget back into deficit, the federal government      has borrowed to fund its spending and, via the tax cuts, some      consumer spending as well. A reversion in 2011 to higher      taxes simply recognizes that fact and starts paying off the      debt. If instead Congress chooses to maintain the cuts, they      just push the due date for the 2000s spending bill even      further into the future. In that case, the ultimate payment--     the drop in consumption--would be even higher.                                  ____                     [From TCSDAILY, Feb. 6, 2007]                 Hillary Clinton and Recession of 2011                         (By James Pethokoukis)       How predictable. The fiscal 2008 budget that President Bush      put forward yesterday gets slammed for being unrealistic--if      not downright mendacious. If the $2.9 trillon proposal      actually got enacted as written--doubtful given that Bush is      dealing with a Democratic-controlled Congress--the plan would      theoretically balance the budget by 2012. As Team Bush      crunches the numbers, the U.S. government would run a $61      billion surplus in 2012 year after running tiny deficits in      2010 ($94.4 billion, or 0.6 percent of GDP) and 2011 ($53.8      billion, or 0.3 percent of GDP). All that while permanently      extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts due to expire in 2010.       Of course, journalists and think-tank analysts had barely      scanned the budget when critics started pointing out its      supposed flaws. Among them: the budget assumes more upbeat      economic conditions--and thus more tax revenue--than does the      forecast from the Congressional Budget Office. (In 2011 and      2012, the White House forecasts 3.0 percent and 2.9 percent      GDP growth vs. 2.7 percent for each of those years by the      CBO.) As the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities      puts it, ``The budget employs rosy revenue assumptions; it      assumes at least $150 billion more in revenue than CBO does      for the same policies.''       Indeed, the CBO viewed by the inside-the-Beltway crowd as      the impartial umpire of all budget disputes--also predicts a      balanced budget by 2012. The catch is that it assumes the      Bush tax cuts are repealed leading to a surge of revenue in      2011 and 2012. It forecasts that the budget deficit would      drop from $137 billion in 2010 to just $12 billion in 2011.      And in 2012, the budget would move into the black with a $170      billion surplus. Yet if the Bush tax cuts are extended, CBO      predicts total deficits of $407 billion in 2011 and 2012 and      then continuing thereafter.       No wonder Democratic presidential candidates are finding it      so easy to pledge or strongly hint that if they are sitting      in the White House in 2010, they will veto any effort to      extend the tax cuts. One can easily envision President      Hillary Rodham Clinton harking back to her husband Bill's      1993 tax hikes and economic success as historical      justification for a repeat performance. Deficits are often      used as reason for higher taxes, such as in 1993 and 1982.      But to believe in higher taxes as sound economic policy in      coming years, you also have to believe in the CBO's cheery      forecast that hundreds of billion of dollars in new taxes      will have little or no effect on economic growth.       Now you don't have to be an acolyte of supply-side guru      Arthur Laffer to find that sort of ``static analysis'' a      little weird. Most Americans probably would. So, apparently,      did the economic team at Goldman Sachs, the old employer of      Robet Rubin, President Bill Clinton's second treasury      secretary. Thus the firm's econ wonks decided to try and      simulate the real world effect of letting the Bush tax cuts      expire at the end of 2010. Using the respected Washington      University Macro Model, Goldman reset the tax code to its      pre-Bush status, assumed all tax cuts expired, and watched      how the economy reacted as 2011 began. What did the firm see?      Well, in the first quarter of 2011 the economy dropped 3      percentage points below what it would have been otherwise.      ``Absent a tailwind to growth from some other source,'' the      analysis concludes, ``this would almost surely mark the onset      of a recession.''       So actually it's CBO's economic forecast, not Bush's that      is overly, optimistic about future economic growth. But      wouldn't the Federal Reserve jump in and cut interest rates,      offsetting the fiscal drag of the tax hikes with easy      monetary policy? The Goldman Sachs experiment assumes it      would, but WUMM still shows the economy sinking;       ``In an effort to resuscitate demand, the Fed immediately      cuts the federal funds rate, bringing it 250 basis points      below the status quo level over the next year and one-half. .      . Despite this, output growth remains well     below trend over that period, putting downward pressure on      inflation as slack in the economy increases.''       And guess what? A recession would throw CBO's carefully      calculated tax revenue assumptions out the window. Indeed,      the CBO admits that recessions in 1981, 1990 and 2001,      ``resulted in significantly different budgetary outcomes than      CBO had projected few months before the downturns started.''       Of course, it's been the history of tax increases that they      tend not to bring in as much revenue as originally predicted.      President Rodham Clinton or President Obama or President      Edwards would likely find the same budgetary disappointment--     and then have to explain to an angry American public during      the 2012 election season why their president decided to      plunge the economy into a recession.
