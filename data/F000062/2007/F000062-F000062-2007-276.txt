 President, I offer my personal congratulations to Talmadge E. King, Jr., MD, for receiving the Edward Livingston Trudeau Medal from the American Thoracic Society. The award recognizes Dr. King for his lifelong commitment to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung disease.  Throughout his career, Dr. King has made significant contributions to pulmonary medicine in patient care, research, specialty organization, and through his generous philanthropic contributions.  Dr. King began his illustrious career after graduating from Gustavus Adolphus College in 1970 and Harvard Medical School in 1974. Following his graduation from Harvard Medical School, he began his residency at Emory University Affiliated Hospitals in Atlanta, GA. After 2 years of residency at Emory, Dr. King was offered a pulmonary fellowship at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver. Here he also held a professorship in medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.  Over the next decade, Dr. King spent time at two other Denver hospitals, the Veterans Administration Medical Center and the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine. In both of these capacities his talents as a doctor and as an administrator were quickly recognized and he rapidly advanced within both organizations.  By 1997, however, he was ready to bring his considerable talents to the Golden State--and we were happy to have him. Dr. King left Denver to take on two new roles in San Francisco, concurrently serving as the vice chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and as the chief of medical services at San Francisco General Hospital. As chief of medical service at San Francisco General Hospital, he leads a department of over 140 full-time physicians and scientists and more than 500 support staff, with an annual budget of over $65 million.  Currently, Dr. King still serves as the chief of medical services at San Francisco General, and since 2005, he has also served as the interim chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California San Francisco.  Dr. King is also a founding board member of the Foundation of the American Thoracic Society, the philanthropic arm of the American Thoracic Society. In this role, Dr. King has been an exemplary contributor and tireless fundraiser to support domestic and international research to find better treatments for the myriad of lung diseases that afflict individuals around the globe.  Of course, no congratulations would be complete without mentioning the contributions of his wife Mozelle Davis King and his two children Consuelo and Malaika who have been there every step of the way and provided him with steadfast love and support.  Again, I congratulate Dr. King on this great achievement and wish him continued success in the years to come. It is truly a pleasure to honor and thank him for all that he has done for patients across the country.                          ____________________
