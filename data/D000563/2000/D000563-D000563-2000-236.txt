They want to give them a tax cut of $24. Two dollars a month is their response. We are trying to give them a dollar an hour increase under Senator Kennedy's leadership in the minimum wage. Yet those at the highest level, those making over $300,000 a year, under the Republican proposal, will see a tax break of $23,000 a year. That is almost double what people making minimum wage are receiving in income. We are going to give that much in a tax break to those making over $300,000.  So instead of raising the minimum wage for the millions that the Senator refers to--and the 350,000 people who get up and go to work every day in Illinois at minimum-wage jobs--we are, instead, giving a tax break to the wealthiest among us.
