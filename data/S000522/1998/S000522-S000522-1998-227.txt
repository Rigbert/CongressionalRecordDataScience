Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of New Jersey's broadcasters and the New Jersey Broadcasters Association who have worked in partnership to help focus public attention on some of the key concerns for residents in my state. While radio and television stations are required to address important public issues, New Jersey broadcasters have worked hard to exceed their responsibilities.  New Jersey's television and radio stations have raised over $1 million for charitable causes and donated over $3 million in air-time for public service projects. Broadcasters in my state have raised money to build new housing for needy families, provided gifts for children during the Christmas holidays, and helped many individuals who were victimized by natural disasters.  Stations in New Jersey have donated countless hours of public affairs programming and public service announcements aimed at educating residents about alcohol abuse, anti-crime initiatives, and efforts to fight poverty and hunger. Additionally, two-thirds of the radio stations in New Jersey have made it their policy to offer free air-time to political candidates. The median value of the air-time totaled $27,000 per station.  Radio and television stations have done much to provide important information for people throughout New Jersey. Their important charitable fund raising, coordinated through the New Jersey Broadcasters Association, has helped enhance the quality of life for many of our citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Phil Roberts, the Executive Director of the New Jersey Broadcasters Association and all the people who work at New Jersey's radio and television stations for their commitment and dedication to the people of New Jersey.                          ____________________
