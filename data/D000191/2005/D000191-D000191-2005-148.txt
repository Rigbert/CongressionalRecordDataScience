  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman who went before me: we should see the best of human nature and we should all join together, and hopefully Congress and the administration can do better in the relief and the rebuilding efforts than they did in the prevention and disaster response.  But it is a time to learn and reform because it may only be days or weeks until we have another devastating hurricane, who knows when the terrorists will attack, and have we learned any lessons since 9/11.  A gentleman before me said we will never forget. We have forgotten. There were no interoperable secure communications. They want to blame New Orleans for that. Guess what, the Bush administration zeroed out interoperable communications in the Homeland Security budget. The Bush administration insisted that FEMA had to go into Homeland Security. I joined with 163 Members of this House saying no, that will degrade FEMA. FEMA has been degraded. They have a political hack as their head.  Changes need to be made now, and urgently, because the next disaster may strike tomorrow. And if the response is as poor as it was in this emergency, more people will die needlessly.                          ____________________[Page H7677]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                  FEMA  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
