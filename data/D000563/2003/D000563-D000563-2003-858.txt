 Madam President, because I am convinced of the genuineness and commitment of both the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Delaware to the issue of nonproliferation, of transparency in our agreement with any nation when it comes to nuclear weapons, I am going to defer to their judgment. But I will also add, were I to send a letter by myself, I am not sure what it might mean, but if they will join me in this correspondence to the administration, I am certain it will carry more weight and be a reminder that we are mindful of the need for real verification, to make certain these nuclear weapons do not end up in the wrong hands and, in fact, they are set aside so they will not be a threat to any other nation.                      Amendment No. 250, Withdrawn  For that reason, with the assurance of Senator Lugar, as well as Senator Biden, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I filed.
