Mr. Speaker, a small bit of good news has emerged from the tortured region of Chechnya, where the Russian military is killing, looting, and terrorizing the population under the guise of an ``anti-terrorism operation.''  Andrei Babitsky, the Radio Liberty correspondent who had disappeared in Chechnya in early February after Russian authorities had ``exchanged'' him to unknown persons in return for some Russian prisoners of war, has emerged in Dagestan and is now in Moscow recuperating from his ordeal. Mr. Babitsky's courageous reporting from the besieged city of Grozny had infuriated Russian military authorities, and he was arrested in mid-January and charged with ``participating in an unlawful armed formation.''  Prior to his release, Mr. Babitsky had spent time in the notorious Chernokozovo ``filtration'' camp where the Russian military has been detaining and torturing Chechens suspected of aiding the resistance. Following his arrival in Moscow, Mr. Babitsky provided a harrowing account of his incarceration at the Chernokozovo prison, and especially the savage treatment of his fellow prisoners. It is another graphic reminder that for all the fine words and denials coming out of Moscow, the Russian military has been conducting a brutalbusiness that makes a mockery of the Geneva Conventions and the code of military conduct stipulated in the 1994 Budapest Document of the OSCE.  Mr. Speaker, last month President Clinton stated that Russia's Acting President Putin is a man the United States ``can do business with.'' With this in mind, I would suggest for the Record excerpts from Mr. Babitsky's interview with an NTV reporter in Russia. If Mr. Putin is aware of the state of affairs at Chernokozovo and condoning it, I would submit that our business with Mr. Putin should be extremely limited. If he is not aware of the truth, then his authority over Russia is a chimera, and we might better deal with the real rulers of Russia.  Babitsky's statement follows:      [From Hero of the Day NTV Program, 7:40 p.m., Feb. 29, 2000]       Interview With Radio Liberty Correspondent Andrei Babitsky       Babitsky. On the 16th I tried to leave the city of Grozny      through the settlement of Staraya Sunzha, a suburb of Grozny      which at the time was divided into two parts. One part was      controlled by federal troops and the other by the Chechen      home guard.       I entered the territory controlled by the federals and it      was there that I was recognized. I was identified as a      journalist, I immediately presented my documents. All the      subsequent claims that I was detained as a person who had to      be identified are not quite clear to me. I had my passports      with me, my accreditation card of       Then I was taken to Khankala. Not what journalists who had      covered the first war regarded as Khankala but to an open      field. There was an encampment there consisting of trucks      used as their office by army intelligence officers. Two of my      cassettes that I had filmed in Grozny were taken from me.      They contained unique frames. I think those were the last      video pictures ever taken by anyone before Grozny was      stormed. Those, again, were pictures of thousands of peaceful      civilians many of whom, as we now know, were killed by      federal artillery shells.       I spent two nights in Khankala, in the so-called Avtozak, a      truck converted into a prison cell. On the third day I was      taken to what the Chechens call a filtration center, the      preliminary detention center in Chernokozovo.       I believe I am the only journalist of those who covered the      first and the second Chechen wars who has seen a filtration      center from the inside. I must say that all these horrors      that we have heard from Chechens who had been there have been      confirmed. Everything that we read about concentration camps      of the Stalin period, all that we know about the German      camps, all this is present there.       The first three days that I spent there, that was the 18th,      19th and the 20th, beatings continued round the clock. I      never thought that I would hear such a diversity of      expressions of human pain. These were not just screams, these      were screams of every possible tonality and depth, these were      screams of most diverse pain. Different types of beatings      cause a different reaction.       Q. Are you saying that you got this treatment?       A. No, that was the treatment meted out to others. I was      fortunate, it was established at once that I am a journalist,      true, nobody knew what type of journalist I was. Everybody      there were surprised that a journalist happened to be there.      In principle, the people there cannot be described as      intellectuals. They decided that there was nothing special      about this, that such things do happen in a war. As a      journalist I was ``registered'', as they say, only once. They      have this procedure there. When a new detainee is being taken      from his cell to the investigator he is made to crawl all the      way under a rain of blows with rubber sticks.       It hurts but one can survive it. This is a light treatment      as compared with the tortures to which Chechens are subjected      day and night, those who are suspected of collaborating with      the illegal armed formations. There are also cases when some      testimony is beaten out of detainees.       Q. What is the prison population there?       A. In my opinion . . . I was in cell No. 17 during the      first three days. In that cell there were 13 inhabitants of      the village Aberdykel (sp.--FNS). Most of them were young.      Judging by their stories, I am not an investigator and I      could not collect a sufficiently full database, but in such      an atmosphere one very rarely doubts the veracity of what you      are told. Mostly these were young men who had nothing to do      with the war. They were really common folk. They were      treating everything happening around them as a calamity but      they were not taking any sides. They were simply waiting for      this calamity to pass either in this direction or that      direction.       Beatings as a method of getting testimony. This is      something that, unfortunately, is very well known in Russian      and not only Russian history and tradition. But I must say      that apart from everything, in my opinion, in all this      torture, as it seemed to me, a large part is due to sheer      sadism. In other words, an absolutely unwarranted torturing      of people.       For instance, I heard . . . You know, you really can't see      this because all this happens outside of your cell. But the      type of screams leaves not doubt about what is happening. You      know, this painful reaction. For two hours a woman was      tortured on the 20th or the 19th. She was tortured, I have no      other word to explain what was happening. That was not a      hysteria. I am not a medic but I believe that we all know      what a hysteria is. There were screams indicting that a      person was experiencing unbearable pain, and for a long      period of time.                               ____________________
