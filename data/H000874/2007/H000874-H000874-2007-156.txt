We had a lot of angst, as you recall, and I asked the majority leader on a number of occasions when they were going to have conferences that were called, that had conferees, to which our conferees were never invited, some the most senior Members of this Congress, namely Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel, who were not invited to conferences. So I understand the gentleman's angst. I really do.  But having said that, I think it is unfair to say a bill that has not been seen. I would again reiterate to my friend that, as I understand it, there will be nothing in the bill that we will hope to consider early next week that was not included in either the Senate bill or the House bill, both of which passed respective bodies. But we haven't been able to get to conference. Meetings have obviously been held. We hope agreements have been reached which would be acceptable to both bodies so that we can move those bills as if a conference had been held. But because a conference hasn't been held, this is the alternative available to us.
