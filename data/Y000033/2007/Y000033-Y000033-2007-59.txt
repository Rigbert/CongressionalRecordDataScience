Madam Speaker, I compliment the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall. As many of my colleagues know, I have long supported the efforts of the Lumbee Tribe to be federally recognized.  I have had discussions with the sponsor of the bill who represents them, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre). I have studied their case for many years when I served as ranking member and chairman of the Committee on Resources.  The Lumbee's quest for recognition has been going for more than 100 years, which seems to be longer than almost any other tribe currently in the recognition process. During this time, the Lumbees have been put under a microscope and subjected to intensive debate by the State of North Carolina, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Congress, historians, and other Indian tribes.  In my judgment and that of the committee, this is clearly a distinct community of Indian people who meet the definition of ``tribe'' under article I, section 8 of Constitution; and the fact that more than 200 Members of this body have cosponsored H.R. 65 attests to the tribe's legitimacy.                              {time}  1545  Here are some of the facts about the Lumbee tribe. It is a State-recognized tribe. It has submitted huge amounts of documentation to prove that it is an autonomous Indian community that can trace links to a historic tribe. Even the Act of 1956, which terminated the tribe, helps to prove their case.  The reason for this is that, in order to be terminated by Congress, you first must be recognized. The fact that Congress had to identify the Lumbees before terminating them is a clear indication that Congress considered them to be a distinct Indian community within the meaning of the Constitution. Why else would Congress feel a need to prohibit benefits for this community if, as the opposition alleges, they were not eligible for the benefits in the first place?  Ask anyone who has traveled to Robeson County, and they will report that the county is largely governed by the Lumbee people already. In one sense, this bill merely puts a Federal endorsement on the fact that an independent, self-governing tribe exists in North Carolina.  But this is a tribe that still lacks the status of all the other federally recognized tribes. And in lacking the benefits, immunities and the responsibilities accorded to other tribes, the Lumbees are second-class citizens within the Indian world. This is not right.  H.R. 65 corrects this historic injustice, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill as soon as possible.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
