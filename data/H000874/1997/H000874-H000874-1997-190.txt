Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, what the gentleman will like about the bill is that it eliminates most of the paperwork and says that there is one form for all of these programs, and it will be the Federal problem of figuring out. But we would only have one form.  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, again reclaiming my time, see, what I would hope we could do is move to something like title VI where we don't have to justify on a form; we would say that we are going to provide the resources and those at the local level decide how they want to spent them.
