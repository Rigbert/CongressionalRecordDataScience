President, this is an amendment that Senator Barrasso and I have offered to fully fund the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, by providing an additional $200 million for this purpose. I am very pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, has also joined us in this amendment as well as Senators Crapo, Kyl, Enzi, Bennett and Hatch.  Significantly, this amendment would provide for full funding for this legislation for the first time since its passage. I helped author the Healthy Forests Restoration Act in 2003--a bipartisan bill that I worked on with a number of my colleagues to help address serious forest health issues and a significant backlog of hazardous fuels that have been building up on our national forests.  When Congress passed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, HFRA, Congress authorized $760 million in new money to complete hazardous fuel reduction work on 20 million acres. Yet in each of the past years the Bush administration's budget request has fallen short, in my estimation by well over $600 million less than Congress authorized. Because the Healthy Forests Restoration Act was never fully funded in the prior administration, it has never really had the chance to work. Our amendment would ensure that rural communities will finally get the resources they were promised. These funds will put these communities on a path to preventing wildfires and bringing jobs back to the forest.  In hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, previous administration leaders assured me that even in the face of such severe budget cuts, they could get the work done, possibly within 8 to 10 years. Yet in hearings before the committee we also heard witnesses from the GAO and USDA inspector general's office testify that the agencies were falling far short of meeting this mandate and that hazardous fuels were building up in our forests as much as three times faster than the agencies could remove them.  When you come from a State like mine, where the Federal Government owns so much of the land, the health of those public forests is a very serious issue--one with life or death consequences for communities that are next to these forests and could become raging infernos in the next fire season.  We can no longer dawdle on completing the thinning work that urgently needs to be performed on our Nation's forests. This work would also provide jobs thinning overstocked forests in rural communities, while reducing the threat of wildfires.  Those wildfires are getting more and more costly to fight and consuming more and more of the budget of our public lands agencies. It simply doesn't make sense to not spend the money on preventing the fires and then turn around during the fire season and watch the millions of dollars flow freely while people's homes and livelihoods go up in smoke.  Full funding of the HFRA would also allow for funding to communities so they can implement ``community wildfire protection plans'' developed in areas that are part of ``wildland urban interface'' and living on the edge of our public forests.  I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense amendment and get the Healthy Forests Act back on track.                     Amendment No. 840, as Modified
