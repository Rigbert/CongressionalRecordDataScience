 President, I realize this is a good bit of money. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I serve on the committee with Senator Gregg. I believe, though, we have been spending pennies as far as transit security is concerned--that is subways, buses, and everything else--as opposed to airline security, which both are important.  We know what happened last week in London.
