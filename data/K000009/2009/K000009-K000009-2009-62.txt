March 26 marks the anniversary of their signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, momentous in that it was the first such treaty between an Arab nation and the nation of Israel. It followed the Camp David Accords which these leaders had signed the prior year. They signed it right here on the White House lawn.  I can remember the day. History will record for all time that incredible step forward of lions and lambs lying down their arms and their fears. I can still recall the day of that signing. It was a sunny day, as the three leaders pledged their political and personal capital to that unprecedented feat. It was historic. It was bold. And it was costly. In 1981, an assassin in Cairo would take the life of President Anwar al-Sadat. In 1983, Menachem Begin resigned. President Jimmy Carter lost his re-election campaign.  President Jimmy Carter and his gifted National Security adviser, Zbigniew Brezezinski, carry the collective living memory of that pristine moment of the Camp David Peace Accord and the Egyptian Israeli Peace Treaty. To date, only one other Arab nation has signed a peace accord with the nation of Israel, Jordan, in 1994, well over 10 years later, through the equally courageous vision of its timeless leader, King Hussein.  Looking back, as today's upheaval across the Middle East reminds us of old fractures and unmet potential, we can ask, how did these men do it? How did they make history?  The enmity between people and nations was no less. The prospects forward seemed very dim at that time. Yet, their inspired and dogged efforts did not take no for an answer. That peace agreement ended 30 years of war between Israel and Egypt. Now we have seen 30 years of peace between them. By anyone's measure, this remains the most important set of diplomatic achievements in the Middle East in modern history. We need to celebrate them.  And as we honor the achievement of these leaders, and the nations to which they dedicated their lives, let us remember what they did.  President Jimmy Carter stated, ``War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each others' children.''  Prime Minister Menachem Begin said, ``If through your efforts and sacrifice, you win liberty and with it the prospect of peace, then work for peace because there is no mission in life more sacred.''  And President Anwar al-Sadat said, ``Peace is much more precious than a piece of land.''  Could we only recapture that moment again. How much our world still owes these men for leading history forward, for showing us the way. They did not allow the status quo or entrenched rivalries and worn-out dreams to quash the prospect of peace. They gave their all to it. Today, we commemorate and we celebrate their greatness.                          ____________________
