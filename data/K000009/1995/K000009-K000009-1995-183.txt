 I would just like to endorse his proposal to the membership to sign House Discharge Petition 2, the Stockman-Sanders discharge petition. There is a bill ready to come to the floor supported by a large number of Members on both sides of the aisle, and I want to commend the gentleman from California for bringing the importance of this to the American people as well as the membership.  As one of the signers of that discharge petition, I know that it is the only alternative we have left to get a full debate in this House on Executive action that has gone beyond the bounds of precedent.
