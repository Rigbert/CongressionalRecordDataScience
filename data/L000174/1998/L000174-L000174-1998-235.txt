President, I am here once again to talk about S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. On this date back in 1878, a gentleman named Thaddeus Hyatt was granted a patent for reinforced concrete. Now, 120 years later, the Senate is refusing to reinforce American innovation by failing to take concrete action to reform our nation's patent laws.  We are presented with an opportunity that will not soon repeat itself--an opportunity to pass S. 507 and give U.S. inventors longer patent terms, put more royalties in their pockets, save them money in costly patent litigation, and avoid wasting their development resources on duplicative research. At the same time, we can get our new technology more rapidly into the marketplace and make U.S. companies more competitive globally.  Remaining globally competitive is not an idle concern. The failure of this body to enact the reforms of our patent system contained in S. 507 has given foreign entities applying for and receiving patents in the U.S. unfair advantages over U.S. firms--advantages that U.S. persons filing and doing business abroad do not have. This ability to keep U.S. inventors in the dark about the latest technological developments does not work to our economic advantage. Why are we turning our backs on our businesses, small and large, by not voting on this bill?  I have made recent speeches citing the strong support this legislation has around the country. This legislation has more than just Vermont or any state in mind. It has the entire country in its best interest. Our 200 year old patent system has provided protections to many of our inventions that have led to our global economic leadership position in the world marketplace. However, that leadership position is being threatened. Litigation has increased. Small inventors have been taken advantage of. Inventors and businesses are asking for our help and requesting that we pass S. 507.  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill out over a year ago by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 17-1, and this bill has yet to see the light of day on the floor. No longer can we turn the other cheek when American business lets out such a cry for help. We need to bring this bill to the floor now and to pass it. We must not squander this opportunity to not only update our patent system but to come to America's defense.  I inserted into the Congressional Record  on June 23, letters of support from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, and the 21st Century Patent Coalition.  On July 10, I inserted into the Congressional Record  additional letters of support from The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America, PhRMA; the American Automobile Manufacturers Association; the Software Publishers Association; the Semiconductor Industry Association; the Business Software Alliance; the American Electronics Association; and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.  I now ask that additional letters of support for S. 507 be printed in the Record. These letters are from IBM; the Biotechnology Industry Organization; the International Trademark Association; 3M; Intel Corporation; Caterpillar; AMP Incorporated; and Hewlett-Packard Company.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     IBM Internet Media Group,                                 Essex Junction, VT, June 6, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: As an inventor I rely on the strength      of the U.S. patent system to legally protect my invention(s).      I am also the chairman of an ANSI standardization committee      (NCITS L3.1) which represents the United States in an      International Standardization Forum (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG      11). Our committee has developed the Emmy Award winning      standard called MPEG-2, a standard which may have never come      to pass had it not been for strong International parent      protection. We are currently working on the future of      International     Multimedia (MPEG-4), a standard which promises to be as      popular and widely used as MPEG-2 will be. The strength of      the patent laws is essential to promoting participation and      the development of International Standards. However, the      system which for years has effectively encouraged innovation      and protected inventors, is no longer effective. A      significant number of ways have been found to abuse it, such      as people and/or companies obtaining inappropriate patents      and in some cases pilfering others' hard-earned invention.      This threatens to undermine America's position as the global      leader in technology innovation. I am proud that my work as      an inventor has contributed to IBM's patent portfolio.       There is no legislation pending before you that will help      restore leadership and integrity to the U.S. patent system.      It is responsive to today's fast paced, highly competitive      environment, and it will protect inventors like me. I am      writing to ask you to urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to      bring S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, to the Senate      floor as soon as possible and for you to support its final      passage.       The bipartisan Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507, was      passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 17-1 and has not      yet been brought up for a floor vote. The House of      Representatives also passed a similar bill in May 1997. Five      former Commissioners of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)      support this bill. A Senate floor vote is the only way to      continue the process to enact this legislation that would      help protect inventors and companies from patent system      abuse.       Please help protect America's intellectual property and      urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to bring this bill to the      floor for a vote. Thank you for your attention to this      matter, and as a concerned constituent, I request your      support of this legislation.           Sincerely,                                               Peter P. Schirling,     IBM Senior Engineer.                                  ____                                                    June 18, 1998.     Re Scheduling Debate on Patent Reform Legislation, S. 507          (Hatch/Leahy).     United States Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to support      scheduling of the patent reform legislation, S. 507, on the      Senate floor before the August recess. This legislation is      supported by an overwhelming majority of the Senators and the      few Senators who have amendments to offer can easily be      accommodated in a time agreement.       BIO has been working on this critical legislation for four      years, the House passed the bill by a lopsided and bipartisan      margin, and it emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee on      a near-unanimous vote. There are very few issues for the      Senate debate or conference with the House. It should be easy      to complete action on this bill and enact it into law this      session. Doing so will be a major victory for biomedical and      other research.       This bill answers the concerns raised by the biotechnology      industry and other high technology industries regarding the      erosion of patents caused by the adoption of the GATT 20      year-from-filing regime. We need to enact this bill to      provide vital protection to biotechnology firms conducting      research on cures and therapies for cancer, AIDS,      Alzheimer's, and other deadly and disabling diseases.       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) represents      almost 800 companies and organizations that use or support      biotechnology research. Our companies are finding the next      generation of medicines and cures for endemic diseases that      diminish the quality of life for all Americans. On a per      capita basis, our companies invest more in research and      development than any other industry--almost ten times the      national average--or about $100,000 per employee per year.      This industries investment (almost 10 billion dollars in      1998) is protected primarily through the patent system.       Patents as an incentive for this critical research. Without      patents this research would stop because no investor will      fund this research without patents. This is why the patent      term protections in this bill are so important. The Hatch-     Leahy patent term bill provides complete and unequivocal      protections to ensure that diligent patent applicants will      not lose patent term under the new GATT 20 year patent law.       There is no industry which has lost more in patent      protection under the new GATT 20 year patent term than the      biotechnology industry. Our industry has been working for      three years to secure protections so that diligent patent      applicants cannot, and will not, lose patent protection under      this new law. It is imperative that the GATT law be amended      to protect diligent patent applicants this year.       Diligent patent applicants cannot lose patent term under      the patent provisions of Hatch-Leahy bill. If there are any      delays in the grant of a patent by the Patent and Trademark      Office (PTO) which are beyond the applicant's control, the      applicant is given extra patent term--day-for-day      compensation. This is a similar system which now applies when      a patent holder loses patent term due to delays in the      approval of a product by the Food and Drug Administration.      So, the solution provided by the Hatch-Leahy bill is tried      and tested and it works.       In addition to these patent term provisions, the Hatch-     Leahy bill also provides for publication of internationally      filed patent applications 18 months after filing and BIO      supports this provision as well. Our companies file for      patents in Europe and Japan where all applications are      published after 18 months. Therefore 18 month publication in      the United States will place U.S. companies on equal footing      to their European and Asian competitors.       We enthusiastically support the patent term and publication      provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, know that it solves the      patent term problem, urge you to support scheduling of this      bill and support final passage. The current GATT/TRIPS law is      very problematic for the biotechnology industry and enactment      of S. 507 is needed to eliminate the disincentive for      biomedical research,       Please contact us with any questions about this critical      issue; we would be pleased to meet with you to discuss them.           Sincerely,                                                Charles E. Ludlam,                          Vice President for Government Relations.                                                   Dave Schmickel,     Patent and Legal Counsel.                                  ____                                           International Trademark                                                  Association,                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: You already know of our association's      strong support for S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Reform Act. Our      members are trademark owners located in every state of the      union. This bipartisan bill makes important changes to the      U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that are necessary      to enable the USPTO to respond efficiently and effectively to      the tremendous growth in trademark applications generated by      our robust economy.       With next week designated as ``High Tech Week'' in the      Senate, where legislation dealing with new technology will be      considered, there is no bill that is more deserving of      attention and support at this time than S. 507. By converting      the USPTO into a government corporation that is 100% user-fee      funded, S. 507 will free the agency from constraints which      have long hampered efficient operations. Passage of this      important legislation will ensure that new products and      inventions receive the protection they need both here at home      and in global markets.       S. 507 provides great value to intellectual property owners      and should be allowed to proceed to the Senate floor. We ask      for your help in gaining passage of S. 507.           Sincerely,                                                    David Stimson,     President.                                  ____                                                     3M, Office of                                Intellectual Property Counsel,                                       St. Paul, MN, June 9, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     United States Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express the strong      support of the 3M Company for the reforms contained in S.      507, the Hatch/Leahy Omnibus Patent Reform Act, and to      request that you ask Senator Lott to schedule it for a Senate      vote as soon as possible. S. 507 is critically important to      U.S. industry. Its reforms will strengthen and improve the      United States patent system, allowing American industry to      compete more effectively with its foreign competition.       S. 507 will give the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the      administrative flexibility to operate at peak efficiency,      save inventors money, and accelerate patent processing. It      will allow American inventors and companies to see foreign      technology contained in U.S. patent applications more than a      year earlier than today, while ensuring that domestic      inventors who choose not to take advantage of publication      before patent grant may continue to do so if they do not file      outside of the U.S. The legislation will guarantee diligent      applications a patent term of at least 17 years from grant      and most will receive an even longer term of exclusivity. S.      507 would also make existing reexamination procedures more      effective by allowing greater third party participation,      while adding numerous safeguards to protect against abuse.       One specific reform of S. 507 which 3M most strongly      supports is that of creating a prior domestic commercial use      defense. This long overdue reform will protect manufacturing      jobs in American companies like 3M by ensuring that a late      filed patent--nearly one-half of U.S. patents are foreign      owned--will not disrupt domestic manufacturing operations.      Important technology underlying our successful Post-     it' Notes such as those attached to this letter--     and the jobs of the American workers who produce them--will      be made safer against foreign attack by the passage of S.      507.       The reforms in S. 507 are designed to improve the      functioning of the patent system for all users, large and      small. In fact, Senators Hatch and Leahy have recently agreed      to amend their bill on the Senate floor in response to      requests from small businesses. With these changes, key small      business constituencies such as the Technology Chairs of the      White House Conference on Small Business, the National      Association of Women Business Owners, and the Small Business      Technology Coalition have expressed their enthusiastic      support for S. 507.       U.S. industry needs these patent reforms now. Support S.      507 and urge Senator Lott to bring it to a vote promptly.           Sincerely,                                   Gary L. Griswold,                                                    Staff Vice President and                                            Chief Intellectual         Property Counsel.                                  ____                                             Intel Corporation                                   Santa Clara, CA, June 12, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     433 Russell Senate Office Building.       Dear Senator Leahy: For the past four years, Intel has been      an active participant in the 21st Century Patent Coalition,      which supports the enactment of patent reform legislation (S.      507). S. 507 would accomplish three broad goals of vital      importance to our industry: modernizing patent      administration, improving and simplifying dispute resolution      procedures in the Patent and Trademark Office, and      strengthening inventors' rights in a number of ways, most      importantly by protecting them from loss of term due to      Patent Office delays. Our coalition has the support of over      80 major American industrial companies and 22 industry      associations that are composed, primarily, of small      businesses.       Now, S. 507--which passed the House on a voice vote last      year, and was approved in the Senate Judiciary by a vote of      17-1--is ready for floor action in the Senate. Our coalition      has worked hard to address any and all legitimate concerns      about the text of the bill and its impact upon small business      entities and independent inventors, and we believe that it      would, if enacted, create the most pro-inventor patent system      in the world. It has recently received the enthusiastic      support of the White House Conference on Small Business      Technology Chairs, the National Association of Women Business      Owners, and the Small Business Technology Coalition.       The patent system we have today will be ill equipped to      serve the needs of inventors in the next century if the      improvements provided for in S. 507 are not made. We ask for      your help in scheduling S. 507 for a floor vote, and for your      support for the Committee bill on final passage.       Your support will help preserve America's role as the      world's technology leader.           Sincerely,                                                   Carl Silverman,     Director of Intellectual Property.                                  ____                                             Caterpillar Inc.,                                         Peoria, IL, June 3, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express Caterpillar's      strong support for S. 507 (Hatch/Leahy), The Omnibus Patent      Act of 1997. As you know, S. 507 was reported from the Senate      Judiciary Committee on a vote of 17-1 and is awaiting Senate      floor action. A companion bill passed the House last year.       S. 507 would modernize the U.S. patent system through major      improvements in our patent laws that will greatly benefit      America's large and small businesses, inventors and      entrepreneurs. For Caterpillar, this legislation will mean      reduced costs, reduced risk, reduced bureaucracy, fewer      lawsuits, more certainty regarding property rights, and      generally a faster, more responsive patent system.       Equally significant, key small business groups now agree      that S. 507 will streamline the patent process and help      America's inventors who currently suffer from delays in the      patent office that are not their fault.       It's time for the Senate to vote on this bill to help      strengthen the U.S. economy and keep jobs in America.       I urge you to contact Majority Leader Lott in support of      early scheduling of S. 507 for floor debate, and support the      efforts of its sponsors to adopt a bill without weakening      amendments.           Sincerely,                                                William B. Heming,     General Patent Counsel.                                  ____                                                 AMP Incorporated,                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Please ask Senator Lott to bring S.      507, the Hatch-Leahy Omnibus Patent Act, to the floor as soon      as possible. This patent reform is important to AMP, our      employees, and the hundreds of inventors in our company who      think up new ideas to produce better products, to keep our      company competitive, and to create new jobs.       It's time to bring this bill up for a vote. The technology      chairs of the White House Conference on Small Business have      approved S. 507 because, ``(it) will lower the litigation      costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas      of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way      towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our      foreign competitors.'' AMP and the dozens of other companies      and associations in the 21st Century Patent Coalition agree.       This bill has undergone months and months of scrutiny and      compromise and is now ready for a vote. I hope you'll      encourage the Majority Leader to schedule floor time for this      reasonable reform measure.       If you need any more information about S. 507, please let      me know.           Sincerely,                                                  John Palafoutas,     Director, Federal Relations.                                  ____                                      Hewlett-Packard Company,                                     Palo Alto, CA, June 22, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act, has      been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, but is appears      that Majority Leader Lott needs some encouragement to      schedule the bill for floor action. Hewlett-Packard Company      strongly supports enactment of S. 507 and would appreciate      your support in urging Senator Lott to put the bill on the      calendar.       Enactment of S. 507 would assure that inventors can receive      a full 17 years--or more--of patent protection if they pursue      their patent claims in a timely manner. It would also      streamline patent operations to expedite processing and      accelerate the dissemination of new technologies for      continuing advancement in products and services.       Significantly, S. 507 achieves these important goals      without threatening a return to the ``submarine patent''      system that existed before the 1995 reform. Under the old      policy, an inventor could manipulate the patent system to      stretch the term even while withholding the new knowledge      from society. Prior to 1995, inventors could wait until the      technology had ripened, and then essentially extort license      fees form another inventor who had independently, in good      faith, created the same or a similar invention.       While ``submarine patents'' are infrequent, when they      strike, they are egregious. In an HP cases, for example, the      company has paid millions of dollars in royatlieis to a      Swedish inventor whose patent has expired in every other      country except the United States. This inventor contributed      nothing to the technology that is in use, in fact, he did not      offer to work with the consortium that was developing the      technology in an open-systems environment. A more thorough      explanation of that case is attached for your review.       Senator Hatch and other supporters of S. 507 have worked      diligently with small business and independent inventors to      resolve concerns about the bill. It is a good compromise for      a more effective patent system as we head into the 21st      century. HP urges your support for S. 507 without weakening      amendments that would revive the submarine patent system.           Sincerely,                                                    Lew Platt,                                           Chairman, President and     Chief Executive Officer.                          ____________________
