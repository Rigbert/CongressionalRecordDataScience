Speaker, our friends at the other cereal company may think they have something that's ``Grrreat'', but for nearly 25 years, true greatness has been present at General Mills in the form of one outstanding gentleman, Mr. Bob Bird. Bob is retiring after more heart-felt skirmishes than some of our greatest generals, and is being feted by friends and colleagues this evening for a career that is worthy of admiration.  From his early days as a copyboy at The New York Post through his years with the Baltimore Sun and then writing for Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson, Bob Bird has had a keen appreciation for news. He went from reporting it to creating it during his days with Sargent Shriver at the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity, then director of governmental relations for the National Center for Resource Recovery, and then with the Senate Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization under Senator Abraham Ribicoff.  Many of our colleagues know Bob Bird from his stellar days with General Mills, where he has worked to represent one of our Nation's finest food companies in a most responsible and successful fashion. In particular, Bob's efforts on behalf of General Mills to support food assistance programs to critically at risk women, infants, and children, have earned him the respect and praise of colleagues, of food program advocates, and respected members of the nutrition community. Acting always as a true professional, no one could doubt that this gentleman of good humor was always acting in an honorable and forthright fashion.  Bob likes to mention that a lesson he learned early in his career is that it is most important to listen, to hear the ideas of others, and to evaluate all information that may be at hand. This method of operation has allowed him to act as a well-informed advocate for General Mills who is welcomed by those who agree with him, as well as those who may have other views. A man of honor who knows how to operate in an honorable fashion is a precious commodity, so I assure you that he will be truly missed by all of us who have come to depend on him as an advisor. And those of us who may be fortunate enough to call him a friend will look forward to more contacts with him in the years to come, but will still miss having him come by as frequently as he had in the past.  With his wonderful wife Lillian, and his family, perhaps Bob will have a better chance to continue his love of jazz, his voracious reading, or his skilled appreciation for thoroughbred horse racing. These relaxations are well earned. But I am also certain that this man of skills and commitment will have many more opportunities to leave his impression on important policy matters.  So from one member who represents the Cheerios Capitol of the World, Toledo, OH, let me say to the man who helped make this Capitol cheerier on many days, Bob, thank you. We are blessed to have known and worked with you. We wish you the best and look forward to seeing your smiling self for many days to come.                          ____________________
