We voted on that over 30 times in this House, and the American people had an opportunity to vote on that. We ought to be focused on making that act as good as it can be--saving as much money as it can and providing access to affordable, quality health care to all of our people. After more than 30 votes in the 112th Congress to repeal, it did not happen; yet this proposed rule signals the 113th will continue along a path that has been rejected.  Another provision in this package continues the policy of denying a voice to 5 million American citizens living in our territories: the District of Columbia--Ms. Norton is here and will speak--Puerto Rico, as well as Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. We have extended in Congresses past--and, frankly, when I was the majority leader--the ability for those Representatives to vote on this floor, not to vote on final passage--the Constitution would have to do that--but to vote in the committee, in the Committee of the Whole. They can vote in our committees in the House, and we ought to give them that right here as a show of respect in order to honor their service to American citizens in the territories and in the District of Columbia.  As this new Congress begins, we have an opportunity to commit ourselves to a spirit of compromise, which our constituents so desperately seek from their Representatives. Our Nation continues to face a number of challenges that can only be addressed by working together and giving every family the opportunity, as our leader said when she spoke so eloquently, to make it in America. Let us take advantage of this new session to start off on the right foot and show Americans that we are ready to come together to tackle our greatest challenges.
