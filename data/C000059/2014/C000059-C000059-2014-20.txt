Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a man who has dedicated 50 years of his life in the service of the State of California and to the United States of America. I say with the utmost sincerity there are few who have contributed more to the understanding and development of the challenging and dangerous discipline of wildland firefighting as Thomas A. Sherman. Riverside County is fortunate to have enjoyed the leadership and experience that Tom Sherman has provided. On March 8, 2014, he will formally retire from the Bureau of Land Management Fire Service as Division Chief of California Desert District Fire and Aviation. In total, Tom has served in multiple capacities of the fire service at the county, state, and federal level.  The roots of Tom's service go back generations when the Sherman (Schermarm) Family left Germany in the late 1800s to become some of the first settlers of the San Jacinto Mountains. Many years later, Tom was born in Upland, California on July 6, 1946 to Jack and Georgette Sherman. He spent a great deal of his youth in the Santa Ana Canyon learning from his grandfather and attending elementary school in Corona. He began what would become a long and thriving career in firefighting in 1963 as a Seasonal Firefighter with the California Division of Forestry (CDF) in Corona. After graduating from Blythe High School in 1965, he worked as a Firefighter with CDF in San Jacinto, California until 1966.  In September of 1966, Tom answered his nation's call and was drafted into the U.S. Army. He attended basic training at Fort Ord, California and was subsequently sent to Vietnam in 1967 as a soldier with the 1st Battalion, 84th Artillery of the 9th Infantry Division. His potential was recognized by his superiors with a promotion to Sergeant and gun-crew NCO in charge. He and his battalion earned two Presidential Unit Citations for their gallant service. Tom returned to the United States in March of 1968 and took the knowledge learned in Vietnam to train new artillery soldiers at the Artillery School at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky. He was honorably discharged from the Army in June of 1968 as a Specialist 5th Class. Tom returned to California and immediately resumed his job at CDF as a Firefighter in Orange County  Tom's natural leadership led to the initiation of numerous firefighting programs that exist to this day. He designed the Riverside County Fire Department emblem, which was formally adopted in 1976 and is still used. That same year while buying guitar strings at the Corona Music Center he met MaryAnn Colapinto. Not long after they were walking down the aisle to be married.  As the 1970s progressed, he was appointed the first Fire Captain in the Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD). In that capacity he further revolutionized wildland fire response through the development of rapidly deployable hand-crews and a state-recognized crew relief driver program. His vast experience led the transformation of obsolete fire trucks into ``Brush Engines'' specifically designed for the unique terrain of Southern California. In 1985he was recognized as a California State Certified Fire Captain for the impacts made across the county and state. Tom continued to advocate issues at the RCFD as both the President of the Riverside County Volunteer Fire Association and Vice President of the Riverside County Fire Chiefs Association.  In the mid-1990s Tom expanded his influence when he was hired by the US Forest Service. There he was promoted to the position of Fire Crew manager for the Cleveland National Forest's Hotshot Crew. He transitioned to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as a seasonal Fire Prevention Technician at the Barstow District, Apple Valley Fire Center. His leadership was soon recognized, and he was promoted to Battalion Chief and permanent Fire Prevention Officer for Palm Springs and South Coast Regions. In 2003 was promoted to Division Chief and filled the position of California Desert District Fire Operations Supervisor. There, he was responsible for training, equipping, and standardizing engine crews, thus increasing professionalism of the teams and interoperability throughout the district. Most recently, Tom has acted as California Desert District Fire and Aviation Manager, where he enhanced interagency cooperation throughout the State of California, formalized federal air support to fire, and reinforced the reputation of BLM as a viable firefighting service.  Today, Tom and MaryAnn reside in Corona, where MaryAnn is a Librarian of 25 years at Jefferson Elementary and a member of the Corona Library Board of Trustees. Tom has also been a member of the Elks Club and supports veterans issues as an active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Their son, Tom began following his father's footsteps as a volunteer firefighter until he entered the United States Air Force Academy in 1991. He is currently a Colonel-Select in the United States Air Force's Security Forces and a student at the National War College at Ft McNair. Their daughter, Nancy, is a Global Clinical Research Program Manager at City of Hope in Pasadena, California.  Throughout his career, Tom's unending love for the fire service created a drive that never ceased to encourage those around him. Fortunately, his legacy will live on through the countless firefighters he has mentored. I am proud to honor such a tremendous member of our community. Passion of this level is rare, but it is the standard that Tom has set for his family, his fellow firefighters, and his community members. I believe I speak for the countless individuals who have benefited from Tom's service when I thank him for the contributions he has made and salute him as he retires after 50 years of service.                          ____________________
