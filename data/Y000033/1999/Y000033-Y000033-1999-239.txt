Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, along with identical legislation being introduced in the Senate by Senators Murkowski and Stevens, to allow commercial and subsistence fishing to continue in Glacier Bay National Park.  In 1978, the National Park Service made a determination that commercial fishing activities were incompatible with National Park Service resources and would be permitted only when specifically authorized by law. Because of this broad determination, the National Park Service developed a rule outlawing commercial and subsistence fishing within the waters of Glacier Bay National Park in 1997.  This broad determination by the National Park Service ignores the fact that commercial fishing has taken place in the waters of Glacier Bay even before the National Park Service took control of the Bay in 1925. Alaskan Natives have fished in this Bay since the 1700's. Non-Native commercial fishing began in the 1880's. In addition, under the Glacier Bay National Park General Management Plan, put into place in 1984, commercial fishing was allowed. Why has the Park Service suddenly now determined that there is some threat to Park resources?  Both the salmon and crab fisheries found off the coast of Alaska and in Glacier Bay National Park, even in Federal waters, are managed by the State of Alaska not the Federal government. There is no resource problem in these fisheries or within the boundaries of the Park. The halibut resource in this area is managed through an international treaty and scientists with both the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the International Halibut Commission have found that there is no problem with the halibut resource in this area. In 1990, the Alaska Wildlife Alliance sued the National Park Service claiming that commercial fishing was statutorily prohibited within the Park. In March 1997, the Federal appeals court (U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals) ruled that commercial fishing was not statutorily prohibited in the Park, except for in wilderness areas. If there is no resource problem within the Glacier Bay National Park boundaries, then commercial and subsistence fishing activities should not be prohibited by broad National Park Service policies drafted in Washington, D.C.  The determination banning commercial and subsistence fishing within Glacier Bay National Park made no sense and was a political decision that will take away the livelihood of a large number of fishermen and will affect the well being of a number of communities which rely on the fishing industry. A ban on commercial fishing will affect not only fishermen, but will also have a huge effect on processing companies including a Native owned and operated processing plant in Kake, which buys much of its seafood from vessels which fish in Glacier Bay. A ban on commercial fishing in Glacier Bay will affect 416 crew and permit holders from Gustavus, Elfin Cove, Hoonah, and Pelican and affect employment opportunities for 613 employed in the seafood industry in these four towns alone. This ban will have a huge economic effect on this region. All of the fishing operations in the Park boundaries are small businesses--there are no large fishing vessels fishing in the Park and no factory trawlers fish here.  Last year, a group of stakeholders including commercial fishing industry representatives, Alaskan Natives, local processing companies, local and national environmental representatives, the State of Alaska, and Park Service personnel met to work out details of an agreement which would allow commercial fishing to continue. The stakeholders had not come to a resolution and because there was no resolution, language was put in the Interior Appropriations legislation to prevent the National Park Service from publishing final rules until the stakeholder group could reach an agreement; however, the National Park Service and national environmental groups made this a national environmental priority and prevented the stakeholder process from concluding.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation will reverse this unjust and unscientific National Park Service policy and allow commercial and subsistence fishing to continue in the non-wilderness waters of Glacier Bay National Park. It clarifies that the State of Alaska will continue to manage marine fishery resources within the Park'sboundaries. It will also provide compensation to those who have been displaced by any closures within the Park or by actions of any Federal agency which interferes with any person legally fishing in Park waters.  Even with commercial fisheries operating in the Park, Glacier Bay National Park was the number one destination in the National Park Service system last year. Commercial fishing poses no threat to the ``park experience'' and in fact many visitors consider seeing fishing vessels as a positive experience in the Park.  Mr. Speaker, there is no fishery resource problem in the Park and there is no justification for a complete closure of Glacier Bay National Park to commercial or subsistence fishing. This legislation will right a wrong and continue to allow these practices to continue in Glacier Bay National Park in a well managed and sustainable manner.                          ____________________
