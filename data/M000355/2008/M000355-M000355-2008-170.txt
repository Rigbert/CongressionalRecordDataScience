  He brought up in the Senate a climate change measure back in the first week of June--something he obviously felt was important. We spent a number of days on it. Many people feel nuclear power is one of the best solutions to the climate change issue, an entirely relevant subject to energy, and would have been permitted under the consent agreement that I offered earlier.  So I think the point is well made, that it is the kind of amendment you would normally expect in the Senate on the biggest issue in the country to be offering, debating, and voting on.  I see my friend from Texas.
