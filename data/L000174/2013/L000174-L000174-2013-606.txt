The annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped more than 50 percent. We have something here that has been a success. We have helped to provide victims with critical services, such as housing and legal protection.  We have to remember, these are not just statistics. These are thousands of lives made immeasurably better. I might say because of this work these thousands of lives are still lives; they are not statistics of people murdered. All the provisions in our bill were developed with the help of victims and those who assist them every day. They are commonsense measures. They will help real people. Every prosecutor, every support group--all will tell you it is past time for Congress to enact this bill to provide help for victims of domestic violence and rape.  We can make these concrete, important changes in the law. We can do it this week. I have been involved in this for years, and I have seen the results of what we have done. I have seen the lives that have been made immeasurably better because of what we have done. I have seen the lives that have been saved because of what we have done. There is no excuse to delay further.                               Exhibit 1         National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                                 February 4, 2013.     Senator,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned local, tribal, and      national organizations, represent and support millions of      victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault      and stalking throughout the United States, American Indian      Tribes and territories. On behalf of the victims we      represent, the professionals who serve them and the      communities that sustain them, we ask that you support the      Violence Against Women Act's (VAWA) reauthorization by co-     sponsoring and voting for S. 47. As you know, VAWA is slated      to come to the Senate floor as early as next week and we are      asking you to take a leadership role in ensuring that this      landmark bi-partisan bill will continue its important work.       VAWA's programs support state, tribal and local efforts to      address the pervasive and insidious crimes of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. These      programs have made great progress towards reducing the      violence, helping victims to be healthy and feel safe and      holding perpetrators accountable. This critical legislation      must be reauthorized to ensure a continued response to these      crimes.       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has dramatically      enhanced our nation's response to violence against girls and      women, boys and men. More victims report domestic violence to      the police and the rate of non-fatal intimate partner      violence against women has decreased by 64%. The sexual      assault services program in VAWA helps rape crisis centers      keep their doors open to provide the frontline response to      victims of rape. VAWA provides for a coordinated community      approach, improving collaboration between law enforcement and      victim services providers to better meet the needs of      victims. These comprehensive and cost-effective programs not      only save lives, they also save money. In fact, VAWA saved      nearly $12.6 billion in net averted social costs in just its      first six years.       VAWA has unquestionably improved the national response to      these terrible crimes. Nonetheless, much work remains to be      done to address unmet needs and enhance access to protections      and services for all victims. We urge you to sponsor and vote      for S. 47 in order to build upon VAWA's successes and      continue to enhance our nation's ability to promote an end to      this violence, to hold perpetrators accountable and to keep      victims and their families safe from future harm. Thank you.           Sincerely,  * * *
