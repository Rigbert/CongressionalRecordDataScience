 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Harwood Union School in Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Sweet. The instances of young children, children under      age of 6 living in poverty in the United States has risen      dramatically over the last two decades. Child poverty is a      problem that encompasses urban, suburban, and rural areas and      affects children of all ethnic backgrounds.       Between the years of 1975, 2 years after the lowest      recorded child poverty level, 11.1 percent, the rate      increased 39 percent, so that by 1994, one in four young      children lived in poverty in the United States. Forty-five      percent of all children under the age of 6 lived in poor or      nearly poor families.       Because poverty has proved to be more detrimental to young      children than to any other age group, because poverty often      means hunger, poor health care, poor education, and even      because of the economic problems of a future ill-prepared      work force the issue of child poverty is one that      necessitates immediate action.       Why the great rise in child poverty? Over the past two      decades and especially since the beginning of the 1980's      there has occurred an increasing gap between the rich and      poor in this country. The average workers wages have declined      since 1970 while the wealthiest fifth of the population has      seen their incomes increased. This small distribution of      wealth significantly affects the poverty of children when 62      percent of all poor children live with at least one working      relative.       Even more important than reforming the welfare system will      be the reform of an economy that has created the largest gap      between the rich and the poor in any industrialized nation.      In the past 2 years because of the increased funding of the      welfare system and other programs, poverty rates have made a      moderate decline. With the new welfare reform bill passed in      1996, loss of funding may cause another increase in child      poverty. The work requirement of the new welfare bill will      not be affected until backed up with adequate child care and      health care programs and a reform of the economy.       Many welfare recipients also because they are unable to      find work for a living wage and unable to care for their      children while at work, single parents especially need to be      provided with access to affordable and adequate child care      and health services if they are to work outside of the home.       Children are the future leaders, the future work force, the      future citizens of the United States of which one in four      even today is living in poverty or near poverty or without      many of the opportunities needed to live successfully as      citizens of the United States.       Congressman Sanders, I thank you for your time and urge you      to consider the children of the Nation as much as possible in      the future.       Poverty gives young children, especially young mothers,      pregnant mothers, children can end up with low-birth weight      and are more--after they are born--are more susceptible to      disease and malnutrition and other health problems and are      also more unable to get a good education as children of      welfare.       It generally impacts the future of a child who grows up      poor who has considerably less access to a good education, is      less motivated in school and doesn't really see a way out of      poverty.       Considering that welfare only takes up 2 percent of the      Federal budget I think that more funding could be put into      helping people who have children who are unable to make a      decent wage, to help the children get a better education and      get decent health care.       Most people that are receiving welfare are unable to make a      decent wage and even if they are unable to pay for education      that would provide them with a better job.       The percentage that I found was that only 2 percent of the      population is receiving Federal aid and is entirely      unemployed, so 62 percent of all families with four children      are working, have at least one relative that is working, so I      think that we need to provide people with better jobs, with      better pay.       With the new computer technology there are a lot of jobs      predicted but I do not think most people who are poor are      properly educated to go in those sorts of fields.                               ____________________
