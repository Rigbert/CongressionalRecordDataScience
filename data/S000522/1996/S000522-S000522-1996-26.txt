Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of a Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary appropriations bill.  This bill provides $2.1 billion in funding for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. That is $30 million more than the administration requested. The funds for the INS in fact represent a 25-percent increase over last year, and they demonstrate Republicans' commitment to reducing illegal immigration.  H.R. 3814 provides the necessary funding to hire 1,100 new Border Patrol agents. The administration's request would only have funded 700 new Border Patrol agents. This bill also contains a significant funding increase for the detention and removal of illegal aliens, including 2,700 new detention beds. The administration's request would only have funded 700 detention beds. Funding is critical to the effective implementation of America's immigration policies.  I thank Chairman Rogers for the tireless efforts he has made to secure our borders.  There is another bill which passed the House in March of this year by a vote of 333 to 87 that also advances immigration reform. H.R. 2202, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, will soon go to conference with the Senate. It will benefit American families, taxpayers and workers by securing the borders, removing criminal and illegal aliens from the country, and ensuring that immigrants are self-reliant.  Mr. Chairman, the American people are demanding that we pass comprehensive immigration reform. I urge my colleagues to provide sufficient funding for border security by voting ``yes'' on this bill.
