 President, I rise today to introduce the Airport Security Personnel Protection Act. This legislation would expedite the naturalization process and authorize transitional employment for the many deserving airport security screeners who are in danger of losing their jobs as a result of a provision in the recently enacted Aviation Transaction Security Act.  In providing this assistance to these worthy individuals, the bill also will provide relief for the airports in which they work and the many customers whom they serve.  On November 19, 2001, President Bush signed the Aviation Transportation Security Act, P.L. 107-71, into law. The measure was passed with overwhelming support in both chambers. Among its many essential provisions was one, found in section 111(a) of the bill, that requires all airport security screeners to be United States citizens.  Some expressed disagreement with the citizenship requirement while the bill was pending but voted for the bill, nonetheless, because of the many positive and essential provisions that the bill contained. Others supported the citizenship requirement as a necessary step to ensure the safety of our aviation system.  Regardless of how Senators and House Members feel about the merits of the provision, we cannot help but be touched by one of its unfortunate consequences. Because of the contentious manner in which differing provisions in the House and Senate bills were resolved, we were unable to provide adequate transition provisions for the many well-qualified, hard-working, loyal, and deserving lawful permanent residents who are on the verge of attaining U.S. citizenship but who will not be able to complete that process before they lose their jobs.  My legislation would resolve their situation in two ways: First, it would require the Attorney General to expedite the naturalization process for those applicants who were employed as airport security screeners at the time of enactment of the Aviation Transportation Security Act.  Second, it would carve out a transition period during which qualified lawful permanent residents could continue their employment as security screeners while their naturalization applications are being adjudicated.  The ``Airport Security Personnel Protection Act'' would provide for a smoother transition for qualified lawful permanent resident airport security screeners who are on the verge of completing the naturalization process. In so doing, it also would preserve both the integrity of the naturalization process and the strong requirements for security screeners that are contained in the Aviation Transportation Security Act.  Section 4(c) of the legislation specifically precludes the weakening of standards for naturalization for these screeners. It makes it clear that the legislation merely requires the Attorney General to expedite the processing of the naturalization applications of qualified airport security screeners.  Under current law, these standards include such requirements as five years of lawful permanent residence for most of those naturalizing, a demonstration of good moral character, an understanding of the English language, and an understanding of the history, principles, and form of government of the United States.  The legislation also makes it clear that the Standards for continuing in employment during this transition period are to be the same, strong standards that are included in the recently enacted Aviation Transportation Security Act.  Under this bill, in order to continue in employment during the transitionperiod, an affected security screener would have to: be a lawful permanent resident alien; have been employed as a security screener on the date of enactment of the Act; meet the employment eligibility requirements under the Airport Security Screeners Act; have undergone and successfully completed an employment investigation (including a criminal history record check); have had a naturalization application pending on the date of enactment of the Act or, in the alternative, have to be within one year of being eligible to file an application for naturalization; and be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation for hiring or continued employment.  Just as importantly, in order to remain employed during this transition period, an alien would have to meet the new, enhanced requirements of security screeners that were enacted as part of the Aviation Transportation Security Act. These new, enhanced requirements provide that the alien would have to: have a satisfactory or better score on a Federal security screening personnel selection examination; demonstrate daily a fitness for duty without any impairment due to illegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, or alcohol; undergo an employment investigation, including a criminal history record check; not present a threat to national security; possess a high school diploma, a general equivalency diploma, or experience that the Under Secretary has determined to be sufficient for the individual to perform the duties of the position; possess the ability to efficiently and thoroughly manipulate and handle such baggage, containers, and other objects subject to security processing; be able to read, speak, and write English well enough to carry out written and oral instructions regarding the proper performance of screening duties; be able to read English language identification media, credentials, airline tickets, and labels on items normally encountered in the screening process; provide direction to and understand and answer questions from English-speaking individuals undergoing screening; and write incident reports and statements and log entries into security records in the English language; have satisfactorily completed all initial, recurrent, and appropriate specialized training required by the security program; among other requirements.  This simple but important bill would help the many deserving lawful permanent residents who are well qualified, have been performing their jobs admirably, and whose lives are in danger of being disrupted. But it also would help the traveling public.  It is estimated that at least 25 percent of the current 28,000 airport security screeners in the Nation's 419 commercial airports are noncitizens. I have heard from the mayor and airport director of the San Francisco International Airport. They came to me out of concern that, as a result of the new citizenship requirements under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, the airport stands to lose 70 to 80 percent of its screening personnel. In Los Angeles, about 40 percent of the baggage screeners are noncitizens.  Certainly, not all of these noncitizens will be able to meet the stringent requirements of this legislation. But to the extent that those who are well-qualified are permitted to continue their employment while their naturalization applications are being adjudicated, it will be a great help to the many airports in which they are employed.  I urge my colleagues to move expeditiously to enact this bill into law. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1829       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
