 President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Collins, to introduce legislation to repeal two provisions of current law that reduce earned Social Security benefits for teachers and other government pensioners--the Windfall Elimination, WEP, provision, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, provision.  Under current law, public employees, whose salaries are often lower than those in the private sector to begin with, find that they are penalized and held to a different standard when it comes to retirement benefits. The unfair reduction in their benefits makes it more difficult to recruit teachers, police officers, and fire fighters.  The Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social Security benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and also receive a government pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund. Private sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal to 90 percent of their first $561 in average monthly career earnings, plus 32 percent of monthly earnings up to $3,381 and 15 percent of earnings above $3,381. Government pensioners, however, are only allowed to receive 40 percent of the first $561 in career monthly earnings, a penalty of $280.50 per month.  To my mind it is simply unfair, especially at a time when we need to be doing all we can to attract qualified people to government service, and my legislation will allow government pensioners the chance to earn the same 90 percent to which non-government pension recipients are entitled.  The current Government Pension Offset provision reduces Social Security spousal benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the spouse's public employment civil service pension. This can have the effect of taking away, entirely, a spouse's benefits from Social Security.  It is beyond my understanding why we would want to discourage people from pursuing careers in public service by essentially saying that if you do enter public service, your family will suffer by not being able to receive the full retirement benefits they would otherwise be entitled to.  Record enrollments in public schools and the projected retirements of thousands of veteran teachers are driving an urgent need for teacher recruitment. Critical efforts to reduce class sizes also necessitate hiring additional teachers. It is estimated that schools will need to hire between 2.2 and 2.7 million new teachers nationwide by 2009.  California has 284,030 teachers currently, but will need to hire an additional 300,000 teachers by 2010 to keep up with California's rate of student enrollment, which is three times the national average. All in all, California has to hire 26,000 new teachers every year.  To combat the growing teacher shortage crisis, forty-five States and the District of Columbia now offer ``alternate routes'' for certification to teach in the Nation's public schools. It is a sad irony that policymakers are encouraging experienced people to change careers and enter the teaching profession at the same time that individuals who have worked in other careers are less likely to want to become teachers if doing so will affect Social Security benefits they worked so hard to earn.  Almost 300,000 government retirees nationwide are affected by the GPO and the WEP, but their impact is greatest in the 13 states that chose to keep their own public employee retirement systems, including California. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for some 200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year. The WEP causes already low-paid public employees outside the Social Security system, like teachers, firefighters and police officers, to lose up to sixty percent of the Social Security benefits to which they are entitled. Ironically, the loss of Social Security benefits may make these individuals eligible for more costly assistance, such as food stamps.  The reforms that led to the GPO and the WEP are almost 20 years old. At the time they were enacted, I'm sure they seemed like a good idea. Now that we are witnessing the practical effects of those reforms, I hope that Congress will pass legislation to address the unfair reduction of benefits that make it even more difficult to recruit and retain public employees.
