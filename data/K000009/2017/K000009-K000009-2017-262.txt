Speaker, I rise today in memoriam of Bernadette ``Bubbles'' Winhoven.  Bernadette passed away fourteen years ago on December 9. Her family dearly remembers her as a bright spirit that left this world too soon, fondly recalling how she encouraged and inspired everyone who came into contact with her. Bernadette inspired me to seek to become a Congresswoman. Our friendship dated back to elementary school at Little Flower Parish. She was the young student who loved ``twirly'' skirts. Bernadette's life should serve as a template for all of us. She was an exemplary citizen who simply wanted to improve the lives of those around her. The sense of community she created for those who knew her has continued to thrive in the years since her passing, and is certain to continue into the future, sustained by the friends and family she knew and loved.  I am confident that Bernadette's family and friends were deeply cherished and that she gave them the very best in life. Her role in their lives will forever be exemplary, guiding their decisions, inspiring kindness and good humor in all situations. She will continue to always be there to help, advise and to give to everyone she has crossed paths with.  In remembering Bernadette, I am reminded of the words by St. John Chrysostom: ``They whom we love and lost are no longer where they were before. They are now wherever we are.'' I know the family and friends of Bernadette feel her presence with them daily, and hope they find comfort in knowing she is with them during every milestone and small step in between. We offer her family our prayers and hope they continue to find comfort in their wonderful memories of ``Bubbles.''                          ____________________
