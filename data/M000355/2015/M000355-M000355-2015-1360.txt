 President, obviously the most sensitive political issue surrounding this is the currency issue. I want to make sure everybody has a clear understanding of where we are on that.  In committee a Senator stated: I explicitly did not offer the currency amendment to the TPA bill. We were told that it would not be a part--if it were a part of TPA, we all know it would kill it, the President wouldn't sign the bill. So my goal is not to use currency to kill the TPA bill and not to kill the TPA bill, it is to get currency passed. That is why we offered it to the Customs bill, a separate bill, on the strong view that no one disputed in committee--no one disputed this in committee--that we would get a vote separately--separately, I repeat--on the Customs bill on the floor and that it would come to the floor just like the other bills.  As for currency, in the committee they agreed they would deal with it on the Customs bill and not on TPA. And now our friends on the other side are trying to bunch it all together.  But look, we need to be clear. The currency issue on TPA is a killer. The President would veto the bill. It would defeat the bill. That is why in committee they sensibly reached the conclusion to deal with currency on the Customs bill. So I want to be clear about that. So when we get on the bill, everybody will understand the significance of that issue.
