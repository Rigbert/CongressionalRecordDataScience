Speaker, I am honored to stand before you and my colleagues today to recognize Deputy Mayor Geraldine Tousant. Geraldine has served the city of Gary for many years and for her efforts, she was honored at an event celebrating her 50 years of service to the city on Saturday, August 14, 2010, at the Gary City Hall. Her complete dedication and endless enthusiasm put forth toward her community have allowed her the opportunity to enrich the lives of countless people.  Geraldine was born in Ensley, Alabama, and moved to the city of Gary when she was three years old. She graduated from Gary Roosevelt High School in 1957, and soon after married the late Marshall Tousant. The couple was happily married for nearly 51 years. Geraldine has three children and is the proud grandmother of five. Amidst her time in office, Geraldine courageously battled breast cancer, and I am happy to report that she is a twenty-year cancer survivor.  Geraldine began her service to the city of Gary in 1960 at the age of twenty-one. She started out as a clerk-typist in the city's Department of Redevelopment. Working her way through the Department's ranks, Geraldine eventually became Director of the Department of Redevelopment. On February 14, 2003, Geraldine was recognized by former Mayor Scott King for her commitment to the people of Gary as he appointed her Deputy Mayor of the city of Gary.  Impressively, Geraldine has worked for seven mayors during her 50 years of service to the city: George Chacharis, my father John Visclosky, A. Martin Katz, Richard G. Hatcher, Thomas Barnes, Scott King, and current Mayor Rudy Clay. Throughout her many years of service, Geraldine has accomplished many impressive tasks, including handling the management and demolition of structures attained in other city agencies and computerizing the city's utility billings and payments.  Today, Geraldine is 71 years young and has no plans to retire anytime soon. Geraldine has said, ``I hope my 50 years with the city of Gary have been a role model for other employees.'' Without a doubt, she has been just that.  Mr. Speaker, Deputy Mayor Geraldine Tousant has always given her time and efforts selflessly and has truly been an inspiration to so many people throughout the years. We have all been enriched because of her lifetime commitment serving others, particularly those most in need. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Geraldine on her 50 years of service to the city of Gary.                          ____________________
