Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce, along with my colleague Representative Cardin, Representative Wolf, Representative Hoyer, Representative Lantos, Representative Wamp, Representative Slaughter, Representative Aderholt and Representative Hastings, this resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the sharp escalation of anti-Semitism, including violence, throughout the region of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, is of serious concern to the U.S. Congress and the American people. We should make a concerted effort in our respective countries to end this disturbing trend.  Anti-Semitism is a disease that has bedeviled previous generations of Jews throughout the centuries and formed a black spot on human history. As the 20th century witnessed the nadir of extreme violence against the Jewish community and their institutions, we must take extraordinary steps to ensure this plague does not infect the 21st century to contaminate future generations. Yet our work is cut out for us, as this past year Europe witnessed a profound increase in vandalism against Jewish cemeteries, synagogues and cultural property, as well as mob assaults, fire bombings and gunfire. This year already a Jewish rabbi was stabbed twice in his Paris synagogue by an assailant. Thankfully, he was released from the hospital the same day. Certainly our own country is not immune, as acts of vandalism and violence continue to sporadically occur. As these incidents made graphically clear, silence is not an option when we are witnesses to insensitivity and violence.  The Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair and on which Mr. Cardin serves has taken the lead in voicing concern and working for real change. On May 22, 2002, the Commission held a hearing to raise specific attention to the growing problem of anti-Semitic violence in the OSCE region. From that hearing a number of initiatives emerged. At the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Annual Session in Berlin last July, I introduced and successfully secured unanimous approval of a resolution denouncing anti-Semitism and calling for all OSCE governments to do more. Mr. Speaker, for the Record, I submit the text of the OSCE PA resolution.  In addition, the U.S. delegation co-sponsored an unprecedented special session with the German delegation to further discuss the alarming trend with our fellow parliamentarians. In December, the Commission co-hosted here in Washington a parliamentary forum on anti-Semitism with German parliamentarians, also attended by a prominent member of the Senate of Canada, Jerry Grafstein. At the conclusion of this event, myself and the German co-chair, Gert Weisskirchen, signed a letter of intent highlighting specific areas for further work and pledging to enlist the support of other parliamentarians from OSCE participating States. I have submitted a copy of the letter of intent, for the Record.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this resolution, and I am eager for the House to go on record in support, making sure both the Congress and our government are doing everything possible to see an end to thisscourge. I am especially pleased that the resolution calls for all OSCE participating States to ensure effective law enforcement and prosecution of individuals perpetrating anti-Semitic violence, as well as urging the parliaments of all participating States to take concrete legislative action at the national level. In sum, I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue our steadfast efforts to see an end to anti-Semitic violence.         Resolution on Anti-Semitic Violence in the OSCE Region       1. Recalling that the OSCE was among those organizations      which publicly achieved international condemnation of anti-     Semitism through the crafting of the 1990 Copenhagen      Concluding Document;       2. Noting that all participating States, as stated in the      Copenhagen Concluding Document, commit to ``unequivocally      condemn'' anti-Semitism and take effective measures to      protect individuals from anti-Semitic violence;       3. Remembering the 1996 Lisbon Concluding Document, which      highlights the OSCE's ``comprehensive approach'' to security,      calls for ``improvement in the implementation of all      commitments in the human dimension, in particular with      respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms'', and urges      participating States to address ``acute problems'', such as      anti-Semitism;       4. Reaffirming the 1999 Charter for European Security,      committing participating States to ``counter such threats to      security as violations of human rights and fundamental      freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience,      religion or belief and manifestations of intolerance,      aggressive nationalism, racism, chauvinism, xenophobia and      anti-Semitism'';       5. Recognizing that the scourge of anti-Semitism is not      unique to any one country, and calls for steadfast      perseverance by all participating States;       The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly:       6. Unequivocally condemns the alarming escalation of anti-     Semitic violence throughout the OSCE region;       7. Voices deep concern over the recent escalation in anti-     Semitic violence, as individuals of the Judaic faith and      Jewish cultural properties have suffered attacks in many OSCE      participating States;       8. Urges those States which undertake to return confiscated      properties to rightful owners, or to provide alternative      compensation to such owners, to ensure that their property      restitution and compensation programmes are implemented in a      nondiscriminatory manner and according to the rule of law;       9. Recognizes the commendable efforts of many post-     communist States to redress injustices inflicted by previous      regimes based on religious heritage, considering that the      interests of justice dictate that more work remains to be      done in this regard, particularly with regard to individual      and community property restitution compensation;       10. Recognizes the danger of anti-Semitic violence to      European security, especially in light of the trend of      increasing violence and attacks region wide;       11. Declares that violence against Jews and other      manifestations of intolerance will never be justified by      international developments or political issues, and that it      obstructs democracy, pluralism, and peace;       12. Urges all States to make public statements recognizing      violence against Jews and Jewish cultural properties as anti-     Semitic, as well as to issue strong, public declarations      condemning the depredations;       13. Calls upon participating States to ensure aggressive      law enforcement by local and national authorities, including      thorough investigation of anti-Semitic criminal acts,      apprehension of perpetrators, initiation of appropriate      criminal prosecutions and judicial proceedings;       14. Urges participating States to bolster the importance of      combating anti-Semitism by holding a follow-up seminar or      human dimension meeting that explores effective measures to      prevent anti-Semitism, and to ensure that their laws,      regulations, practices and policies conform with relevant      OSCE commitments on anti-Semitism; and       15. Encourages all delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly      to vocally and unconditionally condemn manifestations of      anti-Semitic violence in their respective countries and at      all regional and international forums.                            Letter of Intentan action program: confronting and combating anti-semitism in the osce                                  region       As members of the German Bundestag and U.S. Congress and      participants in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, we wish to      express our deep concern regarding the significant increase      in the number of anti-Semitic incidents in many countries of      the OSCE. We condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms. Anti-     Semitic bigotry must have no place in our democratic      societies and needs to be actively opposed by all 55      participating States of the OSCE, including by members of      Parliament. The sorry lessons of the past have demonstrated      that the virus of anti-Semitism, when not successfully      resisted, will lead to terrible tragedy for the Jewish      people, and promote prejudice and intolerance towards other      minority groups.       We affirm our commitment to work together closely to fight      anti-Semitism and encourage colleagues in our respective      legislatures, and in the legislative bodies of other OSCE      participating States, to develop a series of specific      measures to counter anti-Semitic actions and attitudes. In      executing our action plan we will make full use of all      appropriate OSCE institutions and instruments. Actions that      we intend to pursue are the following:       A. Persuade other Parliaments in OSCE participating States      to adopt resolutions condemning anti-Semitism as the U.S      Congress and the German Bundestag have already done.       B. Energize governments and other elected officials at all      levels in OSCE participating States to condemn forcefully and      publicly anti-Semitic acts, when they occur.       C. Encourage all OSCE countries to enact appropriate      criminal legislation to punish anti-Semitic acts and ensure      that such laws are vigorously enforced.       D. Call upon governments in OSCE participating States, if      they have not already done so, to adhere to international      instruments which, by addressing the problem of      discrimination, may counter anti-Semitic attitudes and      actions.       E. Promote educational efforts throughout the OSCE region      to counter anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among      younger people and help identify the necessary resources to      accomplish this goal. Encourage teachers, social workers and      members of the clergy to focus on anti-Semitic attitudes and      behavior of younger people and support the development of      curricula for teacher training.       F. Consider what concrete actions may be possible within      the OSCE to discourage the proliferation of anti-Semitic,      neo-Nazi and other racist material over the Internet, while      preserving the right to freedom of expression.       G. Encourage religious leaders in OSCE participating States      to work more closely together and consider the past      experiences of certain religious institutions in dealing with      the experience of the Holocaust.       H. Create an OSCE parliamentarian-based ``Coalition of the      Willing'' to address anti-Semitic propaganda that appears to      be increasing rapidly in a number of OSCE partner countries.      Explore the possibility of using the OSCE's partnership with      the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries for      promoting this goal. We pledge to meet again in conjunction      with the February 2003 Winter Session of the OSCE      Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna to evaluate progress and      seek the active support and cooperation of our parliamentary      colleagues from other countries. On this occasion, we will      also determine how we can best utilize the July 2003      Rotterdam Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly      to further our common goal of combating anti-Semitism      throughout the OSCE region.       Signed in Washington, D.C. on December 10, 2002.     Christopher H. Smith,       Member of Congress.     Gert Weisskirchen,       Member, German Bundestag.                          ____________________
