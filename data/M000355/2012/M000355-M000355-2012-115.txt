 President, I might say to my friend the majority leader before he leaves the floor that I listened carefully to his speech about what most Americans refer to as ObamaCare. Given the fact that our friends on the other side are going to focus on that bill this particular week, I think it might be a good idea to have a vote on it, on the pending bill.  It would be my intent to offer an amendment that I know my friend does not support, but nevertheless many Americans would like to know. Since we have spent a good deal of time positioning over the last few months on various and assorted issues, I think it would be appropriate to have a vote on the repeal of ObamaCare, and I hope to be able to offer that amendment during the pendency of the bill on cyber security, which we believe will be open to amendments. I wonder if my friend thinks that might be something both sides might agree would be a good idea.
