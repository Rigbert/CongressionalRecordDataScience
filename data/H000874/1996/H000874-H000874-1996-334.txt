Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work conducted by a very important and often forgotten office which serves Congress each and every day. The Government Printing Office [GPO] has seen vast changes in its 136 years of service to the Congress and was recently acknowledged for its ability to reach toward the future in the much respected trade publication In-Plant Graphics.  I would like to share this article with my colleagues and the public, as I believe it aptly captures the breadth of the work conducted by the GPO and addresses the great resource the GPO is to the Government. The Government Printing Office and the employees who do the work stand ready and prepared to deal with the challenges they face ahead, but more importantly, the GPO stands ready to meet its mission of doing the Government's printing in a timely and cost-effective manner.          GPO: Networked, Modernized, and Ready for the Future  (As the king of all in-plants, the 136-year-old Government Printing    Office is a slimmer, more modern version of its former self--but                         challenges still remain)                           (By Bob Neubauer)       As darkness wraps itself tightly around the nation's      capital, the keyboard operators at the Government Printing      Office (GPO) glance anxiously from their computer terminals      toward the U.S. Capitol dome, visible through their windows.       Atop the dome glows a light. When it's on, Congress is in      session. When Congress is in session, every detail of its      proceedings is being transcribed and delivered to the folks      in this room to be input into the Congressional Record      database.       When the light goes out, it means the end is in sight, and      soon their frenzied keyboarding will be over for another day.       Sometimes the light stays on for a long, long time. That's      the nature of life at the GPO. The 9-to-5 life is not part of      the deal. Long after the dome light goes dark and the Record      database has been compiled, prepress and press workers are      wide awake, hustling to convert this digital data to plates      and get the Record printed and delivered to Congress by 9      a.m.       And with the average Record comprising more than 200      pages--about the same amount of type as four to six      metropolitan daily newspapers--this is a daunting task      indeed.       The GPO has been handling congressional printing since      1860, after experiments with contract printing failed      miserably. Much has changed.       Today, under the leadership of Public Printer Michael      DiMario, up to 80 percent of the GPO's work is procured from      the private sector, leaving only complex, time- and security-     critical work like the Record to be printed at the GPO's      downtown Washington, D.C., headquarters.       With three buildings containing almost 35 acres of floor      space, the GPO is a massive operation. It generates $800      million a year and employs 3,830 people. In addition to      printing for Congress, the GPO also handles most executive      branch printing.                              A Heavy Load       Some examples of the GPO's workload are:       The Federal Register, a daily publication that contains      about 200 pages and has a press run of 23,000.       The U.S. Budget, which is produced under tight security and      updated up until the last minute.       Daily business calendars for the House of Representatives      and Senate. They are about 16 pages long at the beginning of      a session and more than 200 pages by the end.       The President's annual economic report, a 400-page      publication.       U.S. passports are also produced under tight security.       But with more than 10,000 copies required by 9 a.m. every      morning that Congress is in session--even when sessions      stretch through the night to the following day--the      Congressional Record takes top priority among the jobs      printed by the GPO.       The Record is also available online on the World Wide Web      (http://www.access.gpo.gov) within an hour from the time the      final page is sent to the pressroom. So far, users have      downloaded an average of 2 million documents per month from      58 databases, which include the Record, the Register and      other documents.       ``We're able to make electronic products available to      everyone,'' remarks DiMario. In addition to offering Web,      modem and telnet availability of documents, he says, the GPO      runs the Federal Depository Library program, making      government publications available through a network of 1,400      libraries across the country.       Most of the work that goes into the Record, acknowledges      Robert Schwenk, superintendent of the electronic      photocomposition division, involves generating the electronic      database. Tasks such as keyboarding, proofing, revising,      assembling and electronic composing make up about two thirds      of the cost of producing the Record.       Printing is done on a trio of new Rockwell web presses that      were designed especially for the GPO. They can robotically      handle all bundles and automatically strap them. When the      webs aren't being used for the Record, the Register is      keeping them busy.       There is always plenty of work to be done at the GPO to      keep the equipment in action, and priorities change      constantly throughout the day. Jobs are occasionally even      pulled off of presses so that more important ones can be      done.       ``The work has to be done to meet, first and foremost,      legislative, congressional priorities,'' notes GPO Staff      Assistant Andrew Sherman--even if that means wasting part of      a job and throwing the schedule off.       GPO employees, DiMario observes, have adapted well to this      environment and are a hard-working lot.       ``They really do believe they're doing important work to      serve the public,'' he says. ``They're very proud of the      products they produce.''       The GPO employs a vast assortment of digital and      traditional graphic arts technologies--an intriguing mix of      old and new. Hand binding and page-end marbling of some      books, along with hand-set type for gold stamping, contrast      sharply with the GPO's fiber-optic connections to Capitol      Hill, CD recorders and computers numbering into the      hundreds.       The GPO receives Senate proceedings via fiber-optic      transmission from Capitol Hill for up to half of the Senate      portion of the Record. Drafts of new legislation are received      digitally from the House and Senate Legislative Counsel's      office. About 80 percent of the Register is transmitted to      the GPO by laser beam from the Office of the Federal      Register.       ``We're a 20th-century agency moving into the 21st,''      comments DiMario. The GPO is constantly exploring alternate      methods of document dissemination, like CD-ROM and multi-     media, depending on the needs of customers.       ``We're attempting to be the multimedia producer of      government publications, and we're restructuring the agency      along those lines,'' DiMario continues. ``That does not      diminish the value of in-plant production of paper products,      although we recognize that in time that need is going to go      down.''                         the push to privatize       Though the GPO's high-tech capabilities may be impressive,      certain government factions, caught up in the privatization      fervor, see them as extravagant and are gunning to close the      GPO, calling it wasteful. They believe that government      printing should be contracted out to the private sector,      supposedly saving the government millions.       It's not that easy, Sherman cautions.       ``We have expressed skepticism that a similar capability      exists in the private sector,'' he notes.       First of all, the GPO already outsources up to 80 percent      of its printing. What is retained could not easily be handled      by an outside supplier. Producing the Record, for example--     with page counts fluctuating from 10 to a record 1,912 pages,      and source material arriving in many different forms,      including handwritten notes--by 9 a.m. every day, would be      a challenge for even the largest printer.       The GPO is staffed to handle those heavy workloads but has      enough other work, such as bills or hearings, to keep      employees busy when the Record is smaller. Could a private      printer keep a sizable staff on hand just to be prepared for      the busy times?       If the Record were contracted out, the printer would also      be responsible for converting the data and making it      available on the Web each day. And with so much data coming      in from Congress via fiber-optic connections, private sector      printers would have to equip themselves with the same      technologies and be provided with access to Congress'      network.       In fact, with so much sharing of information between the      Record and various bills, reports and other government      databases, private contractors would require access to      numerous currently secure government networks. The security      of other documents, such as the Budget of the United States      and the President's annual Economic Report, would also be put      to a test.       Sherman points out that the GPO has already been busy      scrutinizing itself and cutting back on printing to save      money. Between 10,000 and 12,000 copies of the Record are now      being produced, compared with 18,000 a year ago. Many GPO      regional plants have been or are about to be closed. Since      February 1993 the GPO has slashed its work force by about 900      positions, saving $45 million annually.                      Service still takes priority       Though the GPO continues to be a target of well-meaning      legislators, Sherman stresses that the organization's main      interest is serving the public, not merely fighting for      survival.       ``Our job is to help everyone perform the mission of      getting printing requirements performed as cost      effectively and in as timely a manner as possible--and      granting public access,'' he notes. ``If people have got      ways to do that mission better, we want to cooperate with      them.       ``In some cases legislation is offered without a great deal      of research being put into what the possible consequences      will be,'' he continues. ``Our job is to point out those      consequences.''       Sherman advises government in-plant managers who are facing      similar scrutiny to be open and cooperative with their      challengers. Make sure to be recognized as a knowledgeable      printing authority, not merely a scared manager fighting for      his or her job. Carefully analyze all proposals.       ``If something looks good and looks like it's going to      work, than get behind it,'' he advises. On the other hand, if      the proposal is flawed, ``don't be afraid to characterize the      effects as you really see them.'' Still, he adds, be prepared      to make changes that may seem painful at first, but that may      prove smart later on.       In addition to challenges from pro-privatization forces,      the GPO faces other possible roadblocks. A Justice Department      opinion released in May said that the GPO's printing of      executive branch documents is unconstitutional. Yet the      public printer, head of the GPO, is appointed by the      President, chief of the executive branch. And an April White      House memo directed executive departments and agencies to      ``make maximum use of the capabilities and expertise of the      Government Printing Office in handling your agency's printing      and duplicating procurements.'' The effects of the Justice      Department's opinion are still unclear.       So for the time being, the work is still flowing in,      keeping the GPO's presses and other equipment in high gear.       And as long as that light in the Capitol dome keeps shining      and Congress keeps meeting, Sherman and his coworkers intend      to throw themselves full-force into the task of getting the      government's printing done on time and as inexpensively as      possible.                          ____________________
