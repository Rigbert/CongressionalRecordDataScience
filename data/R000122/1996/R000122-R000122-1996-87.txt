Speaker, I rise today to salute a distinguished group of young men from Rhode Island who have attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. The young men recognized for their noteworthy achievement include: Dennis L. Arnold, Steven Bailey, John James Joseph Banks, J. Nicholas Betley, Roger Alan Bonin, Brian T. Breguet, Benjamin T. Brillat, Jeremy S. Brown, James Adrian Butler, Benjamin Caito, Frank Caliri, Christopher J. Cardillo, Christopher J. Cawley, Joseph A. Chappelle, Kenneth C. Collins, Edward A. Darragh, Frank A. Denette IV, Christopher Joseph DiMase, Daniel J. Dorson, Erik Fields, Todd Michael Fisher, Vincent A. Fusaro, Michael Alfred Henry, Michael J. Hogan, Scott E. Hopkins, Vincenzo R. Iacobucci, Douglas Everett Jameson, Peter Eli Jetty, Michael R. Kachanis, Kevin A. Kazlauskas, Kurt J. Kazlauskas, Patrick Keenan, Brian Lafaille, David W. Lowell, Christopher Mark Lundsten, Frederick William Lumb, Luke A. Magnus, Anthony Mangiarelli, Nicholas Marsella, Andrew Paul McGuirl, Steven Barry Mendall Jr., Nathan E. Moreau, Eric Oldford, Keith E. Piehler, John H. Potvin, Andrew Qualls, Kent D. Rutter, Kevin Schwendiman, Mark N. Schwendiman, Craig E. Scorpio, Colin M. Segovis, Guy Scott Shaffer, Kevin A. Silva, Jeremy P. Skaling, James M.R. Sloan, Stanley Sosnowski, Jason E. Soules, Russell Wallis, Jonathan Watterson, Aaron Michael Wilbur, Robert Allen Wilcox, Mark S. Wong, and Rory W. Wood.  Not every young American who joins the Boy Scouts earns the prestigious Eagle Scout Award. In fact, only 2.5 percent of all Boy Scouts receive this honor. To earn the award, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of leadership, service, and outdoor skills. He must earn 21 merit badges, 11 of which must be from areas such as citizenship in the community, citizenship in the Nation, citizenship in the world, safety, environmental science, and first aid.  As he progresses through the Boy Scout ranks, a Scout must participate in increasingly more responsible service projects. He must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more specific youth leadership positions in his patrol and/or troop. The young men now earning the rank of Eagle Scout have distinguished themselves in accordance with these criteria.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting thee Eagle Scouts. In turn, we must duly recognize the Boy Scouts of America for establishing the Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous criteria its aspirants must meet. Through its 85 years, this program has honed and enhanced the leadership skills and commitment to public service of many outstanding Americans.  It is my sincere belief that these young men will continue their public service, and, in so doing, will further distinguish themselves and better their communities.                          ____________________
