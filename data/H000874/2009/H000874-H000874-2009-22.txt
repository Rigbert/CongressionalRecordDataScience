I see the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my friend, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who has worked very hard on this as well with Mr. Berman. I'm pleased this is coming. It's very important that we send a very strong message as we see the Iranian Government and the President say they are going to do one thing, but apparently never do it. So I think it's appropriate that we act.
