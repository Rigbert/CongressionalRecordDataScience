President, it is my pleasure to cosponsor legislation to name a Federal courthouse in my State after a fine soldier, lawyer, and judge, U.S. District Judge James Anthony Redden. This legislation would name the Federal courthouse in Medford, OR, the ``James A. Redden Federal Courthouse.''  Judge Redden has made public service the centerpiece of his life. He served his country in the U.S. Army from 1946 to 1948. He honed his legal skills practicing law from 1956 to 1972 in Medford, OR. He then left his private practice to serve the people of Oregon as the Oregon State treasurer in 1973 and as the Oregon attorney general in 1977. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the position of U.S. District Judge.  For 20 years, Judge Redden practiced law in the courthouse that Senator Hatfield and I propose to rename today. Judge Redden and Senator Hatfield have worked together over the years to renovate this courthouse, and now I, as a Member of the Senate, am pleased to join in the effort to rename this courthouse after Judge Redden, a great Oregonian and a great American.                                 ______      By
