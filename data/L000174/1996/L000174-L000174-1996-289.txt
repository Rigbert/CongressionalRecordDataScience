President, today, more than half our population faces discrimination every day. Hard to believe, but it is true.  Women currently earn, on average, 28 percent less than men. That means for every dollar a man earns, a woman earns only 72 cents. Over a lifetime, the average woman will earn $420,000 less than the average man based solely on her sex. This is unacceptable. We must correct this gross inequity, and we must correct it now.  How is this possible with our Federal laws prohibiting discrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to protect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid fairly for an honest day's work.  Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women and minorities, which continues to fester like a cancer in workplaces across the country. The Fair Pay Act of 1996 would close this legal loophole by prohibiting discrimination based on wages.  I do not pretend that this act will solve all the problems that women and minorities face in the workplace. It is, however, an essential piece of the puzzle.  Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult to combat. And it does not stand alone as an issue that women and minorities face in the workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the problem of unequal opportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if we fail to provide the opportunity for women and minorities, regardless of their merit, to reach higher paying positions.  The Government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and perceptions of individuals or private businesses in hiring and advancing women and minorities, but it can set an example. Certainly, President Clinton has shown great leadership by appointing an unprecedented number of women to his administration. Earlier this week, the Department of Defense, the Nation's largest employer of women, reached a milestone when President Clinton appointed the first female three-star general, Maj. Gen. Carol Mutter of the U.S. Marine Corps. I share her sentiment when she said she could not wait until there were no more firsts for women. The Government has a long way to go, however, since General Mutter will be the lone woman out of more than 100 three-star officers.  The private sector also has a long way to go to provide equal opportunity. The report released by the Glass Ceiling Commission last year found that 95 percent of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 industrial and Fortune 500 companies are white males. The Glass Ceiling Commission also found that when there are women and minorities in high places, their compensation is lower than white males in similar positions. This wage inequality is the issue we seek to address today.  In the next decade, the changing nature of the workplace--women and minority men will make up 62 percent of the work force by the year 2005--will force businesses to look at the larger pool of qualified Americans to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. As this change occurs, we must demand fair pay for equal work.  For the first time in our country's long history, this bill outlaws discrimination in wages paid to employees in equivalent jobs solely on the basis of a worker's sex, race, or national origin. I say it is about time. I commend Senator Harkin for introducing the Fair Pay Act, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it.  The Fair Pay Act would remedy gender and race wage gaps under a balanced approach that takes advantage of the employment expertise of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], while providing flexibility to small employers . In addition, it would safeguard legitimate wage differences caused by a seniority or merit pay system. And the legislation directs the EEOC to provide educational materials and technical assistance to help employers design fair pay policies.  It is a basic issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of equal value. The Fair Pay Act makes it possible for women and minorities to finally achieve this fundamental fairness. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______      By
