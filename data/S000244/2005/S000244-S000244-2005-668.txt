Chairman, this amendment makes technical changes to section 503 of the bill relating to access to Federal crime information databases by child welfare agencies.  The amendment requires fingerprint-based checks when conducting background checks for a limited purpose, to verify that a prospective adoptive or foster parent does not have a criminal record.  Before we allow foster or adoptive parents to take children into their homes, we must ensure that these applicants do not have prior convictions, let alone prior sex offense convictions. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).  The amendment was agreed to.          Amendment No. 31 Offered by Ms. Jackson-Lee of Texas
