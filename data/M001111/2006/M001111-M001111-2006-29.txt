 President, it doesn't have to be this way. Rather than spending the month of July and September debating bills for political reasons, we could have been debating these appropriations bills that are critically needed for the Nation's safety and security. We could have been fighting for the people we represent. We could have been meeting their basic needs, protecting their livelihoods, and ensuring their safety. But our leadership said no, and now our families are paying a price.  I think the Senate deserves better, but more importantly, the people we represent deserve better.  I yield the floor.
