Speaker, I know that Mary Frances very much appreciates the words of Leader Pelosi. I know that the leader is absolutely correct: we are not sending her. She is going.  But I want to tell the leader and tell this House that I talked to Senator Carper, who is the chairman of the committee, and I said: Tom, I will not stand in the schoolhouse door, if you will, and not let her out of our office; but you must pledge that she will be available for our calls and for our questions on a regular basis.  Madam Leader, he assures me that that is the case. I thank the gentlewoman for the comments.  Mr. Speaker, our loss, though, is the Senate's gain. I have no doubt that Mary Frances will bring her talents, her wisdom, and her Michigan-bred can-do attitude to the important work the committee will undertake this Congress and in the years ahead.  I hope all of my colleagues and, indeed, the American people we serve will join me in thanking Mary Frances Repko for her contributions to the work of this House and to the service she has given to our country during her time as a member of the staff of the Senate and the House.  I hope you will all join me in wishing her great success in her new position, in which I can assure you she will not be a stranger to us in the House, but a crucial liaison to the work of the Environment and Public Works Committee just across the hall.  Thank you, Mary Frances. Thank you for a job well done and for your service and wise counsel.                            ____________________
