Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3214 would amend the Federal charter for the American Veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam to American Veterans to more accurately reflect the membership of AMVETS. AMVETS membership now includes not only veterans from those three wars, but also anyone who served honorably after 1940, and the National Guardsmen and Reservists.  At the AMVETS annual convention in 1998, the delegates voted for an official name change from American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to American Veterans to more accurately reflect the membership. Additionally, AMVETS has voted to change the structure of their governing body. This bill contains language to reflect the structure change in the statute.  Finally, because AMVETS has moved the location of their headquarters from the District of Columbia to Lanham, Maryland, the ``Headquarters and principal place of business'' section of their charter needs to be changed to indicate that they are now located in Maryland. In order for these changes to be recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the AMVETS Federal charter must be amended, and this bill does that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass H.R. 3214, and I reserve the balance of my time.
