 President, we are just awaiting the modification language on Senator Brown's amendment 1229. As soon as we have that and have a chance to look at it, it will be sent to the desk. We will ask that it be considered and we will accept that as well.  We will also accept in a moment, I believe, Senator Shelby's amendment relating to fertilizer research, amendment No. 1230.  Now that we have interrupted the Senator from Connecticut 12 times--but we are making progress here; we are accepting important amendments--I will at the end of the comments by my friend from Connecticut urge we accept additional amendments.
