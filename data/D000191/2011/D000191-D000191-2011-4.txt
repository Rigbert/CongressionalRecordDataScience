  Mr. DeFAZIO. I agree, let's do something meaningful to put America back to work. Let's put millions to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.  The Speaker promised us we'd do that this month, the Republicans would bring a surface transportation bill to the House, and they said no, can't figure out how to pay for it. It's more important to continue tax cuts for the rich.  Now, with millions unemployed, can't find jobs, the Republicans want to jerk their lifeline. They want to kill off extended unemployment benefits. To do what? Preserve tax cuts for the rich, the job creators. Ah, they're doing a heck of a job creating jobs, aren't they?  This is the discredited theory of trickle-down economics. America's unemployed are being trickled on, and it stinks.                          ____________________
