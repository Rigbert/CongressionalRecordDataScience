President, I rise to introduce the Gun Show Background Check Act of 2001. Along with twenty of my colleagues, I am offering this legislation to renew the process of bringing some sense to our nation's gun laws by closing a loophole that has allowed criminals to buy firearms at gun shows for far too long.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reported to Congress last year that gun shows are a major gun trafficking channel responsible for more than 26,000 illegal firearms sales during an 18-month period. The FBI and ATF tell us again and again that convicted felons, domestic abusers, and other prohibited purchasers are taking advantage of the gun show loophole to acquire firearms.  Two years ago, after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people at Columbine High School with weapons purchased from a private seller at a gun show, the United States Senate passed the Lautenberg amendment to close the gun show loophole. The legislation I am introducing today is identical to that Senate-passed amendment.  Under federal law, Federal Firearms Licensees are required to maintain careful records of their sales, and under the Brady Act, to check a purchaser's background with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System before transferring any firearm. However, a person does not need a federal firearms license, and the Brady Act does not apply, if the person is not ``engaged in the business'' of selling firearms pursuant to federal law. These nonlicensees make up one quarter or more of the sellers of firearms at thousands of gun shows in America each year. Consequently, felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchases buy firearms at gun shows.  My legislation incorporates recommendations made by the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury in their 1999 report on gun shows. The legislation would take several steps to make gun show transactions safer for all Americans:  Definition of gun shows: Gun shows are defined to include any event at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited for sale. This definition includes not only those events where firearms are the main commodity sold, but also other events where a significant number of guns are sold, such as flea markets or swap meets.  Gun show promoters: Gun show promoters would be required to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, maintain a list of vendors at all gun shows, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge receipt of information about their legal obligations.  Background checks for all transactions: The bill requires that all firearms sales at gun shows go through a Federal Firearms Licensee. If a nonlicensed person is selling a weapon, they would use an FFL at the gun show to complete the transaction. The FFL would be responsible for conducting a Brady check on the purchaser and maintaining records of the transactions.  Improved firearm tracing: FFLs would be required to submit information necessary to trace all firearms transferred at gun shows to the ATF's National Tracing Center, including the manufacturer/importer, model, and serial number of the firearms. However, no personal information about either the seller or the purchaser would be given to the government. Instead, as under current law, FFLs would maintain this information in their files. The NTC would request this information from an FFL only in the event that a firearm subsequently becomes the subject of a law enforcement trace request.  Some will say that this legislation is an attempt to end gun shows, but the experience of states that have closed the gun show loophole proves otherwise. California, for example, requires not only background checks at gun shows but a 10-day waiting period for all gun sales, yet gun shows continue to thrive there. No, we're not trying to end gun shows. What we are trying to end is the free pass we're giving to convicted felons when they can walk into a gun show, find a private dealer, buy whatever weapons they want and walk out without a Brady background check.  In overwhelming numbers, the American people believe that background checks should be required for all gun show sales. The people of Colorado and Oregon confirmed this last fall when they approved ballot initiatives to close the gun show loophole. I urge my colleagues to support the Gun Show Background Check Act of 2001 so that we can finally close this loophole in every state and make sure that convicted felons, domestic abusers, and other prohibited persons do not use gun shows to purchase firearms without a Brady background check.                                 ______                                       By
