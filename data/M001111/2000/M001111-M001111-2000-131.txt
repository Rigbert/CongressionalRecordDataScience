 One will be on the class size amendment. First, the Senator from Arkansas mentioned in his remarks the WestEd Policy Briefing and spoke eloquently about the challenges, but he failed to talk about the tremendous benefits that were also in the report, including achievement gains and greater individual attention. The list goes on.  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire study printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Policy Brief                     great hopes, great challenges       Numerous states have enacted or are considering measures to      reduce class size. Additionally, as part of a seven-year      program to ensure an average class size of 18 for grades one      through three, the federal government has committed more than      $2.5 billion to a national class size reduction (CSR)      initiative. These efforts stem from research findings on      CSR's achievement benefits, as well as from its enormous      popularity with parents, administrators, and teachers.       However, not all efforts have proven equally successful. In      designing CSR programs, careful assessment of specific state      circumstances should help states adopting or modifying CSR      efforts avoid the unintended consequences that some programs      have experienced and ensure greatest benefit from what is      usually a considerable financial investment.                                Benefits       Research in the primary grades shows that as class size      shrinks, opportunities grow. Successful implementation of CSR      has led to numerous benefits, which appear to last into the      high school years, including:       Achievement gains, especially for poor and minority      students.       Greater individual attention and teacher knowledge of each      student's progress.       Improved identification of special needs, allowing earlier      intervention and less need later for remediation.       Fewer classroom discipline disruptions.       Faster and more in-depth coverage of content; more student-     centered classroom strategies, such as special-interest      learning centers; more enrichment activities.       Greater teacher-parent contact and parent satisfaction.       Reduced classroom stress and greater enjoyment of teaching.                               Challenges       Challenges for policy design arise in three major areas:                  Teaching supply and teacher quality       A fundamental condition for the success of CSR is good      teaching. CSR can exacerbate teaching shortages and lead to      the hiring of underqualified teachers. In California, for      example, since the implementation of the state's CSR program,      the percentage of teachers without full credentials has      jumped from 1% to over 12%, while the proportion of teachers      with three or fewer years of experience rose by 9% and the      proportion of teachers who had the least education, a      bachelor's or no degree, increased by nearly 6% statewide.                               Facilities       Inadequate facilities can impede schools' ability to      implement CSR and/or compromise CSR's benefits. Whole schools      or programs may also suffer if, for example, libraries, music      rooms, special education rooms, or computer rooms are      converted into classrooms, as has happened in some places.      Many space-strapped schools have combined two ``smaller''      classes into one large one with two teachers. Wisconsin      reports positive results from such team teaching; in Nevada,      however, concern exists that team teaching has compromised      CSR's success.                                 Equity       CSR policies can inadvertently worsen inequities. In      California, for example, a one-size-fits-all allotment per      student and a rigid 20:1 cap on class size led to uneven      implementation. Early evaluation findings support the concern      that the very students who stand to benefit most from CSR--     poor and minority students--are least likely to have full      opportunity to do so. Schools serving high concentrations of      low-income, minority, and English language learner (ELL)      students implemented more slowly due to lack of facilities.      These same schools have the hardest time attracting prepared,      experienced teachers and, thus, suffered a far greater      decline in teacher qualifications than other schools.      Finally, for many of these schools, the cost of creating      smaller classes exceeded their CSR revenues, and to make up      the deficit they diverted resources from other activities.                            Recommendations       Crafting a successful CSR program is no simple matter. As      knowledge from state and local experience continues to      evolve, lessons are emerging that suggest important design      elements for policymakers to consider, including:                               Targeting       Since research shows that children in the primary grades      and, especially, poor and minority children benefit most from      smaller classes, it makes sense to direct CSR monies toward      these children. Such targeting can also offset some of the      difficulties inner-city and poor, rural schools face in      attracting well qualified teachers and finding sufficient      classroom space.                            Teacher support       Schools will need to hire a number of new and, possibly      inexperienced teachers to enact CSR policies. If the teachers      are unprepared, resources for support, such as mentorship and      training programs, will need to be considered. Research,      experience, and a policy climate of higher expectations also      suggest that novices and veterans alike will need support to      learn new teaching strategies that capitalize on the      opportunities smaller classes present.                            Facility support       CSR initiatives require adequate facilities. If facility      issues are not attended to at all levels, expensive      investments in smaller classes are likely to be compromised.                              Flexibility       CSR policies that allow flexibility in the use of funds      help keep the focus on improving learning, teaching, and      student achievement. In exchange for accountability,      policymakers may consider options that allow schools and      districts latitude to tailor decisions to the needs of their      own circumstances and students--for example, allowing a      class-size average rather than mandating a cap or encouraging      creative scheduling.                           Program evaluation       CSR programs should build in evaluation and research      components, particularly focused on unanswered questions,      such as the outcomes of creative approaches to CSR.
