 For more than 37 years, Linda Yu has reported the news in Chicago and set a high bar for those who follow. Linda is one of the special ones. She has an outstanding ability to connect with her viewers, which has ingratiated her to Chicagoans. A viewer once told her that ``when things go wrong, you make me feel safe.'' That's what Linda Yu means to Chicago. She is a comfort to a city during difficult times and a trusted voice. Linda is the consummate professional, class act, and trailblazer. As the first Asian American to anchor a news broadcast in Chicago, Linda has become a role model for children aspiring to the newsroom, regardless of race or gender. That is quite a legacy.  Linda's story is a uniquely American story. Born in Xian, China, Linda moved to Hong Kong with her family when she was only 2 years old. Three years later, they immigrated to the United States, living in Pennsylvania and Indiana, before settling in California. In 1968, Linda Yu graduated from the University of Southern California with a bachelor of arts in journalism. Shortly after, she began her career at the ABC-owned affiliates KTLA-TV and KABC-TV in Los Angeles, before moving to what became her home away from home, Chicago, IL. In 1979, Linda joined Chicago's WMAQ-TV. Five years later, she joined ABC 7's 4 p.m. newscast. And for the next 32 years, it was the No. 1 newscast. How is that for a winning streak?  Among her accolades, Linda Yu earned five Chicago Emmy Awards. Her first came in 1981, for a special newscast on the assassination attempt on President Reagan. One year later, Linda received her second Emmy for her report and coverage of a construction accident in Chicago's downtown loop. In 2005, Linda was honored by the Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences with the prestigious Silver Circle, honoring her for 25 years of outstanding contributions to Chicago broadcasting. Linda also received the National Gold Medal from the National Conference of Community and Justice for her documentary ``The Scars of Belfast.''  Linda Yu has had an amazing career and is an extraordinarily accomplished professional. In her spare time, she volunteers at the Chinese American Service League, the March of Dimes, Asian Human Services and Juvenile Protective Association. She also cofounded the Chicago Chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association. But her proudest accomplishment is her family. The mother of a daughter, Francesca, and a son, Bryan, Linda now plans on spending more time with them and writing her next book. Her first book, a memoir, ``Living and Working in America, 15 lessons,'' published in Chinese, is a guide to helpyoung Chinese woman in the global workplace. Her next book will focus on stories of prominent Asian woman entrepreneurs and political and cultural leaders in America.  When Linda broke the news to her colleagues that she was ``moving on'' from ABC 7, she made sure not to use the word ``retire'' because she couldn't imagine retirement. So let me be clear, this is not the final chapter for Linda Yu. She will continue to write and be a role model for her community and countless young women around the world.  I want to congratulate Linda Yu on her distinguished career and thank her for giving so much to the people of Chicago. She will truly be missed. I wish Linda and her family all the best.                          ____________________
