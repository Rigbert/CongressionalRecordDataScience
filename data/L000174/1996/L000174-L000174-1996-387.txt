President, obviously my concern is, as I stated, that I do not want to see a major change in the multiple-use Forest Service law on an amendment within a forum of this nature. I would also say to the Senator from Colorado, this is a matter that I first heard of I think about 11:30 last night. I know he is aware of that. I think most of us heard of this amendment at about 11:30 last night.  As you know, I have been fairly active in the negotiations on the bill. This was not the first item that I was looking at. It is going to be some time before we actually have a vote. It will be after 11 o'clock, in any event. Between now and then, I will meet with the Senator from Colorado. We will discuss it further.
