President, I will hopefully not even need the full hour, and we will be able to go ahead and have the cloture vote. I believe Senator Gregg is going to be managing on the Republican side once he gets here. Hopefully, it will be possible to just yield back all of our time before the end of the hour and go to a vote. I will yield in just about 3 minutes to Senator Murray from Washington State for 10 minutes.
