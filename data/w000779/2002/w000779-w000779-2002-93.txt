Robert L. Tunstall of Oregon has spent a lifetime in service to his fellow Americans--as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps, as a U.S. postal worker, and as a dedicated representative of his many colleagues in the Postal Service.  In November 1998, Mr. Tunstall was elected to the third-highest office of the American Postal Workers Union AFL-CIO, becoming the organization's secretary-treasurer. Prior to that election, Mr. Tunstall was twice chosen as director of the union's clerk division, serving from 1992 to 1998.  Mr. Tunstall's illustrious service record with the APWU spans more than three decades. He became president of the Portland, OR local in 1974 and served until 1976. He followed that service as a national representative from 1976-1978, national vice-president for the Seattle region from 1978-1985, and as assistant clerk division director from 1985 until 1992. Mr. Tunstall also represented APWU members as a member of the rank and file bargaining advisory committee in 1975 and as chairman of the appeals committee in 1982.  Mr. Tunstall's employment with the U.S. Postal Service began nearly 40 years ago. In 1963, after completing four years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Mr. Tunstall was hired as a distribution clerk. He went on to hold numerous positions, including stamp supply clerk, bulk mail clerk, postage due clerk, box section clerk and pouch rack clerk.  Mr. Tunstall was born in Sioux Falls, SD, but raised and educated in Portland, OR. After graduating from Portland's Jefferson High School, he attended Multnomah Junior College, where he made the dean's list in 1967; he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Portland State University in 1969. Later, in 1977, Mr. Tunstall earned a law degree at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College. Mr. Tunstall has taught at the Labor Education Research Center of the University of Oregon.  In addition to a career of honorable service, Robert Tunstall has built a fine family as well. He is married to Rae Ann; they have a son, Brett, a daughter, Brooke, and a grandson, Matthew Martinez. I am proud to honor this fellow Oregonian today and I hope that Oregon and the nation benefit from many more years of his public service.                          ____________________
