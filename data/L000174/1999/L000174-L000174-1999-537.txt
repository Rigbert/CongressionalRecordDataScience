President, I commend the Senior Senator from West Virginia for his dedication to enforcing state liquor laws. But I must disagree with his approach. The Byrd amendment would permit the enforcement of state liquor laws in Federal court. This expansion of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is not warranted and raises constitutional problems because one state may impose its laws on the citizens of another state under this amendment.  In the Judiciary Committee, we recently held a hearing on this issue of direct sales of alcohol products over the Internet and via mail order. In our hearing, several expert witnesses raised questions about a similar bill by Senator Hatch, S. 577. I would like to work with Senator Byrd, Senator Hatch and others on the Judiciary Committee to see if we can refine this legislation to make sure it will pass constitutional muster. I have my doubts about constitutionality of the language before us today and will have to vote against the Byrd amendment as currently drafted.  If the full Senate is to pass an amendment today on the interstate shipment of alcohol, I believe the amendment by Senator Feinstein is a more targeted and sounder approach.  Her amendment would require clear labeling of alcoholic beverages shipped interstate and require the signature of an adult upon delivery of the alcoholic beverages.  The Feinstein amendment does not raise constitutional issues and is targeted at preventing any underage purchase of alcoholic beverages over the Internet or through other direct sales.  I will vote against the Byrd amendment and for the Feinstein amendment, because I believe that hers is constitutionally far more acceptable but also hits the problem far better.
