'  We are having this bill held up, but we are turning on our televisions at night, as I saw last night, to see this gripping scene that no father or mother could stand to watch for more than a few seconds of a child lying on the dirt in one of these refugee camps, this Afghan family that fled their country because of their fear of the Taliban and fear of the war. This little child was literally lying there, swathed in blankets and rags, listless and clearly sick, with flies all over her face, and her father trying to swat them away saying: I have nothing to give her. I have no money to buy medicine, nothing.  We see these scenes at night and it tears at our hearts because our war is not against the Afghan people. It is against the terrorists and the Taliban that harbors them. Yet when the President brings us a bill to do something to help those people, the Democrats stand with him and want to call the bill, while the Republicans, his own party, turn their backs on him in what has been described as the most massive humanitarian crisis anywhere.  To say that is a battle worth fighting for, these poor, defenseless, dying people, so the Judiciary Committee could turn out a few more judges to the satisfaction of some of the Senate Republicans, I do not think can be defended.
