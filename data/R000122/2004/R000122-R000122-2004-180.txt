President, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. At a time when this country is faced with extraordinary problems--with economic problems, international problems--we are devoting very precious time to legislation that is in behalf of a special interest rather than dealing with the broader public interest, the economy of this country and the international position and status of this country.  This is not legislation that is designed to protect the courts. This is legislation that is designed to protect gun dealers, the gun industry, manufacturers, and trade associations such as the National Rifle Association. To suggest this is simply a response to politically motivated cases flies in the face of cases that have been filed, like the cases of the victims of the sniper shootings here in Washington, DC; people like Bernice Johnson, whose husband was sitting on a bus reading his paper waiting to go on and run his route that day and was killed. It subsequently turns out the weapon that was used in this crime came from a dealer in Washington State who apparently couldn't account for 238 weapons. Mrs. Johnson is not suing to make a political point. She is suing simply because she lost her husband, the father of her children, and she would like to hold responsible those people who were negligent.
