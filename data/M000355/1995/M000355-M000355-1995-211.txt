 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Red Bartlett, a resident of Newport, KY, a man who has dedicated 50 years of his life  to  the  people  in  his  community, especially  the children.  Mr. Bartlett is  marking  his  50th  year  of service to knothole  baseball  in  Campbell County. In addition to this commitment, Red has carried the children of Campbell County through many other programs.  It seems strange to refer to him as Mr. Bartlett. For thousands of northern Kentuckians know him--friend and stranger alike--simply as Red.  Red served as knothole supervisor for all of Campbell County beginning in 1949. Currently supervisor of knothole District 22, he will work with his replacement right up to the end of next year. Although he will soon retire, his memory will live on in the hearts of the countless number of children to whom he was coach, role model, and friend.  Red grew up in an orphanage and has spent his life enriching his community by providing a fun, safe, and accessible recreational outlet for children. He was honored by the Northern Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame and recently by the Greater Cincinnati Knothole Hall of Fame for his extensive commitment to athletic supervision. He has worked as the Newport city recreation director and as the Newport Central Catholic High School tennis coach.  Red organized Youth, Inc. Boys Club. That organization ran the junior olympics program in northern Kentucky, a youth basketball league, and was instrumental in establishing the Pee-Wee football league in Campbell County.  Mr. President, a little more than 4 years ago, Red reorganized the all-stars games to recognize knothole players of northern Kentucky. The proceeds benefit the family nurturing center child abuse prevention programs and local food pantries. He organized the games and made sure each young star received an engraved trophy.  Red believed each child should have a chance to build character and confidence on the athletic field. He provided a channel, gave positive recognition, and taught self-esteem.  Mr. President, I would like to close now with a thought expressed in a recent editorial by the Kentucky Post. The Post wrote, ``No one hands out hero's medals to men who serve 50 years in knothole. Maybe they should. Red Bartlett just may have done more for youth sports and for the young people of Campbell County over the last half-century than anyone.''  To sum it up, Red gave children a chance to learn some of life's most lasting lessons through athletics. His commitment to his community made Red the real star.                          ____________________
