Hatch, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Brown) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 454       Whereas Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)      is a type of infection that is resistant to treatment with      the usual antibiotics and is one of the most common pathogens      that cause Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) in the      United States and in many parts of the world;       Whereas a study led by the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention estimates that in 2005 more than 94,000 invasive      MRSA infections occurred in the United States and more than      18,500 of these infections resulted in death;       Whereas the percentage of Staphylococcus aureus infections      in the United States that are attributable to MRSA has grown      from 2 percent in 1974 to 63 percent in 2004;       Whereas the annual number of hospitalizations associated      with MRSA infections, including both HAIs and community-based      infections, more than tripled between 1999 and 2005, from      108,600 to 368,600;       Whereas approximately 85 percent of all invasive MRSA      infections were associated with healthcare;       Whereas serious MRSA infections occur most frequently among      individuals in hospitals and healthcare facilities,      particularly the elderly, those undergoing dialysis, and      those with surgical wounds;       Whereas individuals infected with MRSA are most likely to      have longer and more expensive hospital stays, with an      average cost of $35,000;       Whereas there has been an increase in reported community-     acquired staph infection outbreaks, including antibiotic-     resistant strains, in States such as Illinois, New York,      Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida,      and the District of Columbia;       Whereas clusters of community-acquired MRSA infections have      been reported since the late 1990s among competitive sports      teams, correctional facilities, schools, workplaces, military      facilities, and other community settings;       Whereas a person who is not infected with MRSA can be a      vehicle for the transmission of infections through skin-to-     skin contact; and       Whereas many instances of MRSA transmission can be      prevented through the use of appropriate hygienic practices,      such as hand washing and appropriate first aid for open      wounds and active skin infections, are followed: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) recognizes the need to apply what is already known      about reducing the transmission of infections in hospitals,      effectively using diagnostics, and ensuring appropriate use      and utilization of antibiotics to meet patient and public      health needs;       (2) recognizes the need to pursue operational research to      find the best ways of preventing hospital- and community-     acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)      and developing new antibiotics for improving care for MRSA      patients;       (3) recognizes the importance of raising awareness of MRSA      and methods of preventing MRSA infections;       (4) supports the work of advocates, healthcare      practitioners, and science-based experts in educating,      supporting, and providing hope for individuals and their      families affected by community and healthcare associated      infections; and       (5) designates the month of March 2008 as ``MRSA Awareness      Month''.
