President, the administration's budget was wrong for the Nation when the President proposed it in February. It is even worse for the Nation now that we are at war. I will oppose it, and I hope that reason and common sense will prevail in the remaining steps of the budget process to prevent this package from doing lasting damage to the economy and to our communities.  As incredible as it might seem, this budget plan would worsen the fiscal and economic harm done by the administration's 2001 economic package, which, in one fell swoop squandered the hard-won budget surpluses and converted them to ever-deepening deficits and debt. Making matters all the worse, this budget would compound this squandering while the Nation is at war.  Can anyone seriously argue, just for instance, that it makes fiscal or economic sense to borrow money to pay for a tax cut package which itself is steeply tilted to the wealthiest individuals?  This budget plan is misguided in its priorities. It severely underfunds essential health, education and employment training programs; it contains an enormous government giveaway to wealthy corporations and the wealthiest individuals that will skyrocket our Nation's debt; and it is wholly inadequate to meet the domestic security needs of the first-responder agencies that are our first line of defense against terrorism.  Even before the war, when the President unveiled his budget proposal in February, his priorities were sharply out of kilter with the Nation's needs. By severely underfunding education and other domestic needs, and by making a nearly $700 billion tax package the focus of his budget, the President compounds the irresponsible polices of the last 2 years that have traded record surpluses for record deficits.  Let me cite just a few examples of how bad the President's budget is for Vermont: The $6.7 million cut in afterschool programs that will leave 9,566 children in my State without afterschool activities; the $2,405,259 cut in Clean Water Act funding, at a time when Vermont has nine toxic waste sites on the National Priorities List; the $524,673 cut in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that helps Vermonters who need assistance with the electricity and heating bills; the $793,220 cut in the Community Services Block Grant that provides local organizations in Vermont with funds to help reduce poverty, revitalize low-income communities, and offer families the help they need to become fully self-sufficient; and the elimination of the COPS police-hiring program that has put 245 officers on our streets. And I could go on and on.  In 2001, I voted against the Bush tax package because it was too skewed toward the wealthiest Americans and it was fiscally irresponsible. Since then, we have gone from record surpluses to red ink, and the economy is still floundering. Leading economists have repeatedly made clear that the elimination of taxes on dividends paid to investors, the centerpiece of the President's tax-cut proposal, will do little if anything to spur economic growth or to reduce the Nation's jobless rate.  As Congress shapes an economic package, fiscal responsibility needs to be a priority. We need to be smart about how we proceed, and we need to be fair about it. The tax cuts the President has proposed not only will worsen our Federal deficit, but it will also eliminate $16 million in revenue from the State of Vermont. Congress now has the responsibility to bring stability and sensible fiscal policies back into the budget process. We must work to reestablish a balanced budget and to restore our country's economic health.  Our Nation is at war. We have nearly a quarter of a million troops in the Middle East. We have five carrier battle groups in the region. And we have National Guard units being called up all across the country. Yet the President has only recently submitted an estimate to Congress about the cost of this war. The $75 billion he requested on Monday does not adequately address our country's homeland security needs and is likely just a start in funding all of the United States operations in Iraq.  I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt my amendment to boost funding for first responders. We are in a two-front war, overseas and here at home, and we need to fund both. First responders are on the front lines in defending against and preparing for terrorist attacks. The White House has refused to adequately fund homeland security, and these added responsibilities have become unfunded Federal mandates that are severely straining our police, fire and rescue agencies. Every time the alert level is raised, it costs our communities and states millions more. Everyone recognizes the vital role of first responders, but the White House is overdue in acting accordingly. The sooner we help first responders help us in the war on terrorism, the better.  In his State of the Union Message, the President was right when he said we should not pass on our problems to other Congresses, other Presidents and future generations. Unfortunately, that is exactly what this budget plan would do. The White House's own documents predict the deficit will hit highs of $304 billion this year and $307 billion in 2004. Over the next 5 years, deficits would total $1.08 trillion. Even these staggering numbers are short of the real mark because the administration will surely need hundreds of billions of dollars more in Iraq-related spending that is not counted here.  This administration has been in a rush to war, but it has been in no hurry to substantively deal with the poor economy that millions of Americans are coping with today.  This budget was a bad plan for the Nation before the war began. It is an even worse plan now.  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by Emerson Lynn that appeared in the March 21 edition of the St. Albans Messenger be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            It's Wrong To Tie Patriotism to Massive Tax Cut       There is the distinct sense that the American people cannot      do two things at once, that we cannot separate our thoughts      of the war with our thoughts of how the government spends and      collects our taxpayer dollars. Worse, there is the conviction      that one should be labeled unpatriotic if the attempt is made      to draw the distinction.       This contradiction was played out yesterday in the House of      Representatives which passed largely along party lines the      president's proposed budget, including his budget busting tax      cuts. The cuts were thought to be in jeopardy a month ago,      particularly with the Congressional Budget Office's      assessment of unending budget deficits as far as the eye can      see.       Why the miraculous turnaround? Because, as partisan      Republicans said, it would be wrong to embarrass the      president just as war is being waged in Iraq. In other words,      one's budget sense should be placed at the mercy of the      president's polling numbers.       Hmmm. If there is a sense of discomfort in having the      budget resolution being debated while war is being waged,      then why not delay discussion of the budget? If the      president's experts are to be believed, the war will be over      in less than a week or so. Why the hurry?       Was the pressure applied because the Republican leadership      (and the White House) are concerned about conflicting      messages of domestic support, or is it because they saw the      opening moments of the war as the most propitious time to      push the president's $726     billion in tax cuts, a proposal most Republicans a month ago      thought would be beyond their reach?       Guess.       Today, the same arm-twisting efforts will be applied in the      U.S. Senate. Again, it was thought only a week or so ago that      the entire tax cut proposal had no chance of being approved,      particularly with several moderate Republicans proposing a      plan to shave the tax cut in half. The ground has shifted,      Senate insiders now believe the president has a good chance      of winning it all. Again, it's the war and the pushed thought      that a good American supports whatever the president wants      right now. We must stand together.       Dear Mr. President: We are smart enough to distinguish      between a necessary war and an unnecessary tax cut. Too, our      patriotism remains intact; in fact, it is with ease that we      can argue that being opposed to the $726 billion in tax cuts      is utterly patriotic. How else to avoid an endless string of      swollen budget deficits? How else to protect the integrity of      legislative branch's responsibility to be acting on behalf of      its constituents?       We find it incredible that we have a president who lost the      popular vote and today rules as if it was his divine right,      as did the kings in Shakespeare's time. And, yet, we are      impressed. Highly impressed. In terms of sheer      accomplishment, he has achieved more in two years than Bill      Clinton did in eight. An it was thought that the balance of      power between the Democrats and the Republicans would largely      result in legislative stalemate. The Democrats could only      wish.       What is most upsetting, however, is understanding how      completely backwards the argument before congress is. The      primary focus is on the war and stalwart Republicans are      using the emotion of the moment to wash away all other      thoughts. In truth, what happens in Iraq, while terribly      important, pales in comparison to the long-term effects of      the president's decision to essentially strip this Congress      and all future Congresses of the resources needed to address      essential issues such as health care, Social Security,      Medicaid and Medicare. The war will not last long, and even      the rebuilding efforts after-wards will be short in duration      when compared to huge tax cuts that keep on taking, and      taking, and taking.       So you say, just elect a Democrat as president. A year from      now the primaries will be in full swing. We could have a      change in leadership within 24 months.       Think again.       Politically, it is almost impossible for Congress to raise      taxes. Our representatives can oppose the cuts to begin with,      which is what we hope happens, but once they are in place,      good luck turning back the clock.       That's why today's vote in the United States Senate is so      important. Although it is a budget resolution and does not      have the effect of law, it does pave the way for acceptance      later. Let's hope common sense prevails and that our      legislators act as if they are capable of distinguishing      between what needs to happen in Iraq and what needs to happen      here.
