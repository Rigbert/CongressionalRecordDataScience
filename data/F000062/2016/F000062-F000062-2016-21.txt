 President, I rise today to introduce the Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act of 2016, with my Judiciary Committee colleagues, Senators Grassley, Leahy, and Tillis.  This narrowly focused legislation responsibly cuts the red tape that hinders marijuana research, paving the way for important studies to determine if cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana often referred to as CBD, can be a safe and effective medication for serious illnesses, such as intractable epilepsy.  It does this while maintaining safeguards to protect against illegal diversion.  First, the bill directs the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to complete a scientific and medical evaluation of CBD within one year.  Based on this evaluation, the legislation directs the Department of Justice to make a scheduling recommendation for CBD that is independent of marijuana. This has never been done before.  Second, without sacrificing appropriate oversight, it streamlines the regulatory process for marijuana research.  In particular, it improves regulations dealing with changes to approved quantities of marijuana needed for research and approved research protocols.  It also expedites the Drug Enforcement Administration registration process for researching CBD and marijuana.  Third, this legislation seeks to increase medical research on CBD, while simultaneously reducing the stigma associated with conducting research on a Schedule I drug.  It does so by explicitly authorizing medical and osteopathic schools, research universities, and pharmaceutical companies to use a Schedule II Drug Enforcement Administration registration to conduct authorized medical research on CBD.  Given that the security requirements for conducting research on Schedule I and II drugs are nearly identical, this change would not jeopardize important safeguards against illegal diversion.  Fourth, the bill allows medical schools, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies to produce the marijuana they need for authorized medical research. This will ensure that researchers have access to the material they need to develop proven, effective medicines.  Finally, the bill allows parents who have children with intractable epilepsy, as well as adults with intractable epilepsy, to possess and transport cannabidiol or other non-psychoactive components of marijuana used to treat this disease while research is ongoing.  To do so, parents and adults must be able to provide documentation that they or their child have been treated by a board-certified neurologist for at least 6 months, and have certifications from their neurologist that other treatment options have been exhausted, and that the potential benefits outweigh the harms of using these non-psychoactive components of marijuana.  The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act will responsibly reduce barriers and spur additional research to ensure that CBD and other marijuana-derived medications are based on the most up to date scientific evidence.  I believe this bill is critical to help families across the country as they seek safe, effective medicines for serious illnesses, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
