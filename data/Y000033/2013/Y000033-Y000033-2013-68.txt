Mr. Speaker, I submit the following exchange of correspondence between myself and Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas.                                     House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2013.     Hon. Frank Lucas,     Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, Longworth House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Lucas, I write today to highlight a program      of significance to rural Alaska and many of our Alaska Native      villages. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),      through the Rural Utilities Service, helps provide financing      for the construction of water and waste water systems in      remote Alaska villages that face unique, significant      obstacles to providing residents with potable water and safe      sanitation systems. These obstacles include Alaska's extreme      climate and geography as well as the fact that most villages      are not connected to the road system and are only accessible      by air. The water systems assisted by the program are not a      matter of convenience for these communities, but meet a      critical public health need.       Currently, more than 30 villages in Alaska still use      ``honeybuckets'' as their method of waste collection. A      honeybucket is a five gallon bucket used as a toilet by      everyone in a household and emptied by the family on a daily      basis. Honeybuckets are a reality for many communities in my      state and pose serious health risks for residents,      particularly children. Thankfully USDA, the State of Alaska,      and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium are working      together through the program to create better sanitation      facilities in rural Alaska and help make honeybuckets a relic      of the past.       I would like to bring this issue to your attention and      would greatly appreciate your assistance in Farm Bill      conference negotiations with the Senate to help reauthorize      this important program.           Thank You,                                                        Don Young,                                       Congressman for all Alaska.                                  ____                                                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Agriculture,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2013.     Hon. Don Young,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Young,  Thank you for your letter      regarding the United States Department of Agriculture program      that helps provide financing for water and waste water      systems in remote Alaska villages. I appreciate you bringing      this issue to my attention. Given the urgency that you      describe in your letter, I would be happy to work with you      during the Farm Bill conference regarding this public health      need.           Sincerely,                                                   Frank D. Lucas,     Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture.                          ____________________
