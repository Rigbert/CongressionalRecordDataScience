  Essentially, today, under current law, the aggregate limit that anyone can give in a calendar year to anything--to all of these--is $25,000 or $50,000 a cycle. McCain-Feingold, as you know, increases that to $60,000 a cycle or $30,000 a calendar year. We increase that further to $65,000 a calendar year. And we tried to create an incentive. Again, we are replacing soft dollars with hard dollars.  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.
