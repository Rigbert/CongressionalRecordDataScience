 Virtually every piece of legislation that comes to this floor of the House is frankly bought and paid for. Why would you stand up to our China policy, which has now a $160 billion trade deficit, the loss of millions of jobs, the lowering of wages throughout this country, why would you stand up and try to fight that when you have corporate America investing tens of billions in China, donating huge amounts of money to the President and other political people, why would you stand up for American workers in the middle class when you could defend China and the large corporations that go to China?  When we speak about our trade policy, I don't want anybody to think that we are just talking about blue collar jobs. One of the major economic crises facing our country today is not just the loss of manufacturing jobs in the auto industry, the steel industry, textiles, furniture, et cetera, et cetera. That is hugely important. But what is happening now, in addition to the loss of manufacturing jobs, we are beginning to see the hemorrhaging of white collar information technology jobs. For many years, the rhetoric here in Washington was, well, don't worry too much if you're going to lose the blue collar jobs in your community because that's kind of old-fashioned economics. We're not into that anymore. The real trick is to make sure your kids get a college education and they can go out and get white collar, computer, information technology jobs, make 50, 60, $70,000 a year, good, clean, solid income. That's the future of America.  But what is happening there? What is happening now is corporations are beginning to understand the same thing. Information technology companies are understanding what manufacturing companies are understanding. And, that is, why do you want to hire American workers at 40 or $50,000 a year when there are people in India, China, Russia and elsewhere who can do information technology jobs very, very well for 10 percent of the wages paid in the United States? So what you are beginning to see now is a hemorrhaging of white collar information technology jobs which are impacting people who have college degrees, people who have graduate degrees. We are seeing this taking place at an increasing level. The answer is if we lose blue collar jobs that paid middle-class wages, if we lose white collar jobs that paid middle-class wages, what is left?                              {time}  2000  Well, I guess it is Wal-Mart time. We have a situation now, in a company like Wal-Mart, which is far and away the largest employer in America today, a company which pays low wages, minimal benefits, virtually no pension plan, that is the future of America, lose good-paying blue-collar jobs, lose good-paying white-collar jobs and move towards the Wal-Mart-type job in which our standard of living becomes less and less.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Just to make a link there, remember, during the discussions here on this floor, and during the formulation of the China trade policy here, there were the special Wal-Mart provisions that were added to that legislation, China being the largest producer of products for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has been driving manufacturers out of America.  There was a fan company driven out of Ohio. Finally, they did not want to go. They wanted to keep making them here, but Wal-Mart said we can get them cheaper. You make them cheaper. The guy said, I can't make them any cheaper. This is really efficient. We are making great products here in the United States of America. I am paying these people a decent wage. They said, no, we know you can do it better. No more contract unless you go cheaper. We know where you can go, China.  They are doing that to business after business after business, driving them out of America, driving them to China. Yes, you can say short run, that is good. The products are cheaper. Well, the profit margins are a lot cheaper. The products are maybe a little cheaper, but people do not have jobs any more. People are buying things on credit.  Not only are we borrowing $675 billion this year, projected, to buy products made overseas, Americans are borrowing money to buy the products that we borrowed money to import from overseas that we used to make here, because they have lost their jobs, and they are living off the equity in their homes or other things. We have record levels of debt in this country. So there are a host of cascading problems that are falling out of this unsustainable rush toward the bottom.
