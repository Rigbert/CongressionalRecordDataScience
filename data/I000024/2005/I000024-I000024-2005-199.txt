Some people have tried to stop projects only to find out it does not save any money; it just causes them to rearrange their projects.  This amendment actually does that. This is the only amendment that does. I will read it for my colleagues:       All non-defense, non-trust fund discretionary spending      shall not exceed the previous fiscal year's level without a      two-thirds vote.  I retain the remainder of my time.
