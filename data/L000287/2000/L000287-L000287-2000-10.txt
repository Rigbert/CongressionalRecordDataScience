Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Conyers) for yielding the time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees. Hate is hate. Hate is hate. It is based on race, on color, on religion, national origin or sexual orientation. No one, but no one is born hating. Little babies do not know hate.  They do not know sexism. They do not know racism, but our society will change the little babies before they become adults. We teach people how to hate, to hate someone because of their color, because of their race, because of their religion, because of their sex or sexual orientation.  As I said before, nobody, Mr. Speaker, is born hating, but too many people in our society grew up hating, and they get involved in hate crime against someone because of their religion, because of their color, because of their sex or sexual orientation. There is no room in our society to hate or be violent towards someone because of their race, their color, their national origin, their religion or sexual orientation.  With this legislation, Mr. Speaker, we will send a strong and powerful message that we are one family, one people, one Nation. I urge all of my colleagues to support the motion to instruct conferees.
