555 on the Executive Calendar, the nomination of Kermit Lipez, of Maine, to the first circuit.   Mr. President, it is an honor and a pleasure to rise to speak in support of the nomination of Justice Kermit Lipez to serve on the First Circuit Court of Appeals.  Having spent the past 12 years as a member of the Maine judiciary, Justice Lipez is a highly respected jurist. With experience at both the trial and appellate court levels, it is fair to say that he has been tested for the position for which he has now been nominated and that he has passed that test with flying colors.  Justice Lipez is universally praised in Maine for his judicial temperament, his sense of fairness, and his intellectual capabilities. His demeanor is consistently that of a gentleman, treating witnesses, jurors, attorneys, and spectators with great respect, and ensuring that others follow his example. He makes the courtroom a far less intimidating place for the average person.  Justice Lipez's reputation for impartiality is reflected in the high regard in which he is held by all segments of the bar. Indeed, people who agree on little else agree on his sense of fairness. He was appointed to the Maine Superior Court by a Democratic Governor, he was appointed to the Maine Supreme Court by a Republican Governor, and he was recently praised by an Independent Governor. If public trust in our court system hinges on the belief that the courtroom is a place where everyone can expect equal treatment, no one in Maine has done more to promote that perception than Justice Lipez.  The nominee is also a man who combines great intellectual acumen with considerable common sense. He has that rare ability to deal with the most cerebral of issues while keeping his feet planted firmly on the ground. Despite the talent he possesses and the respect he commands, he is a person of humility, an essential trait for someone empowered to sit in judgment of others.  Mr. President, Kermit Lipez's dedication to his profession is beyond question. As a judge's son, he came to the bench with considerable knowledge of the judicial function. Yet, shortly after his appointment to the State Superior Court, he took the unusual step of obtaining a master's degree in judicial process from the University of Virginia School of Law.  Justice Lipez understands not only the powers of a judge but also the limits on those powers. To use his own words, courts exist to resolve ``particularized disputes. They do not decide the wisdom of laws. . . . [They] squander their resources and their authority when they try to manage problems or impose solutions beyond their competence and their proper role.''  Mr. President, Justice Lipez has excelled in everything he has undertaken--whether as a legislative aide to former Senator Muskie, a private practitioner, a trial judge, or a Justice on Maine's Supreme Judicial Court--and I am confident that he will excel as a member of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.  Senator Snowe has been a very strong advocate for Justice Kermit Lipez. It was, in fact, Senator Snowe's husband who appointed Justice Lipez to the court in Maine. I am delighted to be here tonight to speak on behalf of this nomination.                   In Support of Justice Kermit Lipez
