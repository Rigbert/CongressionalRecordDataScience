President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Hagel in introducing the Small Business Banking Act of 1997, legislation that eliminates a Depression-era Federal law prohibiting banks from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. This legislation represents an important victory for small business and the banking industry because it eliminates a costly and burdensome Federal prohibition that has outlived its usefulness.  The prohibition against the payment of interest on commercial accounts was originally part of a broad prohibition on the payment of interest on any deposit account. At the time of enactment, it was the popular view that payment of interest on deposits created an incentive for rural banks to shift deposits of excess funds to urban money center banks that made loans that fueled speculation. Moreover, it was believed that such transfers created liquidity crises in rural communities. However, a number of changes in the banking system since enactment of the prohibition have called into question its usefulness.  First, with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress allowed financial institutions to offer interest-bearing accounts to individuals--a change which has not adversely affected safety and soundness. Second, a number of banks have developed complex mechanisms called sweep accounts to circumvent the interest rate prohibition. Because of the costs associated with developing sweep accounts, however, large banks have become the primary offerors of these accounts. As a result, many smaller banks are at a competitive disadvantage with larger banks that can offer their commercial depositors interest-bearing accounts. Most important, the vast majority of small businesses cannot afford to utilize sweep accounts because the cost of opening these accounts is relatively high and most small businesses do not have a large enough deposit base to justify these costs.  In light of these developments, it has become clear that the prohibition on interest-bearing commercial accounts is nothing more than a relic of the Depression era that has effectively disadvantaged small businesses and small banks, and led large banks to dedicate significant resources to circumventing the prohibition. I am, therefore, pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will eliminate this prohibition and level the playing field for small banks and small business.                                 ______                                       By
