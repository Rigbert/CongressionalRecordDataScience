 President, on another subject and admittedly a lighter note, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of young women from the University of Louisville who reached an amazing milestone this week. The U of L Lady Cards made basketball history with their first NCAA Final Four trip.  The Lady Cards, coached by Jeff Walz and led by All-American Angel McCoughtry and senior forward Candyce Bingham, are heading to St. Louis this weekend to play in the women's NCAA Final Four.  Today, I wanted to recognize this history-making team. The Lady Cards had an amazing season, and it is not over yet. On Sunday, they will face Oklahoma, with the winner advancing to the final game on Tuesday.  This has been a fun team to watch this season. Their style of play will inspire future generations of Lady Cardinals. I am sure there are a lot of young athletes in Kentucky who look up to the home team and will be cheering them on to victory this weekend.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of the players and coaches.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           University of Louisville Women's Basketball Roster       Gwen Rucker, Becky Burke, Candyce Bingham, Janae Howard,      Tiera Stephen, Mary Jackson, Laura Terry, Monique Reid, Angel      McCoughtry, Chauntise Wright, Keshia Hines, and Deseree Boyd.
