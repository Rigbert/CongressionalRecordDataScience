I have known Mr. Nangle for many years and can attest to a life dedicated to maintaining the integrity of the press and improving the governance of all those he serves. Not only is Bill a distinguished journalist, but he has used the power of his pen to be a force for progress and change in the community. Last week, the Hoosier State Press Association recognized Bill for his commitment to the pursuit of open government by presenting him with its Distinguished Service Award.  Throughout his illustrious career, which spans five decades, Bill has taken his role in the Fourth Estate seriously, leading the charge for openness and transparency in government. For example, in 1989, he pushed state legislators and then-Governor Evan Bayh to enact a state law reversing a court decision that closed county coroner records to the public.  And in 1998, Bill assembled Indiana's seven largest newspapers to collaborate on ``The State of Secrecy,'' an investigation of government sunshine and First Amendment rights in which investigative journalists went undercover as ordinary citizens to try to access records in each of the state's 92 counties that are lawfully open to the public. The flagrant legal violations that they uncovered prompted action from then-Governor Frank O'Bannon and spurred similar projects on openness and transparency in 32 other states. For his efforts, Bill Nangle was awarded the Sagamore of the Wabash, the state's highest honor at the time.  Bill has also exercised his commitment to open, effective government locally. In 2005, he joined me in a consortium of local civic and business leaders to create Northwest Indiana's Good Government Initiative. He was a driving force behind that effort to study government efficiency across the many levels of our local government, including my office, and to implement solutions that improve government services while cutting costs. The Good Government Initiative became the model for the statewide Kernan-Shepard Report on Indiana government, which is the basis for government reform initiatives currently underway in the StateHouse in Indianapolis and throughout the state.  Last year, Bill and his colleagues at The Times took the lead on establishing the One Region: One Vision concept with the goal of uniting local leaders to advance all of Northwest Indiana as one community. In the past, Northwest Indiana has been plagued by a limiting provincialism that has inhibited our area's growth and potential. Under the One Region: One Vision concept, Bill and his colleagues have already brought local leaders together from across the area to start collaborating on projects that will make Northwest Indiana a better place for everybody to live.  Finally, any praise for Bill would be incomplete without mention of his business instincts and acumen. With the print media industry struggling nationwide, and with the economic downturn exacerbating the industry's problems, The Times continues to thrive under Bill's direction. Last March, Editor and Publisher Magazine bestowed upon The Times the distinction of fastest growing English-language daily newspaper in the United States. By the most recent published reports, that growth has continued.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in honoring Bill Nangle, who has worked tirelessly to maintain a vibrant and free press and has used his influence to positively enhance the lives of the people he serves. Bill is an unparalleled leader who deserves our recognition.                          ____________________
