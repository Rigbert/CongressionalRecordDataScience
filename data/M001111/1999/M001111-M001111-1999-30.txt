 President, since 1995, we have had more than 110 anti-choice votes in Congress. More than 110 times, we have voted to restrict or deny access to safe and legal reproductive health care. More than 110 times we have voted to undermine and limit the constitutional guarantees that were provided in the Roe v. Wade decision.  The goal is clear: Little by little, the proponents of the underlying bill want to place so many barriers and obstacles in front of women and their physicians that abortions will only be available to a few wealthy women, just as it was before the Roe v. Wade decision. A woman who is a victim of rape or incest, a woman whose life is at stake, will not even be able to find a provider. In fact, I want my colleagues to know we are already seeing this. In some States, there are no doctors now who are willing to provide a legal health care procedure. We are going back to the dark days when women's health was at risk because of the laws of this land.  Let there be no confusion; the proponents of this bill want to outlaw abortions step by step since they know a majority of Americans will not give up their rights to make this decision on their own with their own family and their own faith.  If you support the Roe v. Wade decision, you have to support the Harkin amendment. If you support a woman's right to choose, you have to support the Harkin amendment. And a ``no'' vote will send a message that the Senate does not support Roe or recognize the importance that a woman has to make this decision on her own.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Harkin amendment and put us on record where we ought to be: To allow women to have safe, legal reproductive choices that allow them to make this decision with their family and their faith. That is where this decision rests, not on the floor of the Senate.  I thank my colleague from California.
