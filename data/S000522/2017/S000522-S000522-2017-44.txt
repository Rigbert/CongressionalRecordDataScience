Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank her for her leadership, for being one of the prime cosponsors of the bill, H.R. 7, along with Mrs. Black, Ms. Foxx, Mrs. Wagner, Mrs. Blackburn, Mrs. Noem, Mrs. Hartzler, and all the others who have joined in as sponsors of this lifesaving legislation.  I would also like to thank Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Whip Scalise, and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers for their extraordinary leadership in defending the most innocent and the most vulnerable among us, unborn children, as well as providing protections for their mothers, and for bringing this legislation, H.R. 7, to the floor.  Forty years ago, Madam Speaker, Congress enacted the Hyde amendment, a law that continues to this day to proscribe Federal Medicaid funds from being used to subsidize abortion in most circumstances.  More than 20 peer-reviewed studies show that more than 2 million people are alive today, 2 million, because of the Hyde amendment. Two million people who would have been aborted, instead, survived because public funds were unavailable to effectuate their violent demise, while their mothers benefited from prenatal health care and support; 2 million survivors who have had the opportunity to live and to enjoy the most basic and the most elemental of all human rights, the right to life.  Madam Speaker, we are experiencing a megatrend in America, consistently reflected in polling data, including the most recent polling data from the Marist Poll yesterday, that showed that 61 percent of Americans are against public funding for abortion, and most want, even those who identify as pro-choice, more restrictions to protect the innocent unborn.  People are seeing the truth of who abortion actually destroys, as today's proudly shared, first baby pictures are most often of ultrasound imaging photos depicting the amazing miracle of the developing child in the womb.  Growing numbers of Americans are often shocked to learn that the methods of abortion include dismemberment of a child's fragile body, including decapitation, and the severing of arms and legs, or the use of drugs like RU-486 that literally starve the child to death before forcibly expelling her or him from the safety of the womb.  Yet, the billion-dollar abortion industry continues to cleverly market the chief sophistry of choice, while going to extraordinary lengths to cover up, ignore, and trivialize the battered victim child in the womb.  Madam Speaker, pro-life Americans struggle for the day when abortion violence will be replaced by compassion and empathy for women and respect forthe weak and most vulnerable among us, the child in the womb. They believe, as do my pro-life colleagues, that we ought to love them both, mother and child, and not fund the destruction of children through abortion.  Lawmakers also need to hear the courageous voices of women who are silent no more, a rapidly expanding number of women who share the agony and heartbreak that they have endured after procuring an abortion.  As I mentioned, yesterday there was a poll that came out, and, again, it found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion, and only 35 percent support it, which is precisely what we seek to accomplish with enactment of H.R. 7. It would make the Hyde amendment and other current abortion funding restrictions permanent and government-wide.  I would note, parenthetically, that soon after the Hyde amendment was enacted in 1976, other abortion funding riders were enacted into law, and Hyde itself was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980.  In 1983, I authored the ban on funding abortion in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Most must be renewed legislatively each and every year. This legislation would make it permanent.  The legislation ensures that the Affordable Care Act, until repeal, conforms with the Hyde amendment.  I would remind my colleagues that just a few feet from where I stand, on September 9, 2009--and I have his speech right in front of me--the President of the United States said: ``And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up--under our plan, no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and Federal conscience laws will remain in place.''  Well, on the latter, the conscience laws remained in place, but they were just simply not enforced.  And of course we know now, as my good friend, Ms. Cheney, mentioned, we know that, according to the GAO--because people kept saying in the early years, oh, there is no funding, public funding for abortion, so we asked GAO to look into it. They came back and said there is much--over 1,000 plans pay for abortion on demand.  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article that appeared in The Washington Post: ``Does Obamacare provide federal subsidies for elective abortions?'' It talks about the GAO report, and it basically says that those who claim that it does, they earn three Pinocchios.                            [Jan. 26, 2017]    Does Obamacare Provide Federal Subsidies for Elective Abortions?                        (By Michelle Ye Hee Lee)       ``The president's health-care law authorized massive      subsidies to assist millions of Americans to purchase private      health plans that will cover abortion on demand. In other      words, hard-earned taxpayer dollars are now being used to pay      for elective abortions. This is simply unacceptable.''--Rep.      Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), House debate, Jan. 22, 2015       The argument that the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a.      Obamacare, provides federal subsidies for abortions came up      several times during the House debate on an antiabortion      bill.       The bill would prohibit using federal funds for any      abortions or for any health plans that cover abortions. Under      Obamacare, federal funds can be used to cover abortions for      pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or that endanger the      mother's life. But no federal subsidies for premiums can be      used for elective abortions. The House debate centered on      whether this restriction is being enforced, and whether      additional protection for taxpayers are needed.       There often is overheated rhetoric in the abortion debate      that cannot be fact-checked. (The Fact Checker previously      examined Democrats' claims following the Hobby Lobby ruling.)       The bill's opponents, who support abortion rights, say the      system works and that the measure would unnecessarily      restrict women's private insurance choices. Lawmakers who      oppose abortion rights don't buy it; they say the system is      just an accounting gimmick. The goal of this fact check is      not to relitigate the debate but to examine evidence to      support the above statement, which was repeated throughout      the debate.       Foxx, one of the lawmakers arguing for the bill, was among      several Republicans who claimed federal subsidies are paying      for elective abortions. Does this accurately portray how      abortions are covered under Obamacare?                               The Facts       The House passed H.R. 7, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion      and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015, on the      anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.      The bill was a watered-down measure that the House took up at      the last minute after GOP leaders pulled an initial, more      restrictive bill.       Public funding for abortions is intricately structured.      Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funds can't be used for      elective abortions under Medicaid-funded plans. Some states      do pay 100 percent of the cost of elective abortions without      passing on any cost to the federal government.       Under Obamacare, health insurance plans could cover some or      all elective abortions, but they can't use federal tax      credits and subsidies to offset the cost. Insurance providers      that cover elective abortions must charge consumers      separately and deposit the money into a separate account that      contains no federal money. Providers need to bill enrollees      separately for elective abortions by itemizing them      separately in monthly bills or sending separate bills.       States can pass laws to ban or restrict health plans from      providing coverage for elective abortions. In 2014, 23 states      restricted coverage for these procedures. There were 1,036      plans in 28 states that provided some or all coverage for      elective abortions.       In a speech to Congress and a subsequent executive order,      President Obama gave assurances that federal subsidies would      not be used to cover elective abortion services. He ordered      Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and      Budget to issue a guideline for states so they can comply      with billing and funding segregation requirements.       Obama's not keeping his promise, say supporters of H.R. 7.      Staffers for Foxx and two of the other lawmakers who made      similar claims--H.R. 7 sponsor Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and      Rep. Ana Wagner (R-MO.)--pointed to a September 2014      Government Accountability Office report. At the request of      GOP leaders, the GAO examined whether health plans were      following the elective abortion billing requirements.       GAO picked 18 plans in 10 states with no laws restricting      abortion coverage as a non-probability sample representing a      quarter of all health plans that cover elective abortions.      GAO found 17 of 18 issuers were not separately billing      consumers. The one remaining issuer said its bills show there      is a charge ``for coverage of services for which member      subsidies may not be used.''       These issuers did not give blanket coverage for all      abortions. One covered abortions that a health-care provider      determines necessary, and two limited coverage to no more      than one elective abortion a year. All 18 issuers had payment      requirements such as co-pays, deductions and out-of-pocket      costs.       The report did not examine whether the providers were      illegally using federal subsidies to pay for elective      abortion services. In response to the report, HHS released a      new set of regulations to clarify billing and funding      segregation requirements.       Experts say the GAO's findings do not necessarily mean      insurance providers are inappropriately using federal      subsidies to cover abortion services. There is no government      or industry agency tracking insurers' compliance, making it      impossible to know whether providers are following the law,      they said.       ``It's really not clear how these different plans are being      operationalized,'' said Alina Salganicoff, Kaiser Family      Foundation's director of women's health policy.       The GAO report found premium amounts collected from      elective abortion services ranged from 51 cents to $1.46 per      enrollee per month. To put this in context, the national      average premium for a 40-year-old person purchasing coverage      through the marketplace was between $224 to $270 per month,      according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (An earlier, non-     age-specific average monthly estimate was $241.) Even if the      maximum charge ($1.46) was added to the cheapest health plan      ($224), the elective abortion surcharge is less than 1      percent of the monthly bill.       The key point made by lawmakers and advocacy groups who      oppose abortion rights is that money is fungible, and that it      doesn't matter exactly how the money is being collected. A      dollar is a dollar, they say, and every dollar paid to an      insurance provider in the marketplace ultimately goes into      collective risk pools that are used to rim government-     subsidized health insurance, so taxpayers are effectively      paying for elective abortions.       ``The point is the federal subsidies provided for those      1,036 plans are funding abortion just as much as the private      funds contributed by the individual. That is consistent with      the commonly held understanding that money is fungible and      the funds received by the insurance company are used to pay      all benefits,'' Sheridan Watson, Foxx's communications      director, wrote to The Fact Checker.                           The Pinocchio Test       The GAO's report found that the insurers it studied were      not following billing requirements. But experts say that does      not necessarily mean the providers were illegally using      federal subsidies for abortions. Even if they were, Foxx's      statement that Obamacare authorized ``massive'' subsidies is      an exaggeration. Based on the estimates above, abortion      charges would range from 0.2 percent to 0.65 percent of an      enrollee's monthly bill.       The claim that ``hard-earned taxpayer dollars'' are paying      for abortions ``on demand'' implies that taxpayers foot the      abortion bill for any woman who requests one. But in reality,      some providers still imposed their own restrictions on which      abortions to cover, and all 18 issuers had payment      requirements, such as out-of-pocket costs and co-pays.       Lawmakers like Foxx who oppose abortion rights discredit      the billing and funding separation requirement for elective      abortion services. Billing doesn't matter, they say, because      federal tax dollars used for subsidies pay for everything in      a health plan. This is an opinion, and something that can't      be fact-checked. But to say that massive federal subsidies      are paying for abortions on demand is not an accurate      portrayal of this complex issue, and the facts in the GAO      report do not support this argument.  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).
