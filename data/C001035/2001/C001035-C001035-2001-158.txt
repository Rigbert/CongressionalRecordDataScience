President, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the budget resolution. There will be 10 minutes of debate on the Stabenow and Collins amendments with back-to-back votes to occur at 9:30. Following the votes, Senator Conrad will be recognized to offer his amendment regarding debt reduction. As a reminder, first-degree amendments to the resolution must be filed by 2 p.m. today. Senators should expect another late session with votes into the night. Votes also will occur throughout the day tomorrow. I thank my colleagues for their attention.
