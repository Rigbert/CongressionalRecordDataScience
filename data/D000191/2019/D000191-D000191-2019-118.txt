Speaker, I will vote in support of H. Res. 246, a resolution opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.  While it will be a difficult vote, I support this resolution because some individuals leading the BDS movement have engaged in anti-Semitic rhetoric and actions and have questioned the right of Israel to exist. While not perfect, this resolution sends an important message that anti-Semitism is unacceptable.  Let me be clear: anti-Semitism, as with any other form of racism or discrimination, is antithetical to the values and aspirations of the American people. I am disturbed by the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States and other parts of the world, and I am troubled by the fact that the genocide that took place during the Holocaust is fading from memory.  That's why I have taken substantive actions to combat anti-Semitism, including joining the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, voting in support of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2018, and voting in support of a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry and intolerance. I am also a cosponsor of the Never Again Education Act, which would help address the rise in anti-Semitism by granting teachers across the country the resources and training necessary to teach our children the lessons of the Holocaust and the horrific consequences of hate and intolerance.  At the same time, I agree with this resolution's statements that boycotts and related actions are legitimate forms of free speech protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. That's why I am cosponsoring H. Res. 496, a resolution affirming that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts, as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. I have also consistently opposed--and will continue to oppose--any legislation that would punish or criminalize individuals' constitutionally-protected right to free speech.  I also agree with the stated support for a two-state solution in H. Res. 246. I have consistently supported a two-state solution throughout my time in Congress, and I am once again a cosponsor of legislation stating that any U.S. plan or proposal for peace in the Middle East must include and center on a two-state solution. A two-state solution will not only secure Israel's future as a democratic, Jewish state, it will also advance U.S. security interests in the region and enhance our ability to confront the threats posed by Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other dubious actors in the Middle East.  Unfortunately, this resolution does nothing to address the fact that the Trump administration and the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have taken a number of actions that severely undermine a two-state solution. This includes the Trump administration's decision to recognize the city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, to greenlight the continuing expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and to discontinue U.S. contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and bilateral assistance to the Palestinians--all decisions which I strongly oppose. Regrettably, the Trump administration's actions have undermined the confidence among Palestinians and Arab countries in the region that the U.S. desires to play a productive role as a neutral mediator in the Middle East peace process.  As an ally of Israel, the United States invests more than $3 billion in aid to Israel annually. Accordingly, I believe it is only appropriate that lawmakers voice their legitimate concerns with Israeli policies in a constructive way, as I have done throughout my time in Congress and will continue to do. That's why I have joined my colleagues in urging the Israeli government not to demolish Palestinian communities in the West Bank, cosponsored legislation such as the Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act, and continued to urge President Trump to restore vital aid to the Palestinians. Protecting human rights, regardless of any ongoing tension between Israelis and Palestinians, should be a fundamental American value.  It is only through thoughtful, respectful, nuanced debate that Congress can productively contribute towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and addressing the legitimate needs of both peoples. The bottom line is it is critical that the U.S. pursue policies that will move Israelis and Palestinians towards a negotiated, two-state solution, and I will continue to push the Trump administration and Congress to do so.                          ____________________
