 President, it was a great treat for me to listen to the very eloquent comments of the Senator from Michigan. A few years ago, Vice President Walter Mondale said to me ``When you go to the Senate, listen to Carl Levin; he is one of the most articulate and erudite Members of that body.'' After hearing his discussion of the NATO enlargement, I just want to say the Vice President was correct.
