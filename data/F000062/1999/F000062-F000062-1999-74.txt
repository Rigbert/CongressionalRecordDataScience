 The uncertainty created by the temporary and sporadic extensions is incompatible with the basic needs of biotech innovation--providing companies with a stable time frame to plan, launch, and conduct research activities. In the case of a promising but financially intensive research project, such unpredictability can make the difference as to whether the project is completed or abandoned.  Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in the past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how research and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, and even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from breakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to cleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax credit.  Over the past two decades the research and experimentation tax credit has proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs and in growing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled by remaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the uncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to work to make sure that any Senate tax bill contains a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.                          ____________________
