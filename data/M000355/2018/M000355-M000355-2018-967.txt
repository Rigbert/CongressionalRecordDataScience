 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Wednesday, July 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be closed. I ask that following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the Benczkowski nomination and that all time during adjournment, leader remarks, and morning business count postcloture on the nomination.
