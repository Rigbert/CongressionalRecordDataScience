Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the long and illustrious careers of my distinguished colleagues and good friends, Andy Jacobs and John Myers. I have had the honor of serving with John and Andy since I was first elected to join Indiana's congressional delegation in 1984. Before that, I got to know them when I worked on the staff of the late Adam Benjamin, Jr. Andy and John have always demonstrated that they are men of impeccable character, honesty, and integrity. Indeed, Indiana and the Nation are fortunate to have had these two honorable and capable individuals representing their interests in the U.S. Congress for the past three decades.  Since he was first elected to represent Indiana's Tenth Congressional District in 1964, Andy Jacobs has been a tremendous legislator. As a new Member of Congress, he helped to write the 1965 Voting Rights Act and led the House debate to help get the United States out of Vietnam. A member of the Waysand Means Committee, Andy quickly developed an expertise in Medicare and Social Security, and he worked tirelessly to help improve the lives of millions of America's senior citizens. During his tenure in the House, he served as chairman of both the Health, Medicare, and Social Security Subcommittees. In this capacity, he was able to strengthen and enhance the Social Security Administration and the Medicare Program. Widely recognized as one of the most frugal Members of Congress, Andy put his money where his mouth is by being an early proponent of a balanced budget constitutional amendment.  the third most senior Republican in the House and the GOP Dean of Indiana's congressional delegation, John Myers has served in the House since 1966, when he was first elected to represent Indiana's Seventh Congressional District. Over the years, John has earned the reputation as a staunch fiscal conservative, and he takes pride in the fact that he has never voted for a tax increase.  John's leadership on the Appropriations Committee has been particularly distinguished. Since he began his service on the committee in 1970, John has compiled a remarkable legislative record, punctuated by fairness and bipartisanship. Throughout his career, and, most recently, as chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, he has used his experience to craft needed flood control projects for his farming-intensive district. However, John's work on the subcommittee goes beyond helping out his constituents. He has been a long-time advocate for high-technology research, including progress in new cancer treatments, plant biodiversity, superconductivity, and general science at Purdue, Indiana State, and other Indiana universities.  Andy Jacobs and John Myers will be sorely missed after they retire at the end of the 104th Congress. Indiana and the Nation will lose the invaluable experience of their combined 60 years in the U.S. Congress. I am happy, however, that Andy and John can look forward to spending plenty of time with their families. I would like to convey my best wishes to Andy's wife, Kim, and their two boys, Andy and Steve. I would also like to tell John and his wife, Carol, that they are lucky to have more time to spend with their two daughters, Carol Ann and Lori, and their two grandsons, Justin and Austin.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Andy Jacobs and John Myers for all they have done for me during my tenure in the Congress. In addition to being fonts of wisdom and experience, they were always there for me when I needed them--first and foremost as friends. John and Andy, I am a better person, a better legislator, and a better father, because I have known you. I wish both of you good and decent men every joy and happiness in life.                          ____________________
