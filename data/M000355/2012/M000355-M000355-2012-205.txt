  Thanks to the noble work of the Honor Flight Program and the leaders of the Bluegrass Chapter, including Brian Duffy, these brave patriots, along with their brothers-in-arms from the Korean war, will see the national memorials built in their honor today. Over the years, the Honor Flight Bluegrass Chapter has brought some 1,100 veterans--most from Kentucky--to Washington, DC, for this purpose. This program provides transportation, lodging, and food for the veterans. Without Honor Flight, most of these veterans would never be able to visit the Capital or see the World War II Memorial.  I have been privileged to visit with groups of Honor Flight veterans before, and I am pleased to report that I will be meeting with today's group at their memorial as well. My father served in World War II, and it is an honor to shake hands with his contemporaries, hear their stories, and thank them for their service.  America is forever indebted to the heroic members of the U.S. military who defended this great Nation and fought for freedom and against tyranny in World War II.
