 Chairman, this tripartisan amendment has wide support across the political spectrum. It has been cosponsored by Ron Paul of Texas, Mr. Hinchey of New York, Mr. Kucinich of Ohio, and has been endorsed by a number of leading nationalorganizations, including the U.S. Business and Industry Council, the Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Green Scissors Coalition, Public Citizen, Friends of the Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.                              {time}  1300  This amendment is simple and it is straightforward. At a time when this Nation has an $8.2 trillion national debt, this amendment would simply prohibit the Export-Import Bank from providing corporate welfare to large oil companies for the development of oil and gas projects overseas.  Mr. Chairman, in America today there are proposals coming from the White House and the leadership of this institution to cut back on health care, to cut back on Medicare, to cut back on Medicaid, to cut back on financial aid for college middle class students. And yet if we do not have enough money to take care of the middle class and their needs, working families, lower-income families, I wonder why we have billions of dollars available to provide corporate welfare for the largest oil companies in the United States of America, companies that are receiving today billions and billions of dollars in profits.  It is beyond comprehension that anybody in this institution could come forward with a straight face and say that the taxpayers of America should be providing loan guarantees and subsidies to corporations like ExxonMobil, which last year earned $36 billion in profits, more profits than any corporation in the history of the world. Companies like ExxonMobil which had enough money to pay out $398 million for a retirement package for their former CEO. That the taxpayers of this country, that middle-class families, that working families should be subsidizing the largest oil companies in the world who are receiving record-breaking profits, who are paying their CEOs huge compensation packages is literally insane.  We have real needs in this country. We have needs for our veterans, needs for education, needs for health care. If oil companies in America cannot make a buck today without coming for corporate welfare to the taxpayers of this country, they are never going to make a buck.  Since 1996 the Export-Import Bank has given more than $7 billion in loans and loan guarantees for oil and gas projects all over this world, including $1.3 billion to ExxonMobil and nearly $2 billion to our old friends in Halliburton, another company that is obviously in desperate need of taxpayer funds.  Mr. Chairman, to add insult to injury, the top recipient, and I hope you hear this, of this corporate welfare is not even an American company. It is not even a privately owned company. I didn't know that my Republican friends were so supportive of state-owned nationalized industries. I learn something new every day. But the top recipient of this corporate welfare is PEMEX, a wholly owned oil company of Mexico. Well, isn't that great that the taxpayers of America are subsidizing a wholly owned oil company of Mexico. Well, how about paying attention to some small businesses in America?  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
