Boehner was asked if we would be allowed to vote on the Senate tax bill, to which he responded:       If our Democrat colleagues want to offer the President's      plan in the Senate, then we are more than happy to give them      a vote.  He said that just a few minutes ago.  Our intention will probably be to offer the bill that has now passed the Senate, which will protect middle class taxpayers from any tax increase, as I think your party, Mr. Leader, and my party agree on.  Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we would be able to offer that alternative on the floor with such protections as would be necessary consistent with what Speaker Boehner has said.  I yield to my friend.
