President, our health care system is structured to cure but often neglects how we die and how to make dying patients and their families more comfortable. Today, I am introducing two bills which I believe will provide better care options for dying patients in our country. The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act seeks to test ways in which to improve the Medicare hospice benefit, and the Palliative Care Training Act recognizes that we need a larger cadre of health care professionals who know how to help those with terminal illnesses have a better quality of life.  Although this Congress made improvements in the Medicare Hospice benefit last year, I believe we need to continue to test new modes of providing hospice care so that more seniors are not only aware of the benefit, but access it when needed. Medicare introduced the hospice program in 1983 as an optional benefit for achieving a ``good death''. This benefit is widely recognized as effective in improving quality of life for terminally ill patients. Hospice programs provide a range of services to control pain and provide comfort care, primarily to individuals in their own homes. In the past decade, the number of Medicare patients receiving hospice care has more than doubled. Today, about 20 percent of patients who die in the United States receive hospice care. However, average lengths of stay in hospice have been dropping. According to the GAO, twenty-eight percent of Medicare patients in the hospice program receive hospice care for one week or less. One reason for this shift in hospice use is patient unwillingness to forego curative care--or to abandon hope despite a terminal diagnosis. The Medicare hospice program pays for medical procedures necessary for pain control and other symptom management, but not those aimed at curing the patient. As a result, many seriously ill patients resist the program because it forces them to make a choice between the hope that there might be a cure and the acceptance that one's life is coming to an end.  The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act would remove this obstacle by permitting patients to seek hospice care as they continue curative treatment. I believe more people would use the hospice benefit and use it in a timely manner so they could get the full benefit of the range of services hospice offers if they did not have to give up hope. I also believe that this concept along with counseling assistance provided by this demonstration project would help the medical community be better able to help patients accept hospice care.  The second bill I am introducing, ``The Palliative Care Training Act'', uses the model already in law for other specialities to create a Hospice and Palliative Care Academic Career Award. This award would foster the creation of faculty at our Nation's medical schools to teach palliativecare, once the specialty is recognized as a board certified specialty.  For some the term ``palliative care'' may be new. Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment, and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. It neither hastens nor postpones death. This type of care offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death and to help the family cope during their loved one's illness and in their own bereavement. In addition, palliative care is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  No one likes to think about what it will be like at the end of our lives. We rarely have the discussions we need to have with our medical providers about how to help us have a ``good'' death. Much of the fault lies in the way we have structured our health care system. With all that the American health system has to offer, we need to make sure resources are put in place to assure patients and their families better care in their last days. I believe these two bills provide important components to do that.                                 ______                                       By
