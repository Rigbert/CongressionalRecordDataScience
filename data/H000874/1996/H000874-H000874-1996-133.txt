I will be pleased to work with the chairman on this very important issue. I would also appreciate a bit more clarification regarding the operational components of the tax systems modernization program. As the bill is currently written, my concern is that some programs, such as electronic filing, will come to a standstill.  What types of accommodations is the chairman willing to make as we conference this bill as it relates to the operational TSM programs?
