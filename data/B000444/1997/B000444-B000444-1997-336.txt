 President, last fall, I had the opportunity to participate in a ribbon cutting ceremony commemorating renovations to the Queen Manor low-income senior citizen complex in Dover, DE. One of the highlights of the ceremony was a poem written and read by Mr. James B. Coker that reminds us that drug abuse is not the answer.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the poem be printed in the Record.  The poem follows:       The high I need doesn't come in a bottle       Or in an auto's throttle       Just give me some hugs       Not someone's drugs
