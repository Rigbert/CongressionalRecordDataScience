 They have done a spectacular job on this budget, and I wish to thank my Senators on this side of the aisle for cooperating in such a way that we are going to finish this bill at midafternoon on Friday, one of the earliest completion times we have had.  Finally, with regard to next week, it is the view of the Republican side of the aisle that we need to finish that bill next week. The troops need the money. There is a veto threat out against the bill potentially if it is not fixed on the floor of the Senate. So we need to wrap up that bill up next week, and we will be working cooperatively on this side of the aisle to achieve that goal.  I yield the floor.
