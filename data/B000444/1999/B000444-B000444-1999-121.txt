  First, the very essential safeguards the chairman indicated all military guys want, I find it fascinating that the Republican leadership would not allow the Senate to include those in the treaty. That indicates what a stacked deck this is and how outrageous is this approach of how we are proceeding on this is.  The very things all the Joint Chiefs and the President of the United States said they wanted in the treaty as the six safeguards when we brought this up in the unanimous consent agreement, we were not allowed to include those as part of the treaty. I think that is telling.  The second point. The Senator says, Have we ever exercised this clause? The appropriate question is, Have we ever needed to? The answer is, we have never concluded we needed to. Such a clause, or a variation, is in every treaty the United States of America signs. This is a bit of a red herring. In every treaty we sign of consequence relating to our national security, there is a supreme national interest clause. The reason we haven't exercised it is that no President has concluded there was a need.  The third point I make, if my friend is concerned--as I know he is--about our friends at one point not being able to rely upon the United States and deciding to go their own route, I ask him why Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac are making a personal appeal to the President of the United States, for goodness sake, pass this treaty. Japan and Germany are saying please, please, pass a treaty. We signed it; we ratified it.  How much time does the Senator from New York require?
