 I was first made aware of the problems that current property transfer laws poses by the sheriff of Riverside County in southern California. The sheriff's officehas obtained, by short-term lease, a portion of March Air Reserve Base. The sheriff's office has been using this land for joint law enforcement and fire and rescue training. This legislation will allow the sheriff's office to apply directly to the General Services Administration, which will coordinate the application and approval process with the Department of Justice and FEMA to transfer the necessary property. Once again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.                  abusive and exploitative child labor
