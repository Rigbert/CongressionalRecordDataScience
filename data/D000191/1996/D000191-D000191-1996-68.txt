Speaker, Americans are tired of being discriminated against by their insurance company. Mental health parity language included in the VA-HUD appropriation bill was recently endorsed by an overwhelming majority in the House. Nearly five million men, women and children suffer from a severe mental illness. Yet, only 2 percent of the mentally ill receive insurance coverage. Unfortunately, greed seems to be the driving force behind efforts to deprive so many of our friends, relatives and neighbors of this basic care.  We cannot wait any longer to subject mental health benefits to the same annual and lifetime caps as those for physical health. Currently, private insurers place lifetime limits of $1 million for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and tuberculosis but lifetime limits on mental illness is typically set at $50,000 or less. Thisdisparity is a straightforward solution that will provide financial relief.  A study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand indicates that mental parity legislation would save over $16 million in Medicaid costs annually. People who exhaust their current health care benefits are forced to fall back on the Federal health care system. This is certainly not my idea of responsible fiscal management of our public health care. America's insurance companies can well afford to equalize caps for both mental and medical conditions. We have waited long enough for this comprehensive, financially prudent approach to health care reform. By providing parity for mental health benefits, we are helping millions of Americans move closer toward meaningful recovery. I urge all of my colleagues to listen to the voices of concerned citizens and guarantee mental health parity for all those in need of long-term treatment.                          ____________________
