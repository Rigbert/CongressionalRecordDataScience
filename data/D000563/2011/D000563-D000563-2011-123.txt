President, I have the greatest respect for Senator Carl Levin and Senator John McCain. They have done an extraordinary job on the Defense authorization bill. I would say, by and large, this bill would not have engendered the controversy that brings us to the floor today but for this provision, because it is a critically important provision which has drawn the attention not just of those in the military community--which they, of course, would expect in a Defense authorization bill--but also the attention of those in the intelligence community and the law enforcement community across the United States, as well as the President of the United States.  The provision which they include in this bill is a substantial and dramatic departure in American law when it comes to fighting terrorism. I salute Senator Udall for bringing it to the attention of the committee and now to the floor; that before we take this step forward, we should reflect and pass the Udall amendment which calls for the necessary agencies of government--law enforcement, intelligence, and military--to reflect on the impact of this decision, not just on the impact of America's security but on America's commitment to constitutional principles. This is a fundamental issue which is being raised, and it should be considered ever so seriously. We need to ask ourselves, 10 years after 9/11, why are we prepared to engage in a rewrite of the laws on fighting terrorism?  Thank God we meet in this Chamber today with no repeat of 9/11. Through President George Bush and President Barack Obama, America has been safe. Yes, there are people who threaten us, and they always will, but we have risen to that challenge with the best military in the world, with effective law enforcement, and without giving away our basic values and principles as Americans.  Take a look at the provision in this bill which Senator Udall is addressing. Who opposes this provision? I will tell you who opposes it. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who passed out of this Chamber with a 100-to-0 vote of confidence in his leadership, has told us don't do this; this is a mistake in this provision.  Secondly, the law enforcement community, from Attorney General Eric Holder to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has told us it is a mistake to pass this measure, to limit our ability to fight terrorism. And the intelligence community as well; the Director of National Intelligence tells us this is a mistake.  Is it any wonder Senator Udall comes to the floor and others join him from both sides of the aisle saying, before we make this serious change in policy in America, ask ourselves: Have we considered the impact this will have on our Nation's security, our ability to interrogate witnesses, and our commitment to constitutional principles?  When I take a look at the letter that was sent to us by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, I have to reflect on the fact that Director Mueller was appointed by President George W. Bush and reappointed by President Barack Obama. I respect him very much. He has warned this Senate: Do not pass this provision in the Defense authorization bill. It may adversely impact ``our ability to continue ongoing international terrorism investigation.''  If this provision had been offered by a Democrat under Republican George W. Bush, the critics would have come to the floor and said: How could you possibly tie the hands of the President when he is trying to keep America safe?  The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has made it clear the passage of this provision in this bill will limit the flexibility of the administration to combat terrorism. It will create uncertainty for law enforcement, intelligence, and defense officials regarding how they handle suspected terrorists and raise serious constitutional concerns. Listen, all those things are worthy of debate were it not for the record that for 10 years America has been safe. It has been safe because of a Republican President and a Democratic President using the forces at hand to keep us safe. If we were coming here with some record of failure when it comes to keeping America safe, it is one thing, but we have a record of positive success. This notion that there is no way to keep America safe without military tribunals and commissions defies logic and defies experience.  Since 9/11, over 300 suspected terrorists have been successfully prosecuted in article III criminal courts in America. Yes, they have been read the Miranda rights, and, yes, they have been prosecuted and sent to prison, the most recent being the Underwear Bomber, who pled guilty just weeks ago in the article III criminal courts. During this same period of time, when it comes to military commissions and tribunals, how many alleged terrorists have been convicted? Six. The score, my friends, if you are paying attention, is 300 to 6. President Bush and President Obama used our article III criminal courts effectively to keep America safe, and in those instances where they felt military tribunals could do it best, they turned to them with some success.  I might add, to those who want to just change the law again when it comes to military tribunals, this is the third try. Twice we have tried to write the language on military tribunals and commissions. It has been sent ultimately across the street to the Supreme Court and rejected. They told us to start over. Do we want to risk that again? Do we want to jeopardize the prosecution of an alleged terrorist because we want to test out a new legal and constitutional theory? I hope not.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the Director of the FBI.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2011.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express concerns      regarding the impact of certain aspects of the current      version of Section 1032 of the National Defense Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Because the proposed legislation      applies to certain persons detained in the United States, the      legislation may adversely impact our ability to continue      ongoing international terrorism investigations before or      after arrest, derive intelligence from those investigations,      and may raise extraneous issues in any future prosecution of      a person covered by Section 1032.       The legislation as currently proposed raises two principal      concerns. First, by establishing a presumption of military      detention for covered individuals within the United States,      the legislation introduces a substantial element of      uncertainty as to what procedures are to be followed in the      course of a terrorism investigation in the United States.      Even before the decision to arrest is made, the question of      whether a Secretary of Defense waiver is necessary for the      investigation to proceed will inject uncertainty as to the      appropriate course for further investigation up to and beyond      the moment when the determination is made that there is      probable cause for an arrest.       Section 1032 may be read to divest the FBI and other      domestic law enforcement agencies of jurisdiction to continue      to investigate those persons who are known to fall within the      mandatory strictures of section 1032, absent the Secretary's      waiver. The legislation may call into question the FBI's      continued use or scope of its criminal investigative or      national security authorities in further investigation of the      subject. The legislation may restrict the FBI from using the      grand jury to gather records relating to the covered person's      communication or financial records, or to subpoena witnesses      having information on the matter. Absent a statutory basis      for further domestic investigation, Section 1032 may be      interpreted by the courts as foreclosing the FBI from      conducting any further investigation of the covered      individual or his associates.       Second, the legislation as currently drafted will inhibit      our ability to convince covered arrestees to cooperate      immediately, and provide critical intelligence. The      legislation introduces a substantial element of uncertainty      as to what procedures are to be followed at perhaps the most      critical time in the development of an investigation against      a covered person. Over the past decade we have had numerous      arrestees, several of whom would arguably have been covered      by the statute, who have provided important intelligence      immediately after they have been arrested, and in some      instances for days and weeks thereafter. In the context of      the arrest, they have been persuaded that it was in their      best interests to provide essential information while the      information was current and useful to the arresting      authorities.       Nonetheless, at this crucial juncture, in order for the      arresting agents to proceed to obtain the desired      cooperation, the statute requires that a waiver be obtained      from the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the      Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence,      with certification by the Secretary to Congress that the      waiver was in the national security interests of the United      States. The proposed statute acknowledges that this is a      significant point in     an ongoing investigation. It provides that surveillance and      intelligence gathering on the arrestee's associates should      not be interrupted. Likewise, the statute provides that an      ongoing interrogation session should not be interrupted.       These limited exceptions, however, fail to recognize the      reality of a counterterrorism investigation. Building rapport      with, and convincing a covered individual to cooperate once      arrested, is a delicate and time sensitive skill that      transcends any one interrogation session. It requires      coordination with other aspects of the investigation.      Coordination with the prosecutor's office is also often an      essential component of obtaining a defendant's cooperation.      To halt this process while the Secretary of Defense      undertakes the mandated consultation, and the required.      certification is drafted and provided to Congress, would set      back our efforts to develop intelligence from the subject.       We appreciate that Congress has sought to address our      concerns in the latest version of the bill, but believe that      the legislation as currently drafted remains problematic for      the reasons set forth above. We respectfully ask that you      take into account these concerns as Congress continues to      consider Section 1032.           Sincerely,                                            Robert S. Mueller III,                                                         Director.
