Chair, may I ask for the remaining time on either side.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 30 seconds remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I doubt the gentlewoman has ever visited one of these programs. I have, numerous times. I have seen the hotshot teams. These kids are so proud. They were on a bad path, and now they are on a good path.  So, if you want to talk about at-risk youth, if you want to end up having them get on drugs and go to jail, kill the program. If you don't kill the program, we are going to save these kids' lives and make them into productive citizens.  On the plane one day, I sat next to a guy just coming back from one in Idaho. He had learned to cook there. He got his certificate. He was offered four jobs when he came back. Before that, he was a dead-end kid with no high school degree.  These programs have great results for these youth. Do not be cruel and kill it.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
