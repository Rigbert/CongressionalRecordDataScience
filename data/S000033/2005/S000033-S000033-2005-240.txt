 Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of this body, and the Nation, the wonderful work that has been done by the Northeast Organic Farming Association (NOFA), and in particular the wonderful work its affiliate does in Vermont.  In a time when the family farm is under great destructive pressures, in a time when agribusiness blindly ignores the potential for damage that accompanies chemical pesticides and GMOs, in a time when corporate agriculture ignores the need to sustain and replenish the soil that sustains life, there are those who fight to maintain a good, healthy, ongoing source of food for all of us.  NOFA Vermont has been fighting, and continues to fight, for family farms, for responsible husbandry of the soil, for a secure and healthful food supply.  NOFA Vermont has been in existence for over 30 years, and is one of the oldest organic farming associations in the entire United States. The Vermont chapter, one of seven state chapters in the northeastern region of the United States, currently has over 1,000 members. It has been a sustaining force for the 333 certified organic growers and producers in our New England state. They sell their produce and products in 52 farmers markets in Vermont, to local groceries and food stores, to grocery chains operating in Vermont, and indeed to distributors nationwide. In an especially noteworthy development, they have forged new relations with local buyers, and new distribution networks, through the formation of 42 Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farms which provide food directly to consumers on an ongoing and regular basis.  NOFA Vermont's dual commitment is to local agriculture and to organic agriculture. It strives to be a steward of the soil, a preserver of the ongoing vitality of the environment, a proponent for healthy and nutritious foods. Through education, organic certification and technical assistance it strengthens the agricultural community in Vermont. Through its efforts to sustain community food security, and to promote both the marketing of organic products and the development of new markets, like the farmers markets and CSAs I mentioned a few minutes ago, it builds a stronger presence for healthful foods in Vermont.  It is important that we take time to recognize the individuals and organizations which not only nourish--in every way--our present, but look forward with vision to creating a strong and sustainable world for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. NOFA Vermont, and its hundreds of members, nourish us and show us the shape of a vital, vibrant and human-centered future.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E7]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            ORGANIC FARMING IS ALIVE AND THRIVING IN VERMONT                                 ______                                                           HON.
