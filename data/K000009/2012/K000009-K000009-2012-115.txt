Speaker, my first reaction upon reading Dr. Gordon Gee's denigrating comments about the Polish Army was to see red--blood red.  As a Polish American, I fail to see the humor when the president of The Ohio State University described bureaucratic turf battles at his school with administrators ``shooting each other'' as ``kind of like the Polish Army.'' His comments revealed not only insensitivity to the suffering of the Polish people over the past two centuries, but a shocking lack of knowledge of history. Surely, the leader of a major institution of higher learning should know better.                              {time}  1040  Ohio State, after all, is home to the Center for Slavic and East European Studies.  Having spent my public career trying to overcome ethnic stereotyping, I thought about how to respond: Do I hold a press conference? Do I make an official statement? The Polish American Congress quickly demanded, received, and accepted an apology from President Gee.  But I kept thinking about my dear friend Colonel Marian Wojciechowski, a true hero of Poland and America, who died last year at age 97. I have known the Wojciechowski family for almost half a century. Marian's brilliant daughter Mary Ann was my friend in high school and the valedictorian of our class at St. Ursula Academy in Toledo.  Her father, Marian, had commanded a Polish Army cavalry platoon at the place where World War II started on land September 1, 1939. Against impossible odds, the Polish Army secured a tactical victory in the battle of Mokra. There was nothing disorganized or chaotic about Marian's home unit, the 21st Regiment Pulku Ulanow Nadwisclankich, which eventually was awarded the Virtuti Militari, Poland's highest military honor.  No, President Gee, the Polish soldiers at Mokra did not shoot at each other. In fact, they inflicted surprisingly heavy losses against the more heavily equipped Nazi invaders, who lost 800 men. Eventually, the Poles' situation deteriorated, as they ran low on ammunition and medicine. No Western country came to their aid. No Western country. The infantry commander considered surrendering, but the cavalry commander ordered a charge. Polish cavalry soldiers bravely drew their swords, positioned their artillery, and heroically charged German positions, even though they were hopelessly overmatched by mechanized blitzkrieg forces on the land, including two Panzer divisions, and Luftwaffe planes in the air.  A fellow soldier from Marian's hometown of Polaniec thought Marian had been killed and reported the sad news to Marian's family who held a funeral for him. But in fact, Marian had survived, had moved east with his remaining cavalry forces to fight the Red Army that attacked Poland 3 weeks later on the Russian front, on September 17. My friend Marian was grazed in the head by a Russian bullet.  He then joined the underground resistance for over 2 years in such dangerous work until he was arrested, brutally tortured, sent to Auschwitz in Death Block 11, and then transferred to Gross-Rosen and finally to Leitmeritz in 1945, from which he escaped. I must mention that the woman who had accidentally revealed his name was beheaded by Nazi forces.  Of course Poland, which had been partitioned by adjoining empires since the late 18th Century for daring to write its own democratic Constitution in 1791--2 years after our own and upon which it was modeled--was devastated by World War II. Poland lost a higher percentage of her population than any other nation, approximately one in five people. Cities such as Warsaw were razed because their people fought unrelentingly until they were subdued.  Fleeing to Germany and a U.S. Army-run refugee camp, Marian met his life-long love, Wladyslawa Poniencka, a Polish girl scout and also a member of the women's Underground resistance. She and her family had been arrested in Warsaw and sent to the notorious Pawiak Prison and then she to Ravensbruck where unspeakable experiments were performed on her while all of her closet relatives were killed. Marian and Wladyslawa married. They had their first child, my friend, and immigrated to America in 1950 under the Displaced Persons Act. They were sponsored by Marian's cousin in Toledo. They raised their family. And he published a Polish language newspaper Ameryka-Echo in Toledo, for more than 7 years. He also built a career in neighborhood community development, working until age 80.  Like Generals Kosciusko and Pulaski, Colonel Marian Wojciechowski dedicated his life to the cause of liberty and community building. He was an extraordinary man. In different times, I think he might have been president of Poland. He surely should have run for office here.  I am going to send a copy of the book ``Seven Paths to Freedom,'' edited by Miroslawa Zawadzka and Andrezj Zawadzki, to President Gee. I hope he reads it. It's over time for the President of Ohio State University to show reverence and respect for Poland's heroic struggle for liberty.                                    The Kosciuszko Foundation,                                                     New York, NY.     Subject: Ohio State President Gordon Gee Must Be Reprimanded          For Polish Slur.     Chairman Leslie H. Wexner,     Board of Trustees, Ohio State University, Bricker Hall,          Columbus, OH.       Dear Chairman Wexner and Trustees of Ohio State University:      As a son of Polish war heroes, I ask that you publicly      admonish University President Gordon Gee for his unacceptable      comment that your staff, ``were shooting at each other . . .      like the Polish Army.'' In addition, the Board of Trustees      must truly serve the 465,000 Polish-Americans living in Ohio      by funding classes on Polish history at the University. With      a President who lacks erudition, how can you expect to      educate your students about World history, or Poland?       I can assure Mr. Gee that my father, Corp. Dionizy      Storozynski was shooting straight as a motorcycle scout for a      Polish tank division during the allied invasion of Normandy.      Afterwards, he was awarded the Polish Army Medal, and three      medals from the British Army. And I can assure Mr. Gee that      my grandfather, Sgt. Wladyslaw Krzyzanowski was shooting      straight when his Polish regiment, the Anders' Army, helped      drive the Germans from North Africa, and when he destroyed      two German tanks in the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy. For      this he received three Polish medals and three British      medals. And I can assure Mr. Gee that the Polish WWII pilots      that set records in accuracy in destroying German Luftwaffe      planes during the Battle for Britain were shooting straight.       It's Mr. Gee who is not a straight shooter. Gee has made a      half-hearted apology. That is not enough. Gee has a history      of putting his feet in his mouth and having to apologize. Yet      the Ohio State Board of Trustees has made him the highest      paid college president in the United States, paying him $1.6      million annually.       As Trustees, you are the governing body for a state      university in a state that has nearly half a million Polish-     American taxpayers and voters. Yet you offer few classes in      Polish language and literature, and no classes in Polish      history. With your university receiving $493 million in state      appropriations and $426 million in other government funding      in 2012, surely you can afford to rectify this situation.      This should be put on the agenda for your next Board of      Trustees meeting on Feb. 9.       After Mr. Gee made his unenlightened comment, he said,      ``Who did I embarrass now?'' For starters, Mr. Gee      embarrassed himself and Ohio State University. This is also      an embarrassment to United States foreign policy.       With thousands of Polish soldiers who have served in Iraq      and Afghanistan, Gee's comments have caused a stir in Poland.      And the Polish soldiers supporting the American mission in      Afghanistan will not be pleased with Mr. Gee's benighted      opinion. Poland's Special Forces unit shut down oilrigs in      the Persian Gulf during the invasion of Iraq, and the Polish      Army played a major role in the war.       When I traveled to Iraq in 2006 to write an article for the      New York Sun, U.S. Army lieutenant general, Peter Chiarelli,      told me that the Polish troops ``are doing an absolutely      outstanding job. They've been one of the most steadfast      members of the coalition. And these are two of the most      peaceful provinces in all of Iraq, Diwaniyah and Wasit. And      that's largely attributable to the great leadership of      successive Polish generals who have come down here and the      Polish units who have served here.''       The Polish Army has made major contributions to European      and American history. King Jan Sobieski turned back the      Ottoman Empire during the Siege of Vienna in 1863 when the      Turks invaded Europe and tried to turn it into a Muslim      colony. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the largest      country in Europe at the time and Sobieski's Hussar Knights      were the most feared soldiers in Europe.       The President of a major university should also know the      military contributions of Poles to this country. The Father      of the American Cavalry, Gen. Casimir Pulaski saved George      Washington's life at the Battle of Brandywine. Gen. Thaddeus      Kosciuszko built the largest fortress in America, West Point      and suggested putting a military academy there. That was      before he devised the plans for the Battle of Saratoga, the      turning point of the American Revolution. And Abraham Lincoln      appointed Wlodzimierz Krzyzanowski Brigadier General in the      Union Army during the Civil War. Would Abe Lincoln have      picked a Polish general if he could not shoot straight?       Mr. Gee further exposed his ignorance about Poland when      after his witless comments about the Polish Army he told the      crowd at the Columbus Metropolitan Club, ``Oh, never mind,      who did I embarrass now? I'll have to raise money for Poland      now.''       If Mr. Gee read the Wall Street Journal he would know that      despite Europe's financial woes, over the past several years,      Poland has had one of the fastest growing economies in      Europe. So no, Poland does not need Mr. Gee to help it raise      money. But he can help himself by curing his foot-in-mouth      disease and working to rehabilitate his image with the many      Polish-Americans in your state.       Here's where he can start. Thaddeus Kosciuszko was given      500 acres on the Scioto River in Ohio by the Founding Fathers      for his exemplary service in the American Revolution. That      original tract of land borders the Ohio State University      campus in Columbus. Today, part of that land is the Riverside      Drive Park in Dublin, Ohio, and in May the city will rename      it Thaddeus Kosciuszko Park. In addition to his military      service, Kosciuszko put his money where his mouth was when it      came to standing up for liberty. Kosciuszko donated his      salary from the American Revolution, $17,000 and asked that      it be used to purchase slaves, and to free and educate them.       Kosciuszko was a virtuous straight shooter who did the      right thing. If Mr. Gee is as much of a straight shooter as      Polish soldiers, and has any semblance of decency, he should      pay to erect a statue of Kosciuszko in that park. With a      salary of $1.6 million per year, Mr. Gee can clearly afford      it.                                             Alex Storozynski,                                   President & Executive Director,     The American Center for Polish Culture.                                  ____                                              Piast Institute,                                  Hamtramck, MI, January 17, 2012.     President E. Gordon Gee,     The Ohio State University, Bricker Hall, Columbus, OH.       Dear President Gee: I like many others both inside and      outside the Polish American community, was surprised and      dismayed by your remarks that played off deeply offensive      stereotypes of Poles and Polish Americans. I am glad that you      have recognized the inappropriateness of your statements and      have tendered an apology. Nevertheless, it is disheartening      that such remarks should come from the President of one of      America's major universities. It shows that our society still      has a long way to go in dispelling prejudice.       I am sure that you and the university's trustees have also      received quite a number of letters detailing at some length      the story of Poland as source of a world-class culture, a      distinguished democratic tradition, courageous soldiers who      have fought consistently for freedom for themselves and      others and an unparalleled contribution to the history of      liberty and human dignity in our time, through the efforts of      heroes such as John Paul II and Lech Walesa.       Many of those who have written have asked for redress in      the form of greater attention to the history of Poland and      Polish Americans in courses and programs at The Ohio State      University. Such projects would indeed help the people of      Ohio better appreciate the contribution of Poland to world      civilization and to give students a valuable historical and      cultural perspective on universal issues such as human      dignity, the price of liberty, and the various dimensions of      tolerance, pluralism and non-violence. The Piast Institute      heartily supports such a program, which is at the heart of      its mission.       Nevertheless, such a program no matter how far reaching,      will be of limited success unless it also addresses deep-     seated negative images of Poles and Poland that lie buried in      our culture. It will be hard for most people to even hear,      let alone incorporate more positive images of Poland and      Poles until these are attacked and extirpated. As Malgorzata      Warchol-Schlottmann pointed out in her study of stereotypes      of Poles in German culture ``Positive personal experiences or      empirical knowledge of Poland did not modify the      stereotypical images''. On the basis of my experience, I      believe that the same is true of American culture.       I do not think that you picked the image of incompetent      Polish soldiers shooting at each other at random out of thin      air. It would have left your listeners puzzled if you had      chosen 'The Norwegian army'' as your example. You were      drawing, certainly without deep reflection, perhaps ever      reflexively on deeply embedded negative images of Poles and      Poland in American culture.       These stereotypes took shape in Europe in the 18th century      as part of propaganda by Prussia, Russia and Austria to      justify their unprecedented partition of Poland and the      destruction of the Polish constitution. They were later used      to justify Nazi genocide against Poles. Those images were      transmitted to America in the 19th century and became a      distinct American bigotry in response to the large influx to      Polish immigrants. Those stereotypes still exist and have      power. This is clear from the fact that a President of a      major American university could invoke them so unthinkingly      and cavalierly.       I would hope that any program to provide redress would also      include a mandate to examine the character and roots of anti-     Polonism in courses and special programs designed to deal      with racism, bigotry and prejudice in American Society. The      Piast Institute, which is a national research and policy      institute, would be pleased to assist in curriculum      development and materials for such classes and programs.       We maintain close ties with the Polish community in Ohio      and have worked with them on educational and cultural      programs as well as providing demographic analysis of the      Polish American population in Cleveland and Akron. The work      of the Institute on such projects as our national survey of      1,400 Polish American leaders published as Polish Americans      Today (2010) and our work in preparing curricula for the      genocide curriculum in the California schools and for the      National Catholic Holocaust Education Center at Seton Hill      College has given us unparalleled recognition in Polish      American communities and among their leaders. I also served      for eight years as President of St. Mary's College founded by      Polish immigrants and for many years a national center for      Polish studies in the U.S.       I look forward to working with you and the university to      turn this unfortunate event into a positive project to lessen      prejudice and create a genuine pluralism at Ohio State as      well as to build bridges to the half a million Polish      Americans who live in Ohio and the 10 million Polish      Americans in the United States.           Sincerely yours,                                   Thaddeus C. Radzilowski, Ph.D.,     President.                          ____________________
