Chief Justice, and I appreciate the courtesy of my good friend from Mississippi, I notice, as he has, that there are a lot of empty seats here in the Chamber. I realize at one time we thought we were coming in at noon, to have committee meetings.  If these statements are not made in the Record, the only time we are going to have a chance to discuss with each other what our thoughts are is in this closed session, by being here. I also think, in respect to the Chief Justice, we should be doing that.  I am inclined, I would say to my friend from Mississippi, to suggest the absence of a quorum. I am withholding, just for a moment, doing that. But if we are going to be off in committee meetings, I don't think that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing.  I hope that both leaders--and I have discussed this with the distinguished Democratic leader, too--would urge Members to be here. Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and tomorrow.
