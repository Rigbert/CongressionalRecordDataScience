                          Health Care Reform  Mr. President, last week, I came to the Senate floor to talk about the flawed process of our current attempts to reform the health care system in this country and the urgent need to fix those flaws.  Those efforts included a letter--my letter--which every Republican member of the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--signed requesting some very reasonable steps to be taken by Chairman Baucus, Chairman Kennedy, and Senator Dodd, who is standing in for our friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy.  We asked the chairmen to release the details of their plans to reform health care. We asked them to do so in a timely manner to allow us time to read and understand the policies and to get reactions from our constituents, i.e., the people who will benefit or will not benefit, not to mention the providers of health care. We asked them to give us the estimates of how much their plans would cost and how it would impact everyday Americans. Finally, we asked them to identify how they intended to pay for these plans.  It was my sincere hope that by receiving this information we could better participate in the quest to ensure that every American--every American--has meaningful access to health care, not to mention patient choice.  Well, unfortunately, the health care reform process has been so corrupted by artificial timelines and a ``hurry up'' and a ``riding hell for leather'' mentality that it threatens to destroy a health care system that has served most Americans very well.
