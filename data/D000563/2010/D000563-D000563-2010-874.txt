President, I have spoken with Senator Coburn, and he and I reached an agreement about which I will propound a unanimous consent request.  I ask unanimous consent that the time between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. be evenly divided between his side and our side in 15-minute segments; the first 15-minute segment will be for our side, the Democratic side, for those Members wishing to speak in favor of the 30-day extension; the next 30 minutes to Senator Coburn on the Republican side for those sharing his position; and the last 15 minutes back to our side until we reach the end of this debate at 9:30 p.m.
