S. role, but also for what the prospect is that it can yield an agreement in just a few more days or a few weeks. Far too much time has been lost.  Israel and the Palestinians have been stuck for months on how to complete the interim agreements launched by the Oslo process, so that they can move on to the critical final status talks. These interim talks deal with hard and important questions: How much of the West Bank Israel will redeploy from, what steps the Palestinian Authority will take to ensure a sustained crackdown on terrorist groups, how the security services of the two sides will work together to prevent acts of terrorism, and the understanding that both sides must refrain from unilateral actions that undermine the other side's confidence in the peace process.  Nothing about these talks is easy, but the time has long since come for both sides to take politically difficult, but fundamentally necessary, decisions that will allow this process to move forward. Israel's security and Palestinian dreams of self-determination can only be realized through a mutually agreed permanent peace agreement.  To the extent that today's meeting and the talks set for upcoming days represent a chance to complete the interim agreements and begin final status talks, there is reason for hope. The final status talks--which are supposed to be completed by May 4, 1999, but will probably take much longer--are going to be difficult enough. They will deal with the hardest questions of all: sovereignty, settlements, refugees, water, and Jerusalem.  Every day these final status talks are delayed, they only become more difficult. Every day they are delayed, the temptation on each side to take unilateral measures only increases. Every day they are delayed is another opportunity for extremists on each side to use violence to try to destroy the chances for peace altogether.  If the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority are truly committed to peace, as I believe they are, they cannot let that happen. They must work hard in the next several days to complete the interim agreement, and then move quickly to make progress in the final status talks.  At this season of renewal in the Jewish calendar, when a new year and new beginnings are at hand, it is my hope and prayer that a new day may at last be dawning in the lives of Israelis and Palestinians. For that to happen, their leaders, with the strong support of the United States, must act to now to seize the opportunities that are before them.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                               September 24, 1998.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: As American Jews dedicated to Israel's      security and to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, we want to      express our appreciation for your steadfast commitment to the      Jewish state and its quest for a secure peace.       As you face the many formidable challenges confronting your      Administration and our country, we urge you to reestablish      the Middle East peace process as an urgent American priority.      We believe it is important for the U.S. to encourage Israel      and the Palestinian Authority to redouble their efforts to      achieve an agreement on further Israeli redeployment and      enhanced security measures as soon as possible. The longer      this process drags on inconclusively, the greater the danger      of a total collapse of the entire peace process, which      inevitably will lead to more violence and bloodshed.       We have been strongly supportive of your Administration's      efforts to narrow the gaps between the two parties and help      them to reach an agreement. As in past Arab-Israeli      negotiations, the American role in getting both sides to say      yes is indispensable. Although mediating this complex dispute      can be a thankless task, and some naysayers may urge you to      put the peace process on the back burner, now is not the time      to stop searching for ways to help both peoples resolve their      differences.       The success of the peace process is, in our view, crucial      to Israel's long-term security and the strategic interests of      the United States. Polls consistently show that this position      reflects the widespread feeling in the American Jewish      community. We hope that, buoyed by this support, you will      keep striving to remove obstacles from the road to a secure      Arab-Israeli peace.
