President, today I join Senator Isakson in introducing the Tanning Accountability and Notification (TAN) Act.  Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. While the decline in cancer deaths reported earlier this year is an indication that we are starting to turn the corner on our fight against cancer, approximately 1 million people will be diagnosed with skin cancer and 10,850 are expected to die in 2007 alone.  There are many factors that contribute to these startling figures. In recent years efforts have been undertaken by various organizations to better inform the public about the risk of sun exposure and ways to decrease the chance of developing skin cancer. One area, however, where better information is sorely needed is on the use of indoor tanning salons.  Every day approximately 1 million people visit a tanning salon. It is a practice particularly popular among teens, the group that seems most at risk from the effects of indoor tanning. The American Academy of Dermatology, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the World Health Organization, WHO, all discourage the use of indoor tanning equipment.  This message and the current information about the risks of indoor tanning I fear are not being adequately passed on to consumers. The FDA has not updated its warnings on tanning beds since 1979. Regular users of indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed.  The TAN Act calls upon the FDA to revisit the current label on indoor tanning beds and determine through a process of public hearings and consumer testing what kind of labeling requirements would convey important information on the risks of indoor tanning.  This legislation is not about introducing new regulations but ensuring that the current FDA regulations remain effective in communicating accurate, current, and clear information to consumers about indoor tanning salons.  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward passage of this bipartisan legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 668       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Tanning Accountability and      Notification Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. REPORT BY FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGARDING                    LABELING INFORMATION ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN                    USE OF INDOOR TANNING DEVICES AND DEVELOPMENT                    OF SKIN CANCER OR OTHER SKIN DAMAGE.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting      through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall determine--       (1) whether the labeling requirements for indoor tanning      devices, including the positioning requirements, provide      sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that      the use of such devices pose for the development of      irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin      cancer; and       (2)(A) whether adding the warning suggested by the American      Academy of Dermatology to the current warning label, or any     other additional warning, would communicate the risks of      indoor tanning more effectively; or       (B) whether there is no warning that would be capable of      adequately communicating such risks.       (b) Consumer Testing.--In making the determinations under      subsection (a), the Secretary shall conduct appropriate      consumer testing, using the best available methods for      determining consumer understanding of label warnings.       (c) Public Hearings; Public Comment.--The Secretary shall      hold public hearings and solicit comments from the public in      making the determinations under subsection (a).       (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the      Congress a report that provides the determinations under      subsection (a). In addition, the Secretary shall include in      the report the measures being implemented by the Secretary to      significantly reduce the risks associated with indoor tanning      devices.                                 ______                                       By
