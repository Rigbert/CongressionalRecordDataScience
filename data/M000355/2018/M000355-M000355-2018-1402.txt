 President, an important tribute took place in the Capitol this morning--the fifth annual memorial service for the four U.S. Capitol police officers who have died in the line of duty. Sergeant Christopher Eney, Officer Jacob Chestnut, Detective John Gibson, and Sergeant Clinton Holtz were remembered with a wreath-laying in the Capitol Visitor Center.  This year's ceremony marked the 20th anniversary of the 1998 Capitol shooting, when both Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were killed. Next week is National Police Week, and I will have more to say about the heroism of the professionals who put themselves in harm's way every day to keep others safe. Today the Senate honors the memories of these four fallen heroes.  Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, the Senate advanced the nomination of the first of this week's judicial nominees, Judge Kurt Engelhardt. Those who join him on this latest slate for consideration are each well qualified. Each has received thorough examination from the Judiciary Committee, and each stands ready to serve on the Federal bench.                     Nomination of Michael Brennan  Following the confirmation of Judge Engelhardt, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of Michael Brennan of Wisconsin to serve as a U.S. circuit judge for the Seventh Circuit. Mr. Brennan's nomination comes as only the latest distinction in a career marked by truly impressive legal accomplishments. In both public service and private practice, this graduate of Notre Dame and Northwestern University School of Law has developed a reputation for a keen legal mind and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law.  According to current and former peers on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Mr. Brennan has ``the mind, heart and soul of a great jurist'' and a ``keen understanding of the legal issues in sophisticated and complex litigation.''  Like Judge Engelhardt, Mr. Brennan has my full support, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm another fine nominee this week.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, on a final matter, it seems that every day brings another piece of good news for middle-class workers and families and, like clockwork, another desperate attempt bymy Democratic colleagues to convince everyone that this growing tide of new prosperity is somehow a bad thing.  In the last few weeks alone, the percentage of Americans who are unemployed, underemployed, or who have given up finding a job has dropped to a 17-year low. Recently, new jobless claims reached their lowest level since 1969, and the total number of Americans who are receiving unemployment benefits is as small as it has been since--listen to this--1973.  Let me put that another way. Notwithstanding 45 years of population growth, there are fewer total Americans receiving unemployment benefits under President Trump and this Republican Congress than at any other point under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, or Obama. We all know economic indicators can be volatile, and Washington is far from the only force behind them. In fact, getting the Federal Government out of the way is often the solution.
