Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the information on the schedule for next week.  I would ask him, with respect to Korea, that being on the floor--also, as I understand it, the committee has been working on a Syria sanctions bill. Obviously both of those areas are critically important.  Does the gentleman have any information when we might anticipate the Syria resolution coming forward as well?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. This is a critical area and one that we do want to make sure we speak with one voice and a bipartisan voice.  I have spoken to the committee chairman. He is continuing to work on this. And I anticipate, not next week but in the future, that coming to the floor.
