Speaker, thank goodness some Americans continue to analyze the real causes of job loss and turmoil in our economy. While all eyes are on Europe, the problem just isn't in Greece.  On October 31, U.S.-based MF Global Holdings, Limited filed for chapter 11. It reportedly is the eighth largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its failure, like the crash in 2008, revolves around the actions of money traders using slick instruments called ``credit derivatives.'' As analysts try to piece together what happened at MF Global, one word seems to keep popping up: fraud.  I would like to include in the Record a few recent articles on the Wall Street perpetrators of this crisis.                      [From Reuters, Nov. 7, 2011]                Frustration Mounts for MF Global Clients                        (By Lauren Tara LaCapra)       The sudden collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd is leaving      some small and independent futures traders angry and      frustrated.       Customers of the bankrupt firm are starting to complain      about getting checks that bounced, having requests to      transfer funds denied and receiving inaccurate account      statements.       The growing litany of woes is adding to the tasks for the      receiver assigned to liquidate MF Global and causing some      investors to voice concern about the basic plumbing of the      financial services system.       Steve Meyers, an independent futures trader in Florida,      said he asked for $500,000 from his MF Global account to be      wired back to him on October 28 because he was concerned      about the firm filing for bankruptcy.       The money never was wired.       Instead, on November 2, Meyers received several checks from      MF Global that were dated October 28. By the time he went to      deposit the checks, MF Global had filed for bankruptcy on      October 31 and the checks were not honored for payment.       Between himself and several clients he manages money for,      Meyers said he has several millions of dollars still tied up      with MF Global.       ``I am sitting with hundreds of thousands of dollars in      returned checks,'' said Meyers. ``I just think the industry      has suffered irreparable damage from this.''       Other clients of the firm led by former New Jersey Governor      Jon Corzine are telling similar stories.       Chris Ries, who co-manages a commodities brokerage and      grain dealer in Iowa that cleared trades through MF Global,      said several clients had checks bounce even though they      deposited them before MF Global's bankruptcy on October 31.       The situation has been made worse, he said, because      customers' account balances appear as though they received      the cash even though the checks did not clear.       ``Eventually it may all get cleared up,'' said Ries, ``but      for now, accounts with bounced checks don't reflect the      balance that they should.''     Missing $600 Million       Some clients' checks were drawn on an MF Global account      held at a Harris Bank branch in Illinois. Harris Bank is a      subsidiary of Bank of Montreal.       Jim Kappel, a spokesman for Harris, said the bank began      denying payment and returning checks on November 1, at the      direction of the bankruptcy trustee. While some checks might      have been dated before October 31, he said, they were likely      debited at a later date.       Clients' issues with bounced checks come as MF Global and      its regulators continue to hunt for $600 million in client      money that has gone missing. It is not clear if some of the      bounced checks are part of the unaccounted money.       It appears MF Global began issuing checks to customers      seeking funds--instead of wiring the money--as a way to buy      some time for the firm, which was hoping to arrange a last-     minute sale to Interactive Brokers, some of the customers      say. The deal fell apart last Monday when the issue of the      missing customer money arose.       A week later, regulators have yet to provide an answer on      what became of the missing $600 million, although some money      has been located in an account with JPMorgan Chase.       Brokers who cleared through MF Global say they have been      allowed to move some of their money to new firms, but not all      of it. They have been waiting for guidance from the trustee      or regulators on when they will get access to all of their      funds.     Frustration       MF Global's trustee, James Giddens, had frozen 150,000      accounts when the firm filed for bankruptcy protection.       On Monday, Giddens said $1.5 billion worth of client money      had been transferred to other firms. But the trustee and CME      Group Inc, which regulates futures exchanges, have held back      some $1 billion in customer funds as they search for the      missing money, angering clients who can trade again but are      still frozen out of their excess collateral and cash.       ``We can understand the frustration of customers,'' Kent      Jarrell, a spokesman for the trustee, told Reuters. ``That is      why we are working around the clock to facilitate the      transfer and return of customer assets. Unfortunately, this      will take time as we conduct our independent and thorough      investigation and maximize the estate for all stakeholders in      a fair process.''       Some traders who tried to move their money from MF Global      to other clearing firms or banks even before the company went      belly-up have also been left in the lurch.       One independent options trader in Chicago said he placed a      wire request on the morning of October 28 to transfer $1.25      million from MF Global to JPMorgan Chase.       The transfer never occurred.       An MF Global representative said JPMorgan rejected the      transfer because of errors in the account number, the trader      said, but upon double-checking the wire request form he found      no mistakes. The funds have remained frozen at MF Global      since its bankruptcy, he said.       ``We pretty much have zero clarity,'' said the trader, who      did not want to be identified. ``I have a feeling the wire      instructions probably just got lost in the turmoil.''                              {time}  1100  In a recent posting, attorney William Black describes the failure of our justice system to investigate ``accounting control fraud as a systemic risk that underlies the damage still being done.''  The collapse of MF Global has garnered massive attention, partly because Jon Corzine sat at its helm. Mr. Corzine is a former chief executive officer of infamous Goldman Sachs. He is also a former U.S. Senator and formerGovernor of New Jersey. Mr. Corzine's firm even held a special status as a primary dealer at the New York Federal Reserve. That's like the Good Housekeeping stamp of approval. Mr. Corzine isn't the only former government leader whose cozy relationship with the financial services industry is being publicly questioned.  Former Speaker of this House Newt Gingrich appears to have had a significant financial relationship with Freddie Mac, one of the mortgage industry giants led by its management into financial ruin. Freddie Mac played a key role in the financial meltdown. As countless American families have lost their homes, Freddie Mac assumed the toxic assets that were handed to it from the banks. And it is now under conservatorship of the Federal Government, living off the taxpayer dime. Mr. Gingrich is apparently $1.8 million richer, though he claims he isn't sure how much Freddie paid him.  I now see why Congress has consistently failed to investigate what happened at Freddie Mac along with Fannie Mae to determine exactly what decisions, by whom--by whom and when led to this financial ruin. I have a bill to do just that. H.R. 2093, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Commission Act. It's well past time to pass it, and I invite Members to join me in this effort.  The allegations against MF Global are serious. Mr. Corzine's firm had essentially placed a $6.3 billion bet on the sovereign debt of several European governments. After its most recent quarterly returns showed almost $200 million in losses, MF Global's stock lost 67 percent of its value. But this is not just a case of an investment firm being lured by the higher returns of riskier bonds. CME Group, Inc., who audited MF Global's accounts, found that Mr. Corzine's company violated key requirements to keep its accounts separate from its clients'. The details are still being sorted out, but as much as $600 million appears to be missing from customer accounts.  The financial press is reporting a staggering amount of malfeasance in the days before MF Global filed for bankruptcy. In an apparent effort to buy themselves time, MF Global sent checks instead of wiring money. The checks turned out to be bogus. There are stories of requests to transfer funds being denied and even inaccurate account statements being issued. Even more egregious are accounts of people receiving bounced checks, going back and finding that their accounts were also altered inappropriately. If this isn't fraud, what is?  What should concern all of us is the knowledge that fraud is not limited to a case here or there. In the financial services sector, fraud has become systemic. In 2009, the FBI testified before the House Judiciary Committee, ``The current financial crisis has produced one unexpected consequence: It has exposed prevalent fraud schemes that have been thriving in the global financial system. These fraud schemes are not new, but they are coming to light as a result of market deterioration.''  This isn't the first time our country has seen a massive crime wave in the financial services industry. In the 1980s, it was the savings and loan crisis, and the FBI responded with a staff of 1,000 agents and forensic experts based in 27 cities. That crisis was much smaller than what we are seeing today, yet today the FBI only has a couple hundred agents able to investigate. I have a bill, H.R. 1350, that asks that number to be increased by 1,000. I ask my colleagues to help cosponsor it, and let's bring some reason and prudence back to the financial markets of our country and let's exact real justice for the American people.  The Virgin Crisis: Systematically Ignoring Fraud as a Systemic Risk                         (By William K. Black)       One of the most revealing things about this crisis is the      unwillingness to investigate whether ``accounting control      fraud'' was a major contributor to the crisis. The refusal to      even consider a major role for fraud is facially bizarre. The      banking expert James Pierce found that fraud by senior      insiders was, historically, the leading cause of major bank      failures in the United States. The national commission that      investigated the cause of the S&L debacle found:       ``The typical large failure [grew] at an extremely rapid      rate, achieving high concentrations of assets in risky      ventures. . . . [E]very accounting trick available was used.      . . . Evidence of fraud was invariably present as was the      ability of the operators to ``milk'' the organization.''      (NCFIRRE 1993) Two of the nation's top economists'' study of      the S&L debacle led them to conclude that the S&L regulators      were correct--financial deregulation could be dangerously      criminogenic. That understanding would allow us to avoid      similar future crises. ``Neither the public nor economists      foresaw that [S&L deregulation was] bound to produce looting.      Nor, unaware of the concept, could they have known how      serious it would be. Thus the regulators in the field who      understood what was happening from the beginning found      lukewarm support, at best, for their cause. Now we know      better. If we learn from experience, history need not repeat      itself' (George Akerlof & Paul Romer. ``Looting: the Economic      Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit.'' 1993: 60).       The epidemic of accounting control fraud that drove the      second phase of the S&L debacle (the first phase was caused      by interest rate risk) was followed by an epidemic of      accounting control fraud that produced the Enron era frauds.       The FBI warned in September 2004 that there was an      ``epidemic'' of mortgage fraud and predicted that it would      cause a financial ``crisis'' if it were not contained. The      mortgage banking industry's own anti-fraud experts reported      in writing to nearly every mortgage lender in 2006 that:       ``Stated income and reduced documentation loans speed up      the approval process, but they are open invitations to      fraudsters.'' ``When the stated incomes were compared to the      IRS figures: [90%] of the stated incomes were exaggerated by      5% or more. [A]lmost 60% were exaggerated by more than 50%.      [T]he stated income loan deserves the nickname used by many      in the industry, the `liar's loan' '' (MARI 2006).       We know that accounting control fraud is itself      criminogenic--fraud begets fraud. The fraudulent CEOs      deliberately create the perverse incentives that that suborn      inside and outside employees and professionals. We have known      for four decades how these perverse incentives produce      endemic fraud by generating a ``Gresham's'' dynamic in which      bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace.       ``[D]ishonest dealings tend to drive honest dealings out of      the market. The cost of dishonesty, therefore, lies not only      in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated; the cost      also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate      business out of existence.'' George Akerlof (1970).       Akerlof noted this dynamic in his seminal article on      markets for ``lemons,'' which led to the award of the Nobel      Prize in Economics in 2001. It is the giants of economics who      have confirmed what the S&L regulators and criminologists      observed when we systematically ``autopsied'' each S&L      failure to investigate its causes. Modern executive      compensation has made accounting control fraud vastly more      criminogenic than it once was as investigators of the current      crisis have confirmed.       ``Over the last several years, the subprime market has      created a race to the bottom in which unethical actors have      been handsomely rewarded for their misdeeds and ethical      actors have lost market share. . . . The market incentives      rewarded irresponsible lending and made it more difficult for      responsible lenders to compete.'' Miller, T. J. (August 14,      2007). Iowa AG.       Liar's loans offer what we call a superb ``natural      experiment.'' No honest mortgage lender would make a liar's      loan because such loans have a sharply negative expected      value. Not underwriting creates intense ``adverse      selection.'' We know that it was overwhelmingly the lenders      and their agents that put the lies in liar's loans and the      lenders created the perverse compensation incentives that led      their agents to lie about the borrowers' income and to      inflate appraisals. We know that appraisal fraud was endemic      and only agents and their lenders can commit widespread      appraisal fraud. Iowa Attorney General Miller's      investigations found:       ``[Many originators invent] non-existent occupations or      income sources, or simply inflat[e] income totals to support      loan applications. Importantly, our investigations have found      that most stated income fraud occurs at the suggestion and      direction of the loan originator, not the consumer.''       New York Attorney General (now Governor) Cuomo's      investigations revealed that Washington Mutual (one of the      leaders in making liar's loans) developed a blacklist of      appraisers--who refused to inflate appraisals. No honest      mortgage lender would ever inflate an appraisal or permit      widespread appraisal inflation by its agents. Surveys of      appraisers confirm that there was widespread pressure by      nonprime lenders and their agents to inflate appraisals.       We also know that the firms that made and purchased liar's      loans followed the respective accounting control fraud      ``recipes'' that maximize fictional short-term reported      income, executive compensation, and (real) losses. Those      recipes have four ingredients:       1. Grow like crazy       2. By making (or purchasing) poor quality loans at a      premium yield       3. While employing extreme leverage, and       4. Providing only grossly inadequate allowances for loan      and lease losses (ALLL) against the losses inherent in making      or purchasing liars loans       Firms that follow these recipes are not ``gamblers'' and      they are not taking ``risks.'' Akerlof & Romer, the S&L      regulators, and criminologists recognize that this recipe      provides a ``sure thing.'' The exceptional (albeit     fictional) income, real bonuses, and real losses are all sure      things for accounting control frauds.       Liar's loans are superb ``ammunition'' for accounting      control frauds because they (and appraisal fraud) allow the      fraudulent mortgage lenders and their agents to attain the      unholy fraud trinity: (1) the lender can charge a substantial      premium yield, (2) on a loan that appears to relatively lower      risk because the lender has inflated the borrowers' income      and the appraisal, while (3) eliminating the incriminating      evidence of fraud that real underwriting of the borrowers'      income and salary would normally place in the loan files. The      government did not require any entity to make or purchase      liar's loans (and that includes Fannie and Freddie). The      states and the federal government frequently criticized      liar's loans. Fannie and Freddie purchased liar's loans for      the same reasons that Merrill, Lehman, Bear Stearns, etc.      acquired liar's loans--they were accounting control frauds      and liar's loans (and CDOs backed by liar's loans) were the      best available ammunition for maximizing their fictional      reported income and real bonuses.       Liar's loans were large enough to hyper-inflate the bubble      and drive the crisis. They increased massively from 2003-     2007.       ``[B]etween 2003 and 2006 . . . subprime and Alt-A [loans      grew] 94 and 340 percent, respectively.       The higher levels of originations after 2003 were largely      sustained by the growth of the nonprime (both the subprime      and Alt-A) segment of the mortgage market.'' ``Alt-A: The      Forgotten Segment of the Mortgage Market'' (Federal Reserve      Bank of St. Louis 2010).       The growth of liar's loans was actually far greater than      the extraordinary rate that the St. Louis Fed study      indicated. Their error was assuming that ``subprime'' and      ``alt-a'' (one of the many misleading euphemisms for liar's      loans) were dichotomous. Credit Suisse's early 2007 study of      nonprime lending reported that roughly half of all loans      called ``subprime'' were also ``liar's'' loans and that      roughly one-third of home loans made in 2006 were liar's      loans. That fact has four critical implications for this      subject. The growth of liar's loans was dramatically larger      than the already extraordinary 340% in three years reported      by the St. Louis Fed because, by 2006, half of the loans the      study labeled as ``subprime'' were also liar's loans. Because      loans the study classified as ``subprime'' started out the      period studied (2003) as a much larger category than liar's      loans the actual percentage increase in liar's loans from      2003-2006 is over 500%. The first critical implication is      that it was the tremendous growth in liar's loans that caused      the bubble to hyper-inflate and delayed its collapse.       The role of accounting control fraud epidemics in causing      bubbles to hyper-inflate and persist is another reason that      accounting control fraud is often criminogenic. When such      frauds cluster they are likely to drive serious bubbles.      Inflating bubbles optimize the fraud recipes for borrowers      and purchasers of the bad loans by greatly delaying the onset      of loss recognition. The saying in the trade is that ``a      rolling loan gathers no loss.'' One can simply refinance the      bad loans to delay the loss recognition and book new fee and      interest ``income.'' When entry is easy (and entry into      becoming a mortgage broker was exceptionally easy), an      industry becomes even more criminogenic.       Second, liar's loans (and CDOs ``backed'' by liar's loans)      were large enough to cause extreme losses. Millions of liar's      loans were made and those loans caused catastrophic losses      because they hyper-inflated the bubble, because they were      endemically fraudulent, because the borrower was typically      induced by the lenders' frauds to acquire a home they could      not afford to purchase, and because the appraisals were      frequently inflated. Do the math: roughly one-third of home      loans made in 2006 were liar's loans and the incidence of      fraud in such loans was 90%. We are talking about an annual      fraud rate of over one million mortgage loans from 2005 until      the market for liar's loans collapsed in mid-2007.       Third, the industry massively increased its origination and      purchase of liar's loans after the FBI warned of the      developing fraud ``epidemic'' and predicted it would cause a      crisis and then massively increased its origination and      purchase of liar's loans after the industry's own anti-fraud      experts warned that such loans were endemically fraudulent      and would cause severe losses. Again, this provides a natural      experiment to evaluate why Fannie, Freddie, et alia,      originated and purchased these loans. It wasn't because ``the      government'' compelled them to do so. They did so because      they were accounting control frauds.       Fourth, the industry increasingly made the worst      conceivable loans that maximized fictional short-term income      and real compensation and losses. Making (or purchasing)      liar's loans that are also subprime loans means that the      originator is making (or the purchaser is buying) a loan that      is endemically fraudulent to a borrower who has known,      serious credit problems. It's actually worse than that      because lenders also increasingly added ``layered'' risks (no      downpayments and negative amortization) in order to optimize      accounting fraud. Negative amortization reduces the      borrowers' short-term interest rates, delaying delinquencies      and defaults (but producing far greater losses). Again, this      strategy maximizes fictional income and real losses. Honest      home lenders and purchasers of home loans would not act in      this fashion because the loans must cause catastrophic      losses.       To sum it up, the known facts of this crisis refute the      rival theories that the lenders/purchasers originated/bought      endemically fraudulent liar's loans because (a) ``the      government'' made them (or Fannie and Freddie) do so, or (b)      because they were trying to maximize profits by taking      ``extreme tail'' (i.e., an exceptionally unlikely risk). The      risk that a liar's home loan will default is exceptionally      high, not exceptionally low. The known facts of the crisis      are consistent with accounting control frauds using liar's      loans (in the United States) as their ``ammunition of      choice'' in accordance with the conventional fraud ``recipe''      used that caused prior U.S. crises.       It is bizarre that in such circumstances the automatic      assumption of the Bush and Obama administrations has been      that fraud isn't even worth investigating or considering in      connection with the crisis. It is as if millions of liar's      loans purchased and resold as CDOs largely by systemically      dangerous institutions are an inconvenient distraction from      campaign fundraising efforts. Instead, we have the myth of      the virgin crisis unsullied by accounting control fraud.      Indeed, contrary to theory, experience, and reality, the      Department of Justice has invented the faith-based fiction      that looting cannot occur.       Benjamin Wagner, a U.S. Attorney who is actively      prosecuting mortgage fraud cases in Sacramento, Calif.,      points out that banks lose money when a loan turns out to be      fraudulent. ``It doesn't make any sense to me that they would      be deliberately defrauding themselves,'' Wagner said.      Wagner's statement is embarrassing. He conflates ``they''      (referring to the CEO) and ``themselves'' (referring to the      bank). It makes perfect sense for the CEO to loot the bank.      Looting is a ``sure thing'' guaranteed to make the CEO      wealthy. ``Looting'' destroys the bank (that's the      ``bankruptcy'' part of Akerlof & Romer's title) but it      produces the ``profit'' for the CEO. It is the deliberate      making of masses of bad loans at premium yields that allows      the CEO to profit by looting the bank. When the top      prosecutor in an epicenter of accounting control fraud      defines the most destructive form of financial crime out of      existence he allows elite fraud to occur with impunity.       As embarrassing as Wagner's statement is, however, it      cannot compete on this dimension with that of his boss,      Attorney General Holder. I was appalled when I reviewed his      testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission      (FCIC). Chairman Angelides asked Holder to explain the      actions the Department of Justice (DOJ) took in response to      the FBI's warning in September 2004 that mortgage fraud was      ``epidemic'' and its prediction that if the fraud epidemic      were not contained it would cause a financial ``crisis.''      Holder testified: ``I'm not familiar myself with that [FBI]      statement.'' The DOJ's (the FBI is part of DOJ) preeminent      contribution with respect to this crisis was the FBI's 2004      warning to the nation (in open House testimony picked up by      the national media. For none of Holder's senior staffers who      prepped him for his testimony to know about the FBI testimony      requires that they know nothing about the department's most      important and (potentially) useful act. That depth of      ignorance could not exist if his senior aides cared the least      about the financial crisis and made it even a minor priority      to understand, investigate, and prosecute the frauds that      drove the crisis. Because Holder was testifying in January      14, 2010, the failure of anyone from Holder on down in his      prep team to know about the FBI's warnings also requires that      all of them failed to read any of the relevant criminology      literature or even the media and blogosphere.       In addition to claiming that the DOJ's response to the      developing crisis under President Bush was superb, Holder      implicitly took the position that (without any investigation      or analysis) fraud could not and did not pose any systemic      economic risk. Implicitly, he claimed that only economists      had the expertise to contribute to understanding the causes      of the crisis. If you don't investigate; you don't find. If      you don't understand ``accounting control fraud'' you cannot      understand why we have recurrent, intensifying financial      crises. If Holder thinks we should take our policy advice      from Larry Summers and Bob Rubin, leading authors of the      crisis, then he has abdicated his responsibilities to the      source of the problem. ``Now let me state at the outset what      role the Department plays and does not play in addressing      these challenges'' [record fraud in investment banking and      securities].       ``The Department of Justice investigates and prosecutes      federal crimes. . . .''       ``As a general matter we do not have the expertise nor is      it part of our mission to opine on the systemic causes of the      financial crisis. Rather the Justice Department's resources      are focused on investigating and prosecuting crime. It is      within this context that I am pleased to offer my testimony      and to contribute to your vital review.'' Two aspects of      Holder's testimony were preposterous, dishonest, and      dangerous.       ``I'm proud that we have put in place a law enforcement      response to the financial crisis that is and will continue to      be is aggressive, comprehensive, and well-coordinated.''       DOJ has obtained ten convictions of senior insiders of      mortgage lenders (all from one obscure mortgage bank) v. over      1000 felony convictions in the S&L debacle. DOJ has not      conducted an investigation worthy of the     name of any of the largest accounting control frauds. DOJ is      actively opposing investigating the systemically dangerous      institutions (SDIs).       Holder's most disingenuous and dangerous sentence, however,      was this one:       ``Our efforts to fight economic crime are a vital component      of our broader strategy, a strategy that seeks to foster      confidence in our financial system, integrity in our markets,      and prosperity for the American people.'' Yes, the      ``confidence fairy'' ruled at DOJ. It is the rationale now      for DOJ's disgraceful efforts to achieve immunity for the      SDIs' endemic frauds. The confidence fairy trumped and      traduced ``integrity in our markets'' and ``prosperity for      the American people.'' Prosperity is reserved for the SDIs      and their senior managers--the one percent.                          ____________________
