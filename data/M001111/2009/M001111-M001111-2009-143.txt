 President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his remarks. As ranking member and former chairman of this committee, he knows full well we work very hard to accomplish and complete these bills and to get them done in a timely fashion. We are working our hearts out to get that done.  To that point, the bill before us, the transportation and housing bill, has now been on the floor of the Senate Thursday afternoon and evening, Friday, Monday, all of today, and we will finish it tomorrow. So for any Senators who are sitting out there with issues, you need to come to the floor and get them resolved. We hope to start a series of votes tomorrow morning to get through a number of the amendments that are out there and finish this so we can move to the Interior appropriations bill tomorrow.  So, again, for the notification of all Senators, to the point the Senator from Mississippi raised, come to the floor, resolve your disagreements, or help us schedule a vote. We are going to finish this bill tomorrow.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
