Mother's Day is an important reminder of just how essential these inspirational women are to their families, their friends, and their communities.  Mothers--and all women--are also essential to the fabric of our economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just four decades ago, fewer than half of mothers were in the American work force. Today, 70 percent of mothers are working outside the home, and one-third of working mothers are the sole wage earners in their households. More than 30 percent of Vermont families rely on working moms as the exclusive wage earners in their homes.  The numbers are staggering. Yet working moms still fall behind in equal and fair pay. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress recently released a report showing that working mothers earn 3 percent less than women without children, while fathers earn 15 percent more than men without children. Working moms also face the potential of missing scheduled wage increases or bonuses, if they take time away from the workforce to care for a child.  Vermont has been a national leader in leveling the playing field for working moms. In 2002 the Green Mountain State enacted its own Equal Pay Act, making it illegal for employers to offer anything less than equal pay for equal work. The Federal Government has fallen behind, and it is far past time for Congress to approve the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation, authored by one of the trailblazers in the Senate, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), builds on efforts that date back more than 50 years to ensure a balanced and equal playing field in the workplace for women.  Of course, equal wages are not fair wages if they are not livable wages. According to the Joint Economic Committee, working mothers in families in the bottom 20 percent of households contribute an astounding 86 percent to their families' income. In an overwhelming majority of cases, these families are supported solely by a mother. That is just one of the many reasons we need to ensure that wages are not just equal and fair, but also livable. Two weeks ago I joined with Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and 31 other Democratic Senators to propose legislation to raise the minimum wage. The Raise the Wage Act will provide a staggered increase in the Federal minimum wage, from $7.25 to $12.00 by the year 2020. It is the right thing to do, and it is the fair thing to do, for working mothers, for our families, and for our Nation's economy as a whole.  Mother's Day is always an opportunity to show the moms in our lives just how valued they are. It is past time for Congress to do the same, and to act on commonsense bills like the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Raise the Wage Act.                          ____________________
