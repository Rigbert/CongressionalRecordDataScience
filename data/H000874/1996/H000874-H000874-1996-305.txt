Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to this bill. However, I am pleased the conference report language contains language I offered during full committee markup. The language requests the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to address in its March 1996 financial report and plan, first, how the District plans to restore funds removed from the Blue Plains budget and second, the timing for that restoration.  During fiscal year 1994, over $80 million dollars was transferred from the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund. The Blue Plains budget falls within this fund. This substantial loss of funds had led to serious maintenance and plant operations problems at the facility.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency which recently inspected the facility, the plant is short of staff, maintenance, and chemicals. These shortages could potentially lead to a real threat of sewage flowing into the Potomac River. This can cause a serious threat to the ratepayers and suburban jurisdictions and have a devastating environmental impact on the region.  During its inspection, EPA found failure to pay vendors and contractors in a timely manner has resulted in contractors walking off their jobs at Blue Plains and vendors failing to make deliveries of chemicals or supply spare parts. This further hampers the plant's ability to operate and maintain plant equipment. Moreover, lack of preventive maintenance of and replacement parts for essential treatment process units has resulted in many units becoming inoperable and/or inaccurate.  According to EPA, the current level of staff has had a deleterious effect on plant operations: Shortages in the required number of engineers has restricted use of the plants ability to monitor the large number of environmentally sensitive processes, plan for necessary maintenance, and oversee ongoing construction projects.  In turn, EPA required the District to submit a short and long action plan demonstrating the city's ability to address current problems and how the city plans to meet its long term obligations.  The District submitted its plan to EPA on October 13. After a brief review of the plan, early indications are that the plans lay out proper activities, yet it is still uncertain how the District will be able to finance these activities and how the transferred funds will be returned in a timely fashion.  Current conditions at Blue Plains pose a health and safety threat to the sewage rate payers and residents of the metropolitan area who live downstream from the flow of untreated sewage. It poses a serious threat to the fragile environmental conditions of the Potomac, Chesapeake Bay, Anacostia, and Patuxent Rivers and the water life they support.  In order to prevent danger to life or environment, swift return of the funds is necessary so that the Blue Plains facility can return to operating in a more safe and efficient manner.                              {time}  1930
