Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to honor J. Guadalupe Valtierra and to wish him well upon his retirement from his position as Chancellor at Ivy Tech Community College. Chancellor Valtierra's many years of service and expertise in the field of education have been a remarkable asset to the community of Northwest Indiana, where he has been able to positively impact the lives of countless students and educators. In honor of his retirement, a reception will be held on Wednesday, January 23, 2013 at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana.  J. Guadalupe Valtierra's professional career began with his passion for education and learning. Following his graduation from Purdue University, Lupe went on to earn a law degree, followed by a master's degree in higher education and student affairs, both from Indiana University. Chancellor Valtierra's career with Ivy Tech Community College spans seventeen years. Prior to becoming chancellor, he served as Director of Student Services. In 2002, Mr. Valtierra became chancellor of the college's Northwest region, which includes the campuses located in Gary, East Chicago, Valparaiso, and Michigan City. In this position, Chancellor Valtierra has been a true leader, supervising and directing the administrative and fiscal operations for the Northwest Region. Under his direction, enrollment in Ivy Tech's Northwest Region grew by more than seventy percent, and today there are more than 16,000 students enrolled in classes. In 2006, the new Valparaiso Ivy Tech campus opened. Chancellor Valtierra oversaw the completion of this project, which included a tremendously successful capital campaign that raised $3.9 million. During his tenure, the Gerald I. Lamkin Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, which manages the Society of Innovators and the Dare to Dream Initiative, was also launched. These programs have been a tremendous benefit to the community of Northwest Indiana, fostering a culture of innovation, which is so crucial in today's ever-changing economy.  Additionally, Lupe has selflessly given of his time through his involvement in various organizations and civic activities, including H.O.P.E.--Hispanic Organization Promoting Excellence, the Lake County Good Government Initiative, the Quality of Life Council, Catholic Charities, the Gary Educational Development Foundation Board, the Salvation Army, and the Northwest Indiana Local Government Academy Advisory Board, among many others. For his service and dedication to serving his community, Lupe is to be commended.  Mr. Valtierra's commitment to education and to the community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. He and his wonderful wife, Teresa, have one daughter, Adriana.  Today, there are countless citizens throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond whose lives are fuller because of Chancellor Valtierra's life of dedicated public service. They have been educated when otherwise they might not have been. They have fuller careers and loves. I am grateful for Lupe's selflessness, as well as for his friendship.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Chancellor J. Guadalupe Valtierra for his lifetime of leadership, service, and dedication to Ivy Tech and to the field of education. For his uncompromising devotion to his students and his community, Chancellor Valtierra is worthy of the highest praise, and I ask that you join me in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
