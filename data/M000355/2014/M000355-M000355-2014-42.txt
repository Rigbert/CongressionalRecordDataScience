 President, if I may, it strikes me what the administration is best at is either destroying jobs or preventing new jobs from being created. In my State, as a direct result of the Environmental Protection Agency, we have lost 7,000 coal-mining jobs during the Obama years. For every coal-mining job, we lose three more jobs. We have a literal depression in eastern Kentucky, largely caused by the Obama Environmental Protection Agency. So you begin to get the picture.  Whether it is preventing 42,000 people from going to work or taking the employment away from up to 21,000 Kentuckians, what this administration seems to be best at is either destroying existing jobs or preventing new jobs from being created. I am happy there was an energy bill in Texas and an energy bill in North Dakota. I am pretty darn unhappy we don't have an energy bill in Kentucky. We have a depression again as a result of this administration and its Environmental Protection Agency.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Texas.
