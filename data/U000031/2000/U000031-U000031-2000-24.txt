Speaker, I just want to note that there are a number of Members tonight that would have liked to have paid tribute. Because of the particular hour that it is, I just want to recognize them and recognize that their statements will appear. The gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Bass), the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) all from the bottom of their hearts have nothing but good things to say about our friend, Ron Lasch.  We hope we see him, and we hope that he has some type of privilege so we see him in the weeks ahead, so we can pay our firmest respects for all of his hard work and great service to this country.                          ____________________
