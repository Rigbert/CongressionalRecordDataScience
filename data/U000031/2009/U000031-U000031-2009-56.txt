I would note that many of my Michigan colleagues signed a letter requesting these amounts.                           Apple Fire Blight  Department: Agriculture  Account: Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Michigan State University  Address of Requesting Entity:  Description of Request: Fire Blight is a major threat to Michigan's apple trees and has reduced apple acreage in Michigan by an astounding 24%. Michigan and New York researchers are taking aggressive measures against fire blight including development of blight-resistant varieties and new, environmentally responsible control strategies. Finding ways to control and curb fire blight is of critical importance to apple growers in my district and elsewhere. This research is very promising, and its results will help apple growers significantly increase their yields.  Amount: $346,000  Financial Breakdown: Approximately, $148,000 is for the salaries of laboratory and field research personal; and $36,000 is for materials and supplies. Michigan State University has obtained funding from the Michigan Apple Committee and industry sources and will continue to fund the fire blight research at MSU at a level of $52, 500 in FY09.                          Phytopthora Research  Department: Agriculture  Account: Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Michigan State University  Address of Requesting Entity:  Description of Request: Researchers at Michigan State University are leaders in the fight to control Phytophthora capsici, a fungal-like pathogen that lives in the soil and causes numerous plants to rot. Phytophthora management has been complicated by its longevity in soils (10 or more years), its ability to spread in water, its resistance to key fungicides and lack of disease resistant varieties. Michigan State University has developed new techniques for control and resistant varieties. However, losses caused by Phytophthora have become so large throughout the nation in recent years that the economic viability of the vegetable industries in many states is at risk, and more research is necessary. Since 1996, researchers have leveraged private, state and federal funds to significantly advance disease management. The widespread crop loss caused by Phytophthora capsici will be lessened, keeping family farms and their communities viable. Spread of Phytophthora to new sites will be stopped. Ways to remediate/treat infested ground and water sources will be identified. Integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices will be developed.  Amount: $346,000  Financial Breakdown: This money will provide $346,000 in funding for Phytophthora research at Michigan State University. Approximately 85 percent of the funding will go to researchers, technicians and students. Approximately 15 percent will be used for materials, supplies and administration. Michigan State University has received outside sources of funding for Phytophthora research as well. This funding is consistent with the authorized purpose of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service.                          ____________________
