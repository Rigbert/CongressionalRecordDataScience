 President, we will, indeed, be saying goodbye to our friend and colleague, Trent Lott, over the next few weeks. Senator Reid and I will work out a time certain for tributes to Senator Lott and his extraordinary career sometime between now and the end of this session.  I ask unanimous consent that the Republican time in the morning business coming up be divided equally between Senators Bond, Kyl, and Cornyn, in that order.
