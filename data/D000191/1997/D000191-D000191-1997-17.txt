  Mr. DeFAZIO. Today, coveted nuclear technology for China. But do not worry. They signed a secret nonproliferation agreement. Of course I cannot read it, my colleagues cannot read it, but they will abide by it. Ha. You bet.  Next week fast track trade authority. Make no mistake. These policies are inextricably linked by the one overarching principle of U.S. foreign policy, money, corporate profits. That is all it is about. Human rights? The United States does not care. We do not stand for that anymore. U.S. economic interests in the long term, U.S. workers? The United States does not care anymore. And even now national security is subsumed to the profits of a few huge multinational U.S.-based corporations who want to export nuclear technology. It was all last night down at the White House right here: ``Forget diplomacy. Money makes the world go round.''  If you like our policy toward China, you will love fast track. It promises more of the same.                          ____________________
