President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.  First, I thank the Senators who began this debate. I have been told a number of family matters changed the ability of some to be here.  Over the last several months, the Judiciary Committee has used hearings, investigation, and oversight to uncover an abuse of power that threatens the independence of U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country and the trust of all Americans in the independence of our Federal law enforcement officials. We have probed the mass firings of U.S. attorneys. We are trying to get to the truth in order to prevent these kinds of abuses from happening again.  So today, the Senate finally begins debate on S. 214; that is, the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007.
