  The Grassley-Wyden bipartisan bill ought to have a lot of support. It would save taxpayers more than $100 billion. You would think fiscally conservative organizations would want to back that. Of course, some of these fiscally conservative organizations receive substantial funding from Big Pharma.  I can't think of a better opportunity to enact bipartisan entitlement reform that would significantly lower the debt and help rein in entitlement spending bill. This bill happens to be judged by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group working for the Congress as a whole, saying that it would save a little over $100 billion.  Reining in entitlement spending is a goal that I campaigned on, and nearly every one of my Republican colleagues have campaigned on that same platform. Now is the chance to carry out those campaign promises, in other words, to stand on the platform you ran on.  In an era of gridlock and partisanship, do supporters of less government spending and balanced budgets really think their goal could be achieved without bipartisanship? Nothing gets done in the U.S. Senate that isn't somewhat bipartisan. The good news is that my legislation is bipartisan, and support for the bill is growing every day.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
