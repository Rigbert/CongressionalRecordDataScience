Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would begin by also commending the gentleman from California (Chairman Packard) and would point out to every Member of the body in this institution that this will be the last Energy and Water bill that the gentleman will bring to the House floor during his tenure as a Member of Congress, given the fact that he will now retire after the 106th Congress.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California is a very decent man. He is a God-fearing man whose family is the most important thing in his life, his wife, Jean, as well as his seven children. Clearly as important to him is his country. And whether it was his service in defense of this country as a member of the United States Navy; whether it was his service as a member of a school board ensuring that the youth of his community receive the best education possible for their future; whether it be as the mayor and chief executive of his local community or his years of service in this Congress, I certainly respect the gentleman's three great passions in life.                              {time}  1530  But I would be remiss, as I would have been remiss in full committee, Mr. Chairman, if I did not mention for one moment the other great passion in life of the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard), and that is golf. For those who do not yet know the good work, the foursome of the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) did win the recent Bob Michael's, Founder, Golf Tournament with the lowest team score.  I salute the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard). He has been a gentleman, a friend, and we will all miss him.  I also want to add my thanks, my deepest thanks as a former staff member myself, to all of the staff involved on both sides of the aisle, whether they be professional committee staff, detailees, or associate staff.  But today, because this is the last bill of the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard), I would also point out to the House, this is John McNutt's last bill. He is my associate staff member and has been for the last 7 years 6 months and 27 days, not that we are counting.  But as I pointed out in my previous remarks before the full committee, Mr. McNutt is moving on with his life. He is going to be attending the University of Virginia Law School and made the wise choice, from an academic consideration, when he had the option of going to either UVA or the University of Notre Dame, that he chose Virginia. I do wish him well in his endeavor.  I would advise all of the Members that I do support this bill. I do believe that the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) has done the best job humanly possible with this bill given the allocations the subcommittee had.  But I would note that I for one did not vote for the budget resolution adopted by this institution, and I did not vote for the allocations adopted by the committee and have not agreed with the allocation we were given.  On the civilian side particularly of the legislation, it gives us great trouble. The fact is we are $210 million today under a freeze level for civilian purposes. Let me note for the Members of this Chamber several problems that it causes.  In the area of water projects, and there is hardly a Member in this institution who does not have a problem one way or the other with water in their district, the spending this year, while $60 million over the President's request, is $6 million under a freeze. Given the fact that the Corps today has responsibilities of over 400 multipurpose reservoirs, 12,000 miles of navigation channels, hundreds of ports, and 11.6 million acres of land, we fall woefully short.  It is anticipated just to fully fund authorized active construction projects, those projects that this Congress has authorized, that are economically justified, and are supported by a non-Federal entity, we would need an additional $30 billion.  It is further anticipated that if the shadows of the future are not unaltered, the backlog for critically deferred maintenance this coming fiscal year will amount to $450 million.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army, Mr. Westphal, has indicated that, to ensure that projects proceed on the most efficient schedule possible, we should probably be spending almost $700 million more a year.  People have noted in the past that there has been mission creep by the Corps, that, first, it is flood control projects, then it is navigation, then it is hydropower, shoreline protection, and recreation.  But I would point out to the body that those are all responsibilities we collectively have given to the Corps. We have also seen fit, both the legislative branch and the executive branch, to give them additional responsibilities as far as environmental restoration, water treatment facilities, sewer treatment facilities, and the clean up of contaminated sites.  Within the last couple of weeks, we had a very controversial debate and vote relative to trade with China. I would point out that global commerce is projected to double over the next 20 years, and the harbors and inland waterways that lead to them will have to be expanded and maintained for us to stay competitive, and that nearly half of the inland waterway locks and dams today are over 50 years old.  To put it in another perspective, in 1999 constant dollars, in the 1960s, we were spending nearly $5 billion on water construction projects. Today for inflation adjusted dollars, we are spending about $1.7 billion.  There is no money in the bill for a new recreation facility modernization initiative by the administration. There is no money for the Challenge 21 Riverine Restoration Program to move towards more nonstructural solutions to many of our flooding and water problems. They would also be looking to have greater coordination with environmental restoration. Given the fact that we have at least a two to one cost benefit ratio, I think it is a mistake not to further fund these programs.  In the arena of science, I would mention renewables. There was a debate during the rule about gas prices going up. Whether one blames OPEC, the oil companies, EPA, ethanol, the fact is they have gone up. Funding in this bill currently as we debate it has gone down $12 million from last year's level. It is my anticipation and I appreciate the fact that it would appear that later today that figure will go up.  Finally, I would point to an initiative that the administration asks for in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a famous lecture; and in it he challenged his audience to envision a time when materials could be manipulated and controlled on the smallest of scales. He said then in 1959 that, when they looked back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction, and here we are 40 years later.  Nanoscale science and synthesis would result in a number of benefits: significant improvements in solar energy conservation, more energy efficient lighting, stronger, lighter materials that would improve efficiency in transportation, greatly improved chemical and biological sensing, and others. Again, a new science initiative would not be funded.  I would simply close again by assuring Members that, within the allocations provided, the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) has done a very good job. I do support the bills, but I would have been remiss in my remark for not pointing out the deficiencies given the allocations that we were given that I did not support.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
