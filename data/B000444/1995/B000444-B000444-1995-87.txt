 President, one of the greatest pleasures of our service in the Senate, is that we have the opportunity to call the Nation's attention to acts of extraordinary service and sacrifice by our citizens, and to record those acts as a part of our proud and uniquely American history of leadership by the People.  On more occasions than any of us can count, Mr. President, our praise and thanks have been earned by members of a group who truly embody the highest ideals of citizenship and service--our Nation's firefighters. During this National Fire Prevention Week, I am especially proud to pay tribute to a firefighter from my State, Capt. Robert J. Lewis of the Talleyville Fire Company.  On June 30 of this year, the Talleyville Fire Company was dispatched to help battle a house fire in Brandywood, a community just north of Wilmington, DE. There was heavy smoke coming from the attic, and the firefighters immediately went to work with handlines directed to the upper floor of the house.  An engine crew from the nearby Claymont Fire Company was assigned to search the main attic. In the course of that search, Claymont Firefighter Greg Denston was caught when fire broke through the wall, engulfing the attic in flames and leaving little chance of escape by way of the staircase.  In the course of working his way to the attic, Firefighter Denston had lost his helmet, and his protective mask had become dislodged when the flames broke through the wall. He alertly activated his personal safety signal device, hoping that someone would hear his call for help.  Rescue Capt. Robert J. Lewis did hear, Mr. President, and he responded.  Captain Lewis found a Claymont Fire Company helmet at the bottom of the attic staircase. He fought his way through heavy smoke and intense heat, and managed to get to the attic by way of the kind of fold-down stairs that can be hard to navigate under the best of circumstances. And these were surely the worst of circumstances.  The attic was literally under siege by the fire. But Captain Lewis managed to locate Firefighter Denston and to pull him down the stairs, where several other firefighters helped get their injured comrade out of the house and on his way to medical treatment. Firefighter Denston was hospitalized for 7 days, and has continued his recovery at home.  The hope of that recovery is only possible, Mr. President, because Robert Lewis answered the call for help, as firefighters do every day in cities and towns across America.  Captain Lewis' professional instincts--and all firefighters are professionals--his professional instincts were perfect; he acted precisely as his training had taught him.  But training can only teach you how to save a life. It cannot make you do it.  The personal instinct that led Captain Lewis to act quickly and decisively--automatically, without pausing to weigh the pros and cons, putting his concern for another above his concern for his own safety--that instinct comes from deep within. It is something hard to define, but it makes ordinary citizens into heroes every day.  One American writer described it this way: ``There is a certain blend of courage, integrity, character and principle which has no satisfactory dictionary name but has been called different things at different times, in different countries. Our American name for it is `guts.' '' Training makes a professional; guts, Mr. President, make a hero.  Capt. Robert J. Lewis of the Talleyville Fire Company did not become a hero on June 30, 1995. He was already a hero, as were his fellow firefighters, because they know that every time they answer the call they may be putting their lives at risk. And still they answer--without pausing to weigh the pros and cons, putting their concern for others above their concern for their own safety--each and every time.  In recognizing Captain Lewis for his extraordinary service, we recognize all firefighters. They represent and summon the best in us--the best of the American character--and we are grateful to them all.                          ____________________
