 President, it is with great sorrow that I speak today in honor of a fallen soldier. American hero MSG Scott M. Carney was killed in military operations on August 24, 2007. My deepest sympathy and prayers go out to Scott's wife Jeni and twin sons Jacob and Justin. I also express sincere sympathy and gratitude to his parents Geneva and John Carney and his brothers and sister.  An Ankeny, IA, resident, Scott was killed during a humvee rollover near Herat, Afghanistan. Scott was a member of the Iowa National Guard's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Division out of Boone, IA. Scott enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1989 and had been a member of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team since 2004.  Scott will be fondly remembered and missed dearly. His wife described Scott by saying he ``died doing what he loved, serving his country and protecting the freedom that we enjoy and providing the people of Afghanistan with the opportunity for freedom.'' I know I speak on behalf of all Iowans when I express gratitude for Scott's 18 years of military service. While I speak today with great sorrow, I also speak with great pride; pride in having soldiers like Scott, willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.  A fellow soldier lent an apt description of Scott when he said ``the Army was his life. He loved his family dearly and was a great family member. He was also part of the team.'' I ask all Americans to spend a moment today in prayerful gratitude for the family of a true American patriot, fallen hero MSG Scott M. Carney.                          ____________________
