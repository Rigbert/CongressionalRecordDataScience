Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from New York for yielding.  Is the gentleman aware that under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, contraception is provided? It is just is not mandated. It is totally permissible. An HMO, a Kaiser Permanente, you name it, if they want to provide contraception, they can.
