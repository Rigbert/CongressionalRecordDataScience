Mr. Speaker, H.R. 629 is a noncontroversial bill which will authorize the National Park Service to spend Federal funds to operate a new visitor center. The center will be developed with private funds and located on private lands just outside the entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park. The bill is consistent with Park Service plans, supported by the administration and will be funded from existing funds.  Mr. Speaker, Rocky Mountain National Park is the No. 1 tourist attraction in the State of Colorado and a new visitor center will serve to educate the visitors about the park and its resources, while encouraging a partnership with the private sector. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
