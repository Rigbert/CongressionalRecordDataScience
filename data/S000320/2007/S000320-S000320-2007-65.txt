 President, I rise today to pay tribute to our colleague, our friend, and a great statesman, Senator Craig Thomas.  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber as we mourn this loss.  His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he touched throughout his life. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Susan, his four children, and the entire Thomas family.  Craig was an influential force in the Senate for the people of Wyoming, as well as a thoughtful leader on national issues.  Craig served the people of Wyoming with distinction and honor.  His roots in the State ran deep, and Wyoming had no greater advocate. He has built his reputation as a fiscal conservative while focusing on the unique issues affecting the American west.  He was honest, humble, good natured, and loyal. It was these characteristics that he brought to the Senate and to his work. He was an effective leader because he believed you could get a lot accomplished when you did not care who took the credit.  Craig was committed to the values and principles he believed in deeply. He loved his State, and it showed. He was committed to protecting our Nation's natural resources, improving the lives of those in rural America, and a leader in advocating a sound national energy policy.  It was my true privilege to have served with Craig over the past 13 years in the Senate. While we continue to mourn his passing, we should try to carry on with the same determination and energy he brought every day to the challenges he faced.  He will be remembered as a dedicated American, a marine, a public servant, and the quintessential American cowboy who gave so much of his life in service to the Nation.  I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to Craig in this difficult time, especially to his family.                          ____________________
