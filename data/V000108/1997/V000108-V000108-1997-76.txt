Speaker, I would like to commend the Latin American Community Alliance for Support and Assistance of Northwest Indiana, Inc. [LACASA], its Adult Education Learners, its Head Start Students, and its Agency Volunteers, on the achievements earned during the 1997-98 program year.  LACASA is dedicated to serving the Hispanic residents of northwest Indiana, who experience difficulty in obtaining needed social and educational services. Some quality services which the organization offers include: an adult education program, geared toward students at all levels; a Head Start program, which provides training in parenting skills, and an opportunity for parents to become empowered in the education of their children; and Access Assistance, a program stressing job search and person and community leadership preparation. Currently, LACASA is working to develop additional programs meant to improve the quality of life for northwest Indiana's Hispanic population. For those in need, LACASA hopes to provide transportation services to its programs, as well as to agencies where its clients are referred. The organization would also like to establish health stations in an effort to assist families in understanding their basic health needs and inform them about how to access the existing health care system. Finally, LACASA hopes to expand its services to the elderly by familiarizing them with in-home care options to prevent unnecessary institutionalization.  Students who have participated in LACASA's 1997-98 Adult Education Learners Program include: Juan Luis Alvarado, Juan Manuel Alvarado, Maria C.
