J. Res. 8. A joint resolution recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal; read the first time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 8       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the October 2018 report entitled ``Special Report on      Global Warming of 1.5 C'' by the Intergovernmental Panel on      Climate Change and the November 2018 Fourth National Climate      Assessment report found that--       (A) human activity is the dominant cause of observed      climate change over the past century;       (B) a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and an      increase in wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and other      extreme weather events that threaten human life, healthy      communities, and critical infrastructure;       (C) global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond      pre-industrialized levels will cause--       (i) mass migration from the regions most affected by      climate change;       (ii) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic      output in the United States by the year 2100;       (iii) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at least      twice as much forest area in the western United States than      was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding      2019;       (iv) a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on      Earth;       (v) more than 350,000,000 more people to be exposed      globally to deadly heat stress by 2050; and       (vi) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public      infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States;      and       (D) global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees      Celsius above pre-industrialized levels to avoid the most      severe impacts of a changing climate, which will require--       (i) global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from      human sources of 40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030;      and       (ii) net-zero global emissions by 2050;       (2) because the United States has historically been      responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas      emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas      emissions through 2014, and has a high technological      capacity, the United States must take a leading role in      reducing emissions through economic transformation;       (3) the United States is currently experiencing several      related crises, with--       (A) life expectancy declining while basic needs, such as      clean air, clean water, healthy food, and adequate health      care, housing, transportation, and education, are      inaccessible to a significant portion of the United States      population;       (B) a 4-decade trend of wage stagnation,      deindustrialization, and anti-labor policies that has led      to--       (i) hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970s despite      increased worker productivity;       (ii) the third-worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the      developed world before the Great Recession;       (iii) the erosion of the earning and bargaining power of      workers in the United States; and       (iv) inadequate resources for public sector workers to      confront the challenges of climate change at local, State,      and Federal levels; and       (C) the greatest income inequality since the 1920s, with--       (i) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of      gains in the first few years of economic recovery after the      Great Recession;       (ii) a large racial wealth divide amounting to a difference      of 20 times more wealth between the average White family and      the average Black family; and       (iii) a gender earnings gap that results in women earning      approximately 80 percent as much as men, at the median;       (4) climate change, pollution, and environmental      destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional,      social, environmental, and economic injustices (referred to      in this section as ``systemic injustices'') by      disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities      of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities,      depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers,      women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities,      and youth (referred to in this section as ``frontline and      vulnerable communities'');       (5) climate change constitutes a direct threat to the      national security of the United States--       (A) by impacting the economic, environmental, and social      stability of countries and communities around the world; and       (B) by acting as a threat multiplier;       (6) the Federal Government-led mobilizations during World      War II and the New Deal created the greatest middle class      that the United States has ever seen, but many members of      frontline and vulnerable communities were excluded from many      of the economic and societal benefits of those mobilizations;      and       (7) a new national, social, industrial, and economic      mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the      New Deal era is a historic opportunity--       (A) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the      United States;       (B) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and      economic security for all people of the United States; and       (C) to counteract systemic injustices.     SEC. 2. GREEN NEW DEAL POLICY.       It is the policy of the United States that--       (1) it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a      Green New Deal--       (A) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a      fair and just transition for all communities and workers;       (B) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure      prosperity and economic security for all people of the United      States;       (C) to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the      United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st      century;       (D) to secure for all people of the United States for      generations to come--       (i) clean air and water;       (ii) climate and community resiliency;       (iii) healthy food;       (iv) access to nature; and       (v) a sustainable environment; and       (E) to promote justice and equity by stopping current,      preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of      indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant      communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural      communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the      elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth      (referred to in this section as ``frontline and vulnerable      communities'');       (2) the goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of      paragraph (1) (referred to in this section as the ``Green New      Deal goals'') should be accomplished through a 10-year      national mobilization (referred to in this section as the      ``Green New Deal mobilization'') that will require the      following goals and projects--       (A) building resiliency against climate change-related      disasters, such as extreme weather, including by leveraging      funding and providing investments for community-defined      projects and strategies;

      (F) spurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the      United States and removing pollution and greenhouse gas      emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is      technologically feasible, including by expanding renewable      energy manufacturing and investing in existing manufacturing      and industry;       (G) working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in      the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas      emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is      technologically feasible, including--       (i) by supporting family farming;       (ii) by investing in sustainable farming and land use      practices that increase soil health; and       (iii) by building a more sustainable food system that      ensures universal access to healthy food;       (H) overhauling transportation systems in the United States      to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the      transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,      including through investment in--       (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing;       (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and       (iii) high-speed rail;       (I) mitigating and managing the long-term adverse health,      economic, and other effects of pollution and climate change,      including by providing funding for community-defined projects      and strategies;       (J) removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and      reducing pollution by restoring natural ecosystems through      proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage,      such as land preservation and afforestation;       (K) restoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and      fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-     based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate      resiliency;       (L) cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned      sites, ensuring economic development and sustainability on      those sites;       (M) identifying other emission and pollution sources and      creating solutions to remove them; and       (N) promoting the international exchange of technology,      expertise, products, funding, and services, with the aim of      making the United States the international leader on climate      action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal;       (3) a Green New Deal must be developed through transparent      and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership      with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions,      worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and      businesses; and       (4) to achieve the Green New Deal goals and mobilization, a      Green New Deal will require the following goals and      projects--       (A) providing and leveraging, in a way that ensures that      the public receives appropriate ownership stakes and returns      on investment, adequate capital (including through community      grants, public banks, and other public financing), technical      expertise, supporting policies, and other forms of assistance      to communities, organizations, Federal, State, and local      government agencies, and businesses working on the Green New      Deal mobilization;       (B) ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account      the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of      emissions through--       (i) existing laws;       (ii) new policies and programs; and       (iii) ensuring that frontline and vulnerable communities      shall not be adversely affected;       (C) providing resources, training, and high-quality      education, including higher education, to all people of the      United States, with a focus on frontline and vulnerable      communities, so that all people of the United States may be      full and equal participants in the Green New Deal      mobilization;
