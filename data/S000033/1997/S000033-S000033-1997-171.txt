 Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, I think the proof basically is in the pudding; is it not? Now, if the trade policies and our current economic policies are working well, then the proof is there. Then we will have an expanding middle class; right? Then the new jobs that are being created will pay people decent wages; is that not correct? Then we will have a society where the gap between the rich and the poor grows narrower.  But what in fact has been happening since the development of these trade policies? What we now have in the United States is the wealthiest 1 percent of the population owning 42 percent of the wealth, which is more than the bottom 90 percent. Now I think we have not been totally fair tonight, because I think we should acknowledge that these trade agreements do do some people good.
