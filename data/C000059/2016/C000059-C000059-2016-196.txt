Chair, today, the Army celebrates its 241st birthday and a long, proud history of defending our great Nation. The Army and all of our military branches make up the finest fighting force in the world because of our extraordinary men and women who serve in them and because they have the tools that are necessary to carry out their missions.                              {time}  1715  Just days ago, we saw a tragic and horrific reminder in Orlando that we are a Nation very much at war with radical Islamic extremists. While there may be differing opinions on what steps our country can and should do to stop attacks on our homeland, there should be no daylight between all Members of this body in our commitment to ensuring our soldiers have the resources necessary to win this war.  I want to thank my friend and chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, Rodney Frelinghuysen, and all of my Appropriations Committee colleagues for putting together a good bill that deserves all our support.  I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill and continue to support our men and women in uniform as they defend our great Nation.
