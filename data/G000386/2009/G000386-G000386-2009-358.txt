 The complex funding formula for spending the $87 billion in Medicare in this bill is not fair. It should be a flat increase to all States. That is the way we have done it in the past, and that is what my amendment does now. Thirty-four States do better with the formulaunder my amendment. So this is a vote to give your State its fair share or not, as you choose. I believe there are 65 Members in the Senate here today whose States do better under my amendment, and if you do not know how your State does--although I put it in the Record this afternoon--come to me before you cast your vote and I will show you.
