Speaker, in February of 1913, an extraordinary lady was born and 42 years later she refused to give her seat up on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her actions had an extraordinarily positive impact on America and on focusing Americans' attention on the fact that they were, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, not fulfilling our Nation's promise of equality and justice. And so we note the passing of Rosa Parks at the age of 92. She made an extraordinary contribution, not just to our country, but to the concept of equality and dignity of human beings around the world.  Rosa Parks was a civil rights icon and a national treasure. Her simple, dignified act nearly half a century ago--defiance of a racist law that denied her humanity--helped galvanize the civil rights movement and delivered a moral body blow to segregationist laws that stain our Nation's history.  Ms. Parks' life is a testament to the truth that one person with courage and an unshakable will can change a Nation and begin to right wrongs. Her legacy will endure not only through her personal acts of courage and strength, but also through the thousands of activists who were inspired by her.  Ms. Parks risked everything, including her life, for a cause that she knew in her heart was right. We are a better Nation today as the result of her courage and vision. And, we should honor her memory by continuing the fight for equality, decency and basic human rights.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2194]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         TRIBUTE TO ROSA PARKS                                 ______                                                                speech of                          HON.
