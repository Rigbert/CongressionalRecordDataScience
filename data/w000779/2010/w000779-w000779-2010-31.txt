President, Senators should expect the first vote of the day to begin at approximately 11 a.m. That will be the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Promoting Natural Gas and Electric Vehicles legislation. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate would proceed immediately to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 3772, the paycheck fairness bill. If cloture is again not invoked, there would be a third cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 510, the food safety bill. Therefore, Senators should expect up to three rollcall votes to begin around 11 a.m.                          ____________________
