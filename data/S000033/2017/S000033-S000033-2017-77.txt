 President, I ask unanimous consent that a motion to commit be printed in the Record to instruct the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to report back with changes that are based on hearings held by the committee.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Sanders moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate within 3      days with changes that are within the jurisdiction of such      Committee based on hearings held by the Committee.
