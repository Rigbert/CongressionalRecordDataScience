 President--       Once upon a time the oceans were moats around our bastions.      Once upon a time it was a miracle to travel round the world      in 90 days. Now it is done in as many hours. Once upon a time      we were a comfortably isolated land. Now we are unavoidably      the leader and the reliance of freemen throughout this free      world. We cannot escape from our prestige nor from its hazard      * * * There is no longer such a thing as isolated security.  In 1949, when the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, made these remarks he was urging his colleagues to ratify NATO. He made his case before a reluctant Senate, one weary of the costs of war in blood and treasure. But, Vandenberg understood that the defense of our Nation and the conduct of its foreign policy were the unique responsibilities of the Federal Government. He persuaded his colleagues not only to support NATO, but pay the costs of containment spelled out in the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan.  Senator Vandenberg was not indifferent to his colleagues caution. He took note of their objections--he understood that many of President Truman's initiatives, and NATO in particular, were considered by some a sharp departure from our historic foreign policy of nonentanglement in the affairs of others.  Senator Vandenberg was a Republican who closely cooperated with a Democratic President and his administration. That bipartisan cooperation [[Page S7455]] secured the foundation for treaties and alliances that continue to guard our interests to this day. That cooperation rebuilt Europe yielding trade, prosperity, and stability.  Today, the challenge is to rebuild Armenia and Ukraine, not Belgium and France. Our challenge is to include Poland and the Czech Republic and other nations in a new European security alliance.  Our challenge is a choice much like that faced by the Senate in 1949--to provide the resources to support American resolve, to secure American interests.  Today, the choice is to advance democracy and free markets or retreat in our fight against the threats of international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, crime, and narcotics. Today, we win exports, jobs, and partners in peace or we lose to ethnic genocide, trade wars, terrorists, and tyrants.  I am not so naive as to believe the choices we face are simple and stark. In some ways, if the choices were crystal clear, absolutely obvious, support for foreign aid and our global role would be much stronger. But it is the murky ambiguities of this day and age that give rise to both confusion and a general apathy about our place in the world. And, it is that confusion that risks our isolation.  In his State of the Union Address in January 1945, President Roosevelt issued a sharp warning to the Nation. ``Let us not forget that the retreat to isolationism a quarter of a century ago was started not by a direct attack against international cooperation but against the alleged imperfections of the peace.''  Every one of us has been critical of the imperfections of foreign aid. Every Member has expressed opposition to waste, fraud, and abuses. A majority could identify programs, embassies, and consulates which could be shut down.  But, the costs of these imperfections should not be our international leadership. We must not pay the permanent price of retreat from the world, because we were troubled by the inefficiencies or problems in our foreign aid program.  Foreign aid must be fixed. It must more clearly serve our national political, economic, and security interests. The public must understand exactly what we do with the 1 percent of the Federal budget foreign aid expends.  Like many of my colleagues, I hear from constituents who are uncertain about why we have a foreign aid program at all. To each of them, I offer my firm commitment that we will reduce spending by eliminating unnecessary programs, consolidating responsibilities, and assuring we only spend our spare resources where we can achieve concrete results.  I believe foreign aid is an important tool essential to maintaining our leadership around the globe. We cannot preserve, let alone promote, our interests for free.  And, why should that matter. First, we are a compassionate nation by tradition; in fact it is one of our finest traditions as exemplified by the outpouring of support for Oklahomans. But for the moment let's set aside altruistic motives--set aside what I like to call the CNN syndrome--where they broadcast a famine, funds will naturally follow.  Effective foreign assistance serves our interests. Let me review what I think we lose by the cuts proposed in the budget resolution.  First and foremost, the budget resolution assumes we will cut nearly $800 million from the trade promotion activities. Programs at the Export Import Bank, OPIC, and the Trade Development Agency are not lining the pockets of foreigners. These are programs which directly affect American jobs and exports.  Over the past 2 years Ex-Im has supported over $32 billion in exports and 300,000 jobs. In key sectors, such as power, telecommunications, and major construction, Ex-Im financed accounts for close to 30 percent of all new sales to developing countries and 15 percent of all U.S. production. In high growth developing markets, Ex-Im is financing anywhere from 10 to 40 percent of all U.S. capital goods.  That is why the Coalition for Employment through Exports is supporting an increase in the Function 150 account--a Coalition that is a broad based organization of exporters, labor unions, and State governors enjoying substantial bipartisan support. That is why I have heard from bankers and businessmen across the country supporting an increase in the Function 150 account. They understand that this is about American jobs, American exports, American income.  But there are other constituents who are concerned about the budget resolution cuts. The resolution assumes all aid to Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations will be zeroed out. Let me tell you what that means for just one country--Poland. After considerable effort by Congress, I think the administration has turned the corner and made the commitment to expand NATO. Poland is clearly first in line of the potential entrants. Just as the point where we are likely to make this offer, we zero out military assistance and training key to the effective integration of their forces.  Criteria under consideration for admission to NATO is civilian control of the armed services and transparency of the defense budget. Here too, we would be cutting off parliamentary exchanges, expanded IMET and democratization initiatives key to meeting these admission standards.  The budget resolution also assumes we will cut our program to the NIS from nearly $800 to $100 million. Just at the point when we are finally shifting emphasis from Russia to the other republics, we gut the program. Armenia and Ukraine are important partners in the region. Millions of Americans trace their roots to these countries--nations which deserve our support as they struggle down the perilous road of economic and political reforms. For the benefit of some of my colleagues who may not know about this constituency, let me offer a few statistics drawn up by the census bureau. Central and Eastern Europeans constitute: 18 percent of Pennsylvanians; 17 percent of New Jersey; 12 percent of Ohio; 18 percent of Connecticut; 15 percent of Illinois; 11 percent of Massachusetts; and nearly 2 million Californians.  Which one of us wants to apologize to our children for a nuclear catastrophe because we failed to help Ukraine safeguard its aging Chernobyl reactors? Which one of us wants to answer to the American Armenian with a grandmother in Yerevan who has not had heat or light for months? Which one will shrug their shoulders at the market opportunities to a region of hundreds of millions of people?  And, let's not forget Russia. With over 5,000 organized criminal enterprises with tentacles reaching our shores and access to nuclear material, do we really want to terminate the FBI's joint training and investigation efforts?  Mr. President, the budget resolution decimates support for these new republics and that is why many of us have heard from local, State, and national organizations representing Americans of European descent who support increasing the level of the 150 account to guarantee adequate funding for foreign aid programs. The Central and Eastern European Coalition which includes the Armenian Assembly, the Estonian World Council, the Lithuanian American Community, the Polish American Congress, the Ukrainian Congress Committee, the Ukrainian National Association, the Joint Baltic American National Committee, the U.S. Baltic Foundation, the Hungarian American Coalition, the Czecho-Slovak Council of America, the National Federation of Hungarian Americans, and several other groups all support this amendment.  I have only highlighted some of my specific concerns about the assumptions included in the budget resolution. I did not mention the fact that it assumes a cutoff of assistance to Greece and Turkey. I did not detail the devastating impact it will have on development assistance, peacekeeping, and the National Endowment for Democracy. I did not review country by country the consequence of terminating international lending to the world's poorest countries. I have only highlighted my concerns--concerns shared by many of our constituents. I hoped that this discussion would help all of us understand that this is not a debate about giving away tax dollars to foreigners or pouring our money down rat holes.  [[Page S7456]] Our constituents recognize, as I do, that the budget resolution before the Senate will leave this President, the next President, our Nation and citizens with virtually no options except military intervention. In the last decade foreign aid has already suffered a 40- percent reduction. The reductions in the budget resolution, to an account that already represents only 1 percent of our spending, amounts to eliminating foreign aid.  I think that is a mistake which jeopardizes our interests. Eliminating foreign aid does not eliminate crises and needs. Eliminating foreign aid will not constrain a President from addressing these reqirements--from carrying out his policies, from serving our national interests.  Eliminating foreign aid will simply transfer the burden directly to the Pentagon. The costs DOD assumed for taking care of Cuban and Haitian refugees at Guantanamo will become routine, not rare. We can support private voluntary organizations carrying out feeding missions in Rwanda or we can deploy our National Guard. We can help train the military in Mexico to interdict narcotics, or we can drain the Pentagon's accounts to patrol our borders intercepting drug flights. We can fund the FBI's work with their Russian counterpart's to combat criminal organizations engaged in smuggling chemical, biological, and nuclear material, or the Pentagon can pay a price to manage the threat.  Crisis prevention costs less than crisis.  Much has been made by the administration of the isolationist symptoms twitching in this body. And there certainly are Members, Senators who I have a deep respect for who believe the United States should withdraw from the world stage.  But, I do not believe we have that option any more. The world is no longer conveniently divided into cold war camps. Our friends and allies, the emerging democracies, all turn to the sole remaining superpower for leadership and support. A time when the international landscape is troubled and confused is precisely the wrong time to withdraw. It is precisely the wrong time to create a vacuum for the Saddam Husseins and other ambitious tyrants to fill. We can pay a small price now to secure American interests or we will surely pay an enormous cost later.  Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes and I had intended to offer an amendment to increase the level of the function 150 account. We were supported in this effort by Senators Hatfield, Leahy, and other members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee and Foreign Relations Committee who were concerned about the budget resolution's impact.  We had worked hard to achieve a bipartisan base of support for an amendment to raise the level of resources for function 150. Unfortunately, these efforts were undercut by comments made by Secretary Christopher before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. The Secretary made clear he was concerned about the level of resources the Congress might make available. Nonetheless, when I asked him, as I had asked the Administrator for A.I.D. and other members of the Clinton administration, to work to secure congressional support to increase the account, he declined. He made it absolutely clear to all of us that the administration intended to sit on the sidelines as the resolution was debated.  I believe this reluctance directly affected our support for an amendment. many Members I spoke with commented that if it isn't important enough to the President and the State Department to work to improve the resolution, why should I go out on a limb to increase foreign aid?  Ironically, just yesterday the President decided to lash out and threaten to veto the House bill which authorizes priorities and policies related to foreign assistance spending. The President is a day late and is attacking a bill that the budget process leaves billions of dollars short.  He refused to weigh in at the time that the crucial battle was being fought--the administration simply did not show up to participate in a bipartisan effort to secure adequate funds to administer our Nation's foreign affairs.  On other occasions in the course of our history similar mistakes have been made. By the time Gen. J.E.B. Stuart showed up at Gettysburg, General Lee had not only lost the battle, but ultimately the war. Stuart had wandered Pennsylvania aimlessly, leaving his commander blind to the strength and the position of Union troops.  This week, we saw aimless wandering not in the hills of Pennsylvania, but down the Avenue. Many of my colleagues understood the importance of the budget battle--understood it has significant implications for our long-term national interests. But the critical support for an effort to save the 150 account failed to arrive in time.                          transportation cuts
