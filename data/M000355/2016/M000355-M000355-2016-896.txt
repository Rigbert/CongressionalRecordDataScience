 President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend and a distinguished Kentuckian who has sadly passed away after a resoundingly successful life and career of many decades. Ward Correll, a native Kentuckian renowned across the Commonwealth, died on April 21 of this year. He was 88 years old.  My wife, Elaine, and I are deeply saddened by Ward's death. Ward rose from humble beginnings to great business success, and he also generously and charitably shared the fruits of his success with others in his hometown of Somerset and throughout Kentucky. Many have benefitted from his philanthropy, and he will be terribly missed.  Ward was a household name in Kentucky. A self-made man, he created a business empire, including an oil distributorship and many property, business, and financial holdings. He was a major stockholder in First Southern National Bank.  Ward believed strongly in giving back to the community that he loved so much. He was a financial benefactor to dozens of charities, churches, sports teams, and other organizations, including Somerset Christian School--which honors his family's contribution with a monument on the school campus--and the University of the Cumberlands, where the science complex is named in his and his late wife's honor. The Ward Correll Sports Complex, a popular destination in Somerset, is thanks to his efforts.  For all his success in life, Ward graduated high school with less than $3 in his pocket. He hitchhiked to Detroit, where he worked odd jobs. After serving his country in the U.S. Army in an intelligence unit during the Korean war, he returned home to Somerset and married his wife, Regina.  Ward and Regina's first business was selling bananas. From that, he built himself into the titan of business and philanthropy whom we mourn today.  Ward received the 2002 Kentuckian Award from the A.B. Chandler Foundation. He was named Outstanding Philanthropist by the Association of Fundraising Professionals Bluegrass Chapter in 2003. In that same year, he received the Business of the Year Award as an Entrepreneurial Success from the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce. And he received the Somerset-Pulaski County Distinguished Community Service Award in 2014.  The people of Pulaski County were accustomed to seeing full-page ads in the local paper bought by Ward Correll, each one sharing some bit of wisdom or personal philosophy from Ward that he wished to pass on to others. He ended each ad with the signature line, ``Hooray, cheers! Ward Correll.''  I want to send my deepest condolences and prayers to Ward's family at their time of loss. Now is the time to wish one final hooray and cheers to the man who leaves behind a powerful legacy. Kentucky honors Ward Correll for his life and his lifetime of service, and we mourn his passing.  The Lexington Herald-Leader published an article detailing Ward Correll's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 23, 2016]Somerset Businessman Ward Correll, Known for Philanthropy, Dead at Age                                    88                            (By Bill Estep)       Somerset businessman Ward F. Correll, recognized for      millions of dollars' worth of philanthropy in support of      various causes, died Thursday at University of Kentucky      Chandler Hospital. He was 88.       Correll had been hospitalized since suffering what police      said were accidental gunshot wounds at his home early March      9.       Correll had business interests in a shopping center, an oil      and gas distributorship and a life insurance company, and he      was a founder of First Southern National Bank.       Correll had given millions to causes and projects including      land for a water park and youth baseball field in Somerset;      land and financial support for Somerset Christian School;      money to renovate an auditorium at Somerset High School; and      $1 million for a classroom building at the University of the      Cumberlands in Williamsburg. The building was named for      Correll and his late wife, Regina.       He also made smaller donations, reportedly giving away $30      worth of gas from his stations to active-duty military      personnel in 2009, for instance.       Observers said Correll's philanthropy had touched countless      lives.       ``It has built the community up from every aspect,'' said      Carolyn Mounce, head of the Somerset-Pulaski County      Convention and Visitors Bureau.       U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, a Somerset Republican, said Correll's      impact will last for generations.       ``His generosity was as vast as his business ingenuity, and      he routinely used both to inspire and encourage everyone      around him,'' Rogers said. ``Ultimately, Ward loved his God,      his family, his community and his country, and spent a      lifetime faithfully serving each one with great passion and      enthusiasm.''       Correll was born in Wayne County, one of 13 children, and      grew up in Pulaski County in modest circumstances.       He told the story of leaving home after high school with      $2.67 and hitchhiking to Detroit for work, returning home      several months later with a bit more money in his pocket.       He eventually developed a shopping center in the 1960s on      what was then a sparsely built stretch of U.S. 27 in      Somerset, now crowded with hundreds of businesses.       Correll frequently bought full-page advertisements in the      Commonwealth-Journal newspaper in Somerset to publish      inspirational quotes.       Correll, a Korean War veteran, is survived by six children,      nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, according      to Lake Cumberland Funeral Home.                          ____________________
