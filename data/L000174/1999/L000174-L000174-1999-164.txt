President, I congratulate Col. John Sinclair on his Senate confirmation as the next United States Marshal for the District of Vermont.  As a 30-year veteran of the Vermont State Police, Col. Sinclair has served as a uniformed trooper at both the Colchester and Bethel Barracks, later joined the Fraud Unit and the Governor's security detail, and then was promoted to the post of Station Commander at the Brattleboro Barracks. He has also commanded both the Criminal Division and the Field Force. In 1996, he was appointed to his present position as director of the Vermont State Police, the department's highest-ranking uniformed post.  I have known Col. Sinclair for nearly 30 years, since the time when he was a new State trooper and I was Chittenden County's new State's attorney. We worked closely together on a number of investigations, trials, and law enforcement education programs. I have watched his career for the past three decades and consider him to be one of the finest police officers with whom I have ever worked. He is a police officer's police officer. He is a strong component of our law enforcement team in Vermont.  He has gained extensive experience with State, federal, and local law enforcement matters. It is fitting that his longstanding service to the people of Vermont culminate in this important law enforcement position. His practical experience, background and training qualify him to be Vermont's 34th United States Marshal.  Again, I congratulate Col. Sinclair and his wife, Barbara, who live in Charlotte, and their two sons, on receiving Senate confirmation as United States Marshal for the District of Vermont.                          ____________________
