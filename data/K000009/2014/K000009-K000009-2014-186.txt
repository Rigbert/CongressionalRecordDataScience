Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Benjamin F. Marsh, who passed from this life at the age of 87 years. Ben was a respected attorney and longtime solicitor for the City of Maumee, Ohio. A proud patriot, Ben Marsh's life was one of service to others.  Born in Sylvania, Ohio, Ben served our nation during World War II as a member of the U.S. Navy. After graduating from Ohio Wesleyan University, he attended George Washington Law School. While at George Washington, Ben worked in federal service for the Atomic Energy Commission. Upon earning his law degree he first went to Columbus, Ohio and then returned to Northwest Ohio to practice law.  Early in Ben's law career his services were retained by local government. In 1963 he became the Maumee solicitor. Always committed to public service, Ben decided to run for Congress in 1968, though he was not successful against the incumbent. Ben went on to admirably and ably chair his county party for many years. With a compassionate world view, Ben was named a U.S. Representative to the 1972 general conference of UNESCO. He later served on the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.  Not one to let retirement end his public service, Ben remained an active and engaged citizen. In 1997 Ben was asked by the State Department to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina to help oversee local elections. He served on the Ohio Elections Commission and was a co-chairman in 2007 of a study committee on Lucas County governance. He also briefly served on the Lucas County Board of Elections.  Perhaps Ben's greatest legacy is his family. He and his wife Martha were married for 62 years and together raised a son and daughter. They shared in the joy of their five grandchildren. We know that Ben's family will find comfort in memory and the gift of his life.  Ben Marsh was an outstanding citizen, keen intellect, accomplished lawyer, and a devoted patriot at home and abroad. He embodied the meaning of the words ``enlightened citizen.'' His kind nature and sense of humor made him a bridge builder at every level he served. Our community has been bettered by his lifelong dedication to it. Personally, I am grateful for his advice and counsel so selflessly rendered.                          ____________________
