 I say that because aides to the President say we should not expect much new in the speech. We can expect more of the same: More government, more debt, and higher taxes to pay for it all.  According to news reports, some Democrats are starting to get a little wary of this approach. A number of folks who worked in the Clinton administration have suggested something more positive. But others are pleading with the President to double down on the message that government is the answer.  So far it appears as though the hard-left wing of the party has the upper hand. As liberal columnist E.J. Dionne suggested recently in the Washington Post:       Let's turn [Reagan's] declaration on its head. Opposition      to government isn't the solution.  Opposition to government was and remains the problem, and that is precisely what the President appears to be doing--doubling down on the same government-driven solutions that have kept the private sector mired in what some are calling the worst recovery ever.
