Grover Norquist is one of the conservative gurus in the Republican Party. He is now joining in what he calls his ``K Street Project'' with other conservatives. They are really creating a black list of people with which this administration will not deal. People who are fighting for the environment, people who are fighting for human rights, people who are trying to protect the rights of individuals to have health care, people who are trying to protect consumers will be part of the Norquist black list.  Now what the Bush administration is saying is that they really do not know that they want to comment on this. They should comment on it immediately and reject it. They ought to denounce it. This is unacceptable, whether the President is a Democratic or Republican. Every President should be open to every point of view. They may come down and reach a different conclusion, but to create a black list, as Grover Norquist has for those who are standing up and fighting and basically representing the families of America, is plain wrong.  I ask the Senator from California, do we not see this coming back at us in so many different ways? The Senator mentioned Enron, the weak stock market, and the lack of confidence in corporate America. Should we not have leadership from the White House saying we demand corporate responsibility? We do not find that, do we, in this administration response?
