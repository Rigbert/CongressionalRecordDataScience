Chairman, I rise today to thank the 179 Members of this body who signed on to my letter asking Speaker Gingrich to preserve the Legal Services Corporation [LSC]. Additionally, I would like to thank those Members--Amo Houghton, Stephen Horn, David Skaggs, Howard Berman, Jack Reed, and Connie Morella, among others--who personally talked to other Members of Congress to help stave off further cuts to the Legal Services Corporation.  Legal services is literally the last line of defense against destitution for many deserving Americans. Last year, LSC-funded programs provided assistance to over 50,000 women seeking protection against abusive spouses, 240,000 elderly seeking help ranging from fraud to Medicare, 2,600 veterans seeking help with veteran's benefits, and 9,000 abused and neglected children. There are many in this country who would find themselves trapped in disastrous often life-threatening situations were it not for legal services attorneys.  I would also like to make several points about the contention that the private bar could somehow replace legal services attorneys. I began my career in public service running the Oregon Legal Services Program for the elderly. I came away from my experience with a strong belief that there is a critical role for the private sector to play in providing legal assistance to the poor.  During the time I worked with Legal Services, I organized hundreds of private attorneys to assist in expanding access to the courts for the elderly. Today, 250 private attorneys donate time to the senior law centers in Oregon. In Portland last year, these attorneys donated 1,640 hours. More than 1,000 lawyers in Oregon, and 130,000 lawyers nationwide participate in pro bono activities organized by legal services programs.  However, I know most of the attorneys I worked with would agree that in spite of their hard work, they could not even begin to fill the shoes of the legal services attorneys who could give full time attention to the problems of seniors. The American Bar Association estimates that less than 20 percent of the legal needs of the poor are met. Even with current funding and massive involvement by the private sector, LSC-funded programs are forced to turn away 43 percent of eligible clients. Most legal aid programs turn away women in divorce cases unless they are in danger of their lives from an abuser, and they turn away eviction cases unless the family will go homeless.  Second, the legal problems of the poor, and in my experience, particularly the poor elderly, often require a depth of expertise and a time commitment that is rarely available on a pro bono basis by private attorneys.  Cases that legal service lawyers take up for older Americans range from navigating the bureaucratic maze of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to working through problems with consumer fraud, age discrimination, pension income, property assessments, and wills and probate.  The fact of the matter about legal services is that in most communities they are the only knowledgeable advocate for poor people who find themselves up against a convoluted Federal bureaucracy or abusive members of their family or community. For every anecdote about a legal services attorney taking up a questionable case, there are a thousand where they helped a poor person just get a fair shake.  Again, I would like to thank the many Members of Congress who recognized the importance of legal services in ensuring this country provides equal justice for all, and fought to ensure the continuance of this program.
