 President, today I am introducing the Dangerous Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000. Similar legislation was originally submitted by the Administration in 1999 as part of a larger anti-crime proposal.  Today a terrorist attack in the United States using chemical or biological weapons is one of the most significant terrorist threats we face. In recent years, through the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the enactment of the related implementing legislation, we have provided several statutory safeguards designed to prevent and deter against an attack using chemical weapons. But gaps remain in our laws regulating biological pathogens. It is essential not only that America be fully prepared to respond to such an attack, but also that we take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place.  Currently, federal law bans only the development and possession of biological agents for use as a weapon. But there are sensible things that we can do in the near term to give federal law enforcement the tools that they need to protect our country from these threats--before they materialize into unspeakable scenarios.  Earlier this year, the National Commission on Terrorism reported to Congress. Among its conclusions was that the federal laws regarding the possession of dangerous pathogens are currently insufficient. The Commission specifically recommended, among other things, that Congress make it illegal for anyone not properly certified to possess certain critical pathogens. And they were right.  The bill I introduce today fill several gaps in the law.  First, the bill will make it unlawful for anyone to possess biological agent, toxin or delivery system of a type or in a quantity that under the circumstances is not reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purpose. Second, the bill makes it unlawful to handle a biological agent with conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk to public health and safety. Third, the legislation makes it unlawful to knowingly communicate false, but believable information, concerning an activity which would constitute a violation of this statute. Finally, the bill requires people to report to the federal government their possession of listed biological agents, prohibits the transfer of a listed biological agent to a person who is not registered and makes possession by certain restricted persons--such as convicted felons--unlawful.  Closing these gaps in the law would be a modest but important step to prevent and deter a terrorist act involving biological agents. This should not be a partisan issue. This is an issue of governance, not politics. From Wilmington to Washington State, our constituents need protection and expect and deserve nothing less.  Mr. President, I recognize that the Congressional session is about to end, and therefore it is too late for the bill to be considered this year. But I wanted to introduce the bill now so that it would be available for review by my colleagues and other interested parties inside and outside of government. In particular, I invite comment by interested parties in the scientific community, the business community, and the civil liberties community. I regard the bill I introduce today as an initial draft that is a work in progress, and I welcome constructive comments and suggestions for improvement. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary early in the next session of Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3202       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Dangerous Biological Agent      and Toxin Control Act of 2000''.     SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS STATUTE.       (a) Findings and Purposes.--       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (A) certain biological agents and toxins have the potential      to pose a severe threat to the Nation's public health and      safety, and thereby affect interstate and foreign commerce;       (B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has      published a list of biological agents and toxins that pose a      severe threat to the Nation's public health and safety as an      appendix to part 72 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations;       (C) biological agents and toxins can be used as weapons by      individuals or organizations for the purpose of domestic or      international terrorism or for other criminal purposes;       (D) terrorists and other criminals can also harm national      security, drain the limited resources of all levels of      government devoted to thwarting biological weapons, and      damage interstate and foreign commerce by threatening to use,      and by falsely reporting efforts to use, biological agents      and toxins as weapons;       (E) the Biological Weapons Convention obligates the United      States to take necessary measures within the United States to      prohibit and prevent the development, production,      stockpiling, acquisition, or retention of biological agents      and toxins of types and in quantities that have no      justification for prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful      purposes;       (F) the mere possession of biological agents and toxins is      a potential danger that affects the obligations of the United      States under the Biological Weapons Convention and affects      interstate and foreign commerce; and       (G) persons in possession of harmful biological agents and      toxins should handle them in a safe manner and, in the case      of agents and toxins listed by the Department of Health and      Human Services as posing a severe threat to the Nation's      public health and safety, report their possession and the      purpose for their possession to the appropriate Federal      agency in order to ensure that such possession is for      peaceful scientific research or development.       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--       (A) strengthen the implementation by the United States of      the Biological Weapons Convention and to ensure that      biological agents and toxins are possessed for only      prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes;       (B) establish penalties for the false reporting of      violations of chapter 10 of title 18, United States Code      (relating to biological weapons); and       (C) improve the statutory definitions relating to      biological weapons.       (b) Additional Measures.--       (1) In general.--Section 175 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Additional Prohibitions Relating to Biological      Agents, Toxins, and Delivery Systems.--       ``(1) Unlawful possession.--Whoever knowingly possesses any      biological agent, toxin, or delivery system of a type or in a      quantity that, under the circumstances, is not reasonably      justified by a prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful      purpose, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more      than 10 years, or both. Knowledge of whether the type or      quantity of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system      is reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective, or      other peaceful purpose is not an element of the offense. For      purposes of this paragraph, the terms `biological agent' and      `toxin' do not encompass any biological agent or toxin that      is in its naturally occurring environment, if such agent or      toxin has not been cultivated, collected, or otherwise      extracted from its natural source.       ``(2) Unsafe handling.--       ``(A) In general.--Whoever, with conscious disregard of an      unreasonable risk to public health and safety, handles an      item knowing it to be a biological agent, toxin, or delivery      system in a manner that grossly deviates from accepted norms,      shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 1      year, or both.       ``(B) Aggravated offense.--Whoever in the course of a      violation of subparagraph (A) causes bodily injury (as      defined in section 1365(g)(4) of this title) to any      individual (other than the perpetrator)--       ``(i) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more      than 10 years, or both; and       ``(ii) if death results from the offense, shall be fined      under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or for      life, or both fined and imprisoned.       ``(d) False Information.--       ``(1) Criminal violation.--Whoever communicates      information, knowing the information to be false and under      circumstances in which such information may reasonably be      believed, concerning the existence of activity that would      constitute a violation of subsection (a) or (c) shall be      fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or      both.       ``(2) Civil penalty.--Whoever communicates information,      knowing the information to be false, concerning the existence      of activity that would constitute a violation of subsection      (a) or (c) is liable to the United States or any State for a      civil penalty of the greater of $10,000 or the amount of      money expended by the United States or the State in      responding to the false information.       ``(e) Reporting, Transfer, and Possession of Select      Agents.--       ``(1) Obligation to report.--Any person who possesses a      select agent shall report such possession to the designated      agency, in the manner prescribed by the designated agency,      within 72 hours of the effective date of the regulation      issued by that agency pursuant to this paragraph or within 72      hours of subsequently obtaining possession of the agent or      toxin, except that, if such person is a registered entity,      the reporting, if any, shall be in the manner as otherwise      directed by regulation by the designated agency. If a person      complies with this paragraph, there is no obligation for any      employee of such person to file a separate report concerning      the employee's possession of a select agent in the workplace      of such person.       ``(2) Criminal penalty for willful failure to report.--Any      person who willfully fails to make the report required by      paragraph (1) within the prescribed period shall be fined      under this title, imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both.      In this paragraph, the term `willfully' means an intentional      violation of a known duty to report.       ``(3) Civil penalty for failure to report.--Any person who      fails to make the report required by paragraph (1) within the      prescribed period is liable to the United States for a civil      penalty of $5,000.       ``(4) Penalty for possession of unreported select agents.--     Any person who knowingly possesses a biological agent or      toxin that is a select agent for which a report required by      paragraph (1) has not been made shall be fined under this      title, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.       ``(5) Unauthorized transfer of select agents.--Whoever      knowingly transfers a select agent to any person who is not a      registered entity shall be fined under this title, imprisoned      not more than 5 years, or both. For purposes of this      paragraph, the term `transfers' does not encompass the      transfer of a select agent within the workplace between      employees of the same registered entity, or between employees      of any person who has filed the report required by paragraph      (1), if the transfer is authorized by such entity or person.       ``(6) Possession of select agents by restricted      individuals.--       ``(A) Prohibition on possession.--Except as otherwise      provided in this section or in section 2(b)(3)(G) of the      Dangerous Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000, no      restricted individual shall knowingly possess or attempt to      possess any biological agent or toxin if that biological      agent or toxin is a select agent.       ``(B) Penalty.--Any individual who violates subparagraph      (A) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than      5 years, or both.       ``(C) Employers of individuals who possess select agents.--     Employers of individuals who will possess select agents in      the course of their employment shall require such      individuals, prior to being given access to select agents, to      complete a form in which the individual affirms or denies the      existence of each of the restrictions set forth in section      178(8) of this title. In the case of individuals already      employed as of the date of enactment of this subsection who      possess select agents in the course of their employment,      employers shall, not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this subsection, require those individuals to      complete such a form. Such form shall be retained by the      employer for not less than 5 years after the individual      terminates his employment with that employer.       ``(D) Employees.--       ``(i) Whoever willfully and knowingly falsifies or conceals      a material fact or makes any materially false, fictitious, or      fraudulent statement or representation in completing the form      required under subparagraph (C) shall be fined under this      title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.       ``(ii) The prohibition of subparagraph (A) does not apply      to possession by a restricted individual of a select agent in      the workplace of his employer if the basis for the      prohibition relates solely to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of      section 178(8) of this title and a determination is made to      waive the prohibition in accordance with the rules and      procedures established pursuant to subsection (f).       ``(iii) The prohibition of subparagraph (A) does not apply      to possession by a restricted individual of a select agent in      the workplace of his employer if the basis for the      prohibition relates solely to subparagraph (B)(ii) or (G) of      section 178(8) of this title and is more than 5 years old      (not counting time served while in custody), and a      determination is made to waive the prohibition in accordance      with the rules and procedures established pursuant to      subsection (f).       ``(iv) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term      `employer' means any person who is a registered entity or has      filed the report required by section 175(e)(1) of this title      and employs a restricted individual.       ``(E) Certain nonpermanent resident aliens.--The      prohibition of subparagraph (A) does not apply to possession      by a restricted individual of a select agent if the basis for      the prohibition relates solely to subparagraph (F) of section      178(8) of this title, and the restricted individual has      received a waiver from the agency designated to carry out the      functions of this subparagraph. The designated agency may      issue a waiver if it determines, in consultation with the      Attorney General, that a waiver is in the public interest.       ``(f) Waivers of Restrictions on Possession of Select      Agents in Course of Employment.--The agency designated to      carry out this subsection, after consultation with      appropriate agencies, with representatives of the scientific      and medical community, and with other appropriate public and      private entities and organizations (including consultation      concerning employment practices in working with select      agents), shall establish the rules and procedures governing      waivers of the provisions of subsection (e)(6)(A) with     respect to possession of select agents by restricted      individuals in the course of employment. Such rules and      procedures shall address, among other matters as found      appropriate by the designated agency, whether (or the      circumstances under or the extent to which) the determination      to grant a waiver shall be reserved to the Government, or may      be made by the employer (either with or without consultation      with the Government).       ``(g) Reimbursement of Costs.--       ``(1) Convicted defendant.--       ``(A) Subsection (a), (c), or (e).--The court shall order      any person convicted of an offense under subsection (a), (c),      or (e) to reimburse the United States or any State for any      expenses incurred by the United States or the State incident      to the seizure, storage, handling, transportation, and      destruction or other disposal of any property that was seized      in connection with an investigation of the commission of such      offense by that person.       ``(B) Subsection (d)(1).--The court shall order any person      convicted of an offense under subsection (d)(1) to reimburse      the United States for any expenses incurred by the United      States incident to the investigation of the commission by      that person of such offense, including the cost of any      response made by any Federal military or civilian agency to      protect public health or safety.       ``(2) Owner liability.--The owner or possessor of any      property seized and forfeited under this chapter shall be      liable to the United States for any expenses incurred      incident to the seizure and forfeiture, including any      expenses relating to the handling, storage, transportation,      and destruction or other disposition of the seized and      forfeited property.       ``(3) Jointly and severally liable.--A person ordered to      reimburse the United States for expenses under this chapter      shall be jointly and severally liable for such expenses with      each other person, if any, who is ordered under this      subsection to reimburse the United States for the same      expenses.''.       (2) Technical clarifications.--       (A) Section 175.--Section 175(a) of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by striking ``section'' and inserting      ``subsection''.
