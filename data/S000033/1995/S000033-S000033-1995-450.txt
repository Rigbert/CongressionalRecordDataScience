 Speaker, I am submitting a copy of an article which appeared in the Brattleboro Reformer, Brattleboro, VT today. I think that it will be of interest to many and request that it be included in the Record.          [From the Brattleboro (VT) Reformer, June 13, 1995]                              Cheer Leader       Of all the fishermen, in all the rivers, in all the states      of the union, why did it have to be Tim Kipp in the      Androscoggin River in Milan, N.H., when Speaker of the House      Newt Gingrich stopped Sunday to chat?       Kipp, a history teacher at BUHS, is Brattleboro point man      for Vermont's independent Congressman Bernard Sanders. Well      to the left, his presence in the middle of a river was      probably the first time in years Kipp has been in the      mainstream. He was waist deep in water and up to here in      indignation when Gingrich, in New Hampshire testing the      political waters, paused for a photo op. It didn't help that      the very waters Kipp was fishing are imperiled by an anti-     environment initiative championed by the conservative      speaker.       Gingrich, a pawn of Murphy's Law, did not know whom he was      greeting when he waved hello.       Kipp seethed back: ``Your politics are some of the meanest      politics I have ever heard. You make Calvin Coolidge look      like a liberal.''       Gingrich dismissed Kipp's testy greeting with an intriguing      summary: ``The guy is from Vermont and he didn't have that      cheerful New Hampshire conservatism.'' The key word here is      ``cheerful.''       To be cheerful in the face of assaults on the environment      and cruel cuts to veterans, children, the elderly, the poor      and the sick is evidence of either viciousness or delusion.      We trust it is delusion that is behind ``cheerful New      Hampshire conservatism.'' Certainly, delusion--plus smoke and      mirrors--are the main underpinnings of the Republican      congressional agenda. Thus would tax breaks for the wealthy      help reduce the budget. Thus would denying the needy      simultaneously empower them.       Lately, Gingrich has been hustling a picturesque, even      uplifting, vision of an alternative to a national social      welfare system he regards as crushingly expensive and lacking      a moral soul. In Gingrich's America, private charities would      shelter the homeless, feed the hungry and lend a hand to the      lame and halt. The welfare state would be dismantled.      Government employees would be replaced by volunteers      sustained only by their sense of mission.       According to the leaders of the charities that would be      called upon to fill the breach left by an obliterated welfare      system, however, Gingrich is, well deluded.       Officials of numerous national charitable institutions--     Catholic Charities USA, the Salvation Army, the American Red      Cross, among others--say private donations to their agencies      have dropped off in recent years. Both tax laws and a      precarious economy discourage giving, and volunteerism is      down in an economy where there are too few non-working      Americans with extra time on their hands.       It's hard to be cheerful in the face of the truth, but      somebody has to balance the happy horsefeathers offered by      the speaker. Maybe Kipp should go on a speaking tour of New      Hampshire and Newt ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' Gingrich should      go fishing.                               ____________________
