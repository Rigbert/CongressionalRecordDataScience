Speaker, shortly, the House will begin its consideration of the so-called ``patent reform'' bill.  At last night's meeting of the Rules Committee, when the debate on the rule within the committee wrapped up, the chairman chastised the Judiciary Committee for voting out a bill in violation of House rules, and specifically the House CutGo rules. However, the Rules Committee also voted a waiver that allows the CutGo rules to be ignored. That waiver is described by its supporters as a technical correction. This technical correction involves $700 million, hardly something that is technical.  It seems to me that the best thing that should have been done was that the Rules Committee ordered the bill re-referred to the Judiciary Committee so the Judiciary Committee could do it right in conformity with the House rules, like the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) did when he was the chair and which I did when I was the chair. We ought to know this when we're debating it.                          ____________________
