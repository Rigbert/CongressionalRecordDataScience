 President, I want to speak on the nomination of the person just announced. In the process, I am going to speak about some other people who have similar issues.  Tax collection is meant to reflect shared benefits and appeal to equality as a fundamental value. However, to paraphrase George Orwell, some people are more equal than others.  More specifically, several recent Presidential nominees have apparently set themselves above the typical American citizen in the lack of importance they place on complying with their tax obligations. This certainly seems to be the case with Dr. Brainard, nominated to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.  As a nominee, Dr. Brainard was treated the same as any other nominee to come through the Finance Committee in the 9 years I have been either chairman or ranking member. For the past 9 years, and likely much longer, the Finance Committee has vetted all Presidential nominees referred to the committee, and that vetting includes a tax review.
