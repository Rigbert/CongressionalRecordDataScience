What he has been hearing is the same thing that I have been hearing.  I think a lot of us, Madam President, have been distressed by reading some of the polls that might imply that there is a deadlock, and somehow the Republicans have something to do with it, when, in fact, we have come up with a solution, the solution that was a part of the mandate of the election of 1994.  They told us in loud and clear terms as Republicans took control of both the House and the Senate, that we are tired of business as usual, that we do want less Government involved in our lives. We want to change that trend that has existed since the 1960's.  I am very proud to announce here today that in our partly closed offices around the State of Oklahoma and here in Washington, that we have been watching very closely as the calls come in. The calls have come in, and the very first 6 hours after supposedly the Government shut down, 98 people called in and said that they thought the President was right; but 611 people called in--almost an 8-1 ratio--and those 611 people said ``Don't give in.''  We made ourselves clear in November of 1994: If the Republicans cannot do it, you know the Democrats will not do it. Do not cave in at this time. We want a balanced budget.  The Republicans have offered a balanced budget. Every Democrat I know of has stood on this floor and said we all want balanced budgets, but when it gets right down to it, they really do not want balanced budgets. They want business as usual.  We have offered a balanced budget. We have sent all this to the President. It is in the President's court now.  It is hard for me to understand what is going to happen. I encourage all of my Republican colleagues to listen to the loud and clear message that we are getting from Oklahoma, a very wise State. That is, stay the course. The same as Mr. Ham said, who wrote to our majority leader, Bob Dole, that he quoted a few minutes ago.  I have no intentions of caving in. This is the last opportunity we will have to actually achieve a balanced budget in America. We are going to do it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
