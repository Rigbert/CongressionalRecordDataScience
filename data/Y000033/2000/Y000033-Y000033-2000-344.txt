Mr. Chairman, I have not read the amendment of the gentleman. I apologize.  Does it, in fact, specifically say only land acquisition?  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, it only applies to those funds under the land and water conservation portion, which I believe the bill of the gentleman only provides for land acquisition.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time having expired, the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sweeney).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
