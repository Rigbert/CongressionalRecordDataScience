 I had the opportunity of working with her on a number of Federal employee issues. She and I both represented large numbers of Federal employees. She was very conscientious, hard working, focused, obviously very concerned about our national security, represented very substantial defense establishments, Navy establishments in her district. Her district was across the Potomac River from mine, as the gentleman probably knows, and we will miss her. I know that her constituents will miss her. And we were certainly pleased to have the opportunity to make sure that any and all Members who could go and wanted to go would be able to attend the services that will be held for her tomorrow at 1 p.m.  I thank the gentleman for his observations and join him in my commendations to her.
