Speaker, I want to make it clear that I support balancing the Federal budget within 7 years. It can be done if we roll up our sleeves and work in a bipartisan fashion.  However, I am not able to support this evening's continuing resolution as it fails to provide even the most basic protections for Social Security or Medicare. Further, it would immediately cut education, veterans' homeless programs, and--at the outset of winter--the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.  This is not a vote taken in a vacuum. The House has adopted a balanced budget that calls for $270 billion in Medicare cuts. I cannot and I will not support the weakening of Medicare for our seniors.  I am prepared tonight to work across the aisle to balance the budget. My priorities for cutting the Federal budget include slashing military spending, agricultural subsidies, the space program, and Federal agency overhead, as well as eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  I will work with anyone to bring the Federal budget under control, but I cannot support tonight's partisan effort.
