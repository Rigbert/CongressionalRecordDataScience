In it he says:       I am writing to express my strong support for passage of a      comprehensive bipartisan cyber security bill by the Senate      this week. The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and      demands immediate action--  Not action next year, not action next Congress, not action even after the recess we are about to take. As General Alexander says:       The time to act is now; we simply cannot afford further      delay. Moreover, to be most effective in protecting against      this threat to our national security, cyber security      legislation should address both information sharing and core      critical infrastructure hardening.  That is exactly what the bill we have brought before the Senate would do. I urge our colleagues to join us. If they have other ideas, offer amendments, but let's get on with the task before usbefore we are looking back and saying: Why didn't we act? Why didn't we pay attention to all of those warnings?
