 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday, July 9; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session and resume the consideration of the Bress nomination. Finally, I ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.
