 President, I want to inform Members of the Senate that the order of sentences in amendment No. 1258 does not reflect a meeting of the minds of Senators involved, and we have discussed it among them. That will have to be brought to the attention of the conferees for resolution.  I ask unanimous consent that the substitute be agreed to, the bill be read the third time, and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
