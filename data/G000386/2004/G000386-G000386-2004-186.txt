 The provision was adopted to provide needed clarifications in order to eliminate the uncertainties that have arisen regarding the proper application of the income forecast method. I believe the disputes that have arisen regarding the mechanics of the income forecast formula are extremely unproductive and an inefficient use of both taxpayer and limited tax administration resources. By adopting these clarifications, I believe the committee intended to end any disputes and prevent any further waste of both taxpayer and Government resources in resolving these disputes. Any existing disputes should be resolved expeditiously in a manner consistent with the clarifications included in the bill.
