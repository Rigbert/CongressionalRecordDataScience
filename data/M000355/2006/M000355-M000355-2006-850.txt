 President, this morning we are getting an early start, and we will shortly resume debate on the immigration bill. In just a moment, I will offer an amendment relating to photo identifications. The time until 9:30 a.m. will be equally divided for debate on that amendment. At 9:30, we will proceed to a rollcall vote on the McConnell amendment. That vote will be followed by a vote on invoking cloture on the comprehensive immigration bill. Following that cloture vote, the Senate will recess to attend a joint meeting with the House to hear an address by the Prime Minister of Israel.  Obviously, we expect another full day considering immigration-related amendments, and we will have rollcalls periodically all day.                          ____________________[Page S5045]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
