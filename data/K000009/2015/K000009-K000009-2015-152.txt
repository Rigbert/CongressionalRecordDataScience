 We really appreciate everything that she has done legislatively over these last 5 years to help our ports develop, to connect rail to ports, highway to rail. It is really amazing what her leadership has done in forming the PORTS Caucus. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Hahn.  I rise this evening to join both of you. Obviously, I am in a different part of the country, but we understand what it means to Make It In America. I think the last company in Washington, D.C., our Nation's Capital, was the old Government Printing Office that used to print some of its goods here, but it doesn't anymore.  To Make It In America creates jobs here, and what is interesting to look at, Congressman Garamendi talks about the transportation and infrastructure bill. No bill that this Congress could pass would create more jobs than that bill. We hope to have it cleared.  I know Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio are working very hard on that. I know Members like Congressman Garamendi are helping lift them across the finish line.  The Make It In America agenda will create tens of thousands of jobs across this country. Look at every community you go to, and look at what is unfinished. Old bridges are falling down. There used to be a song, ``London Bridge is Falling Down.'' Well, I think they are falling down in America now. Highways are not complete. We have old airports.
