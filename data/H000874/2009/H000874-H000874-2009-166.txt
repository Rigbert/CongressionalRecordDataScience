 First of all, of course, as you know, the House has passed all 12 of our appropriation bills, so we're ready to go to conference on all 12 of those bills. The Senate has passed four of their bills and is working on the balance. We hope to conference and have on the floor a number of those bills before the end of September, before the beginning of the fiscal year. There obviously will be, given the Senate's schedule, a requirement for a continuing resolution for some period of time, perhaps in a 30-day period time frame. So we will be considering those bills, those conference reports.  In addition, as you heard, the student loan reform bill will be on the floor next week, we believe. Defense authorization is in conference, and we expect that conference report. Health care reform, obviously we expect to do that this fall. Regulatory reform is expected to be an item on our agenda in the House this fall. Additionally, we will be waiting on the Senate on a number of items that we have sent to them, including climate change and food safety, which, as you know, the House passed. So those will be some of the items. That is not an exhaustive list, but is, I think, a good list of what we expect to be considering during the coming weeks.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.  Does the gentleman expect the House to be in session beyond the targeted adjournment date of October 30?  And I yield.
