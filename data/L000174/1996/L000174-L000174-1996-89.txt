President, would the Senator from Kentucky add to his request that before we start the Coverdell and the other matters, that the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, would have 2 minutes to speak on an amendment that has already been accepted.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be allowed to proceed for 2 minutes on an amendment we just passed, prior to the time running on the Brown NATO amendment and the Coverdell amendment.
