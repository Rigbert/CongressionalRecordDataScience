President, I rise today to honor a faithful public servant on the occasion of his retirement. J. David Hood, the regional commissioner of the Public Buildings Service for General Services Administration's Great Lakes Region, is retiring on July 1, 2011, after 40 years of dedicated service to the Federal Government. David heads an organization that is responsible for more than 35 million square feet of Federal offices and workplaces in nearly 1,000 buildings owned or leased by GSA. He also manages over $1.2 billion in construction and renovation projects throughout the region.  David joined GSA's Great Lakes Regional Office in 1971 as an intern before becoming a real estate appraiser, a project manager, director of planning, and eventually serving as deputy assistant regional administrator, Public Buildings Service. In 1993, David moved to the agency's former Federal Supply Service, FSS, where he served as assistant regional administrator for 9 years before taking the same position, now regional commissioner, with Public Buildings Service. He is a member of the Federal Government's SeniorExecutive Service and is a recipient of GSA's Meritorious Service Award. David also served as acting regional administrator for GSA's Great Lakes Region from January 2009 until January 2011.  In a sense, David is the landlord for my State offices in Chicago and Carbondale. In that capacity, I saw firsthand David's commitment to the Federal Government and wise use of taxpayer money. Last year, my Chicago office in the Kluczynski Federal Building was in need of repair and reconfiguration. David and his team completed what would normally be a year-long project in just 4 months, and stayed within budget. In addition to meeting the operational needs of my Chicago staff so that they can best serve the people of Illinois, the renovation also produced considerable cost- and energy-savings.  As David's storied career in public service comes to a close, I rise to thank him for his hard work on behalf of the American people, and in particular the people of Illinois. David is an exemplary civil servant, and while his retirement is well-deserved, his service to the Federal Government will be missed.                          ____________________
