 President, I want to respond to the Senator from Oklahoma and commend him for his efforts in this area.  What Senator Dodd and I and other Members, including the Presiding Officer at the moment, who is involved in banking issues and insurance, and so forth, know is that this flood insurance program is bankrupt, as does the Senator from Oklahoma. It is not working. And what we are trying to do is move it toward an actuarially sound basis.  The Senator's suggestion is something I think we ought to consider as we move along down the road because we want to make sure nobody beats the system. In other words, the more people who are involved in the flood insurance program, proper mapping is going to mean lower premiums to everybody. And the problem, in the long run, as we have catastrophes, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes--well, in this case floods and water--that the insurance would take care of it rather than thinking, as the Senator from Oklahoma says: Well, I do not have to insure you; the Government, the taxpayer, the people will take care of me in the end.  I think that is what we are trying to prevent. I think the Senator from Oklahoma has a very good point.  I yield the floor.
