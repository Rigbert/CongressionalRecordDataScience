Then this year when the Defense authorization bill came forward, is it not true that the Democratic side offered another amendment in an attempt to strike a bipartisan position on foreign policy in Iraq, an amendment which was sponsored by Senator Levin of Michigan, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is a graduate of West Point, served in the United States Army, and that this amendment which we offered to our friends on the Republican side to join us this year said we would start a transition this year before the end of the calendar year by redeploying American troops outside of Iraq? This amendment we offered had 39 of 45 Democratic Senators supporting it and no Republican support.  I would ask the Senator from Nevada, at the end of that Defense authorization bill, just a few weeks ago, was any position taken by the Republican side of the aisle that suggested any change in policy in Iraq?
