 Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that the people with whom the conference would be held on the other side of the Capitol happen to be a majority of our party? So we don't trust the majority party on the other side of the aisle to come to conference and not hold to the fiscal discipline we want to see happen; isn't that a little bit bizarre?
