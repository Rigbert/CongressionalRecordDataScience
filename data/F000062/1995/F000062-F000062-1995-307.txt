 President, yesterday the Senate voted 90 to 0 to approve an amendment I authored to the counterterrorism legislation. Because of the importance of this amendment, I want to clarify its intent and language.  This amendment will make it easier for law enforcement officials to trace the origins of bombs used for violent or criminal purposes. The legislation specifically requires the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study within 12 months on the use of taggants in all explosive materials, including black or smokeless powder. Once that study is completed, the Treasury Department must enforce the use of taggants in explosive materials within 6 months, depending on the study's findings and other factors. In addition, this amendment instructs the Treasury Department to also study ways of making common chemicals, such as fertilizer, inert and unusable as an explosive.  This amendment exempts putting taggants in black or smokeless gun powder when that powder is used for small arms ammunition, or bullets--an exemption that already exists under current law. In addition, black or smokeless powder used in antique firearms for recreational purposes is also exempted from this amendment. The amendment does allow for the use of taggants in black or smokeless powder produced for sale in large quantities or for other uses.  I want to clarify that this amendment extends the existing exemption under current law. Under sections 845 (a)(4) and (5) of Title 18, United States Code, small arms ammunitiona and antique weapons used for recreational purposes are exempt from all explosive regulations, except for a few specific circumstances. This amendment simply reiterates current law.
