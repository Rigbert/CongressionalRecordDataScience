Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Gary and Iris Greenbaum, of Munster, Indiana. On November 1, 1998, Gary and Iris will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to our community and to the State of Israel. Their praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the Northwest Indiana-Israel Dinner of State, as they receive the 1998 Israel Builders of Freedom Award. The Freedom Builder Awards are given each year to worthy recipients who demonstrate their dedication and service to Israel, the State of Israel Bonds, the Jewish community, and our own community. The Greenbaums are most certainly worthy recipients of this year's award. True community activists, Gary and Iris give much of their time to local charities and service organizations. These community groups include the Munster Citizens Police Commission, the Northwest Indiana Jewish Welfare Federation, the Gleaner Food Depository, Temple Israel, Congregation Beth Israel, and the local Jewish Federation.  Gary and Iris, longtime residents of Munster, hale from Gary and Chicago, respectively. After both graduated from Indiana University, they returned to Gary's native region, Northwest Indiana, and have made our area their permanent home. In 1971, Gary started his career as an insurance agent. After a few years gaining quality experience, in 1976 he founded the Greenbaum Insurance Agency, located in Griffith, Indiana; Iris also works for the Agency as its most important unpaid worker in her dual role as office manager and insurance agent. Gary and Iris are the parents of two sons, Jason and Evan, of whom they are immensely proud. Both Gary and Iris have their own interests outside of work and their dedicated community activities. Gary is an antique automobile buff, and Iris is a master gardener; both enjoy traveling together. They plan on continuing their charity and community work, in addition to providing affordable, local insurance services to Northwest Indiana residents.  In the words of Gary himself, ``I believe every Jew has the solemn responsibility to safeguard his brothers from oppression by helping to guarantee that Israel exists as a haven where any Jew can choose his own destiny.'' As America has served as a haven of freedom and opportunity for immigrants the world over, so her citizens now reach out and ensure that the freedom-loving peoples of the world are safe and secure. To quote Thomas Paine, ``Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.'' No one is more deserving of the opportunity and freedom guaranteed by America than Gary and Iris Greenbaum; their efforts have truly gone above and beyond the call of duty.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Gary and Iris Greenbaum for receiving the 1998 Israel Builders of Freedom Award. Their dedicated service to both the State of Israel and our Northwest Indiana community is commendable and admirable. No government, leader, or military can safeguard the twin blessings of freedom and opportunity without the labors of dedicated, conscientious citizens. With their support, our world has become a better place, a place of freedom, democracy, and opportunity. Indiana's First Congressional District is proud to count two such dedicated, conscientious citizens, Gary and Iris Greenbaum, among her residents.                          ____________________
