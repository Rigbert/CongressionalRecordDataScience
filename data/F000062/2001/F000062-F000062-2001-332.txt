 President, I rise today to express my disappointment that President Bush chose yesterday to announce that as his first major policy action since becoming President he is reinstating the ``global gag rule'' restricting United States assistance to international family planning organizations.  There have been few issues in recent years that have been more debated, with people of good intention on both sides of the issue, and I am dismayed that the President has opted to start his Administration with such a divisive action.  The world now has more than 6 billion people. The United Nations estimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. Almost all of this growth will occur in the places least able to bear up under the pressures of massive population increases. The brunt of this decision will be felt not in the United States but in developing countries lacking the resources needed to provide basic health or education services.  If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of their families, they must have access to the educational and medical resources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their health.  In fact, international family planning programs reduce poverty, improve health and raise living standards around the world; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children.  Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the United States has established a long and distinguished record of world leadership on international family planning and reproductive health issues.  Unfortunately, in recent years these programs have come under increasing partisan attack by the anti-choice wing of the Republican party--despite the fact that no U.S. international family planning funds are spent on international abortion.  I do not expect President Bush to change his mind. He is the President, and, under legislation passed by the last Congress it is now his prerogative to determine how U.S. international family planning assistance will be used.  But I would ask him, and his advisors, to think long and hard about this decision, about how this decision squares with ``humble'' U.S. leadership of the international community and our commitment to help those around the world who need and want our help and assistance.  I would ask the women of America, as they consider their own reproductive rights, to consider the aim and intent of a policy in which the reproductive rights of American women are approached one way, and those of women in the developing world another.  And I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who feel as strongly about this issue as I do to consider what legislative remedies and options we may have available to address this decision.  Mr. President, it had been my sincere hope that under President Bush international family planning would have been an issue that Republicans and Democrats, the Administration and Congress, could have worked on together, in a bipartisan fashion.  It is with no small amount of regret that I say that that no longer appears to be the case.                          ____________________
