I urge other Senators to show their support for the men and women who work tirelessly to protect our communities.  This week is National Police Week, a time when thousands of law enforcement officers come to our Nation's Capital, and we pause to honor the sacrifices of our men and women in law enforcement. On Tuesday night the names of 286 officers killed in the line of duty were added to the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, 101 of whom were lost in 2013. The memorial now contains the names of over 20,000 fallen officers.  This resolution pays tribute to those who have fallen, recognizing May 15, 2014, as ``National Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and calling on the people of the United States to observe that day with solemnity, appreciation, and respect. Earlier today, Senator Grassley and I attended the 33rd Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial service here on the West Front of the Capitol. The event was a somber reminder of the sacrifices that law enforcement officers make every day. We have a responsibility to support them in the critical work they do.  I also urge the Senate to come together to honor law enforcement officers by supporting the passage of both S.933, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, and S. 357, the National Blue Alert Act. These bills are unanimously and strongly supported by law enforcement and passing these bills would provide tangible, life-saving assistance to those who serve on the front lines, protecting our communities.  I thank Senators Grassley, Shaheen, Wicker, Markey, Begich, Udall of New Mexico, Hagan, Coons, Durbin, Franken, Booker, Landrieu, Reed, Blumenthal, Schatz, Heitkamp, Feinstein, Udall of Colorado, Wicker, Pryor, Hirono, Cardin, Cochran, Warner, Mikulski, Warren, Schumer, Murray, Whitehouse, Donnelly, Heinrich, and Klobuchar for their cosponsorship of this resolution and their support for law enforcement. I am very glad to see this resolution pass.
