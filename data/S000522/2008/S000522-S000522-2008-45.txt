I appreciate my friend for yielding.  One of the concerns is, while they may be terrorists or homegrown, we're talking about and we are very concerned about is that this is the Government of the People's Republic of China and their enablers, people who are part of a network, that is very much focused on trying to wreak havoc and to glean information about dissidents, about legislative strategy, and about what we know about what's going on----
