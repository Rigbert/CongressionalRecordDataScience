Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is regrettable that my two colleagues, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) have decided to make this very meritorious bill into a debate on racial profiling.  I have offered, as has the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), to send a letter to the Comptroller General asking for the precise study that the gentleman from Michigan and the gentlewoman from Texas have asked for.  As I said previously, every Member of Congress can get GAO studies on any relevant issue that they desire. We do not need to clutter up the statute books by requiring the Comptroller General to do a study on this subject or on any other subject. It merely requires sending a letter signed by a Member of Congress.  Now, if the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), who represents a border community, and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee), who represents a district which is pretty close to the other border, if their idea becomes law, I am afraid that every immigration inspector who has to stop everybody who is legally crossing the border and ask them questions, they are going to have to compile this data for the GAO study, and the lines behind the border are going to get longer and longer, and people are going to be more frustrated, whether they are coming across the border to go to school, which we are going to talk about in a few minutes, or to further commerce, or just to visit the United States of America as a tourist, which is something that I think we encourage, as well, because we like foreigners spending their money here.  I am going to work with the gentleman from Michigan and the gentlewoman from Texas. But that is no reason, just because the issue of racial profiling is brought up, and a process where everybody has to be stopped and detained and questioned as they cross the border, that this very meritorious bill should be voted down.  Anybody in law enforcement will tell us that the quicker a drunk driver or a driver whose ability is impaired by drugs is stopped, the fewer people are placed at risk; so why not stop them on the border, and if they are drunk or impaired, do the appropriate chemical tests?  Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good idea. It might save lives. I commend the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) for keeping this a clean bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1500
