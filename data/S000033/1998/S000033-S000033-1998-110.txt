  Madam Chairman, my understanding is that this amendment has the support of both the majority and the minority, and therefore, I will be very, very brief.  Madam Chairman, this amendment simply requires the Controller General of the United States to conduct a study on whether it would be beneficial, in light of the expected consolidation of the financial industry, if H.R. 10 were to pass to establish uniform limits on commissions and other fees charged to consumers who purchase stocks, bonds, insurance, and other financial products.                              {time}  2000  This amendment would require a report to be submitted to Congress concerning the results of the study within 1 year of enactment of this bill. That is the short version of my speech.
