President, I have an editorial by the New York Times, entitled, ``Not So Harsh on Refugees.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1996]                        Not So Harsh on Refugees       The ordeal of a young woman from Togo who came to America      to avoid the practice of female genital mutilation should      give members of Congress pause before they approve any      further limitations on the rights of refugees seeking      sanctuary in the United States. As detailed last week by      Celia Dugger of The Times, Fauziya Kasinga was detained for      months before she obtained a hearing, and she was strip-     searched and held with convicted criminals. Shamefully, the      anti-terrorism bill just passed by Congress and immigration      bills still pending could subject many more refugees to      similar treatment.       Ms. Kasinga's case involves female genital mutilation, a      common practice in some two dozen African nations that      involves cutting off portions of a young woman's genitals,      often without anesthesia.       Ms. Kasinga fled Togo in 1994 to avoid mutilation after      losing her status as a member of a privileged family. Her      determination to avoid the practice could have subjected her      to harsh treatment had she stayed, or if she is forced to      return home. She may have a reasonable claim for asylum on      the basis of membership in a social group vulnerable to      persecution in her homeland.       But when Ms. Kasinga landed at Newark Airport in December      1994, seeking asylum with a phony passport, she was      immediately detained. Under the law, people who have credible      claims for asylum and family members already living in the      United States can be released, pending a hearing. Ms. Kasinga      has a cousin in the Washington area, but she was kept in      custody anyway. After being held for months at a New Jersey      detention center, Ms. Kasinga was transferred to a      Pennsylvania prison and housed with convicted criminals.       Ms. Kasinga fared no better in court, where an immigration      judge denied her claim. The Board of Immigration Appeals will      hear her case in May.       If some members of Congress had their way, Ms. Kasinga      would have been returned to Togo long ago. Under an      immigration bill passed by the House, but now held up in the      Senate, anyone attempting to enter the country without proper      documents would only be entitled to a one-hour interview with      an asylum officer. Denial of an asylum claim would be subject      to review by a supervisor, but not by any other      administrative or judicial body. These provisions, similar to      ones in the anti-terrorism bill, would deny a fair hearing to      many asylum seekers.       The House immigration bill also calls for detention of any      asylum seeker who is awaiting a hearing, even when a credible      claim has been presented. That could subject more would-be      refugees to the harsh treatment suffered by Ms. Kasinga.       Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont plans to offer an      amendment that would not only override the harsh exclusion      provisions in the immigration bill but also supersede the      same provisions in the anti-terrorism bill. Congress should      follow his lead.
