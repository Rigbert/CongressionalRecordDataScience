Speaker, Jerusalem Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio will bid a fond farewell to its revered patriarch, Reverend Harry Crenshaw. With the coming of spring, Reverend Crenshaw retires as pastor of the church after a lifetime of service to his flock and that of the larger Toledo community. Truly a community leader, long recognized as the voice of the church, Reverend Crenshaw has been a mainstay of the Jerusalem congregation and its neighborhood for decades. He is a man for others.  ``Blessed is the may that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits at the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord; and in His law does he meditate both day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of the water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.'' (Psalms, 1:1-3)  Within the words of this passage lies Reverend Dr. Harry Crenshaw. A man of God, he lives the Word in thought and deed, and has imparted his love of that Word to generations. Through his strength and wisdom he has provided counsel to thousands. The esteem with which he is held is testament to his prominent role in the lifeblood of the community and the personal lives of the people to whom he ministers.  While no one can build a church alone, Jerusalem Baptist Church and its ministry, the Jerusalem Outreach Center, are attributable to the passion and perseverance of Reverend Dr. Crenshaw. His guidance and leadership have been a primary force in the growth of the church and its neighborhood mission, particularly its embrace of our youth. He has come to embody faith and hope for the next generation of our community.  Reverend Dr. Crenshaw has earned his rest as he takes his leave from the day-to-day operations of the Jerusalem congregation. Yet, his abiding goodness lives strong in each of us whose lives he has touched. We know he will remain involved in its activities for the church and its works are a part of him. Reverend Dr. Harry Crenshaw's soul will echo on in the buildings' walls and the congregation's hearts for many years to come. He came this far by faith with his beautiful wife, Frances, and he led us all to a more humane and compassionate community and world.                          ____________________
