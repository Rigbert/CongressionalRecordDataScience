In our conversations, I agree with what Senator Domenici is setting out to do. I do not believe it is antagonistic to McCain-Feingold. I think it is complementary. It is an important element. But I do believe we need to take the concept Senator Domenici has brought to the floor and work on it. We need to spend a little time working on this to bring it to where it ought to be.  I say to my friend from New Mexico, I hope--he, of course, can do what he would like with his amendment. I cannot support it at this moment, but I want to work with him and work with Senator DeWine of Ohio to try to find a bipartisan alternative that deals with this in a realistic way.  So if Senator Domenici wants to go ahead with this amendment, I will have to join those who are attempting to table it, but only with the understanding that once this amendment is completed, we will sit down in a good-faith effort, bipartisan effort, to address this issue. Without his leadership, we might not even be at this point in the debate.  I thank him for that leadership.
