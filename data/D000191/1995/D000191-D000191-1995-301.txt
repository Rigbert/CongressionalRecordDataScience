Speaker, today we have before the House the issue of the line-time veto, or did we really have a viable form of the line-item veto pending before this House? This could be a useful tool in the armamentarium of a President who is truly concerned about reducing the budget, a President who just does not want to use it in a political or punitive manner to go after a few programs, that he or she in the future could not convince the Congress to otherwise not fund.  But the question is, is this a viable form, or is it a grandly symbolic gesture, a gesture intended for the 84th birthday of ex-President Ronald  [[Page H1217]] Reagan? We have heard that a lot from the other side.  Well, let us just recount a few of the Reagan years so we can get this in perspective. Remember, President Reagan promised the people of the United States of America that he would balance the budget by 1984. Instead, his administration worked hand in glove with Congress to pile up the greatest amount of debt ever seen for this Nation. It took us 200 years to amass the first $900 billion of debt, but in a mere 8 years, President Reagan's administration more than tripled the national debt to over $3 trillion. Yes, they talked a great game about reducing the deficit and balancing the budget, but they never ever submitted a balanced budget. They never ever even submitted a budget within $100 billion of balance.  And then finally in the twilight years, in the last year of the Reagan administration, Budget Director Miller submitted a list of what he said Ronald Reagan would have used the line-item veto on if only he had that power.  The deficit in 1988 was $150 billion. After tremendous efforts downtown at the White House, President Reagan and Mr. Miller came up with a list of $1 billion in cuts that they would have made had they had the line-item veto. So instead of $150 billion deficit, it would have been $149 billion, and, of course, not a penny would have come from the Pentagon, the largest single source of general fund spending.  Last year we passed a constitutional version of a line-item veto called an enhanced rescission. This year we have before us an empty gesture. Clearly, the bill that will be voted on finally today, the Stenholm amendment, the bill we passed last year having been defeated in a vote last Friday on the floor of this House, is unconstitutional, and will be thrown out by the courts.  So if what we want is a grandly symbolic empty gesture, then vote ``yes'' on final passage today.  Happy birthday, of course, to the ex-President.  His legacy of a $3 trillion will stand as a monument for generations of Americans to come. I would hope this House would begin to take real steps toward cutting the Federal deficit and the Federal debt and no more gestures. Do not vote today for this empty gesture.                          ____________________
