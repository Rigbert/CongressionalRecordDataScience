Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] be given the opportunity to withdraw the amendment that apparently is at the desk and substitute the amendment which reads after ``stabilization fund'', ``* * * when it is made known to the Federal official to whom such amounts are made available in this Act that such obligation or expenditure is for the purpose of bolstering any foreign currency.''  Mr. Chairman, this will provide a degree of comity. The gentleman from Vermont clearly thought that was the amendment, and, very frankly, what he thinks was the amendment is what I have in front of me.
