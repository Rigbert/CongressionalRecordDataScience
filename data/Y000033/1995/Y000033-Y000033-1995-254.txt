Mr. Chairman, I am not going to oppose the amendment at this time. I do compliment the gentleman from Washington in his efforts, because he has brought this to our attention, and more so than California, because they do not have oil fields in other areas, of the need for a constant supply of oil, I can just about guarantee everybody in this room, because it is not just BP that has ownership of this oil. ARCO ships all of its oil to the west coast. That is where it has occurred. The Exxon areas, part is shipped to the west coast. The only people really right now who will have any oil available will be BP.  Mr. Chairman, I am inclined to accept the gentleman's amendment at this time, and we will be discussing the trigger date and conference, and seeing if there is a possibility we can further define that.
