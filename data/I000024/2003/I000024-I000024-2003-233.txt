2292, in the 106th Congress as well as Senator Voinovich's bills, S. 1591 and S. 1360 from the 107th Congress and S. 156 in this 108th Congress. I laud Senator Voinovich's diligent and effective work on this legislation. I would also like to thank Environmental and Public Works Committee staff and associated staff who have worked on this legislation, especially Andrew Wheeler, Lewis Renjel, Marty Hall, Brian Mormino, and Aloysius Hogan.  It is quite appropriate that the passage of this legislation be one of the first actions of the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, I had scheduled the passage of Senator Voinovich's bill S. 156 for my first Environment and Public Works Committee mark-up as Chairman in this 108th Congress. Moreover, in the Environment and Public Works Committee I look forward to further productive oversight and legislation regarding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, control of nuclear energy, infrastructure, and continued environmental enhancement for our flora, fauna, air, water, and soil.  I support the opportunity to enact this legislation promptly on this omnibus appropriations bill in lieu of Environment and Public Works Committee action. By fostering the clean-up of our soil and water and by fostering clean air energy sources, the legislation we pass in this bill is good for our environment. The sooner we enact this legislation, the better for our environment.
