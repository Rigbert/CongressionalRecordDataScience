Mr. Chairman, I want to suggest one thing. The native communities in Alaska support this. They support drilling. I've had them in my office. And to say that, Irepresent that State, not Alexandria, Virginia. And they've come to me and said we need it.  I yield to the gentleman from Idaho, the chairman of the appropriations committee, Mr. Simpson.
