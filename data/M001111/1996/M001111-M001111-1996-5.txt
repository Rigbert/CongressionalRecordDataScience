 President, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for working together to report this bill. I will certainly support final passage.  One of the most important budget items in this bill to me and my Seattle area constituents is funding for the new Federal courthouse. This courthouse has been needed, and in the works, for almost a decade. As Congress has expanded the role of Federal courts in crime fighting and other areas, our judges have gotten more and more squeezed. There is no doubt a new courthouse is needed.  At this time, the General Services Administration, working with the city of Seattle, has tentatively selected the main library for the city as the site for the new courthouse. The library is in sore need of replacement or major restoration. The library is a cherished public asset. The people in and near Seattle check out books at a rate of 1 million per year. They bring their children to story hour, attend the diverse programs, and conduct tremendous amounts of personal and professional research.  The city of Seattle recognizes the need for expansion of the Federal courthouse and is committed to working energetically in partnership with the GSA to make this a reality. Seattle has offered to relocate its library to expedite expansion of the courthouse. I am pleased the city and GSA intend to work together, as quickly as possible, to find a mutually agreeable resolution of the cost and timing questions.  Mr. President, I again thank the chairman and ranking member for doing their part to move this courthouse toward completion. The need for the courthouse and a smooth, cost-efficient transition to a new library cannot be overstated. I look forward to working with you further in the coming years of this project to ensure the Federal justice system is poised to meet the growing needs of the region, and that Seattle's central library is kept whole in the process.                          ____________________
