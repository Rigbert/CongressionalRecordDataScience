Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, the House passed H. Res. 1091, offered by my friend from Ohio, Steve Chabot. I support this resolution and commend my colleague for his leadership on a pressing issue of concern. If democracy dies in darkness as the Washington Post masthead daily reads, surely the release of the Reuters journalists will bring a little light back to Burma. But only a little light unfortunately.   We all believed that Nobel Peace Prize laurate Aung San Sui Kyi would govern differently from past Burmese leaders. Unfortunately, she has not. The democratic icon has become an extremely disappointing politician. On her watch one of the world's largest ethnic cleansings has occurred--the forced and violent removal of Rohingya from Burma. The blood of Rohingya is on her hands. Over half a million Rohingya were removed and untold numbers killed by a military that long planned for this operation.   I commend the Administration for using Global Magnitsky sanctions to target Burmese military leaders and units. But with atrocities continuing against the Rohingya and other Burmese minorities, more clearly needs to be done. Expanding sanctions against companies and cronies linked to the military leadership is a potential game changer in any punitive approach to this issue. And the U.S. should be urging the EU and other nations to do the same.   I understand the arguments made by those who urge caution, fearing that too much pressure on Aung San Sui Kyi will lead to a military coup, with the full backing of Beijing no doubt. But at what price, silence? Thousands of deaths? Half a million people forcibly removed? Condoning crimes against humanity and genocide? We cannot be bystanders to genocide. As with the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in China or the genocide experienced by Christians and Yazidis at the hands of ISIS, U.S. leadership is needed to create a global response to this crisis. I again commend the gentleman from Ohio for this resolution. Preventing and addressing genocide and mass atrocities are a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States.                          ____________________
