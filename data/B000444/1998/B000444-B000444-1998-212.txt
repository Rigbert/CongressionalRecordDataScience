 I find his argument absolutely fascinating that economic dependence or integration with the United States is a prerequisite for NATO membership. I wonder if he could explain to me what that dependence was we had with Norway or that dependence we have with Denmark or Portugal or Spain?  As each came in, as each of these nations came in, if there is a notion that there is a prerequisite of an economic dependency--we have more invested in Poland, more in Poland now than we did at the time of these countries coming in.
