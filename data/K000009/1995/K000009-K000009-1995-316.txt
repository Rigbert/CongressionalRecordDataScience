When you think with the very companies, big companies, we are not talking about little fish now on Main Street, we are talking about big fish that can move their production anywhere in the world to take advantage of cheap labor, those very corporations as well as the big banks, the investment banks, the speculators who supported them got in trouble, and now the very ones who divested investment from the United States and went elsewhere and got their tail caught in the wringer are coming back to the U.S. taxpayers to bail them out. I think it is one of the saddest ironies, and I really feel I almost want to say, you know, if you are going to be a man, be a man, stand up for your investment, at least eat the loss and do not come back to the very people you turned your back on in the first place.  Mr. DeFAZIO. If the gentlewoman will yield, I was in the elevator, kind of in the back, there was a big crowd a little while ago. A number of conservative Members, Republicans, got on the front, and they were talking with some concern saying, you know, what this is about is, you know, we are putting the U.S. taxpayers on the line and really we are going to stick it to the peasants in Mexico because their standard of living is going to go down under their amendment. It is all to bail out the big banks. But the good thing is it is being identified as a Democrat program because it is the President and the Secretary of the Treasury who are so visible on this.  I piped up from the back and said, ``You can't pass it with Democratic votes in the House.'' So it is not something for our Republican colleagues to be listening and saying they are going to be able to pass blame to the White House and to the Secretary of the Treasury because they are out to lunch on this issue. It can only pass in the House and the Senate if the Republicans support it, because they are in [[Page H291]] the majority and they run this institution.                              {time}  1800  So if there is a bailout of Mexico, it is the Republican congressional bailout of Mexico, hand in complicit with the Secretary of the Treasury and the President of the United States who happen to be Democrats on some days.
