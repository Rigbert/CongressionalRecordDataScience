Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to a celebrated community servant, Mr. G. Russell Bassett. On Friday, July 14, 1995, Russ, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from the Sheet Metal Workers Union Local No. 20. This retirement dinner will take place at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, IN.  We are all fortunate to have dedicated people, like Russ, involved in the labor movement in Indiana's First Congressional District. Indeed, Russ personifies true selfless dedication. Russ embarked on his distinguished career in former Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 303, where in 1970, he began as a business manager. In 1983, local No. 303 merged with local No. 20, and in the following year, Russ began 8 years as a business representative for the new local. He retired on July 1, 1995, after nearly 12 years as a business representative of Sheet Metal Workers Union Local No. 20. In all, Russ contributed 39 years of his life to fight for labor rights for his union brothers and sisters.  Russ strengthened the labor movement by contributing in several other capacities. For 25 years, Russ served locals Nos. 303 and 20 as a trustee for the health and welfare fund, the Gary area pension fund, and the joint apprenticeship committee. Moreover, Russ served for 3 years as vice president and executive board member for local No. 303.  Outside of his professional career, Russ has devoted a large portion of his life to the betterment of northwest Indiana. Russ devoted 5 years of his life to the Portage Indiana Economic Development Commission on which he served as chairman, and another 5 years on the Indiana OSHA Safety Review Committee.  As we have just celebrated the birthday of our Nation's independence, let us remember those who have worked hard to fulfill the American dream. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Russ, who has worked arduously to make this dream possible for others. Russ has proven himself to be a distinguished advocate for the labor movement, and he has made northwest Indiana a better place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish Russ a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
