President, yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee began consideration of the Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act, S. 627. I look forward to the committee completing its consideration of this measure at our next business meeting and reporting it to the Senate.  This year the major league season did not begin, of course, until a Federal judge granted an injunction and the owners and players, who had shut the game down last August and robbed fans of pennant races and a World Series, finally declared a ceasefire in their ongoing hostilities. They had to scramble to begin a shortened 144-game schedule.   As far as I can tell the owners and the players have not gotten back to the bargaining table. They are no closer to reaching a collective bargaining agreement than they were 3 months ago. A further unfair trade practices complaint remains pending against the owners.  Interest in major league baseball is undeniably down. Attendance figures show it--they are down between 20 and 30 percent. Ratings for the recent All Star Game were down 10 percent from last year. Advertising and merchandising revenues show it, as well. Both NBC and ABC recently indicated that they will not even bid on broadcast rights for baseball in the future.  In spite of the outstanding years that the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, California Angels, Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves are having and the young, talented players throughout the leagues, the unsettled business affairs that haunt major league baseball and disillusioned many of its fans. Older fans have been turned off and the younger ones have decided to spend their time and attention on other pursuits.  Meanwhile interest and attendance at minor league baseball games continues. If the Vermont Expos are any indication, fans turned off by the excesses of major league baseball have turned to minor league games. Attendance at Centennial Field for Expos' games is up more than 10 percent and merchandise sales are booming. It is friendly, fun, and entertaining. I know that I will enjoy taking in a few games during the August recess, if there is an August recess.  As the season began, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner was quoted as saying: ``We knew there would be some fallout. It's very tough to assess, but there is a residue from the work stoppage, there's no question. There is a lot of anger out there.''  At our February 15 hearing on legislation to end baseball's antitrust exemption, I had asked the acting commissioner how fans get their voices heard. I observed even then: ``Fans are disgruntled; I mean, they are really ripped. Do they vote with their feet?'' Unfortunately, the strike dragged on, fans suffered through the owners' experiment with so-called replacement teams, and the matter remains unsettled and unsettling.  Mr. Selig answered me last February by observing that when the strike ended, there would be an enormous healing process. I said then: ``The longer you go, the harder the healing process is going to be.'' I say now that major league baseball has gone too far and has been above the law too long.  I do not think that those who are the game's current caretakers appreciate the damage that they have done. Slick advertising, discount tickets, and special giveaway nights will not make up the difference. The last year has been disastrous.  Worse, nothing has been resolved. The problems and differences persist. There is no collective bargaining agreement and, so far as the public is aware, no prospect of one any time soon. To borrow from a famous baseball great, ``It ain't over, 'til it's over.''  Why should people return to major league ballparks or patronize major league teams if the risk remains of having affections toyed with again and having hopes of a championship dashed--not by a better team but by labor-management problems?  I believe the time has come for the Senate to act. The Senate Antitrust Subcommittee reported the bill to the Judiciary Committee on April 5. This consensus bill, S. 627, is sponsored by Senators Hatch, Thurmond, Moynihan, Graham, and myself. It would cut back baseball's judicially created and aberrational antitrust exemption.  Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal baseball's self-inflicted wounds, but we can do this: We can pass legislation that will declare that professional baseball can no longer operate above the law. The antitrust laws apply to all other professional sports and commercial activity should apply to professional baseball, as well.  Along with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, I recently received a report of the section on antitrust law of the American Bar Association that examines S. 627. The antitrust section of the ABA reasons that professional baseball's antitrust exemption is not tailored to achieve well-defined and justified public goals.  The antitrust section, therefore, ``supports legislative repeal of the exemption of professional major league baseball from the federal antitrust laws.'' Moreover, the report notes that putting professional baseball on equal footing with other professional sports and business and having the antitrust laws apply ``cannot fairly be criticized as `taking sides' '' in baseball's current labor-management battle.  I look forward to working with our Judiciary Committee chairmen to have our bill, S. 627, considered favorably by the Judiciary Committee at our earliest opportunity and then promptly by the Senate. It is time that the Senate act and end this destructive aberration in our law.                          ____________________
