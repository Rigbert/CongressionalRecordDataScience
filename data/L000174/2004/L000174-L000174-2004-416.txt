President, I am pleased to recognize the long and distinguished career of Mr. Larry Myott, one of our Nation's most respected maple syrup specialists and a longtime friend. After nearly three decades with the University of Vermont Extension Service, Larry retired last week. Known by many as ``Mr. Maple,'' Larry has played an integral role in growing the Vermont maple industry into a $220 million a year industry. His educational work with Vermont farmers and his maple syrup promotion efforts have played a key role in expanding markets for producers, allowing more producers to make a living in the maple industry. While Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States, Larry's work has transcended the State of Vermont. He has traveled throughout the United State and into Canada to assist maple producers and promote Vermont's maple syrup.  I offer my gratitude for Larry's friendship and his great work on behalf of the State of Vermont's maple industry. I ask that an article on Larry's career be printed in the Record.                      [From the Associated Press]   ``Mr. Maple'' Retires From University of Vermont Extension Service                            (By Lisa Rathke)       Montpelier, VT.--Larry Myott just got an e-mail from Taiwan      asking him when Vermonters ``squeeze'' sap from their trees.       The inquirer wanted to visit Vermont during the height of      the maple season.       Myott, the maple specialist for the University of Vermont      Extension Service gets letters from school children, from      maple syrup buyers and from producers all over the world.      They ask how to store maple syrup, if it's pure and what to      do about crystals that form in the syrup.       ``I'm often called `Mister Maple,' '' says Myott, 59, who      will retire in January after 28 years with the Extension      Service. Gov. James Douglas and others will pay tribute to      the maple man at a dinner Saturday.       Myott has educated and assisted maple producers across      Vermont and promoted Vermont's maple products throughout the      world.       He travels to Minnesota, Nova Scotia and Virginia to learn      what's new, share his expertise and spread the word about      Vermont's products.       ``Larry has a love for the maple industry that is hard to      surpass,'' says Jacques Couture, president of the Vermont      Maple Sugarmakers Association, who was making maple candy at      his farm in Westfield Wednesday. ``He's a real promoter of      maple syrup, and he's done it actually by promoting maple      syrup to helping producers on the educational side.       ``It's been a life pursuit for him to see the maple      industry by the best it can be.''       Myott became the maple specialist in 1988, after serving      as Chittenden County Extension agent, and working with      vegetable growers and dairy farmers.       And the maple industry today doesn't look anything like it      did then.       ``Very seldom do you see buckets in the woods any more. You      don't see horses anymore,'' he says from his Ferrisburgh      home, where he is recovering from a stroke earlier this      month.       Sugaring has grown from a side business for dairy farmers      to a year-round profitable operation for large producers, he      says.       In 1988 the average producer had 1,000 taps and generated      250 gallons of syrup a year. Ten years later, the average      size grew to twice that.       Now a large-scale sugarer might produce as much as 40,000      to 50,000 gallons a year, he says.       New technology such as a system that uses a vacuum to pull      sap out of trees; reverse osmosis, which removes water from      sap without heat by using a high pressure filter system; and      super-efficient evaporators that boil sap with less heat,      have made sugaring far more efficient.       Producers have expanded to meet the demand, and prices are      now high enough for them to make a living, he says.       ``Sugarmakers are able to make a living in the maple      business today,'' he says.       The syrup is also better than it used to be. ``The quality      has changed tremendously,'' he says.       And efforts by the state to promote the Vermont image and      products and draw tourists have increased sales of maple      products.       Vermont sugarmakers made 430,000 gallons of syrup last      year, bringing in an estimated $18 million to $20 million,      Myott says. According to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture,      the entire maple industry generates over $200 million a year.       The annual Maple Festival, a local fair started in 1937 in      St. Albans, now draws as many as 50,000 people from around      the world, Myott says.       Vermont, the largest producer of maple syrup, is one of      only a few states to have a maple specialist. But Myott's      reputation stretches far beyond the Green Mountains.       ``Because he's articulate, because he writes a lot, because      he'll take telephone calls from anyone at anytime. That      reputation spans not only Vermont and the region but also      internationally,'' says Gary Deziel, Northwest regional chair      of the UVM Extension Service.       Although he's retiring Jan. 30, Myott says he will remain      involved in the maple industry. He will continue to write      about maple for Farming Magazine, Maple Views, Country Folks      Magazine and Country Magazine. And he will always take      questions from Taiwan.                          ____________________
