Chairman, I am happy to support this amendment.  The recent court decision earlier this year overturned, really, a longstanding EPA exemption for reporting from farms. These family farms and ranchers across the Nation shouldn't be burdened with just more and more paperwork to do an activity they have been doing for many, many years in this country. It is not what Congress intended. Congress, last I looked, still makes the laws around here.  I would support the gentleman's amendment and urge its adoption.
