 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have lodged an objection to the Senate proceeding to S. 1805 or to any other legislation or amendment that converts temporary judgeships to permanent judgeships.  When there is a temporary judgeship on a court, when the temporary judgeship expires, the next permanent vacancy that occurs will not be filled and will be deemed not to be a vacancy, so that the total number of permanent judgeships allowed by law stays the same. On the other hand, the net effect of converting a temporary judgeship into a permanent judgeship is the creation of a new permanent judgeship for that court. The creation of new judgeships should not be taken lightly.  As you know, I firmly believe that the Federal judiciary should not be expanded prior to comprehensive congressional oversight. Congress has not held a single hearing in this Congress on whether additional judges are necessary for the Federal courts, and specifically has not evaluated whether there is a need to convert the temporary judgeships contained in S. 1805 into permanent judgeships. Arguments that the Judicial Conference has recommended these changes should be scrutinized with care, the formula that the Judicial Conference utilizes to create judgeships is flawed and can be substantially manipulated. There needs to be serious congressional oversight of the numbers, which is our responsibility. We need to ensure that the courts are employing all appropriate methods to take care of their caseloads and to make sure that they are utilizing all efficiencies and techniques. Moreover, we should be looking at filling appropriate existing judicial vacancies before we create new judgeships.                          ____________________
