Chair, I rise today in support of transferring $50 million in funding from EPA climate change programs to support the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. While I have serious concerns about the offsets used in Mr. LaTourette's amendment, I strongly believe that we need to continue to restore the Great Lakes to preserve its many rare environmental attributes and to strengthen the American economy.  The Great Lakes are vitally important to the American manufacturing industry. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, nearly 200 million tons of cargo travel through the Great Lakes each year. The Corps reports that the Great Lakes saves manufacturers and other industries approximately $3.6 billion per year in transportation costs.  Studies undertaken by the University of Michigan show that more than 1.5 million jobs are directly connected to the Great Lakes generating $62 billion in wages. The Great Lakes help provide nearly 1 million manufacturing jobs, over 200,000 jobs in tourism and recreation, nearly 120,000 jobs in shipping and more than 118,000 jobs in agriculture, fishing and food production.  The University of Michigan study also states that the 83 million people living in the Great Lakes area helped produce 27 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product and 24 percent of the country's exports in 2009. The basin is home to 38 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Moreover, the region's colleges and universities award 32 percent of the nation's advanced science and engineering degrees resulting in a stronger American workforce to compete against nations such as China and India.  Furthermore, the Great Lakes are an environmental treasure containing nearly 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water. The lakes also support over 200 globally rare plants and animals, and more than 40 species that are found nowhere else in the world according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.  In addition, the Great Lakes provide one of the best areas for fishery and other recreational activities in the world. It is estimated that 180 species of native fish, including small and large mouth bass, the northern pike and lake herring all reside in the Great Lakes. A study conducted by the Great Lakes Commissions reports that there are 4.3 million boats registered in the Great Lakes states, which is nearly one-third of all registered boats in the United States.  The many environmental and economic benefits generated by the Great Lakes are in danger because of its damaged ecosystem and numerous environmental conditions. Despite recent improvements, there is much work still to be done such as eliminating toxic substance pollution, controlling invasive species, reducing nonpoint source pollution and protecting against habitat and species losses.  Recognizing the importance of the Great Lakes, the Federal Government developed the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan to implement solutions to the many environmental challenges facing the Great Lakes. The Initiative has been focusing on ecosystem protection, enhancement, rehabilitation, and remediation within the Great Lakes Region.  According to a study by the Brookings Institution, fully implementing the Great Lakes restoration strategy would not only protect various rare fish and wildlife it would also generate $50 billion in long-term economic benefits and $50 million to $125 million in reduced costs to municipalities.  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support protecting our environment and our economy by voting to transfer funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative--so vital to restoring fresh water resources for the next generation and beyond.
