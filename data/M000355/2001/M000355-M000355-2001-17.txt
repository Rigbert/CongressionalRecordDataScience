 President, it had been my intention, along with Senator Feinstein, to offer to this bill an amendment relating to the Palestinian Liberation Organization's adherence to its 1993 commitments to renounce terrorism and violence. The intent of the amendment would have been similar to the provisions of S. 1409, the Middle East Peace Compliance Act of 2001, which my friend from California and I offered last month, which today has 31 cosponsors.  We are, however, refraining from action at the personal request of the Secretary of State who believes the amendment may adversely impact his ability to form an international coalition against terrorism and efforts to bring the peace process in the Middle East back on track.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary relating to this request be printed in the Record following my remarks.
