Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I listened to my good friend, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), who, I agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), cares a great deal about the policies of this government, a great deal about the working men and women of this country and is one of our finest Members. I also listened to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), who I also believe is a very fine Member. We happen, however, to disagree on this particular issue.  I understand what is being said. I understand about the multinationals and those who have extended credit wisely. I agree with all that, and that angers us. But the fact of the matter is the real adverse ramifications are not to those necessarily who have acted so irresponsibly. Destabilization impact is not on those rich guys who did things speculatively that may have made them a lot of money and at great risk, and when the deal went bad they maybe either expect to bail out or just bail out themselves and leave others holding the bag.  The real problem, from my perspective, is that the destabilization that occurs if they are not bailed out is to those working men and women in this country and in other countries; and they are the ones who suffer, from my perspective, unfortunately.  It is like bailing out the savings and loans that was so controversial. Yes, we bailed out some big guys who were bad people, but the fact is what we tried to do really was to save harmless, an awful lot of depositors who had relatively small amounts of money invested.  I believe he has been quoted of course, and there are some people who obviously disagree, but Secretary Summers has been very much involved in the utilization of this fund over recent months, to, in my opinion, the great benefit not only of the governments of Korea and Brazil and of Mexico but also this government and our people as well.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge the defeat of the amendment.
