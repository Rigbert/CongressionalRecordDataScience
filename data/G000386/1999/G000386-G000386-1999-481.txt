 President, I rise today to introduce ``The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999'' with Senators Torricelli and Biden. This bill builds on the conference report which the Senate and House produced at the end of the 105th Congress, which melded together good legislation from both the Senate and the House to create a final product that combined the best aspects of both bills.  The bill I'm introducing today makes important changes to the conference report from last year to accommodate concerns raised by some Senators.  The need for real bankruptcy reform is pretty obvious. You don't need an army of so-called scientists, law professors and academics to tell us that we have a serious bankruptcy problem.  These are good times in America. Thanks to the hard work of a Republican Congress, we have the first balanced budget in a generation. Unemployment is low, we have a solid stock market and most Americans are optimistic about the future.  Despite the prosperity we are experiencing now, About one and a half million Americans will declare bankruptcy this year if previous trends continue. Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings are up an amazing 94.7 percent. That's almost a 100 percent increase in bankruptcies since 1990.  Clearly something is amiss, and to paraphrase, ``it's not the economy stupid.'' The problem with the explosion in bankruptcies lies elsewhere. While many Americans who declare bankruptcy undoubtedly need a fresh start, it defies common sense to think that all of the million and a half Americans in bankruptcy court can't repay at least some of their debts. The point of bankruptcy reform is to limit chapter 7--which provides for a no-questions asked complete discharge of debts--to people who don't have the ability to repay any of their debts. People who can repay some or all of their debts should be required to do so in a chapter 13 repayment plan.  An important aspect to remember about bankruptcies is that we all have to pick up the tab for bankrupts who walk away from their debts. Businesses have to raise prices on products and services to offset bankruptcy losses. When you realize this, it becomes very apparent that allowing unfettered access to chapter 7 bankruptcy for high income people is a lot like a special interest tax loophole. Over 30 years ago, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. recognized this in a speech on the Senate floor. According to Senator Gore, like tax loopholes, chapter 7 allows someone to get out of paying his fair share and to shift the cost to hardworking Americans who play by the rules.  I think that Senator Gore had it exactly right. Bankruptcy reform is all about closing loopholes so higher income can't get out of paying their fair share.  As I indicated earlier, the bill I'm introducing now contains significant modifications to accommodate the concerns raised by some Senators. At the outset, I want to make it clear that, as was the case with the original Senate bill from last Congress, under this bill, a person in financial trouble can file in any chapter of the bankruptcy code he or she chooses. And before a debtor can be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13 or kicked out of bankruptcy, a judge will have the chance to review the merits of each and every case. I want to repeat this: Each and every chapter 7 debtor who meets the means-test will receive an individual hearing to press his or her own unique case before anything happens. In other words, this bill maintains much of the judicial scrutiny and discretion that was the distinguishing factor of the Senate bill's means-test in the 105th Congress. In the bill Senator Torricelli and I are introducing today, there is more flexibility given to the bankruptcy judge.  Under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, there are even greater consumer protections than were in last year's conference report. For instance, in order to protect consumers from deceptive and coercive collection Practices, the Justice Department and the FBI are directed to appoint one agent and one prosecutor to investigate abusive or deceptive reaffirmation practices. Sears recently plead guilty in Massachusetts to bankruptcy fraud in connection with its business practices in seeking reaffirmations, and agreed to pay 60 million dollars in fines.  I think this shows that we already have tough laws on the books regarding reaffirmations. What we need is better law enforcement, not new laws. That's why we require the Justice Department and the FBI to designate a person to investigate reaffirmation practices. Under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, State attorney generals may enforce State criminal statutes similar to those under which Sears was prosecuted, and the State attorney generals are given the express authority to enforce consumer protections already in the bankruptcy code. Taken together, these provisions amount to a massive infusion of Federal and State law enforcment resources for the purpose of protecting consumers in bankruptcy court from abusive collection tactics.  The Grassley-Torricelli bill retains all the protections for child support in last year's conference report, with important new additions. Now, bankruptcy trustees would be required to notify State enforcment agencies of a bankrupt's address and telephone number if the bankrupt owes child support. This means that the bankruptcy court will now help to track down dead-beat parents.  Also, the bill I'm introducing today also provides that debts incurred prior to bankruptcy to pay off non-dischargeable debts will still be dischargeable if the bankrupt owes child support. This means that child support will never have to compete with this new category of non-dischargeable debt after bankruptcy. Taken together, these provisions will provide key new protections for child support claimants.  Mr. President, in addition to the consumer provisions, the Grassley-Torricelli bill also contains numerous changes to improve the bankruptcy code for businesses. The bill makes numerous changes to the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy, and I expect that these provision will be refined on the floor as the Finance Committee makes some suggestions.  The bill also creates a new chapter 15 to address the growing problem on transnational bankruptcies.  The bill contains provisions to make chapter 12 permanent and to expand access to chapter 12.  The bill contains an entire title dedicated to expediting chapter 11 proceedings for small businesses.  One business-related provision I want to high-light relates to protecting patients when hospitals and health-care businesses declare bankruptcy. I chaired a hearing on this topic last year and I was shocked to realize that the bankruptcy code doesn't require bankruptcy trustees and creditor committees to consider the welfare of patients when closing down or re-organizing a hospital or nursing home. So, under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, whenever a hospital or nursing home declares bankruptcy a patient ombudsman will be appointed to represent the interests of patients during bankruptcy proceedings. And bankruptcy trustees are required to safeguard the privacy of medical records when closing a health care business. These provisions will provide significant protections for patients in bankruptcy proceedings.  Mr. President, this bill contains many much-needed reforms. This bill is fair, balanced and should receive strong bi-partisan support. I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the Record as there is much public interest in bankruptcy reform and I want to get as much information out as possible. I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a summary of the major differences between this bill and the conference report from last year.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 625       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE XIII--GENERAL EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS     SEC. 1301. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS.       (a) Effective Date.--Except as provided otherwise in this      Act, this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take      effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.       (b) Application of Amendments.--The amendments made by this      Act shall not apply with respect to cases commenced under      title 11, United States Code, before the effective date of      this Act.                                  ____Summary of Major Differences Between the Grassley/Torricelli Bankruptcy             Reform Bill and the H.R. 3150 Conference Report                               Means Test       The new Senate bill gives bankruptcy judges greater      discretion in considering whether to transfer a debtor from      Chapter 7 to Chapter 13.       The new Senate bill requires only a showing of ``special      circumstances,'' rather than ``extraordinary circumstances,''      for Chapter 7 debtors with apparent repayment ability to      avoid being transferred to Chapter 13.       A new Senate bill raises the minimum dollar amount from      $5,000 to $15,000, with the effect that debtors with a      marginal ability to repay won't be swept up by the means      test.                          Consumer Protections       The new Senate bill requires the Attorney General and the      FBI Director to designate one prosecutor and one agent in      every district to investigate reaffirmation practices which      violate current federal criminal laws, including the criminal      laws under which Sears was prosecuted.       The new Senate bill specifically authorizes state attorneys      general to enforce federal criminal laws against abusive      reaffirmations, again including the criminal laws under which      Sears was prosecuted.       The new Senate bill specifically authorizes state attorneys      general to enforce state laws regarding unfair trade      practices against creditors who deceive debtors into      reaffirmation agreements, including the state laws under      which Sears was prosecuted.       The new Senate bill drops a provision barring class action      lawsuits for reaffirmation violations.       The new Senate bill reinserts a provision making it a      violation of the automatic stay to threaten to file motions      in order to coerce reaffirmations.       The new Senate bill reinserts a provision penalizing      creditors who fail to acknowledge payments received in      Chapter 13 plans and, thereafter, seek a ``double payment.''                 Greater Protections for Child Support       The new Senate bill requires bankruptcy trustees to notify      appropriate state agencies of a debtor's location and      specific address, if the debtor owes child support. This      effectively turns bankruptcy courts into locator services to      help track down ``deadbeat parents.''       The new Senate bill requires bankruptcy trustees to notify      child support claimants of their right to enforce payment      through an appropriate state agency.       The new Senate bill permits state agencies which enforce      payment of child support obligations to request that      creditors who hold reaffirmed or non-discharged debts to      provide the last known address and telephone number of the      debtor. Again, this effectively turns bankruptcy courts into      locator services which will help to track down ``deadbeat      parents.''       The new Senate bill provides that debts incurred to pay      non-dischargeable debts will continue to be dischargeable if      the debtor owes child support or alimony.                     Fewer Non-Dischargeable Debts       The new Senate bill raises the dollar limits on cash      advances on the eve of bankruptcy, presumed non-dischargeable      from $250 to $750.       The new Senate bill shortens the time during which      purchases and cash advances are presumed non-dischargeable      from 90 days to 70 days.
