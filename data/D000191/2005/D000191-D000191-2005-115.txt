 I would like to support the remarks of my colleague from Ohio. He mentioned what a laborer would earn under Davis-Bacon. I have become aware of the fact that a skilled pipe fitter under Davis-Bacon wages in the Southeast would earn $10.22 an hour. That hardly seems to me to be an excessive wage.And with the extraordinary poverty that was brought to the Nation's attention in New Orleans, one would think that we would want to have people working in jobs that pay a living wage, a decent wage, so that they can support themselves and their families. And it is just extraordinary to me.  We had a meeting with the IG and the GAO regarding the FEMA contracts under Homeland Security, and we asked if they could document, particularly with Hurricane Andrew last year and some other times when Davis-Bacon has been suspended, that, in fact, the taxpayers came out ahead. And they said, well, they really could not. So I said, they mean we might just be lowering wages and increasing the profit margin? And they said, they had a lot of concerns about a lot of these contracts and the no-bid nature of the contracts and whether or not taxpayers were getting full value for their money. And it is particularly distressing when we do not know that we are getting full value for our money and we might, in fact, be only increasing profits while depriving people of a living wage.  So I support the gentleman's remarks, and I do hope that we are allowed to bring legislation to the floor in the near future to overturn the President's misguided efforts in this area.  Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support the legislation.  Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
