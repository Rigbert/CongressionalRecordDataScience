 The chairman has made an excellent case for this legislation. It is not to set any precedent for the future use of AIP funds, since those funds we know are not going to be adequate in the future to meet the total needs of the system. But this is a recognition of an extraordinary circumstance of the disasters of Katrina and Rita and what it has done to the aviation infrastructure in addition to other elements of the infrastructure in those regions. And it is only, I think, appropriate that the Federal Government use discretion and flexibility in helping those airports to recover and to become fully operational. They obviously suffered not only physical damage but tremendous economic losses due to the storms and, in some cases, face perhaps an uncertain economic future because of the damage in the City of New Orleans and questions about how soon or when full aviation schedules will be reinstated to serve that airport.  So I think this legislation is timely. It is appropriate, and I appreciate the chairman of the committee for bringing it forward in such an expedited way.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
