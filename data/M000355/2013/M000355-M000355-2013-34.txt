 President, I rise today to commemorate a great public servant from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dennis ``Pat'' Wooton has devoted his life to service--service of his country in the Vietnam war, service of schoolchildren as a teacher in the Buckhorn school system, service of his State as Congressman Hal Rogers's field representative, and now service of his hometown of Buckhorn as the city's newly appointed mayor.  Mayor Wooton was born 66 years ago in the same Kentucky town he now serves. After graduating from Buckhorn High School in 1963, he worked his way through Berea College, graduating in January of 1968.  In the same year of his graduation from Berea, Mr. Wooton was drafted into the U.S. Army and began his basic training at Fort Knox. After completing infantry training at Fort Polk, LA, he was assigned to the 1/5 Mechanized Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. Mr. Wooton bravely served his country in Vietnam from November 1968 to January 1970. A litany of medals and citations, including the highly revered Bronze Star, serve as testaments to his distinguished service.  Mayor Wooton returned from Vietnam in January 1970, but this did not mark the end of his military service. In 1976 he joined the Army Reserves, where he served as a drill sergeant until 1987.  Before reenlisting to train the next generation of American soldiers, Mr. Wooton returned to his alma mater in 1970 to teach the next generation of Buckhorn High School students. Over the next three decades he became a Buckhorn institution, serving as the school's principal for 14 years and being inducted into the Kentucky High School Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. He retired in 2000 after 32 years of dedicated service.  But retirement from Buckhorn High School did not mean retirement from a life of service. In the intervening 13 years, Mayor Wooton continued to add to his already impressive record of public service. This includes his election as Perry County sheriff, a post he served in from 2003 to 2006. Following his stint as sheriff, he served as Congressman Hal Rogers's eastern Kentucky field representative from 2007 until April 2013. All of this in addition to his long list of volunteer activities which include, but are not limited to, training the Buckhorn Volunteer Fire Department and serving on the Governor's Smart Growth Task Force.  Now, Mr. Wooton has found yet another way to serve his community. Appointed as mayor of Buckhorn by the city council in June 2013, Mayor Wooton is already hard at work to better the lives of Buckhorn residents. In his first year, he is set his sights on expanding Buckhorn's water lines in an effort to remedy the city's water supply problems.  Pat Wooton's lifetime of service to his country, Commonwealth, and community embodies our great Kentucky motto, ``United we stand, divided we fall.'' I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing an exemplary citizen.  The Hazard Herald recently published an article highlighting Pat's appointment as mayor of Buckhorn. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The Hazard Herald, June 11, 2013]              City Council Appoints New Mayor in Buckhorn                           (By Chris Ritchie)       Buckhorn--A new mayor has taken office in the city of      Buckhorn.       It was last month when former Mayor Veda Wooton opted to      resign as the city's mayor, a position which she had held for      several years. Her vacancy was filled when the council voted      to appoint her husband, Pat Wooton, who was elected to the      council last year, as the new mayor. Veda Wooton,      subsequently, was expected to be appointed to the council      during a special-called meeting this week.       Mayor Pat Wooton, who most recently served as a field      representative for Congressman Hal Rogers and also served a      term as Perry County's sheriff from 2002 to 2006, noted the      city essentially exists as a water company to provide service      to area residents. But there are other projects he expects to      continue working on while in office, including one which will      extend waterlines in the area.       The Kentucky Division of Abandoned Mine Lands has approved      funding for one waterline project at Cams Branch, Wooton      said, while also approving the extension of new lines to      serve a few more homes on Otter Creek Road. Buckhorn, which      in the 2010 census recorded a population of 163 people,      purchases water from the city of Hazard to supply its system.       The city, in conjunction with the fiscal court, has also      taken what Wooton described as the ``first few small steps''      in what ultimately could be a 10-year project to build a      water treatment plant at Buckhorn Lake. The plant, he said,      would have to be a regional facility that could serve the      surrounding area, including parts of other counties such as      Breathitt and Clay.       An engineering company is currently working on a study for      the project, and if the     plant is eventually constructed it would play a role in      alleviating issues that Wooton said exist with potential      water supply issues in eastern Kentucky.       ``In the work that I've done, that's one of the things I      came to notice real soon,'' he said. ``We're on the cusp of a      water supply problem in our region.''       Though Wooton reiterated that this project remains in the      very early stages, he envisions a treatment plant that could      hook into other systems that could in turn supply areas in      times of emergency, such as one Buckhorn experienced in 2010      when a waterline break shut down service in the area for over      a week.       ``We need to get all of our systems linked together,      because sooner or later everybody has some kind of problem      and will need supplies, at least for a while,'' he said.       Also in conjunction with the fiscal court, the city is      working on a horse trail that would begin at the new Eagles      Landing campground in Gays Creek and wind along the lake to      the lodge, and perhaps with further development tie in with a      trail in nearby Leslie County. Wooton said plans are being      drafted, and he expects a company working on the project to      give the council a progress report at their next regular      meeting.       ``We think that will be a nice addition to the area,'' he      said.                          ____________________
