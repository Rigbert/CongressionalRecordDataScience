 President, I would certainly agree with my friend from Kansas that it might be in order to have multiple amendments on the other side, but certainly that would be up to the other side to decide.  Let me just conclude before yielding the floor that the message here is clear: Senate Republicans are going to insist on being treated fairly. Secondly, I am hoping the majority leader and myself can structure an appropriate consent agreement so that we can consider this matter in the near future.  I yield the floor.
