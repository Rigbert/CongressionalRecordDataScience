Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) for his comments. The gentleman's statement was right on point.  I think it is important to underscore the good work that the Committee of Voters of Ukraine are actually doing. Between February 23 and March 10, 225 long-term observers visited 622 cities and 712 political party branches. They attended 578 events conducted by political groups. They are making a Herculean effort to ensure that the upcoming elections are free and fair and impartial. They deserve our highest support and praise and congratulations for being so committed to fair and free elections in Ukraine. The Committee is comprised of true patriots of Ukraine. They are brave and resourceful and they deserve the full support of every Member of this body.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the summary of the Long Term Observation Report of the Committee of Voters of Ukraine.                                Summary       In October 2001, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine (CVU)      began its long-term observation of the 2002 parliamentary      election process. CVU is a non-partisan citizens' election      monitoring organization with 160 branches throughout the      Ukraine. CVU will report regularly until the March 31, 2002      elections.       Between February 23 and March 10, 225 long-term observers      visited 622 cities and 712 political party branches, and      attended 578 events conducted by political groups. CVU      observed the same kinds of violations as in the previous      three-week period. Some types of violations decreased in      number, while others increased.       Each time a problem was reported to an observer, the head      of the regional CVU organization called the individual making      the report to verify it and obtain details. In many cases,      witnesses are reluctant to talk about violations, fearing      retribution from their employers or others.       CVU has noticed a few positive developments since its last      report. In the past three weeks, voter education programs in      the mass media have become more robust. Likewise, election      commissioners are receiving practical training from non-     governmental organizations. Some television stations have      also been showing debates between various political leaders.       Nonetheless, the pre-election period continues to be marked      by substantial violations of Ukrainian law. The main types of      offenses recorded by CVU during the last week of February and      first two weeks of March were:       Campaigning by state officials or use of state resources to      support favored political candidates and groups. The block      ``Za Edu'' (For a United Ukraine) was the principal, but not      exclusive beneficiary of this support.       Government pressure on certain political parties,      candidates, and media outlets.       Interference in election campaigns through violence,      threats of violence or destruction of campaign materials.       Illegal campaign practices by candidates offering free      goods and services to voters and distributing unregistered      campaign materials.       Executive branch interference in the election process has      decreased somewhat since the previous three week period,      although it remains a key feature of the electoral      environment. As before, the principal beneficiary of this      assistance is the bloc ``Za Edu'' and its candidates in      single mandate constituencies. Much of this interference      takes place openly; in many cases, government officials      involve themselves in the electoral process in an apparent      attempt to win favor with their superiors. Although CVU      has witnessed fewer instances of this kind of violation,      this does not necessarily suggest that executive branch      officials are behaving more impartially. In many cases,      they have simply shifted their attention away from the      parliamentary elections to oblast (state) and local races,      which are not covered in this report.       Conversely, legal provisions requiring free and transparent      campaigning are being ignored with increasing frequency.      Criminal interference in campaigns has gone up; in turn,      parties and single-mandate candidates are breaking the      election law more often.       Some candidates, parties, and citizens whose rights have      been infringed are beginning to lodge formal complaints with      election commissions and the courts. Some commissions have      responded by warning parties and candidates accused of      campaign violations to respect the law. No state officials     has been punished for abuse of office, however. While CVU has      uncovered no evidence that state interference in the election      has been ordered by senior government authorities, neither      have these authorities punished any accused lawbreakers or      acted preemptively to ensure neutrality on the part of their      subordinates.                          election commissions       The country's central and constituency election commissions      appear to functioning relatively well. Most are following      proper procedure and trying to respond to appeals in a timely      manner. Where problems with district commissions do exist,      they are more likely to be found in eastern and southern      regions of Ukraine.       The formation of polling-place election commissions (PECs)      has not gone smoothly, however. Instead, this process has      been marked by confusion and numerous violations of proper      procedure. Detailed information on the make-up of the      country's roughly 33,000 PECs was supposed to be released by      February 27 Article 21.13 of the election law, but this      requirement was not observed in most areas. Hence, an      analysis of the make-up of the commissions is not possible at      this time.       CVU is concerned that the provisions of Ukraine's election      law that provide for multi-partisan representation on      election commissions have not been respected in spirit. In      many areas, local executive bodies have taken advantage of      the weaknesses of political parties to appoint election      commissioners who nominally represent a party but who are, in      practice, loyal to the local administration alone. CVU has      witnessed numerous cases where election commissioners are      unaware even of identity of the party they are supposed to      represent. Clearly, a good deal of the blame for this problem      also lies with the parties, which have been incapable of      recruiting trusted members to serve as commissioners in many      parts of the country.
