 Experts say the tools in the bipartisan cybersecurity bill the Senate voted to advance can help prevent future attacks through the sharing of information between the public and private sectors. The legislation's voluntary information sharing provisions are key to protecting the personal information of the people we all represent. The bill has also been carefully examined by Senators of both parties and contains important measures to protect civil liberties and individual privacy. I thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein of the Intelligence Committee for their hard work on the bipartisan bill.  We will consider a variety of amendments from both sides of the aisle tomorrow. After that, we can take a final vote on the underlying bill. That will be the Senate's initial focus this week. I will have more to say about it tomorrow.  In the meantime, we also know that fiscal negotiations are ongoing. As the details come in, and especially if an agreement is reached, I intend to consult and discuss the details with our colleagues.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
