It is not just water that is going to the Central Valley, also to the southern California region for the millions of people who live there.  We don't want to see water wasted. This year, we saw hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water being released through the delta, really, with not saving one fish. Even independent agencies will privately agree that they were overly conservativewhen they were managing the pump operations of late.  So this suffering that is going on is terrible. It needs to come to an end. I certainly oppose this amendment and urge a ``no'' vote.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendments offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.                Amendment No. 41 Offered by Mr. Grijalva  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in House Report 114-683.
