 Craig, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr.         Grassley, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Bond):  S. 485. A bill to amend the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act to provide increased emphasis on competitive grants to promote agricultural research projects regarding precision agriculture and to provide for the dissemination of the results of the research projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    THE PRECISION AGRICULTURE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION                        DISSEMINATION ACT OF 1997 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I are introducing the Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and Information Dissemination Act of 1997.  Earlier this month the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry began a series of hearings on reforming and reauthorizing agricultural research programs. It is our desire that as we move through this process this legislation will become part of the research reauthorization that is signed into law.  This legislation emphasizes research on precision agriculture technologies. These technologies are very exciting and will enable the United States to maintain and augment our competitive edge in global agricultural markets. The legislation amends the Competitive, Special and Facilities Research Grant Act of 1965 by modifying the National Research Initiative [NRI] to give the Secretary of Agriculture authority to provide research, extension, and education competitive grants and programs that emphasize precision agriculture technologies and management practices.  This legislation represents a compromise between various interests. The bill is supported by The Fertilizer Institute, National Center for Resources Innovations, Experiment Station and Extension Service Directors, Lockheed Martin, and a consortium of other high technology companies.  An identical bill H.R. 725 was introduced by Congressman Lewis and Congressman Crapo on February 12, 1997.  Precision agriculture technologies are rapidly advancing, and it is crucial that the agricultural research community invest in this field of research so that all farmers will be able to benefit. This bill will not only increase the investment in precision agriculture, but it will also emphasize an educational process that will assist all farmers in adopting precision agriculture technologies and applications.  Emerging technologies in production agriculture are changing and improving the way farmers produce food and fiber in this country. New technologies such as global positioning satellites field mapping, geo-reference information systems, grid soil sampling, variable rate seeding and input applications, portable electronic pest scouting, on-the-go yield monitoring, and computerized field history and record keeping are just a few of the next generation technological tools in use today.  Today, these technologies can map these variables and data instantaneously as an applicator or combine drives across the field. In short, each farm field using precision technology becomes a research pilot. And in the down months or winter season a farmer can collect the data from the previous growing season and adjust dozens of important agronomic variables to maximize the efficient use of all the farmers inputs: time, fuel, commercial inputs, seed rate, irrigation--the list goes on and on.  These precision farming tools are already proving to help farmers increase field productivity, improve input efficiency, protect the environment, maximize farm profitability, and create computerized field histories that may help increase land values. Collectively, these and other emerging technologies are being used in an integrated, site-specific systems approach called ``Precision Agriculture.'' Progressive and production minded farmers are already using these technologies. In a decade they may be as commonplace on the farm as air-conditioned tractor cabs and power steering.  Precision farming seems to offer great promise for improving production performance. Inherently, it sounds very appealing to be able to evaluate production conditions on an individual square foot, yard, or acre basis rather than that of a whole field. It would seem that we should be able to treatany situation more appropriately the smaller the plot we are considering. There have been great strides in predicting productivity on the basis of smaller and smaller units on the ground than we have ever realistically envisioned in the past, measuring yields as we harvest, being able to collect soil samples on a very small pilot basis and prescribe corrective measures on the go. All of these things are possible. They are being done on an experimental basis in many locations. Some producers have adopted the new technology and are using it.  Precision farming is, in its simplest form, a management system for crop production that uses site-specific data to maximize yields and more efficiently use inputs. The technology is quickly gaining acceptance and use by producers, farm suppliers, crop consultants, and custom applicators.  Precision farming links the data-management abilities of computers with sophisticated farm equipment that can vary applications rates and monitor yields throughout a field.  Mr. President, the capabilities of precision agriculture technologies are rapidly increasing. The economic and environmental benefits of these technologies have not been fully realized. Increasing the use of these technologies and development of complementary new technologies will benefit American agriculture, the U.S. economy and both domestic and global environmental concerns. In Kentucky this type of research can help producers increase their yield while protecting environmental concerns such as water quality. I believe these new high-technology tools can make agriculture better by boosting production, environmental quality and profits.                                  ______                                       By
