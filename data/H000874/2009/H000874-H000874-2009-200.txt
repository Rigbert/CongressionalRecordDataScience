Mr. Pence, you opposed the program in 1993. You said it would destroy this economy. You said it would blow deficits sky high. It created 216,000 jobs per month on average.  You then supported an economic program in 2001. You said it would be a haven for jobs and small business and all that. You created not 216,000 jobs per month but 4,240. Those are the figures. I'm sure that you will all want to come here and say, ``No, Hoyer was wrong on those figures.''  Under the economic program we propose, 216,000 new jobs every month on average. Under your program for the last 8 years under the Bush administration, 4,240 per month. That is a very substantial difference between 20.8 million new jobs under the economic program that you did not support in 1993 that we proposed, passed, and President Clinton signed.  So when you talk about jobs, you ought to talk about the experience that you've had under our program and your program. You failed. We succeeded. As a matter of fact, in the last year of the Bush administration, we lost 3 million-plus jobs. During the last year of the Clinton administration, we gained 1.9 million jobs. That's a 5 million job turnaround by your economic program.  So keep talking. America knew the difference. America made a decision. They said what you had been doing was not what they wanted so they changed. In 2006, they changed the Congress, and in 2008 they changed the Presidency.  And let me tell you something. We have lost 200,000 less jobs per month than Bush lost in his last 3 months in office, over the last 3 months. Now, is that where we want to be? It is not. But it is 200,000 better than the last 3 months in your administration. Those are the facts. Refute them if you can. Keep talking.                          ____________________
