 President, Dr. Henry Foster has been nominated by President Clinton to be the U.S. Surgeon General. I rise today to express my support for Dr. Foster, and to urge my colleagues to give him a full and fair hearing.  Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Foster, and I am very impressed.  Dr. Foster is a physician with vast experience who has dedicated his life to maternal and child health. He is a man who speaks from the heart, a person who cares deeply about the health of families across this Nation.  Dr. Foster is one of the country's leading experts on preventing teen pregnancy and drug abuse, as well as reducing infant mortality. He is a public health professional with vision.  I urge my colleagues to meet with Dr. Foster, to talk with him, to ask him tough questions. I have. I believe they too will be very impressed.  Dr. Foster has tested his ideas about public health interventions that can greatly benefit this Nation. He wants to continue his career-long focus on maternal and child health, on adolescents, and the on prevention of teen pregnancy. He wants to fight AIDS, and combat the epidemic of violence that has taken hold across our Nation.  I also want to stress the importance and relevance of Dr. Foster's practice area. For far too long, women's health concerns have been neglected by this Nation. I am heartened that our next Surgeon General can be a physician who has dedicated his life to women's health--an obstetrician/gynecologist.  Women's health is critical to every family--every man, woman, and child--in this Nation. As a woman, and a mother with a son and daughter, I find the selection of Dr. Foster reassuring. I urge my colleagues to stop and think about the importance of women's health to families everywhere.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Labor Committee as they prepare hearings for Dr. foster. I believe when my colleagues and the American public get to know Dr. Foster, they will be as excited as I am to have him as our Nation's next Surgeon General. You, too, will recognize his honesty, his passion, and his commitment to children and families.  I thank you and yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
