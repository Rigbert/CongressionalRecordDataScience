Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act. The bill would amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act)--the premier law governing commercial and recreational fishing in U.S. federal waters. The Magnuson-Stevens Act was first enacted in 1976 and was last reauthorized in 2006.  I worked on the 2006 reauthorization with my friend and Senator, Ted Stevens. Ted Stevens was a champion for Alaska and the law bears his name as recognition of his dedication to supporting and protecting Alaska fishermen and the importance of fishery resources to coastal communities. I will miss working with my friend during this next reauthorization, but will remember him fondly as the legislation moves through Congress.  Over the last two Congresses, I worked with the former Chair of the Committee on Natural Resources, Doc Hastings, to develop the text of the bill. The Committee on Natural Resources held 10 hearings, receiving comments and suggestions from over 100 witnesses representing Members of Congress, the administration, state governments, regional fishery management councils, marine fisheries commissions, commercial and recreational (including for-hire charter) fishing groups, processors, academics, and environmental groups. Due to this in-depth review of the Act and the need to keep the process going forward to reform the law, I am introducing the bill the Committee reported to the House floor in the 113th Congress.  The bill we developed in the 113th Congress would not have been possible without the knowledge and dedicated work of Mr. David Whaley, who retired from the Committee after twenty years of working on fisheries issues. I would like to acknowledge and thank Dave for his hard work and dedication over the years. I hired Dave in 1994 as my fisheries staffer for the Committee on Resources and he continued to handle Alaskan, national and international fishery issues, as well as marine mammal and ocean issues over his career on the Committee. Dave has been an invaluable resource to me and other members of the Committee during his twenty years of service on the Committee and we will miss his expertise and experience as we move this bill forward.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for regional management of fisheries. The law gives guidance through its National Standards and specifies the process through which the Councils develop their fishery management plans. While the Secretary of Commerce has final approval of fishery management plans, the Magnuson-Stevens Act provides for a regional approach where the Councils, hearing from its local constituency groups, can develop fishery management plans that best suit their fisheries and fishermen. This is critical for the protection of coastal economies and for allowing the stakeholders to be a part of the management of their fisheries.  The Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act would update the Magnuson-Stevens Act to implement common sense reforms. The 2006 amendments were said to apply the `Alaska Model' of fisheries management to other regions of the country. The premise of this reform was good. The `Alaska Model' worked in Alaska due to stock assessments providing up-to-date fisheries data to allow the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to use adaptive management, providing optimal use of fishery resources to fishermen. The problem with trying to implement the `Alaska Model' in other regions was that these regions did not have adequate science--due to infrequent or out dated stock assessments--to support that type of management system. Instead of providing optimal use of the resource for fishermen, the implementation of the `Alaska Model' resulted in fisheries being restricted in regions that were considered `data poor' due to multiple levels of precautionary measures being applied because of inadequate scientific data.  I believe the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act will allow for increased fisheries management flexibility and transparency, provide for improved data collection, create jobs, and--what I believe is very important--create predictability and certainty for the coastal communities that depend on stable fishing activities.  The Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act would reauthorize and strengthen the Magnuson-Stevens Act to ensure a proper balance between the biological needs of fish stocks and the economic needs of fishermen and coastal communities. The bill would make a number of improvements to the Act: provide flexibility for fishery managers when rebuilding depleted fisheries; provide flexibility for fishery managers when setting annual catch levels; provide more transparency for fishermen and others in both science and management; provide a schedule for obtaining better fishery dependent and fishery independent data especially for data poor fisheries; provide greater protection for confidential information submitted to regulatory agencies; encourage and promote cooperative research projects where scientists work with fishermen to develop sound scientific information; allow fishery managers to take the economic impact of their decisions into account when setting harvest levels; allow fishery managers to take environmental conditions into account when establishing harvest levels; allow fishermen in regions where catch share programs have been controversial to have a vote to determine whether a new catch share program will be implemented and to be provided better information when considering such a program; require NOAA to provide better accountability on how fees are collected and used; clarify the role of the Magnuson-Stevens Act in relationship to other federal statutes; and authorize appropriations for an additional five fiscal years at current authorized funding levels.  As I've learned over the years as a legislator, laws are not written in stone. Congress's job is to review them, listen to constituents and modify the laws as needed. Laws that are stagnant do not help anyone. Times change and laws need to reflect new information and the needs of Americans.  Constituency groups were influential in developing the 2006 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Key aspects of the 2006 amendments were the goal to end overfishing through the requirement that annual catch limits not exceed scientific recommendations and accountability measures were instituted. Changes in the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act were also developed by listening to constituency groups at committee hearings, fishery managers at fishery council meetings and at national conferences, and reviewing recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. Even the National Marine Fisheries Service recognizes the need for reforms and has proposed revisions to its advisory guidelines for National Standards 1, 3 and 7 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. These proposed revisions recommend changes that would allow for increased flexibility in rebuilding programs, clarify guidance on which stocks require conservation and management and defines depleted stocks, among other items. These changes are similar to changes included in the bill I am introducing today.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the new Chair of the Committee on Natural Resources, Rob Bishop, as a cosponsor of this legislation. I look forward to working with him as the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act moves through Committee and the House. I also am pleased to have Representatives Bradley Byrne and Amata Coleman Radewagen as original cosponsors on the bill. I look forward to working with any Member of the House that is interested in reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This is an important piece of legislation and I urge Members to support its movement through the House of Representatives and 114th Congress.                          ____________________
