Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, 2 minutes is not anywhere near enough to discuss even the defense part of this bill, but I will give it a quick try.  First of all, let me say that everyone that has spoken here this evening so far is correct. It is a good bill, it is a terrible bill; the process is unacceptable, it just does not work; but it was the only way to get here where we are tonight to keep the government functioning for the balance of the fiscal year.  When we are dealing with 435 people in this House, 100 people in the other House at the end of the hall, and at the White House, that is 536 people that had to come together, and 536 people are never going to agree on a perfect bill.  It has been suggested that some of the defense money was under the emergency proclamation. That is true. The largest single part of the defense bill, however, is $1.9 billion for the deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia. Other large portions of the bill go to intelligence.  When we just remember Kenya and Tanzania, where our embassies were bombed, with much loss of life and much injury, more intelligence against terrorism, more intelligence against military threats to our own interests, are important. Yes, there is a substantial amount of money for intelligence here.  Another large portion of this bill is missile defense. The Chinese have developed tremendous missile capability, using much of the technology developed by American industries that was allowed to go overseas to China.                              {time}  1900  The North Koreans not only developed weapons of mass destruction, but also the missiles with the ability to carry them to wherever, to Hawaii, to Alaska. The last North Korean missile shot, some of the debris fell near the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands are part of the United States of America. In addition, we increased the President's request for readiness funding in this bill by 30 percent. We recognized the need for more investment in readiness and for troop morale.
