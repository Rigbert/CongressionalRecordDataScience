President, today I am introducing the Preparing, Recruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals (PRREP) Act to improve education and student achievement through high-quality preparation, induction, and professional development for teachers, early childhood education providers, principals, and administrators.  Improving teacher quality is the single most effective measure we can take to increase student achievement. As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we must ensure that educators receive the training and support necessary to thrive in our nation's early childhood programs, elementary schools, and secondary schools. We have an opportunity to support the development of educators so they not only have the credentials to be considered a ``highly qualified teacher'' under the No Child Left Behind Act, but also the skills and training to be truly effective in the classroom. By strengthening the teacher preparation grants in Title II of the Higher Education Act, my legislation will accomplish both of these important goals.  Teacher attrition undermines teacher quality and creates teacher shortages. According to the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, one-third of beginning teachers leave the profession within three years, and nearly one-half leave within five years. In high poverty schools turnover rates are even worse--approximately one-third higher than the rate for all teachers. The PRREP Act would create a year-long clinical learning experience for prospective teachers, and establish a comprehensive induction program, including high quality mentoring, for new teachers in at least their first two years of teaching. Research consistently shows that induction programs reduce the number of teachers who leave their schools or the profession. Comprehensive induction programs can cut that number by half or more.  Additionally, my legislation strengthens teacher preparation programs so that teachers will reach their maximum potential to positively affect student achievement. A focus on scientific knowledge of effective teaching skills and methods of student learning will equip teachers to understand and respond to diverse student populations, including students with disabilities, limited-English proficient students, and students with different learning styles or special learning needs. The legislation also seeks to ensure that teachers have the ability to integrate technology into the classroom, use assessments to improve instructional practices and curriculum, and communicate with and involve parents in their children's education.  My legislation further focuses on teaching skills and learning strategies by including in the partnership grants academic departments such as psychology, human development, or one with comparable expertise in the disciplines of teaching, learning, and child and adolescent development. The PRREP Act also would include early childhood educators for the first time in teacher preparation programs.  Teacher preparation grants under Title II of the Higher Education Act are currently funded at only $60 million a year--far too small of an investment for this critical enterprise. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of meeting the highly qualified requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, but also for real students in real classrooms. My bill significantly boosts this funding, authorizing $500 million for these vital programs.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its inclusion in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1231       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
