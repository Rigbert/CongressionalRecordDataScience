 President, I agree with the Senator. Maybe he could make that very compelling speech to Mr. Gingrich so we can actually pass the terrorism bill instead of him holding the terrorism bill up that we--the Senator from Oklahoma and I--worked so hard on. The House has not passed it yet. It is a great emergency.  I have not heard any speeches on the floor from my friends who were decrying failure to move quickly on the terrorism bill when we had it. I have not heard any speeches about why the Republican House of Representatives is holding it hostage. God only knows. Maybe it has to do with a line-item veto that they used to be for as well in the House. I am not sure. But I think we would all serve the Nation well if we constantly spoke out and asked Mr. Gingrich to let the terrorism bill go instead of turning that into a habeas corpus reform. I would hate to have that sit over there for the remainder of the year.
