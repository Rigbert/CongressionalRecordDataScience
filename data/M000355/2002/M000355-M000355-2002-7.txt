 Section 301(a)(1), regarding Voting System Standards, says a voting system shall permit a voter to verify in a private and independent manner the votes selected. Section 301(a)(1) also says a voting system shall provide a voter an opportunity in a private and independent manner to change his or her ballot before the ballot is cast and counted.  Am I correct that the conferees included the language ``in a private and independent manner'' to ensure that individuals can verify and change their votes free from intimidation or coercion from poll workers, election officials or others?
