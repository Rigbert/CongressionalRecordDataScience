Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2950, introduced by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, establishes the area of Sand Creek Massacre as a National Historic Site. The Sand Creek Massacre remains a matter of great historical, cultural, and spiritual importance to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, and is a pivotal event in the history of relations between the Plains Indians and Euro-American settlers.  This piece of legislation also directs the Secretary to develop a site management plan, administer the site as part of the National Park Service, and to prepare programs which educate the public about the site. In addition, S. 2950 would dedicate a portion of the site to certain burial and commemorative remains and objects.  I urge my colleagues to support S. 2950.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
