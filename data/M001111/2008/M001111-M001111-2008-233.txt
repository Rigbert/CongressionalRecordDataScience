 President, today I recognize the Garfield-Palouse High School Junior Engineering Technical Society, JETS, design team from Washington State. These outstanding young students and their teacher, Mr. Jim Stewart, are finalists in the National Engineering and Design Challenge.  The Garfield-Palouse JETS team researched and built a prototype paraplegic agricultural lift to meet this year's National Engineering and Design Challenge to design a device to assist disabled people in the workplace. Their work to build this lift was inspired by their desire to help a classmate and will allow access to agriculture equipment for individuals with a disability. Agriculture is an important part of Washington State's economy, and I am pleased these students worked on a project that highlights a local industry and will help individuals with disabilities attain greater independence.  The JETS program at Garfield-Palouse High School is an integral tool to empower students to take a deeper look at understanding and addressing problems that many individuals with disabilities face.  I would like to commend Colby Cocking, Beau Fisher, Spencer Gray, Anna Iverson, Travis Mallett, Sean Neal, Miles Pfaff, Aaron Rager, Katie Redman, Steven Tronsen, and Jim Stewart for their accomplishments. Washington State is fortunate to have a talented and motivated team that placed in the top 5 out of over 100 entries in this unique and rewarding competition. I am proud of the dedication and hard work of these students from Washington State. I wish the team well in the final round of competitions.                          ____________________
