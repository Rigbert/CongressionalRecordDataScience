 President, I wish to submit for the record the Joint Committee's technical explanation of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005. This explanation is of the Senate amendment to H.R. 4440. This legislation was passed by the Senate on Friday, December 16, 2005. Let me make it clear that this technical explanation was actually submitted to the Senate at the time the bill was passed to be printed in the Congressional Record. Unfortunately, due to a clerical error this did not happen. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the technical explanation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              INTRODUCTION       The bill provides tax benefits for the Gulf Opportunity      Zone and certain areas affected by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma.      It also includes tax and trade technical corrections.      Finally, the bill provides that any of its provisions causing      an effect on receipts, budget authority, or outlays is      designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section      402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress).            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF GULF OPPORTUNITY ZONE               A. Tax Benefits for Gulf Opportunity Zone     1. Definitions of ``Gulf Opportunity Zone,'' ``Rita GO          Zone,'' ``Wilma GO Zone,'' and other definitions (new          sec. 1400M of the Code)                          General Definitions     Gulf Opportunity Zone       For purposes of the bill, the ``Gulf Opportunity Zone'' is      defined as that portion of the Hurricane Katrina Disaster      Area determined by the President to warrant individual or      individual and public assistance from the Federal Government      under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.     Hurricane Katrina disaster area       The term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area      with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by      the President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of      the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.     Rita GO Zone       The term ``Rita GO Zone'' means that portion of the      Hurricane Rita disaster area determined by the President to      warrant individual or individual and public assistance from      the Federal Government under section 401 of the Robert T.      Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by      reason of Hurricane Rita.     Hurricane Rita disaster area       The term ``Hurricane Rita disaster area'' means an area      with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by      the President before October 6, 2005, under section 401 of      the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act, by reason of Hurricane Rita.     Wilma GO Zone       The term ``Wilma GO Zone'' means that portion of the      Hurricane Wilma disaster area determined by the President to      warrant individual or individual and public assistance from      the Federal Government under section 401 of the Robert T.      Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by      reason of Hurricane Wilma.     Hurricane Wilma disaster area       The term ``Hurricane Wilma disaster area'' means an area      with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by      the President before November 14, 2005, under section 401 of      the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act, by reason of Hurricane Wilma.     2. Tax-exempt bond financing for the Gulf Opportunity Zone          (new sec. 1400N(a) of the Code)                              Present Law     Rules governing issuance of tax-exempt bonds       In general       Under present law, gross income does not include interest      on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are      classified generally as either governmental bonds or private      activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are      primarily used to finance governmental functions or are      repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are      bonds with respect to which the State or local government      serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental      persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The      exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not      apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued      for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity      bonds'').       Private activities eligible for financing with tax-exempt            bonds       The definition of qualified private activity bonds includes      an exempt facility bond, or qualified mortgage, veterans'      mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, 501(c)(3), or student      loan bond (sec. 141(e)). The definition of exempt facility      bond includes bonds issued to finance certain transportation      facilities (airports, ports, mass commuting, and high-speed      intercity rail facilities); qualified residential rental      projects; privately owned and/or operated utility facilities      (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district      heating and cooling facilities, certain private electric and      gas facilities, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/     private educational facilities; qualified green building and      sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface      freight transfer facilities (sec. 142(a)).       As noted above, subject to certain requirements, qualified      private activity bonds may be issued to finance residential      rental property or owner-occupied housing. Residential rental      property may be financed with exempt facility bonds if the      financed project is a ``qualified residential rental      project.'' A project is a qualified residential rental      project if 20 percent or more of the residential units in      such project are occupied by individuals whose income is 50      percent or less of area median gross income (the ``20-50      test''). Alternatively, a project is a qualified residential      rental project if 40 percent or more of the residential units      in such project are occupied by individuals whose income is      60 percent or less of area median gross income (the ``40-60      test'').       Owner-occupied housing may be financed with qualified      mortgage bonds. Qualified mortgage bonds are bonds issued to      make mortgage loans to qualified mortgagors for the purchase,      improvement, or rehabilitation of owner-occupied residences.      The Code imposes several limitations on qualified mortgage      bonds, including income limitations for homebuyers and      purchase price limitations for the home financed with bond      proceeds. The income limitations are satisfied if all      financing provided by an issue is provided for mortgagors      whose family income does not exceed 115 percent of the median      family income for the metropolitan area or State, whichever      is greater, in which the financed residences are located. The      purchase price limitations provide that a residence financed      with qualified mortgage bonds may not have a purchase price      in excess of 90 percent of the average area purchase price      for that residence. In addition to these limitations,      qualified mortgage bonds generally cannot be used to finance      a mortgage for a homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a      principal residence in the three years preceding the      execution of the mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer''      requirement).       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to      targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one      located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70      percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or      less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of      chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the      income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of      the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits      and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors      whose family income is 140 percent or less of the applicable      median family income. The purchase price limitation is raised      from 90 percent to 110 percent of the average area purchase      price for targeted area residences. In addition, the first-     time homebuyer requirement does not apply to targeted area      residences.       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance      qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement      loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs,      and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such      alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect      or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the      property. Under present law, qualified home-improvement loans      may not exceed $15,000.       Issuance of most qualified private activity bonds is      subject (in whole or in part) to annual State volume      limitations (sec. 146)). Exceptions are provided for bonds      for certain governmentally owned facilities (e.g., airports,      ports, high-speed intercity rail, and solid waste disposal)      and bonds which are subject to separate local, State, or      national volume limits (e.g., public/private educational      facility bonds, enterprise zone facility bonds, qualified      green building bonds, and qualified highway or surface      freight transfer facility bonds).       In addition, qualified private activity bonds generally are      subject to restrictions on the use of proceeds for the      acquisition of land and existing property, use of proceeds to      finance certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes,      skyboxes, other luxury boxes, health club facilities,      gambling facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds      to pay costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter      fees). Small issue and redevelopment bonds also are subject      to additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain      facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).       Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds      generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of      the property being financed and certain public      approval requirements (similar to requirements that      typically apply under State law to issuance of      governmental debt) apply under Federal law to issuance of      private activity bonds.       Liberty Zone Bonds       Present law permits an aggregate of $8 billion in exempt      facility bonds for the purpose of financing the construction      and rehabilitation of nonresidential real property and      residential rental real property in a designated ``Liberty      Zone'' (the ``Zone'') of New York City (``Liberty Zone      bonds''). The Zone consists of all business addresses located      on or south of Canal Street, East Broadway (east of its      intersection with Canal Street), or Grand Street (east of its      intersection with East Broadway) in the Borough of Manhattan.      No more than $800 million of the authorized bond amount may      be used to finance property used for retail sales of tangible      property (e.g., department stores, restaurants, etc.) and      functionally related and subordinate property. The $800      million limit is divided equally between the Mayor of New      York City and the Governor of New York State. In addition, no      more than $1.6 billion of the authorized bond amount may be      used to finance residential rental property. The $1.6 billion      limit also is divided equally between the Mayor of New York      City and the Governor of New York State. Liberty Zone Bonds      must be issued before January 1, 2010.       Property eligible for financing with these bonds includes      buildings and their structural components, fixed tenant      improvements, and public utility property (e.g., gas, water,      electric and telecommunication lines). Fixtures and equipment      that could be removed from the designated zone for use      elsewhere are not eligible for financing with these bonds.      Issuance of these bonds is limited to projects approved by      the Mayor of New York City or the Governor of New York State,      each of whom may designate up to $4 billion of the aggregate      bond authority.       Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more      tax-exempt bonds than necessary for the activity being      financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for      the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage      restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment      of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits      may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined      ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose      of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g.,      ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds'').      Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during      these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the      Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less      restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.                        Explanation of Provision     Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds       The provision authorizes the issuance of qualified private      activity bonds to finance the construction and rehabilitation      of residential and nonresidential property located in the      Gulf Opportunity Zone (``Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds''). Gulf      Opportunity Zone Bonds must be issued after the date of      enactment and before January 1, 2011.       Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds may be issued by the State of      Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any political      subdivision thereof. Issuance of bonds authorized under the      provision is limited to projects approved by the Governor of      the State (or the State bond commission in the case of a bond      which is required under State law to be approved by such      commission) in which the financed project shall be located.      The maximum aggregate face amount of Gulf Opportunity Zone      Bonds that may be issued in any State is limited to $2,500      multiplied by the population of the respective State within      the Gulf Opportunity Zone. Current refundings of outstanding      bonds issued under the provision do not count against the      aggregate volume limit to the extent that the principal      amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the outstanding      principal amount of the bonds being refunded. Gulf      Opportunity Zone Bonds may not be advance refunded.       Depending on the purpose for which such bonds are issued,      Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds are treated as either exempt      facility bonds or qualified mortgage bonds. Gulf Opportunity      Zone Bonds are treated as exempt facility bonds if 95 percent      or more of the net proceeds of such bonds are to be used for      qualified project costs located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.      Qualified project costs include the cost of acquisition,      construction, reconstruction, and renovation of      nonresidential real property (including buildings and their      structural components and fixed improvements associated with      such property), qualified residential rental projects (as      defined in section 142(d) with certain modifications), and      public utility property. For purposes of the provision, costs      associated with improving a facility (e.g., installing      equipment that enhances the pollution control of a      manufacturing facility) may be permitted project costs if      such costs are chargeable to the capital account of the      facility or would be so chargeable either with a proper      election by a taxpayer or but for a proper election by a      taxpayer to deduct the costs.       Bond proceeds may not be used to finance movable fixtures      and equipment. The purpose of this limitation is to ensure      that property financed with the bonds will remain in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone. ``Movable fixtures and equipment'' does not      include components that are assembled to construct an      industrial plant. Such term also does not include consumer      appliances installed in owner-occupied residences and      residential rental property financed with the proceeds of      Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds.       Rather than applying the 20-50 and 40-60 test under present      law, a project is a qualified residential rental project      under the provision if 20 percent or more of the residential      units in such project are occupied by individuals whose      income is 60 percent or less of area median gross income or      if 40 percent or more of the residential units in such      project are occupied by individuals whose income is 70      percent or less of area median gross income.       Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds are treated as qualified      mortgage bonds if the bonds of such issue meet the      requirements of a qualified mortgage issue (as defined in      section 143 and modified by this provision) and the      residences financed with such bonds are located     in the Gulf Opportunity Zone. For these purposes, residences      located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone are treated as targeted      area residences. Thus, the first-time homebuyer rule is      waived and purchase and income rules for targeted area      residences apply to residences financed with bonds issued      under the provision. Under the provision, 100 percent of the      mortgages must be made to mortgagors whose family income is      140 percent or less of the applicable median family income.      Thus, the present law rule allowing one-third of the      mortgages to be made without regard to any income limits does      not apply. In addition, the provision increases from      $15,000 to $150,000 the amount of a qualified home-     improvement loan that may be financed with bond proceeds.       Subject to the following exceptions and modifications,      issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds is subject to the      general rules applicable to issuance of qualified private      activity bonds:       (1) Except as otherwise permitted for a qualified mortgage      issue, repayments of bond-financed loans may not be used to      make additional loans;       (2) Issuance of the bonds is not subject to the aggregate      annual State private activity bond volume limits (sec. 146);       (3) The restriction on acquisition of existing property is      applied using a minimum requirement of 50 percent of the cost      of acquiring the building being devoted to rehabilitation      (sec. 147(d));       (4) The special arbitrage expenditure rules for certain      construction bond proceeds apply to available construction      proceeds of Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds issued to finance      qualified project costs, treating such bonds as a      construction issue (sec. 148(f)(4)(C));       (5) Interest on the bonds is not a preference item for      purposes of the alternative minimum tax preference for      private activity bond interest (sec. 57(a)(5)); and       (6) No portion of the proceeds of the bonds may be used to      provide any property described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e.,      any private or commercial golf course, country club, massage      parlor, hot tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other      facility used for gambling, or any store the principal      purpose of which is the sale alcoholic beverages for      consumption off premises).                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for bonds issued after the date      of enactment and before January 1, 2011.     3. Advance refunding of certain tax-exempt bonds (new sec.          1400N(b) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Interest on bonds issued by State and local governments      generally is excluded from gross income for Federal income      tax purposes if the proceeds of the bonds are used to finance      direct activities of these governmental units or if the bonds      are repaid with revenues of the governmental units      (``governmental bonds''). Interest on State or local bonds to      finance activities of private persons (``private activity      bonds'') is taxable unless a specific exception applies.      Bonds issued to finance the activities of charitable      organizations described in section 501(c)(3) (``qualified      501(c)(3) bonds'') are one type of tax-exempt private      activity bonds (``qualified private activity bonds'').      Qualified private activity bonds also include exempt facility      bonds. The definition of exempt facility bonds includes bonds      issued to finance certain transportation facilities (e.g.,      airports, docks, and wharves).       Generally, qualified private activity bonds are subject to      restrictions on the use of proceeds for the acquisition of      land and existing property, use of proceeds to finance      certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes,      other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling      facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay      costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees).      Certain types of qualified private activity bonds (e.g.,      small issue and redevelopment bonds) also are subject to      additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain      facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).      Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds      generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of      the property being financed and certain public approval      requirements (similar to requirements that typically apply      under State law to issuance of governmental debt) apply under      Federal law to issuance of private activity bonds.     Limitations on advance refundings       A refunding bond is defined as any bond used to pay      principal, interest, or redemption price on a prior bond      issue (the refunded bond). The Code contains different rules      for ``current'' as opposed to ``advance'' refunding bonds. A      current refunding occurs when the refunded bond is redeemed      within 90 days of issuance of the refunding bonds.      Conversely, a bond is classified as an advance refunding bond      if it is issued more than 90 days before the redemption of      the refunded bond (sec. 149(d)(5)). Proceeds of advance      refunding bonds are generally invested in an escrow account      and held until a future date when the refunded bond may be      redeemed. Thus, after issuance of an advance refunding bond,      there is a period of time when both the refunding bonds and      the refunded bonds remain outstanding.       There is no statutory limitation on the number of times      that tax-exempt bonds may be currently refunded. However, the      Code limits the number of advance refundings with tax-exempt      bonds. Generally, governmental bonds and qualified 501(c)(3)      bonds may be advance refunded one time (sec. 149(d)(3)).      Private activity bonds, other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds,      may not be advance refunded.       Under present law, certain bonds used to fund facilities      located in New York City are permitted one additional advance      refunding if issued before January 1, 2006. In addition to      satisfying other requirements, the bond refunded must be (1)      a State or local bond that is a general obligation of New      York City, (2) a State or local bond issued by the New York      Municipal Water Finance Authority or Metropolitan      Transportation Authority of New York City, or (3) a qualified      501(c)(3) bond which is a qualified hospital bond issued by      or on behalf of the State of New York or New York City. The      maximum amount of additional advance refunding bonds that may      be issued is $9 billion.     Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more      tax-exempt bonds than is necessary for the activity being      financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for      the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage      restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment      of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits      may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined      ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose      of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g.,      ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds'').      Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during      these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the      Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less      restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision permits an additional advance refunding of      certain governmental and qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued by      the State of Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any      political subdivision thereof. The provision also permits one      advance refunding of certain exempt facility bonds for      airports, docks, or wharves issued by the State of Alabama,      Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any political subdivision      thereof, notwithstanding the general prohibition on the      advance refunding of such bonds.       The advance refunding authority under this provision only      applies to bonds issued by the State of Alabama, Louisiana,      or Mississippi, or any political subdivision thereof, which      were outstanding on August 28, 2005, and could not be advance      refunded under Code restrictions in effect on that date.      (Although section 1400L(e)(4)(A) refers to restrictions on      advance refundings under ``any provision of law,'' rather      than under the ``Code,'' no inference should be drawn from      the use of different terms). Further, to be eligible for the      additional advance refunding, the advance refunding bond must      be the only other outstanding bond with respect to the      refunded bond. Thus, at no time after the advance refunding      authorized under the provision occurs may there be more than      two sets of bonds outstanding.       The maximum amount of advance refunding bonds that may be      issued pursuant to this provision is $4.5 billion in the case      of Louisiana, $2.250 billion in the case of Mississippi, and      $1.125 billion in the case of Alabama. Eligible advance      refunding bonds must be designated as such by the governor of      the respective State. Advance refunding bonds issued under      the provision must satisfy present-law arbitrage restrictions      and all requirements otherwise applicable to advance      refunding issues (e.g., redemption requirements and      prohibition on abusive transactions). Moreover, bonds may not      be advance refunded under this provision if any portion of      the proceeds of such bonds was used to provide any property      described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e., any private or      commercial golf course, country club, massage parlor, hot tub      facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other facility used      for gambling, or any store the principal purpose of which is      the sale alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises).                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for advance refunding bonds      issued after the date of enactment and before January 1,      2011.     4. Increase the low-income housing credit cap and make other          modifications (new sec. 1400N(c) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       The low-income housing credit may be claimed over a 10-year      period for the cost of rental housing occupied by tenants      having incomes below specified levels. The amount of the      credit for any taxable year in the credit period is the      applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each      qualified low-income building. The qualified basis of any      qualified low-income building for any taxable year equals the      applicable fraction of the eligible basis of the building.       The credit percentage for newly constructed or      substantially rehabilitated housing that is not Federally      subsidized is adjusted monthly by the Internal Revenue      Service so that the 10 annual installments have a present      value of 70 percent of the total qualified basis. The credit      percentage for newly constructed or substantially      rehabilitated housing that is Federally subsidized and for      existing housing that is substantially     rehabilitated is calculated to have a present value of 30      percent of qualified basis. These are referred to as the 70      percent credit and 30 percent credit, respectively.     Income targeting       In order to be eligible for the low-income housing credit,      a qualified low-income building must be part of a qualified      low-income housing project. In general, a qualified low-     income housing project is defined as a project which      satisfies one of two tests at the election of the taxpayer.      The first test is met if 20 percent or more of the      residential units in the project are both rent-restricted and      occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of      area median gross income (the ``20-50 test''). The second      test is met if 40 percent or more of the residential units in      such project are both rent-restricted and occupied by      individuals whose income is 60 percent or less of area median      gross income (the ``40-60 test'').     Credit cap       Generally, the aggregate credit authority provided annually      to each State for calendar year 2006 is $1.90 per resident      with a minimum annual cap of $2,180,000 for certain small      population States. These amounts are indexed for inflation.      These limits do not apply in the case of projects that also      receive financing with proceeds of tax-exempt bonds issued      subject to the private activity bond volume limit.     Basis of building eligible for the credit       Buildings located in high cost areas (i.e., qualified      census tracts and difficult development areas) are eligible      for an enhanced credit. Under the enhanced credit, the 70-     percent and 30 percent credit is increased to a 91 percent      and 39 percent credit, respectively. The mechanism for this      increase is an increase from 100 to 130 percent of the      otherwise applicable eligible basis of a new building or the      rehabilitation expenditures of an existing building. A      further requirement for the enhanced credit is that no more      than 20 percent of the population of each metropolitan      statistical area or nonmetropolitan statistical area may      be a difficult to develop area.     Stacking rule       Authority to allocate credits remains at the State (as      opposed to local) government level unless State law provides      otherwise. Generally, credits may be allocated only from      volume authority arising during the calendar year in which      the building is placed in service, except in the case of: (1)      credits claimed on additions to qualified basis; (2) credits      allocated in a later year pursuant to an earlier binding      commitment made no later than the year in which the building      is placed in service; and (3) carryover allocations.       Each State annually receives low-income housing credit      authority equal to $1.90 per State resident for allocation to      qualified low-income projects. In addition to this $1.90 per      resident amount, each State's ``housing credit ceiling''      includes the following amounts: (1) the unused State housing      credit ceiling (if any) of such State for the preceding      calendar year; (2) the amount of the State housing credit      ceiling (if any) returned in the calendar year; and (3) the      amount of the national pool (if any) allocated to such State      by the Treasury Department.       The national pool consists of States' unused housing credit      carryovers. For each State, the unused housing credit      carryover for a calendar year consists of the excess (if any)      of the unused State housing credit ceiling for such year over      the excess (if any) of the aggregate housing credit dollar      amount allocated for such year over the sum of $1.90 per      resident and the credit returns for such year. The amounts in      the national pool are allocated only to States that allocated      their entire housing credit ceiling for the preceding      calendar year and requested a share in the national pool not      later than May 1 of the calendar year. The national pool      allocation to qualified States is made on a pro rata basis      equivalent to the fraction that a State's population enjoys      relative to the total population of all qualified States for      that year.       The present-law stacking rule provides that each State is      treated as using its allocation of the unused State housing      credit ceiling (if any) from the preceding calendar before      the current year's allocation of credit (including any      credits returned to the State) and then finally any national      pool allocations.                        Explanation of Provision     Income targeting       In the case of property placed in service during 2006,      2007, and 2008 in a nonmetropolitan area within the Gulf      Opportunity Zone, the income targeting rules of the low-     income housing credit are applied by replacing the area      median gross income standard with a national nonmetropolitan      median gross income standard. These new income targeting      rules apply to all such buildings in the Gulf Opportunity      Zone regardless of whether the building receives its credit      allocation under the otherwise applicable low-income housing      credit cap or the additional credit cap (described below).      The income targeting rules are not changed for buildings in      metropolitan areas in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.     Credit cap       Under the provision, the otherwise applicable housing      credit ceiling amount is increased for each of the States      within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. This increase applies to      calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008. The additional credit      cap for each of the affected States equals $18.00 times the      number of such State's residents within the Gulf Opportunity      Zone. This amount is not adjusted for inflation. For purposes      of this additional credit cap amount, the determination of      population for any calendar year is made on the basis of the      most recent census estimate of the resident population of the      State in the Gulf Opportunity Zone released by the Bureau of      the Census before August 28, 2005.       In addition, the otherwise applicable housing credit      ceiling amount is increased for Florida and Texas by      $3,500,000 per State. This increase only applies to calendar      year 2006.     Basis of building eligible for the credit       Under the provision, the Gulf Opportunity Zone, the Rita Go      Zone, and the Wilma Go Zone are treated as high-cost areas      for purposes of the low-income housing credit for property      placed-in-service in calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008.      Therefore, buildings located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone,      the Rita Go Zone, and the Wilma Go Zone are eligible for the      enhanced credit. Under the enhanced credit, the 70 percent      and 30 percent credits are increased to 91 percent and 39      percent credits, respectively. The 20 percent of population      restriction is waived for this purpose. This enhanced credit      applies regardless of whether the building receives its      credit allocation under the otherwise applicable low-income      housing credit cap or the additional credit cap.     Carryover       The additional credit cap available for States within the      Gulf Opportunity Zone for calendar years 2006, 2007 and 2008      may not be carried forward from any year to any other year.      The present-law rules apply for purposes of the Rita Go Zone      and the Wilma Go Zone.     Stacking rule       Within each calendar year, each applicable State within the      GO Zone must treat the additional credit cap allocable under      the provision to that State as allocated before any other      credit cap amounts. Therefore, under the provision each      applicable State within the GO Zone is treated as using      credits in the following order: (1) the additional credit cap      (including any such credits returned to the State) under the      Gulf Opportunity Zone, then (2) its allocation of the unused      State housing credit ceiling (if any) from the preceding      calendar, then (3) the current year's allocation of present-     law credit (including any credits returned to the State) and      then (4) any national pool allocations. This generally      maximizes the total amount of credit (under both otherwise      applicable low income housing credit cap and the additional      credit cap for the Gulf Opportunity Zone) which may be      carried forward.       The present-law rules apply for purposes of the Rita Go      Zone and the Wilma Go Zone.                             Effective Date       The provisions relating to the increased credit cap,      carryover and stacking rule applicable to the GO Zone are      generally effective for calendar years beginning after 2005      and before 2009.       The provision relating to the increased credit cap      applicable to Florida and Texas is generally effective for      calendar years beginning after 2005 and before 2007.       The provision to treat the Gulf Opportunity Zone, Rita Go      Zone and the Wilma Go Zone as a high-cost area is generally      effective for calendar years beginning after 2005 and before      2009, and buildings placed in service during such period in      the case of projects that also receive financing with the      proceeds of tax-exempt bonds subject to the private activity      bond volume limit which are issued during that period.       The income targeting provision is effective for property      placed in service during 2006, 2007 and 2008. This provision      applies to property which receives a credit allocation in any      of those three years or a prior year. It also applies in the      case of credit projects that receive tax-exempt bond      financing subject to the private activity bond volume limit.     5. Additional first-year depreciation for Gulf Opportunity          Zone property (new sec. 1400N(d) of the Code)                              Present Law       A taxpayer is allowed to recover, through annual      depreciation deductions, the cost of certain property used in      a trade or business or for the production of income. The      amount of the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to      tangible property for a taxable year is determined under the      modified accelerated cost recovery system (``MACRS''). Under      MACRS, different types of property generally are assigned      applicable recovery periods and depreciation methods. The      recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal      property (generally tangible property other than residential      rental property and nonresidential real property) range from      3 to 25 years. The depreciation methods generally applicable      to tangible personal property are the 200-percent and 150-     percent declining balance methods, switching to the straight-     line method for the taxable year in which the depreciation      deduction would be maximized.       Section 280F limits the annual depreciation deductions with      respect to passenger automobiles to specified dollar amounts,      indexed for inflation.       Section 167(f)(1) provides that capitalized computer      software costs, other than computer software to which section      197 applies, are recovered ratably over 36 months.       In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a sufficiently      small amount of annual investment generally may elect to      deduct the cost of qualifying property placed in service for      the taxable year. (Sec. 179.) In general, qualifying property      is defined as depreciable tangible personal property that is      purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or      business.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision allows an additional first-year depreciation      deduction equal to 50 percent of the adjusted basis of      qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property. In order to      qualify, property 13 generally must be placed in service on      or before December 31, 2007 (December 31, 2008 in the case of      nonresidential real property and residential rental      property).       The additional first-year depreciation deduction is allowed      for both regular tax and alternative minimum tax purposes for      the taxable year in which the property is placed in service.      The additional first-year depreciation deduction is subject      to the general rules regarding whether an item is deductible      under section 162 or subject to capitalization under section      263 or section 263A. The basis of the property and the      depreciation allowances in the year of purchase and later      years are appropriately adjusted to reflect the additional      first-year depreciation deduction. In addition, the provision      provides that there is no adjustment to the allowable amount      of depreciation for purposes of computing a taxpayer's      alternative minimum taxable income with respect to property      to which the provision applies. A taxpayer is allowed to      elect out of the additional first-year depreciation for any      class of property for any taxable year.       In order for property to qualify for the additional first-     year depreciation deduction, it must meet all of the      following requirements. First, the property must be property      to which the general rules of the Modified Accelerated Cost      Recovery System (``MACRS'') apply with (1) an applicable      recovery period of 20 years or less, (2) computer software      other than computer software covered by section 197, (3)      water utility property (as defined in section 168(e)(5)), (4)      certain leasehold improvement property, or (5) certain      nonresidential real property and residential rental property.      Second, substantially all of the use of such property must be      in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and in the active conduct of a      trade or business by the taxpayer in the Gulf Opportunity      Zone. Third, the original use of the property in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone must commence with the taxpayer on or after      August 28, 2005. (Thus, used property may constitute      qualified property so long as it has not previously been used      within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. In addition, it is intended      that additional capital expenditures incurred to recondition      or rebuild property the original use of which in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone began with the taxpayer would satisfy the      ``original use'' requirement. See Treasury Regulation sec.      1.48-2 Example 5.) Finally, the property must be acquired by      purchase (as defined under section 179(d)) by the taxpayer on      or after August 28, 2005 and placed in service on or before      December 31, 2007. For qualifying nonresidential real      property and residential rental property, the property must      be placed in service on or before December 31, 2008, in lieu      of December 31, 2007. Property does not qualify if a binding      written contract for the acquisition of such property was in      effect before August 28, 2005. However, property is not      precluded from qualifying for the additional first-year      depreciation merely because a binding written contract to      acquire a component of the property is in effect prior to      August 28, 2005.       Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by      the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer qualifies if the      taxpayer begins the manufacture, construction, or production      of the property on or after August 28, 2005, and the property      is placed in service on or before December 31, 2007 (and all      other requirements are met). In the case of qualified      nonresidential real property and residential rental property,      the property must be placed in service on or before December      31, 2008. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or      produced for the taxpayer by another person under a contract      that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction,      or production of the property is considered to be      manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer.       Under a special rule, property any portion of which is      financed with the proceeds of a tax-exempt obligation under      section 103 is not eligible for the additional first-year      depreciation deduction. Recapture rules apply under the      provision if the property ceases to be qualified Gulf      Opportunity Zone property.                             Effective Date       The provision applies to property placed in service on or      after August 28, 2005, in taxable years ending on or after      such date.     6. Increase in expensing for Gulf Opportunity Zone property          (new sec. 1400N(e) of the Code)                              Present Law       In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a sufficiently      small amount of annual investment may elect to deduct (or      ``expense'') such costs. Present law provides that the      maximum amount a taxpayer may expense, for taxable years      beginning in 2003 through 2007, is $100,000 of the cost of      qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year.      Additional section 179 incentives are provided with respect      to a qualified property used by a business in the New York      Liberty Zone (sec. 1400L(f)), an empowerment zone (sec.      1397A), or a renewal community (sec. 1400J). In general,      qualifying property is defined as depreciable tangible      personal property that is purchased for use in the active      conduct of a trade or business. Off-the-shelf computer      software placed in service in taxable years beginning before      2008 is treated as qualifying property. The $100,000 amount      is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the      cost of qualifying property placed in service during the      taxable year exceeds $400,000. The $100,000 and $400,000      amounts are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning      after 2003 and before 2008.       For taxable years beginning in 2008 and thereafter, a      taxpayer with a sufficiently small amount of annual      investment may elect to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of      qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year.      The $25,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the      amount by which the cost of qualifying property placed in      service during the taxable year exceeds $200,000.       The amount eligible to be expensed for a taxable year may      not exceed the taxable income for a taxable year that is      derived from the active conduct of a trade or business      (determined without regard to this provision). Any amount      that is not allowed as a deduction because of the taxable      income limitation may be carried forward to succeeding      taxable years (subject to similar limitations). No general      business credit under section 38 is allowed with respect to      any amount for which a deduction is allowed under section      179.       An expensing election is made under rules prescribed by the      Secretary (sec. 179(c)(1)). Under Treas. Reg. sec. 179-5,      applicable to property placed in service in taxable years      beginning after 2002 and before 2008, a taxpayer is permitted      to make or revoke an election under section 179 without the      consent of the Commissioner on an amended Federal tax return      for that taxable year. This amended return must be filed      within the time prescribed by law for filing an amended      return for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning in      2008 and thereafter, an expensing election may be revoked      only with consent of the Commissioner (sec. 179(c)(2)).                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, the $100,000 maximum amount that a      taxpayer may elect to deduct under section 179 is increased      by the lesser of $100,000, or the cost of qualified section      179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property for the taxable year. The      provision applies with respect to qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property acquired on or after August 28,      2005, and placed in service on or before December 31, 2007.      Thus, in addition to the $100,000 maximum cost of any section      179 property (including property that also meets the      definition of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone      property) that may be deducted under present law, a taxpayer      may elect to deduct a maximum $100,000 additional amount of      the taxpayer's cost of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity      Zone property, resulting in a maximum deductible amount of      $200,000 of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone      property. (The $100,000 present-law portion of this amount is      indexed for taxable years beginning after 2003 and before      2008, so the total may be higher than $200,000 after      taking indexation of this portion into account.) The      $100,000 additional amount for the cost of qualified      section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property is not indexed.       The provision provides a special rule for the reduction in      the $200,000 maximum deduction for the cost of qualified      section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property. Under this rule,      the $200,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the      amount by which the cost of qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property placed in service during the      taxable year exceeds a dollar cap of up to $1 million. (The      $400,000 present-law portion of this amount is indexed for      taxable years beginning after 2003 and before 2008, so the      total may be higher than $1 million after taking indexation      of this portion into account.) The dollar cap is computed by      increasing the $400,000 present-law amount by the lesser of      (1) $600,000, or (2) the cost of qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property placed in service during the      taxable year. The $600,000 amount is not indexed.       The operation of the reduction may be illustrated as      follows. In each of the following examples, assume that the      taxable income limitation of section 179(b)(3)(A) does not      cause a reduction in the amount that may be expensed for the      taxable year. For example, assume that in the taxable year, a      taxpayer's cost of section 179 property that is qualified      Gulf Opportunity Zone property is $800,000, and in that year      the taxpayer acquires no other section 179 property. Under      the provision, the taxpayer's deductible amount is increased      by $100,000 to $200,000 (the lesser of $100,000 and cost of      the taxpayer's qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone      property). Under the provision, the $400,000 phase-out amount      in section 179(b)(2) is increased by $600,000 (i.e., the      lesser of $600,000 or the $800,000 cost of qualified section      179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property), so that the phase-out      amount is $1 million. The taxpayer's cost of section 179      property is $800,000 in total (less than the $1 million      phase-out amount), so no reduction is made in the $200,000      amount of qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone     property that may be deducted under section 179 for the      taxable year. As another example, assume for the taxable year      that a taxpayer's cost of section 179 property that is      qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property is $200,000, and its      cost of other section 179 property is $450,000. Under the      provision, the $400,000 phase-out amount in section 179(b)(2)      is increased to $600,000 by the $200,000 cost of qualified      section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property. The taxpayer had      a total $650,000 cost of section 179 property for the taxable      year. The taxpayer's section 179 deduction is reduced by the      $50,000 difference between $650,000 and $600,000. Thus, under      the provision, the taxpayer may deduct $150,000 ($200,000      less $50,000) under section 179 for the taxable year.       Qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property means      section 179 property (as defined in section 179(d) of present      law) that also meets the requirements to qualify for Gulf      Opportunity Zone bonus depreciation. Specifically, for      section 179 purposes, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone      property is property (1) described in section      168(k)(2)(A)(i), (2) substantially all of the use of which is      in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and is in the active conduct of      a trade or business by the taxpayer in that Zone, (3) the      original use of which commences with the taxpayer on or after      August 28, 2005, (4) which is acquired by the taxpayer by      purchase on or after August 28, 2005, but only if no written      binding contract for the acquisition was in effect before      August 28, 2005, and (5) which is placed in service by the      taxpayer on or before December 31, 2007. Such property does      not include alternative depreciation property, tax-exempt      bond-financed property, or qualified revitalization      buildings.       The provision includes rules coordinating increased section      179 amounts provided under the bill with present-law      expensing rules with respect to enterprise zone businesses in      empowerment zones and with respect to renewal communities.      For purposes of those rules, qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property is not treated as qualified zone      property or qualified renewal property, unless the taxpayer      elects not to take such qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property into account for purposes of this      provision. Thus, a taxpayer acquiring property that could      qualify as either qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone      property, or qualified zone property or qualified renewal      property, may elect the additional expensing provided either      under this provision, or under the empowerment zone or      renewal community rules, but not both, with respect to the      property.       Recapture rules apply under the provision if recapture      applies under section 179(d)(10) or if the property ceases to      be qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005, for qualified section 179 Gulf      Opportunity Zone property acquired after August 27, 2005, and      placed in service on or before December 31, 2007.     7. Expensing for certain demolition and clean-up costs (new          sec. 1400N(f) of the Code)                              Present Law       Under present law, the cost of demolition of a structure is      capitalized into the taxpayer's basis in the land on which      the structure is located. (Sec. 280B). Land is not subject to      an allowance for depreciation or amortization.       The treatment of the cost of debris removal depends on the      nature of the costs incurred. For example, the cost of debris      removal after a storm may in some cases constitute an      ordinary and necessary business expense which is deductible      in the year paid or incurred. In other cases, debris removal      costs may be in the nature of replacement of part of the      property that was damaged. In such cases, the costs are      capitalized and added to the taxpayer's basis in the      property. For example, Revenue Ruling 71-161, 1971-1 C.B. 76,      permits the use of clean-up costs as a measure of casualty      loss but requires that such costs be added to the post-     casualty basis of the property.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, a taxpayer is permitted a deduction      for 50 percent of any qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone clean-     up cost paid or incurred on or after August 28, 2005, and      before January 1, 2008. The remaining 50 percent is      capitalized as under present law.       A qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone clean-up cost is an      amount paid or incurred for the removal of debris from, or      the demolition of structures on, real property located in the      Gulf Opportunity Zone to the extent that the amount would      otherwise be capitalized. In order to qualify, the      property must be held for use in a trade or business, for      the production of income, or as inventory.                             Effective Date       The provision applies to costs paid or incurred on or after      August 28, 2005 in taxable years ending on or after such      date.     8. Extension of expensing for environmental remediation costs          (new sec. 1400N(g) of the Code)                              Present Law       Taxpayers may elect to deduct (or ``expense'') certain      environmental remediation expenditures that would otherwise      be chargeable to capital account, in the year paid or      incurred (sec. 198). The deduction applies for both regular      and alternative minimum tax purposes. The expenditure must be      incurred in connection with the abatement or control of      hazardous substances at a qualified contaminated site.       A ``qualified contaminated site'' generally is any property      that (1) is held for use in a trade or business, for the      production of income, or as inventory and (2) is at a site on      which there has been a release (or threat of release) or      disposal of certain hazardous substances as certified by the      appropriate State environmental agency (so-called      ``brownfields'').       Section 198(d)(1) defines a ``hazardous substance'' as a      substance which is so defined in section 101(14) of the      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and      Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA''), and any substance which      is administratively designated as a hazardous substance under      section 102 of CERCLA. Under section 198(d)(2), however, the      term ``hazardous substance'' does not include any substance      with respect to which a removal or remediation is not      permitted under section 104 of CERCLA by reason of subsection      (a)(3) thereof, which exempts from the scope of such      provision ``the release or threat of release (A) of a      naturally occurring substance in its unaltered form, or      altered solely through naturally occurring processes or      phenomena, from a location where it is naturally found; (B)      from products which are part of the structure of, and result      in exposure within, residential buildings or business or      community structures; or (C) into public or private drinking      water supplies due to deterioration of the system through      ordinary use.'' However, sites which are identified on the      national priorities list under CERCLA cannot qualify for      expensing under section 198.       Petroleum products generally are not regarded as hazardous      substances for purposes of section 198. Section 101(14) of      CERCLA specifically excludes ``petroleum, including crude oil      or any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically      listed or designated as a hazardous substance under      subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph,'' from the      definition of ``hazardous substance.''       Under present law, eligible expenditures are those paid or      incurred before January 1, 2006.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends the present-law expensing provision      for two years (through December 31, 2007) for qualified      contaminated sites located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.       In addition, under the provision, petroleum products are      treated as hazardous substances for purposes of applying the      expensing provision (as extended) within the Gulf Opportunity      Zone. Petroleum products are defined by reference to section      4612(a)(3), and include crude oil, crude oil condensates and      natural gasoline. Thus, for example, the release of crude oil      upon property held for use in a trade or business in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone results in such property being treated as a      qualified contaminated site. The present law exceptions for      sites on the national priorities list under CERCLA, and for      substances with respect to which a removal or remediation is      not permitted under section 104 of CERCLA by reason of      subsection (a)(3) thereof, would continue to apply to all      hazardous substances (including petroleum products).       Expenditures paid or incurred to abate the contamination on      or after August 28, 2005 and before December 31, 2007, would      be eligible for expensing.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005.     9. Increase in rehabilitation tax credit with respect to          certain buildings located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone          (new sec. 1400N(h) of the Code)                              Present Law       Present law provides a two-tier tax credit for      rehabilitation expenditures.       A 20-percent credit is provided for qualified      rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified      historic structure. For this purpose, a certified historic      structure means any building that is listed in the National      Register, or that is located in a registered historic      district and is certified by the Secretary of the Interior to      the Secretary of the Treasury as being of historic      significance to the district.       A 10-percent credit is provided for qualified      rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a qualified      rehabilitated building, which generally means a building that      was first placed in service before 1936. The pre-1936      building must meet requirements with respect to retention of      existing external walls and internal structural framework of      the building in order for expenditures with respect to it to      qualify for the 10-percent credit. A building is treated as      having met the substantial rehabilitation requirement under      the 10-percent credit only if the rehabilitation expenditures      during the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer and      ending within the taxable year exceed the greater of (1) the      adjusted basis of the building (and its structural      components), or (2) $5,000.       The provision requires the use of straight-line      depreciation or the alternative depreciation system in order      for rehabilitation expenditures to be treated as qualified      under the provision.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision increases from 20 to 26 percent, and from 10      to 13 percent, respectively,     the credit under section 47 with respect to any certified      historic structure or qualified rehabilitated building      located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, provided the qualified      rehabilitation expenditures with respect to such buildings or      structures are incurred on or after August 28, 2005, and      before January 1, 2009.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for expenditures incurred on or      after August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2009, for      taxable years ending on or after August 28, 2005.     10. Increased expensing for reforestation expenditures of          small timber producers (new sec. 1400N(i)(1) of the Code)                              Present Law       Present law permits a taxpayer to elect to deduct (or      ``expense'') a limited amount of certain reforestation      expenditures that would otherwise be required to be      capitalized, in the year paid or incurred (sec. 194(b)). No      more than $10,000 of reforestation expenditures made by a      taxpayer in any year can qualify for expensing with respect      to each qualified timber property. The limit is reduced to      $5,000 per qualified timber property for married taxpayers      filing separate returns.       All members of a controlled group of corporations are      treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the $10,000      limit. A controlled group of corporations for purposes of      section 194 is defined as under section 1563(a), except that      the 80-percent ownership requirement is reduced to a more      than 50-percent requirement. If a partnership or S      corporation incurs reforestation expenditures, the $10,000      limit applies separately to the partnership or S corporation      and to each partner or shareholder. For an estate with      reforestation expenditures, the $10,000 limit is apportioned      between the estate and its beneficiaries. Section 194(b) does      not apply to trusts.       Reforestation expenditures include direct costs incurred in      connection with forestation or reforestation by planting or      artificial or natural seeding, including costs for site      preparation, seeds and seeding, labor and tools, and      depreciation on equipment used in planting or seeding.      Qualified timber property means a woodlot or other site      located in the United States which will contain trees in      significant commercial quantities and which is held by the      taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring for, and      cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial production      of timber products (sec. 194(c)(1)).       If a taxpayer's otherwise qualifying reforestation      expenditures exceed the amount permitted to be expensed under      section 194, the remaining expenditures are amortized, and      the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction with respect to the      amortization of the amortizable basis (sec. 194(a)).      Reforestation expenditures qualifying for amortization are      deducted in 84 equal monthly installments starting with the      seventh month of the taxable year during which the      expenditures are paid or incurred. Only reforestation      expenditures that would otherwise be included in the basis of      qualified timber property qualify for expensing and, with      respect to amounts in excess of the $10,000 limit, for      amortization (however, costs that could be deducted in the      absence of section 194 are not required to be amortized).                        Explanation of Provision       The provision doubles, for certain taxpayers, the present-     law expensing limit for reforestation expenditures paid or      incurred by such taxpayers (i) during the period after on or      August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect to      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Gulf Opportunity Zone, (ii) during the period on or after      September 23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect      to qualified timber property any portion of which is located      in the Rita Zone and no portion of which is located in the      Gulf Opportunity Zone, and (iii) during the period on or      after October 23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with      respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is      located in the Wilma Zone. The amount by which the expensing      limit is increased, however, is limited to the amount of      reforestation expenditures paid or incurred during the      relevant portion of the taxable year.       For example, suppose an otherwise eligible calendar-year      taxpayer incurred $20,000 of reforestation expenditures in      June, 2005 (i.e., prior to the relevant period), and incurs      an additional $5,000 of reforestation expenditures in      October, 2005, in the Gulf Opportunity Zone; the taxpayer      would be permitted to expense $15,000 of the expenditures      (because the increase in the expensing limit is limited to      the $5,000 of expenditures paid or incurred during the      relevant period within the taxable year) and could amortize      the remaining $10,000 under section 194(a). By contrast, if      the taxpayer had incurred $5,000 of reforestation      expenditures in June, 2005, and incurs an additional $20,000      of reforestation expenditures in October, 2005, then the      taxpayer would be permitted to expense $20,000 of the      expenditures, and could amortize the remaining $5,000 under      section 194(a).       The provision applies to taxpayers with aggregate holdings      of qualified timber property which do not exceed 500 acres at      any time during the taxable year. ``Qualified timber      property'' is defined by section 194(c)(1) as ``a woodlot or      other site located in the United States which will contain      trees in significant commercial quantities and which is held      by the taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring for,      and cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial      production of timber products.''       The provision does not apply to any taxpayer which is a      corporation the stock of which is publicly traded on an      established securities market, or which is a real estate      investment trust.                             Effective Date       The proposal is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005, (i) for expenditures paid or incurred      on or after August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with      respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is      located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, (ii) for expenditures      paid or incurred on or after September 23, 2005, and before      January 1, 2008, with respect to qualified timber property      any portion of which is located in the Rita Zone and no      portion of which located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, and      (iii) for expenditures paid or incurred on or after October      23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect to      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Wilma Zone.     11. Five-year NOL carryback of certain timber losses (new          sec. 1400N(i)(2) of the Code)                              Present Law       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by      which a taxpayer's business deductions exceed the taxpayer's      gross income. In general, an NOL may be carried back two      years and carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in      these years (sec. 172). NOLs generally are first applied to      the earliest of the taxable years to which the loss may be      carried (sec. 172(b)(2)).       In the case of an NOL arising from a farming loss, the NOL      can be carried back five years. A ``farming loss'' is defined      as the amount of any net operating loss attributable to a      farming business as defined in section 263A(e)(4). Under      section 263A(e)(4), a farming business includes the trade or      business of farming, as well as the trade or business of      operating a nursery or sod farm, or the raising or harvesting      of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental      trees. It does not include the planting, cultivating, caring      for, holding or cutting of trees for sale or use in the      commercial production of timber products.       A farming loss cannot exceed the taxpayer's NOL for the      taxable year. In calculating the amount of a taxpayer's NOL      carrybacks, the portion of the NOL that is attributable to a      farming loss is treated as a separate NOL and is taken into      account after the remaining portion of the NOL for the      taxable year.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, for purposes of determining the      farming loss (if any) of certain taxpayers, income and loss      is treated as attributable to a farming business if such      income and loss is attributable to qualified timber property      any portion of which is located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone      or in the Rita GO Zone, and if such income and loss is      allocable to that portion of the taxpayer's taxable year      which is (i) on or after August 28, 2005 (for qualified      timber property any portion of which is located in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone), on or after September 23, 2005 (for      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Rita GO Zone and no portion of which is located in the      Gulf Opportunity Zone), or on or after October 23, 2005 (for      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Wilma Zone) and (ii) before January 1, 2007. ``Qualified      timber property'' is defined by section 194(c)(1) as ``a      woodlot or other site located in the United States which will      contain trees in significant commercial quantities and which      is held by the taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring      for, and cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial      production of timber products.''       The provision applies to taxpayers with aggregate holdings      of qualified timber property which do not exceed 500 acres at      any time during the taxable year. Further, the provision only      applies (i) with respect to qualified timber property any      portion of which is located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, if      the taxpayer held such property on August 28, 2005, (ii) with      respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is      located in the Rita GO Zone and no portion of which is      located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, if the taxpayer held      such property on September 23, 2005, and (iii) with respect      to qualified timber property any portion of which is located      in the Wilma Zone, if the taxpayer held such property on      October 23, 2005.       The provision does not apply to any taxpayer which is a      corporation the stock of which is publicly traded on an      established securities market, or which is a real estate      investment trust.                             Effective Date       The proposal is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005, with respect to income and loss which      is allocable to that portion of the taxpayer's taxable year      which is (i) on or after August 28, 2005 (for qualified      timber property any portion of which is located in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone), on or after September 23, 2005 (for      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Rita Zone and no portion of which is located in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone), or on or after October 23, 2005 (for      qualified timber property any portion of which is located in      the Wilma Zone) and (ii) before January 1, 2007.     12. Special rule for Gulf Opportunity Zone public utility          casualty losses (new sec. 1400N(j) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by      which a taxpayer's allowable deductions exceed the taxpayer's      gross income. A carryback of an NOL generally results in the      refund of Federal income tax for the carryback year. A      carryover of an NOL reduces Federal income tax for the      carryover year.       In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and      carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years.      NOLs generally are first applied to the earliest of the      taxable years to which the loss may be carried.     Exceptions to the general rule       Different rules apply with respect to NOLs arising in      certain circumstances. For example, a three-year carryback      applies with respect to NOLs (1) arising from casualty or      theft losses of individuals, or (2) attributable to      Presidentially declared disasters for taxpayers engaged in a      farming business or a small business. A five-year carryback      period applies to NOLs from a farming loss (regardless of      whether the loss was incurred in a Presidentially declared      disaster area). Special rules also apply to real estate      investment trusts (no carryback), specified liability losses      (10-year carryback), and excess interest losses (no carryback      to any year preceding a corporate equity reduction      transaction).     Specified liability losses       The specified liability loss rules generally apply to      certain product liability losses and other liability losses.      The amount of the specified liability loss cannot exceed the      taxpayer's NOL for the taxable year. A specified liability      loss is treated as a separate NOL for the taxable year which      is eligible for a 10-year carryback period. Any remaining      portion of the taxpayer's NOL is subject to the general two-     year carryback period.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision provides an election for taxpayers to treat      any Gulf Opportunity Zone public utility casualty loss as a      specified liability loss to which the present-law 10-year      carryback period applies. A Gulf Opportunity Zone public      utility casualty loss is any casualty loss of public utility      property by reason of Hurricane Katrina which is allowed as a      deduction under section 165. The amount of the casualty loss      is reduced by the amount of any gain recognized by the      taxpayer from involuntary conversions of public utility      property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone caused by      Hurricane Katrina. The total amount of specified liability      loss, including any amount of public utility casualty loss      treated as such, is limited to the amount of the taxpayer's      overall NOL for the taxable year as under present law.      Taxpayers who elect the applicability of the proposed      provision with respect to any loss are not eligible to also      treat the loss as having occurred in any prior taxable year      under section 165(i), nor may they include the casualty loss      as part of the five-year NOL carryback provided under another      provision of the bill.       For purposes of the proposed provision, public utility      property is defined as in section 168(i)(10) to mean,      generally, property used predominantly in a rate-regulated      trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electrical      energy, water, or sewage disposal services; gas or steam      through a local distribution system; telephone services or      certain other communication services; or transportation of      gas or steam by pipeline.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for losses arising in taxable      years ending on or after August 28, 2005.     13. Five-year NOL carryback for certain amounts related to          Hurricane Katrina or the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new sec.          1400N(k) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by      which a taxpayer's allowable deductions exceed the taxpayer's      gross income. A carryback of an NOL generally results in the      refund of Federal income tax for the carryback year. A      carryover of an NOL reduces Federal income tax for the      carryover year.       In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and      carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years.      NOLs generally are first applied to the earliest of the      taxable years to which the loss may be carried.       Different rules apply with respect to NOLs arising in      certain circumstances. For example, a three-year carryback      applies with respect to NOLs (1) arising from casualty or      theft losses of individuals, or (2) attributable to      Presidentially declared disasters for taxpayers engaged in a      farming business or a small business. A five-year carryback      period applies to NOLs from a farming loss (regardless of      whether the loss was incurred in a Presidentially declared      disaster area). Special rules also apply to real estate      investment trusts (no carryback), specified liability losses      (10-year carryback), and excess interest losses (no carryback      to any year preceding a corporate equity reduction      transaction).       Separately, under section 165(i), a taxpayer who incurs a      loss attributable to a Presidentially declared disaster may      elect to take such loss into account for the taxable year      immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster      occurred. This rule applies regardless of whether the      taxpayer has an overall net operating loss for the relevant      taxable years.       The alternative minimum tax rules provide that a taxpayer's      NOL deduction cannot reduce the taxpayer's alternative      minimum taxable income (``AMTI'') by more than 90 percent of      the AMTI. However, an NOL deduction attributable to NOL      carrybacks arising in taxable years ending in 2001 and 2002,      as well as NOL carryforwards to these taxable years, offset      100 percent of a taxpayer's AMTI.                        Explanation of Provision     In general       The provision provides a special five-year carryback period      for NOLs to the extent of certain specified amounts related      to Hurricane Katrina or the Gulf Opportunity Zone. The amount      of the NOL which is eligible for the five year carryback      (``eligible NOL'') is limited to the aggregate amount of the      following deductions: (i) qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone      casualty losses; (ii) certain moving expenses; (iii) certain      temporary housing expenses; (iv) depreciation deductions with      respect to qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property for the      taxable year the property is placed in service; and (v)      deductions for certain repair expenses resulting from      Hurricane Katrina. The provision applies for losses paid or      incurred after August 27, 2005, and before January 1, 2008;      however, an irrevocable election not to apply the five-year      carryback under the provision may be made with respect to any      taxable year.     Qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone casualty losses       The amount of qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone casualty      losses which may be included in the eligible NOL is the      amount of the taxpayer's casualty losses with respect to (1)      property used in a trade or business, and (2) capital assets      held for more than one year in connection with either a trade      or business or a transaction entered into for profit. In      order for a casualty loss to qualify, the property must be      located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and the loss must be      attributable to Hurricane Katrina. As under present law, the      amount of any casualty loss includes only the amount not      compensated for by insurance or otherwise. In addition, the      total amount of the casualty loss which may be included in      the eligible NOL is reduced by the amount of any gain      recognized by the taxpayer from involuntary conversions of      property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone caused by      Hurricane Katrina.       To the extent that a casualty loss is included in the      eligible NOL and carried back under the provision, the      taxpayer is not eligible to also treat the loss as having      occurred in the prior taxable year under section 165(i).      Similarly, the five year carryback under the provision does      not apply to any loss taken into account for purposes of the      ten-year carryback of public utility casualty losses which is      provided under another provision in the bill.     Moving expenses       Certain employee moving expenses of an employer may be      included in the eligible NOL. In order to qualify, an amount      must be paid or incurred after August 27, 2005, and before      January 1, 2008 with respect to an employee who (i) lived in      the Gulf Opportunity Zone before August 28, 2005, (ii) was      displaced from their home either temporarily or permanently      as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and (iii) is employed in      the Gulf Opportunity Zone by the taxpayer after the expense      is paid or incurred.       For this purpose, moving expenses are defined as under      present law to include only the reasonable expenses of moving      household goods and personal effects from the former      residence to the new residence, and of traveling (including      lodging) from the former residence to the new place of      residence. However, for purposes of the provision, the former      residence and the new residence may be the same residence if      the employee initially vacated the residence as a result of      Hurricane Katrina. It is not necessary for the individual      with respect to whom the moving expenses are incurred to have      been an employee of the taxpayer at the time the expenses      were incurred. Thus, assuming the other requirements are met,      a taxpayer who pays the moving expenses of a prospective      employee and subsequently employs the individual in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone may include such expenses in the eligible      NOL.     Temporary housing expenses       Any deduction for expenses of an employer to temporarily      house employees who are employed in the Gulf Opportunity Zone      may be included in the eligible NOL. It is not necessary for      the temporary housing to be located in the Gulf Opportunity      Zone in order for such expenses to be included in the      eligible NOL; however, the employee's principal place of      employment with the taxpayer must be in Gulf Opportunity      Zone. So, for example, if a taxpayer temporarily houses an      employee at a location outside of the Gulf Opportunity Zone,      and the employee commutes into the Gulf Opportunity Zone to      the employee's principal place of employment, such temporary      housing costs will be included in the eligible NOL (assuming      all other requirements are met).     Depreciation of Gulf Opportunity Zone property       The eligible NOL includes the depreciation deduction (or      amortization deduction in lieu     of depreciation) with respect to qualified Gulf Opportunity      Zone property placed in service during the year. The special      carryback period applies to the entire allowable depreciation      deduction for such property for the year in which it is      placed in service, including both the regular depreciation      deduction and the additional first-year depreciation      deduction, if any. An election out of the additional first-     year depreciation deduction for Gulf Opportunity Zone      property does not preclude eligibility for the five-year      carryback.     Repair expenses       The eligible NOL includes deductions for repair expenses      (including the cost of removal of debris) with respect to      damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. For example, expenses      relating to the removal of mold and other contaminants from      property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone will be      included in the eligible NOL. In order to qualify, the amount      must be paid or incurred after August 27, 2005 and before      January 1, 2008, and the property must be located in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone.     Other rules       The amount of the NOL to which the five-year carryback      period applies is limited to the amount of the corporation's      overall NOL for the taxable year. Any remaining portion of      the taxpayer's NOL is subject to the general two-year      carryback period. Ordering rules similar to those for      specified liability losses apply to losses carried back under      the provision.       In addition, the general rule which limits a taxpayer's NOL      deduction to 90 percent of AMTI will not apply to any NOL to      which the five-year carryback period applies under the      provision. Instead, a taxpayer may apply such NOL carrybacks      to offset up to 100 percent of AMTI.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for losses arising in taxable      years ending on or after August 28, 2005.     14. Gulf Tax credit bonds (new sec. 1400N(l) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, gross income does not include interest      on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are      classified generally as either governmental bonds or private      activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are      primarily used to finance governmental functions or are      repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are      bonds with respect to which the State or local government      serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental      persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The      exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not      apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued      for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity      bonds'').       Generally, qualified private activity bonds are subject to      restrictions on the use of proceeds for the acquisition of      land and existing property, use of proceeds to finance      certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes,      other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling      facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay      costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees).      Certain types of qualified private activity bonds (e.g.,      small issue and redevelopment bonds) also are subject to      additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain      facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).      Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds      generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of      the property being financed and certain public approval      requirements (similar to requirements that typically apply      under State law to issuance of governmental debt) apply under      Federal law to issuance of private activity bonds.     Tax-credit bonds       As an alternative to traditional tax-exempt bonds, States      and local governments may issue tax-credit bonds for limited      purposes. Rather than receiving interest payments, a taxpayer      holding a tax-credit bond on an allowance date is entitled to      a credit. Generally, the credit amount is includible in gross      income (as if it were a taxable interest payment on the      bond), and the credit may be claimed against regular income      tax and alternative minimum tax liability. Two types of tax-     credit bonds may be issued under present law, ``qualified      zone academy bonds,'' which are bonds issued for the purpose      of renovating, providing equipment to, developing course      materials for use at, or training teachers and other      personnel at certain school facilities, and ``clean renewable      energy bonds,'' which are bonds issued to finance facilities      that would qualify for the tax credit under section 45      without regard to the placed in service date requirements of      that section.     Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more      tax-exempt bonds than is necessary for the activity being      financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for      the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage      restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment      of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits      may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined      ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose      of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g.,      ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds'').      Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during      these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the      Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less      restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision creates a new category of tax-credit bonds      that may be issued in calendar year 2006 by the States of      Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama (``Gulf Tax Credit      Bonds''). As with present law tax-credit bonds, the taxpayer      holding Gulf Tax Credit Bonds on the allowance date would be      entitled to a tax credit. The amount of the credit would be      determined by multiplying the bond's credit rate by the face      amount on the holder's bond. The credit would be includible      in gross income (as if it were an interest payment on the      bond) and could be claimed against regular income tax      liability and alternative minimum tax liability.       Under the provision, 95 percent or more of the proceeds of      Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must be used to (i) pay principal,      interest, or premium on a bond (other than a private activity      bond) that was outstanding on August 28, 2005, and was issued      by the State issuing the Gulf Tax Credit Bonds, or any      political subdivision thereof, or (ii) make a loan to any      political subdivision of such State to pay principal,      interest, or premium on a bond (other than a private activity      bond) issued by such political subdivision. In addition, the      issuer of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must provide additional funds      to pay principal, interest, or premium on outstanding bonds      equal to the amount of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds issued to repay      such outstanding bonds. Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must be a      general obligation of the issuing State and must be      designated by the Governor of such issuing State. The maximum      maturity on Gulf Tax Credit Bonds is two years. In addition,      present-law arbitrage rules that restrict the ability of      State and local governments to invest bond proceeds apply to      Gulf Tax Credit Bonds.       The maximum amount of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds that may be      issued pursuant to this provision is $200 million in the case      of Louisiana, $100 million in the case of Mississippi, and      $50 million in the case of Alabama. Gulf Tax Credit Bonds may      not be used to pay principal, interest, or premium on any      bond with respect to which there is any outstanding refunded      or refunding bond. Moreover, Gulf Tax Credit Bonds may not be      used to pay principal, interest, or premium on any prior bond      if the proceeds of such prior bond were used to provide any      property described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e., any private      or commercial golf course, country club, massage parlor, hot      tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other facility      used for gambling, or any store the principal purpose of      which is the sale alcoholic beverages for consumption off      premises).                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for bonds issued after December      31, 2005 and before January 1, 2007.     15. Additional allocation of new markets tax credit for          investments that serve the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new          sec. 1400N(m) of the Code)                              Present Law       Section 45D provides a new markets tax credit for qualified      equity investments made to acquire stock in a corporation, or      a capital interest in a partnership, that is a qualified      community development entity (``CDE''). The amount of the      credit allowable to the investor (either the original      purchaser or a subsequent holder) is (1) a five-percent      credit for the year in which the equity interest is purchased      from the CDE and for each of the following two years, and (2)      a six-percent credit for each of the following four years.      The credit is determined by applying the applicable      percentage (five or six percent) to the amount paid to the      CDE for the investment at its original issue, and is      available for a taxable year to the taxpayer who holds the      qualified equity investment on the date of the initial      investment or on the respective anniversary date that occurs      during the taxable year. The credit is recaptured if at any      time during the seven-year period that begins on the date of      the original issue of the investment the entity ceases to be      a qualified CDE, the proceeds of the investment cease to be      used as required, or the equity investment is redeemed.       A qualified CDE is any domestic corporation or partnership:      (1) whose primary mission is serving or providing investment      capital for low-income communities or low-income persons; (2)      that maintains accountability to residents of low-income      communities by their representation on any governing board of      or any advisory board to the CDE; and (3) that is certified      by the Secretary as being a qualified CDE. A qualified equity      investment means stock (other than nonqualified preferred      stock) in a corporation or a capital interest in a      partnership that is acquired directly from a CDE for cash,      and includes an investment of a subsequent purchaser if such      investment was a qualified equity investment in the hands of      the prior holder. Substantially all of the investment      proceeds must be used by the CDE to make qualified low-income      community investments. For this purpose, qualified low-income      community investments include: (1) capital or equity      investments in, or loans to, qualified active low-income      community businesses; (2) certain financial counseling and     other services to businesses and residents in low-     income communities; (3) the purchase from another CDE of      any loan made by such entity that is a qualified low-     income community investment; or (4) an equity investment      in, or loan to, another CDE.       A ``low-income community'' is a population census tract      with either (1) a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or (2)      median family income which does not exceed 80 percent of the      greater of metropolitan area median family income or      statewide median family income (for a non-metropolitan census      tract, does not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family      income). In the case of a population census tract located      within a high migration rural county, low-income is defined      by reference to 85 percent (rather than 80 percent) of      statewide median family income. For this purpose, a high      migration rural county is any county that, during the 20-year      period ending with the year in which the most recent census      was conducted, has a net out-migration of inhabitants from      the county of at least 10 percent of the population of the      county at the beginning of such period.       The Secretary has the authority to designate ``targeted      populations'' as low-income communities for purposes of the      new markets tax credit. For this purpose, a ``targeted      population'' is defined by reference to section 103(20) of      the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement      Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4702(20)) to mean individuals, or an      identifiable group of individuals, including an Indian tribe,      who (A) are low-income persons; or (B) otherwise lack      adequate access to loans or equity investments. Under such      Act, ``low-income'' means (1) for a targeted population      within a metropolitan area, less than 80 percent of the area      median family income; and (2) for a targeted population      within a non-metropolitan area, less than the greater of 80      percent of the area median family income or 80 percent of the      statewide non-metropolitan area median family income (12      U.S.C. 4702(17)). Under such Act, a targeted population is      not required to be within any census tract. In addition, a      population census tract with a population of less than 2,000      is treated as a low-income community for purposes of the      credit if such tract is within an empowerment zone, the      designation of which is in effect under section 1391, and is      contiguous to one or more low-income communities.       A qualified active low-income community business is defined      as a business that satisfies, with respect to a taxable year,      the following requirements: (1) at least 50 percent of the      total gross income of the business is derived from the active      conduct of trade or business activities in any low-income      community; (2) a substantial portion of the tangible property      of such business is used in a low-income community; (3) a      substantial portion of the services performed for such      business by its employees is performed in a low-income      community; and (4) less than five percent of the average of      the aggregate unadjusted bases of the property of such      business is attributable to certain financial property or to      certain collectibles.       The maximum annual amount of qualified equity investments      is capped at $2.0 billion per year for calendar years 2004      and 2005, and at $3.5 billion per year for calendar years      2006 and 2007.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision allows an additional allocation of the new      markets tax credit in an amount equal to $300,000,000 for      2005 and 2006, and $400,000,000 for 2007, to be allocated      among qualified CDEs to make qualified low-income community      investments within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. To qualify for      any such allocation, a qualified CDE must have as a      significant mission the recovery and redevelopment of the      Gulf Opportunity Zone. The carryover of any unused additional      allocation is applied separately from the carryover with      respect to allocations made under present law.                             Effective Date       The proposal is effective on the date of enactment.     16. Representations regarding income eligibility for purposes          of qualified residential rental project requirements (new          sec. 1400N(n) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, gross income does not include interest      on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are      classified generally as either governmental bonds or private      activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are      primarily used to finance governmental functions or are      repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are      bonds with respect to which the State or local government      serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental      persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The      exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not      apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued      for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity      bonds'').     Qualified private activity bonds       The definition of a qualified private activity bond      includes an exempt facility bond, or qualified mortgage,      veterans' mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, 501(c)(3), or      student loan bond. The definition of exempt facility bond      includes bonds issued to finance certain transportation      facilities (airports, ports, mass commuting, and high-speed      intercity rail facilities); qualified residential rental      projects; privately owned and/or operated utility facilities      (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district      heating and cooling facilities, certain private electric and      gas facilities, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/     private educational facilities; qualified green building and      sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface      freight transfer facilities.       Subject to certain requirements, qualified private activity      bonds may be issued to finance residential rental property or      owner-occupied housing. Residential rental property may be      financed with exempt facility bonds if the financed project      is a ``qualified residential rental project.'' A project is a      qualified residential rental project if 20 percent or more of      the residential units in such project are occupied by      individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median      gross income (the ``20-50 test''). Alternatively, a project      is a qualified residential rental project if 40 percent or      more of the residential units in such project are occupied by      individuals whose income is 60 percent or less of area median      gross income (the ``40-60 test''). The issuer must elect to      apply either the 20-50 test or the 40-60 test. Operators of      qualified residential rental projects must annually certify      that such project meets the requirements for      qualification, including meeting the 20-50 test or the 40-     60 test.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, the operator of a qualified      residential rental project may rely on the representations of      prospective tenants displaced by reason of Hurricane Katrina      for purposes of determining whether such individual satisfies      the income limitations for qualified residential rental      projects and, thus, the project is in compliance with the 20-     50 test or the 40-60 test. (For a description of      modifications to the 20-50 test and the 40-60 test for      qualified residential rental projects financed in the GO      Zone, see I.A.2. Tax-exempt financing for the Gulf      Opportunity Zone, above).       This rule only applies if the individual's tenancy begins      during the six-month period beginning on the date when such      individual was displaced by Hurricane Katrina.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     17. Treatment of public utility disaster losses (new sec.          1400N(o) of the Code)                              Present Law       Under section 165(i), certain losses attributable to a      disaster occurring in a Presidentially declared disaster area      may, at the election of the taxpayer, be taken into account      for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year      in which the disaster occurred.       Section 6411 provides a procedure under which taxpayers may      apply for tentative carryback and refund adjustments with      respect to net operating losses, net capital losses, and      unused business credits.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision provides an election for taxpayers who      incurred casualty losses attributable to Hurricane Katrina      with respect to public utility property located in the Gulf      Opportunity Zone. Under the election, such losses may be      taken into account in the fifth taxable year (rather than the      1st taxable year) immediately preceding the taxable year in      which the loss occurred. If the application of this provision      results in the creation or increase of a net operating loss      for the year in which the casualty loss is taken into      account, the net operating loss may be carried back or      carried over as under present law applicable to net operating      losses for such year.       For this purpose, public utility property is property used      predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or      sale of electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal      services; gas or steam through a local distribution system;      telephone services, or other communication services if      furnished or sold by the Communications Satellite Corporation      for purposes authorized by the Communications Satellite Act      of 1962; or transportation of gas or steam by pipeline. Such      property is eligible regardless of whether the taxpayer's      rates are established or approved by any regulatory body.       A taxpayer making the election under the provision is      eligible to file an application for a tentative carryback      adjustment of the tax for any prior taxable year affected by      the election. As under present law with respect to tentative      carryback and refund adjustments, the IRS generally has 90      days to act on the refund claim. Under the provision, the      statute of limitations with respect to such a claim can not      expire earlier than one year after the date of enactment.      Also, a taxpayer making the election with respect to a loss      is not entitled to interest with respect to any overpayment      attributable to the loss.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005.     18. Tax benefits not available with respect to certain          property (new sec. 1400N of the Code)                              Present Law       Under present law, specific tax benefits do not apply with      respect to certain types of property. For example, private      activity bonds are subject to restrictions on the use of      proceeds for the acquisition of land and existing property,      use of proceeds to finance     certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes,      other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling      facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay      costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees).      Small issue and redevelopment bonds also are subject to      additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain      facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).                        Explanation of Provision       The provisions relating to additional first-year      depreciation, increased expensing under section 179, and the      five-year carryback of NOLs attributable to casualty losses,      depreciation, or amortization otherwise provided under new      Code section 1400N do not apply with respect to certain      property. Specifically, the provisions do not apply with      respect to any private or commercial golf course, country      club, massage parlor, hot tub facility, suntan facility, or      any store the principal business of which is the sale of      alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises. The      provisions also do not apply with respect to any gambling or      animal racing property.       For this purpose, gambling or animal racing property      includes certain personal property and certain real property.      Personal property treated as gambling or animal racing      property is any equipment, furniture, software, or other      property used directly in connection with gambling, the      racing of animals, or the on-site (i.e., at the racetrack)      viewing of such racing. Real property treated as gambling or      animal racing property is the portion of any real property      (determined by square footage) that is dedicated to gambling,      the racing of animals, or the on-site viewing of such racing      (except if the portion so dedicated is less than 100 square      feet). For example, the additional first-year depreciation      for a building which is used as both a casino and a hotel      (and which otherwise qualifies for additional first-year      depreciation under the bill) is determined without regard to      the portion of the building's basis which bears the same      percentage to the total basis as the percentage of square      footage dedicated to gambling (i.e., the casino floor)      bears to total square footage of the building.       No apportionment calculation is required with respect to      real property which meets the 100-square-foot de minimis      exception. Thus, for example, no apportionment calculation is      required in the case of a retail store that sells lottery      tickets in a less-than-100-square-foot area, nor in the case      of an establishment that, while not a casino, contains a      small number of gaming machines and devices in an area or      areas whose aggregate size is less than 100 square feet.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or      after August 28, 2005, except that the inapplicability of the      five-year carryback of NOLs attributable to casualty losses,      depreciation, or amortization, is effective for losses      arising in such years.     19. Expansion of Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning          Credit for students in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new          sec. 1400O of the Code)                              Present Law     Hope credit       The Hope credit (sec. 25A) is a nonrefundable credit of up      to $1,500 per student per year for qualified tuition and      related expenses paid for the first two years of the      student's post-secondary education in a degree or certificate      program. The Hope credit rate is 100 percent on the first      $1,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses, and 50      percent on the next $1,000 of qualified tuition and related      expenses. The Hope credit that a taxpayer may otherwise claim      is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted      gross income between $43,000 and $53,000 ($87,000 and      $107,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return) for      2005. These adjusted gross income phase-out ranges are      indexed for inflation. Also, each of the $1,000 amounts of      qualified tuition and related expenses to which the 100-     percent credit rate and 50 percent credit rate apply are      indexed for inflation, with the amount rounded down to the      next lowest multiple of $100. The first adjustment to these      qualified expense amounts as a result of inflation is      expected in 2006. The Hope credit generally may not be      claimed against a taxpayer's alternative minimum tax      liability. However, the credit may be claimed against a      taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability for taxable      years beginning prior to January 1, 2006.       The qualified tuition and related expenses must be incurred      on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a      dependent of the taxpayer. The Hope credit is available with      respect to an individual student for two taxable years,      provided that the student has not completed the first two      years of post-secondary education before the beginning of the      second taxable year.       In addition, for each taxable year, a taxpayer may elect      either the Hope credit, the Lifetime Learning credit      (described below), or the deduction for qualified tuition and      related expenses (sec. 222) with respect to an eligible      student.       The Hope credit is available for ``qualified tuition and      related expenses,'' which include tuition and fees (excluding      nonacademic fees) required to be paid to an eligible      educational institution as a condition of enrollment or      attendance of an eligible student at the institution. Charges      and fees associated with meals, lodging, insurance,      transportation, and similar personal, living, or family      expenses are not eligible for the credit. The expenses of      education involving sports, games, or hobbies are not      qualified tuition and related expenses unless this education      is part of the student's degree program. Total qualified      tuition and related expenses are reduced by any scholarship      or fellowship grants excludable from gross income under      section 117 and any other tax-free educational benefits      received by the student (or the taxpayer claiming the credit)      during the taxable year. The Hope credit is not allowed with      respect to any education expense for which a deduction is      claimed under section 162 or any other section of the Code.       An eligible student for purposes of the Hope credit is an      individual who is enrolled in a degree, certificate, or other      program (including a program of study abroad approved for      credit by the institution at which such student is enrolled)      leading to a recognized educational credential at an eligible      educational institution. The student must pursue a course of      study on at least a half-time basis. A student is considered      to pursue a course of study on at least a half-time basis      if the student carries at least one half the normal full-     time work load for the course of study the student is      pursuing for at least one academic period that begins      during the taxable year. To be eligible for the Hope      credit, a student must not have been convicted of a      Federal or State felony consisting of the possession or      distribution of a controlled substance.       For taxable years beginning in 2004 and 2005, the Hope      credit offsets the alternative minimum tax. For taxable years      thereafter, the Hope credit does not offset the alternative      minimum tax.       Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,      2010, the changes to the Hope credit made by EGTRRA no longer      apply. The EGTRRA change scheduled to expire is the change      that permitted a taxpayer to claim a Hope credit in the same      year that he or she claimed an exclusion from an education      savings account. Thus, after 2010, a taxpayer cannot claim a      Hope credit in the same year he or she claims an exclusion      from an education savings account.     Lifetime Learning credit       Individual taxpayers are allowed to claim a nonrefundable      credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, equal to 20 percent of      qualified tuition and related expenses incurred during the      taxable year on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's      spouse, or any dependents (Sec. 25A). Up to $10,000 of      qualified tuition and related expenses per taxpayer return      are eligible for the Lifetime Learning credit (i.e., the      maximum credit per taxpayer return is $2,000). In contrast      with the Hope credit, the maximum credit amount is not      indexed for inflation. The Lifetime Learning credit generally      may not be claimed against a taxpayer's alternative minimum      tax liability. However, the credit may be claimed against a      taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability for taxable      years beginning prior to January 1, 2006.       In contrast to the Hope credit, a taxpayer may claim the      Lifetime Learning credit for an unlimited number of taxable      years. Also in contrast to the Hope credit, the maximum      amount of the Lifetime Learning credit that may be claimed on      a taxpayer's return will not vary based on the number of      students in the taxpayer's family--that is, the Hope credit      is computed on a per student basis, while the Lifetime      Learning credit is computed on a family-wide basis. The      Lifetime Learning credit amount that a taxpayer may otherwise      claim is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified      adjusted gross income between $43,000 and $53,000 ($87,000      and $107,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return) for      2005. These phaseout ranges are the same as those for the      Hope credit, and are similarly indexed for inflation.       A taxpayer may claim the Lifetime Learning credit for a      taxable year with respect to one or more students, even      though the taxpayer also claims a Hope credit for that same      taxable year with respect to other students. If, for a      taxable year, a taxpayer claims a Hope credit with respect to      a student, then the Lifetime Learning credit is not available      with respect to that same student for that year (although the      Lifetime Learning credit may be available with respect to      that same student for other taxable years). As with the Hope      credit, a taxpayer may not claim the Lifetime Learning credit      and also claim the section 222 deduction for qualified      tuition and related expenses (described below).       As with the Hope credit, the Lifetime Learning credit is      available for ``qualified tuition and related expenses,''      which include tuition and fees (excluding nonacademic fees)      required to be paid to an eligible educational institution as      a condition of enrollment or attendance of a student at the      institution. Eligible higher education institutions are      defined in the same manner for purposes of both the Hope and      Lifetime Learning credits. Charges and fees associated with      meals, lodging, insurance, transportation, and similar      personal, living or family expenses are not eligible for the      credit. The expenses of education involving sports, games, or      hobbies are not qualified tuition expenses unless this      education is part of the student's degree program, or the      education is undertaken to acquire or improve the job skills      of the student.       In contrast to the Hope credit, qualified tuition and      related expenses for purposes of the Lifetime Learning credit      include tuition and fees incurred with respect to      undergraduate or graduate-level courses (as explained above,      the Hope credit is available     only with respect to the first two years of a student's      undergraduate education). Additionally, in contrast to the      Hope credit, the eligibility of a student for the Lifetime      Learning credit does not depend on whether the student has      been convicted of a Federal or State felony consisting of the      possession or distribution of a controlled substance.       As under the Hope credit, total qualified tuition and fees      are reduced by any scholarship or fellowship grants      excludable from gross income under section 117 and any other      tax-free educational benefits received by the student during      the taxable year (such as employer-provided educational      assistance excludable under section 127). The Lifetime      Learning credit is not allowed with respect to any education      expense for which a deduction is claimed under section 162 or      any other section of the Code.       For taxable years beginning in 2004 and 2005, the Lifetime      Learning credit offsets the alternative minimum tax. For      taxable years thereafter, the credit does not offset the      alternative minimum tax.       Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,      2010, the changes to the Lifetime Learning credit made by      EGTRRA no longer apply. The EGTRRA change scheduled to expire      is the change that permitted a taxpayer to claim a Lifetime      Learning credit in the same year that he or she claimed an      exclusion from an education savings account. Thus, after      2010, taxpayers cannot claim a Lifetime Learning credit in      the same year he or she claims an exclusion from an education      savings account.     Definition of qualified higher education expenses for          purposes of qualified tuition programs       Present law provides favorable tax treatment for qualified      tuition programs that meet the requirements of section 529 of      the Code. For purposes of the rules relating to qualified      tuition programs, ``qualified higher education expenses''      means tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required      for the enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational      institution and expenses for special needs services in the      case of a special needs beneficiary which are incurred in      connection with such enrollment or attendance. In addition,      in the case of at least half-time students, qualified higher      education expenses include certain room and board expenses.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision temporarily expands the Hope and Lifetime      Learning credits for students attending (i.e., enrolled and      paying tuition at) an eligible education institution located      in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.       Under the provision, the Hope credit is increased to 100      percent of the first $2,000 in qualified tuition and related      expenses and 50 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified      tuition and related expenses for a maximum credit of $3,000      per student. The Lifetime Learning credit rate is increased      from 20 percent to 40 percent. The provision expands the      definition of qualified expenses to mean qualified higher      education expenses as defined under the rules relating to      qualified tuition programs, including certain room and board      expenses for at least half-time students.       The provision applies to taxable years beginning in 2005 or      2006.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     20. Housing relief for individuals affected by Hurricane          Katrina (new sec. 1400P of the Code)                              Present Law       Under present law, employer-provided housing is generally      includible in income as compensation and is wages for      purposes of social security and Medicare taxes and      unemployment tax (secs. 61, 3121(a), 3306(b)). Present law      provides an income and wage exclusion for the value of      lodging furnished to an employee, the employee's spouse, or      the employee's dependents by or on behalf of the employee's      employer, but generally only if the employee is required to      accept the lodging on the business premises of the employer      as a condition of employment (secs. 119, 3121(a)(19), and      3306(b)(14)). Reasonable expenses for employee compensation      are deductible by the employer (sec. 162(a)).                        Explanation of Provision       The provision provides a temporary income exclusion for the      value of in-kind lodging provided for a month to a qualified      employee (and the employee's spouse or dependents) by or on      behalf of a qualified employer. The amount of the exclusion      for any month for which lodging is furnished cannot exceed      $600. The exclusion does not apply for purposes of social      security and Medicare taxes or unemployment tax.       The provision also provides a temporary credit to a      qualified employer of 30 percent of the value of lodging      excluded from the income of a qualified employee under the      provision. The amount taken as a credit is not deductible by      the employer.       Qualified employee means, with respect to a month, an      individual who: (1) on August 28, 2005, had a principal      residence in the Gulf Opportunity (``GO'') Zone; and (2)      performs substantially all of his or her employment services      in the GO Zone for the qualified employer furnishing the      lodging. Qualified employer means any employer with a trade      or business located in the GO Zone.                             Effective Date       The provision applies to lodging provided during the period      beginning on the first day of the first month beginning after      the date of enactment and ending on the date that is six      months after such first day.     21. Special rules for mortgage revenue bonds (sec. 404 of the          Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005)                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, gross income does not include interest      on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are      classified generally as either governmental bonds or private      activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are      primarily used to finance governmental functions or are      repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are      bonds with respect to which the State or local government      serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental      persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The      exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not      apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued      for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity      bonds'') (secs. 103(b)(1) and 141).     Qualified mortgage bonds       The definition of a qualified private activity bond      includes a qualified mortgage bond (sec. 143). Qualified      mortgage bonds are issued to make mortgage loans to qualified      mortgagors for the purchase, improvement, or rehabilitation      of owner-occupied residences. The Code imposes several      limitations on qualified mortgage bonds, including income      limitations for eligible mortgagors, purchase price      limitations on the home financed with bond proceeds, and a      ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement. The income limitations      are satisfied if all financing provided by an issue is      provided for mortgagors whose family income does not exceed      115 percent of the median family income for the metropolitan      area or State, whichever is greater, in which the financed      residences are located. The purchase price limitations      provide that a residence financed with qualified mortgage      bonds may not have a purchase price in excess of 90 percent      of the average area purchase price for that residence. The      first-time homebuyer requirement provides qualified mortgage      bonds generally cannot be used to finance a mortgage for a      homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a principal      residence in the three years preceding the execution of the      mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement).       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to      targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one      located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70      percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or      less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of      chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the      income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of      the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits      and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors      whose family income is 140 percent or less of the      applicable median family income. The purchase price      limitation is raised from 90 percent to 110 percent of the      average area purchase price for targeted area residences.      In addition, the first-time homebuyer requirement does not      apply to targeted area residences.       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance      qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement      loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs,      and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such      alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect      or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the      property. Qualified home-improvement loans may not exceed      $15,000.       A temporary provision waived the first-time homebuyer      requirement for residences located in certain Presidentially      declared disaster areas (sec. 143(k)(11)). In addition,      residences located in such areas were treated as targeted      area residences for purposes of the income and purchase price      limitations. The special rule for residences located in      Presidentially declared disaster areas does not apply to      bonds issued after January 1, 1999.       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (``KETRA'') waives the      first-time homebuyer requirement with respect to certain      residences located in an area with respect to which a major      disaster has been declared by the President before September      14, 2005, under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford      Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by reason of      Hurricane Katrina (see sec. 404 of Pub. L. No. 109-73). The      waiver of the first-time homebuyer requirement does not apply      to financing provided after December 31, 2007. KETRA also      increases to $150,000 the permitted amount of a qualified      home-improvement loan with respect to residences located in      the Hurricane Katrina disaster area to the extent such loan      is for the repair of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.                        Explanation of Provision       The proposal extends the waiver of the first-time homebuyer      requirement provided by KETRA to financing provided through      December 31, 2010.       (For a description of additional mortgage revenue bond      rules applicable to the GO Zone, the Rita GO Zone and the      Wilma GO Zone, see II.H--Special Rules for Mortgage Revenue      Bonds, below)                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     22. Treasury authority to grant bonus depreciation placed-in-         service date relief (sec. 168(k) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       A taxpayer is allowed to recover, through annual      depreciation deductions, the cost of certain property used in      a trade or business or for the production of income. The      amount of the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to      tangible property for a taxable year is determined under the      modified accelerated cost recovery system (``MACRS''). Under      MACRS, different types of property generally are assigned      applicable recovery periods and depreciation methods. The      recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal      property range from three to 25 years. The depreciation      methods generally applicable to tangible personal property      are the 200-percent and 150-percent declining balance      methods, switching to the straight-line method for the      taxable year in which the depreciation deduction would be      maximized.     Additional first year depreciation deduction       Sec. 168(k) allows an additional first-year depreciation      deduction equal to 30 percent or 50 percent of the adjusted      basis of qualified property. In order for property to qualify      for the additional first-year depreciation deduction, it must      meet all of the following requirements. First, the property      must be (1) property to which MACRS applies with an      applicable recovery period of 20 years or less, (2) water      utility property (as defined in section 168(e)(5)), (3)      computer software other than computer software covered by      section 197, or (4) qualified leasehold improvement property      (as defined in section 168(k)(3)). Second, the original use      (the first use to which the property is put, whether or not      such use corresponds to the use of such property by the      taxpayer) of the property must commence with the taxpayer on      or after September 11, 2001. Third, the taxpayer must acquire      the property within the applicable time period. Finally, the      property must be placed in service before January 1, 2005.       An extension of the placed-in-service date of one year      (i.e., January 1, 2006) is provided for certain property with      a recovery period of ten years or longer and certain      transportation property. In order for property to qualify for      the extended placed-in-service date, the property must be      subject to section 263A and have an estimated production      period exceeding two years or an estimated production period      exceeding one year and a cost exceeding $1 million.      Transportation property is defined as tangible personal      property used in the trade or business of transporting      persons or property.       The applicable time period for acquired property is (1)      after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, but      only if no binding written contract for the acquisition is in      effect before September 11, 2001, or (2) pursuant to a      binding written contract which was entered into after      September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005. With respect      to property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by      the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer, the taxpayer must begin      the manufacture, construction, or production of the property      after September 10, 2001. For property eligible for the      extended placed-in-service date, a special rule limits the      amount of costs eligible for the additional first year      depreciation. With respect to such property, only the portion      of the basis that is properly attributable to the costs      incurred before January 1, 2005 (``progress      expenditures'') is eligible for the additional first-year      depreciation. For purposes of determining the amount of      eligible progress expenditures, rules similar to sec.      46(d)(3) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986      apply.       In addition, certain non-commercial aircraft can qualify      for the extended placed-inservice date. Qualifying aircraft      are eligible for the additional first-year depreciation      deduction if placed in service before January 1, 2006. In      order to qualify, the aircraft must:       1. be acquired by the taxpayer during the applicable time      period as under present law;       2. meet the appropriate placed-in-service date      requirements;       3. not be tangible personal property used in the trade or      business of transporting persons or property (except for      agricultural or firefighting purposes);       4. be purchased by a purchaser who, at the time of the      contract for purchase, has made a nonrefundable deposit of      the lesser of ten percent of the cost or $100,000; and       5. have an estimated production period exceeding four      months and a cost exceeding $200,000.       Aircraft qualifying under these rules are not subject to      the progress expenditures limitation.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision provides the Secretary with authority to      further extend the placed-inservice date (beyond December 31,      2005), on a case-by-case basis, for certain property eligible      for the December 31, 2005 placed-in-service date under      present law. The authority extends only to property placed in      service or manufactured in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, the      Rita GO Zone, or the Wilma GO Zone. In addition, the      authority extends only to circumstances in which the taxpayer      was unable to meet the December 31, 2005 deadline as a result      of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and/or Wilma. The extension      should be only for such additional time as is required as a      result of the hurricane(s) and in no case should extend the      deadline beyond December 31, 2006.                             Effective Date       The provision applies to property placed in service on or      after August 28, 2005, in taxable years ending on or after      such date.      TITLE II--TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO HURRICANES RITA AND WILMA   A. Special Rules for Use of Retirement Funds (new Code sec. 1400Q)     1. Tax-favored withdrawals from retirement plans relating to          Hurricanes Rita and Wilma                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, a distribution from a qualified      retirement plan under section 401(a), a qualified annuity      plan under section 403(a), a tax-sheltered annuity under      section 403(b) (a ``403(b) annuity''), an eligible deferred      compensation plan maintained by a State or local government      under section 457 (a ``governmental 457 plan''), or an      individual retirement arrangement under section 408 (an      ``IRA'') generally is included in income for the year      distributed (secs. 402(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408(d), and      457(a)). (These plans are referred to collectively as      ``eligible retirement plans''.) In addition, a distribution      from a qualified retirement or annuity plan, a 403(b)      annuity, or an IRA received before age 59\1/2\, death, or      disability generally is subject to a 10-percent early      withdrawal tax on the amount includible in income, unless an      exception applies (sec. 72(t)).       An eligible rollover distribution from a qualified      retirement or annuity plan, a 403(b) annuity, or a      governmental 457 plan, or a distribution from an IRA,      generally can be rolled over within 60 days to another plan,      annuity, or IRA. The IRS has the authority to waive the 60-     day requirement if failure to waive the requirement would be      against equity or good conscience, including cases of      casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable      control of the individual. Any amount rolled over is not      includible in income (and thus also not subject to the 10-     percent early withdrawal tax).       Distributions from a qualified retirement or annuity plan,      403(b) annuity, a governmental 457 plan, or an IRA are      generally subject to income tax withholding unless the      recipient elects otherwise. An eligible rollover distribution      from a qualified retirement or annuity plan, 403(b) annuity,      or governmental 457 plan is subject to income tax withholding      at a 20-percent rate unless the distribution is rolled over      to another plan, annuity or IRA by means of a direct      transfer.       Certain amounts held in a qualified retirement plan that      includes a qualified cash-or-deferred arrangement (a ``401(k)      plan'') or in a 403(b) annuity may not be distributed before      severance from employment, age 59\1/2\, death, disability, or      financial hardship of the employee. Amounts deferred under a      governmental 457 plan may not be distributed before severance      from employment, age 70\1/2\, or an unforeseeable emergency      of the employee.     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (Public Law      109-73) provides an exception to the 10-percent early      withdrawal tax in the case of a qualified Hurricane      Katrina distribution from a qualified retirement or      annuity plan, a 403(b) annuity, or an IRA. In addition, as      discussed more fully below, income attributable to a      qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution may be included      in income ratably over three years, and the amount of a      qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution may be      recontributed to an eligible retirement plan within three      years.       A qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is a      distribution from an eligible retirement plan made on or      after August 25, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, to an      individual whose principal place of abode on August 28, 2005,      is located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area and who has      sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Katrina.      The total amount of qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions      that an individual can receive from all plans, annuities, or      IRAs is $100,000. Thus, any distributions in excess of      $100,000 during the applicable period are not qualified      Hurricane Katrina distributions.       Any amount required to be included in income as a result of      a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is included in      income ratably over the three-year period beginning with the      year of distribution unless the individual elects not to have      ratable inclusion apply. Certain rules apply for purposes of      the ratable inclusion provision. For example, the amount      required to be included in income for any taxable year in the      three-year period cannot exceed the total amount to be      included in income with respect to the qualified Hurricane      Katrina distribution, reduced by amounts included in income      for preceding years in the period.       Any portion of a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution      may, at any time during the three-year period beginning the      day after the date on which the distribution was received, be      recontributed to an eligible retirement plan to which a      rollover can be made. Any amount recontributed within the      three-year period is treated as a rollover and thus is not      includible in income. For example, if an individual receives      a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution in 2005, that      amount is included in income, generally ratably over the year      of the distribution and the following two years, but is not      subject to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax. If, in 2007,      the amount of the qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is      recontributed to an eligible retirement plan, the individual      may     file an amended return (or returns) to claim a refund of the      tax attributable to the amount previously included in income.      In addition, if, under the ratable inclusion provision, a      portion of the distribution has not yet been included in      income at the time of the contribution, the remaining amount      is not includible in income.       A qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is a permissible      distribution from a 401(k) plan, 403(b) annuity, or      governmental 457 plan, regardless of whether a distribution      would otherwise be permissible. A plan is not treated as      violating any Code requirement merely because it treats a      distribution as a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution,      provided that the aggregate amount of such distributions from      plans maintained by the employer and members of the      employer's controlled group does not exceed $100,000. Thus, a      plan is not treated as violating any Code requirement merely      because an individual might receive total distributions in      excess of $100,000, taking into account distributions from      plans of other employers or IRAs.       Qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions are subject to      the income tax withholding rules applicable to distributions      other than eligible rollover distributions. Thus, 20-percent      mandatory withholding does not apply.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies and expands the relief provided      under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 in the      case of qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions to any      ``qualified hurricane distribution,'' which is defined to      include distributions relating to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma.      Under the provision, a qualified hurricane distribution      includes distributions that meet the definition of qualified      Hurricane Katrina distribution under the Katrina Emergency      Tax Relief Act of 2005, as well as any other distribution      from an eligible retirement plan made on or after September      23, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, to an individual whose      principal place of abode on September 23, 2005, is located in      the Hurricane Rita disaster area and who has sustained an      economic loss by reason of Hurricane Rita. A qualified      hurricane distribution also includes a distribution from an      eligible retirement plan made on or after October 23, 2005,      and before January 1, 2007, to an individual whose principal      place of abode on October 23, 2005, is located in the      Hurricane Wilma disaster area and who has sustained an      economic loss by reason of Hurricane Wilma.       The total amount of qualified hurricane distributions that      an individual can receive from all plans, annuities, or IRAs      is $100,000.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     2. Recontributions of withdrawals for home purchases          cancelled due to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, a distribution from a qualified      retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity (a ``403(b)      annuity''), or an individual retirement arrangement (an      ``IRA'') generally is included in income for the year      distributed (secs. 402(a), 403(b), and 408(d)). In addition,      a distribution from a qualified retirement plan, a 403(b)      annuity, or an IRA received before age 59\1/2\, death, or      disability generally is subject to a 10-percent early      withdrawal tax on the amount includible in income, unless an      exception applies (sec. 72(t)). An exception to the 10-     percent tax applies in the case of a qualified first-time      homebuyer distribution from an IRA, i.e., a distribution (not      to exceed $10,000) used within 120 days for the purchase or      construction of a principal residence of a first-time      homebuyer.       An eligible rollover distribution from a qualified      retirement plan or a 403(b) annuity or a distribution from an      IRA generally can be rolled over within 60 days to another      plan, annuity, or IRA. The IRS has the authority to waive the      60-day requirement if failure to waive the requirement would      be against equity or good conscience, including cases of      casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable      control of the individual. Any amount rolled over is not      includible in income (and thus also not subject to the 10-     percent early withdrawal tax).       Certain amounts held in a qualified retirement plan that      includes a qualified cash-or-deferred arrangement (a ``401(k)      plan'') or a 403(b) annuity may not be distributed before      severance from employment, age 59\1/2\, death, disability, or      financial hardship of the employee. For this purpose, subject      to certain conditions, distributions for costs directly      related to the purchase of a principal residence by an      employee (excluding mortgage payments) are deemed to be      distributions on account of financial hardship.     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 generally      provides that a distribution received from a 401(k) plan,      403(b) annuity, or IRA in order to purchase a home in the      Hurricane Katrina disaster area may be recontributed to such      a plan, annuity, or IRA in certain circumstances.       The ability to recontribute applies to an individual who      receives a qualified distribution. A qualified distribution      is a hardship distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b)      annuity, or a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution      from an IRA: (1) that is received after February 28, 2005,      and before August 29, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to      purchase or construct a principal residence in the Hurricane      Katrina disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or      constructed on account of Hurricane Katrina.       Any portion of a qualified distribution may, during the      period beginning on August 25, 2005, and ending on February      28, 2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which      a rollover is permitted. Any amount recontributed is treated      as a rollover. Thus, that portion of the qualified      distribution is not includible in income (and also is not      subject to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax).                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies and expands the provision under the      Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 allowing      recontribution of certain distributions from a 401(k) plan,      403(b) annuity, or IRA to qualified Hurricane Rita      distributions and to qualified Hurricane Wilma distributions.       A qualified Hurricane Rita distribution is a hardship      distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b) annuity, or a      qualified first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA: (1)      that is received after February 28, 2005, and before      September 24, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to purchase      or construct a principal residence in the Hurricane Rita      disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or      constructed on account of Hurricane Rita. Any portion of a      qualified Hurricane Rita distribution may, during the period      beginning on September 23, 2005, and ending on February 28,      2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which a      rollover is permitted.       A qualified Hurricane Wilma distribution is a hardship      distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b) annuity, or a      qualified first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA: (1)      that is received after February 28, 2005, and before October      24, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to purchase or      construct a principal residence in the Hurricane Wilma      disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or      constructed on account of Hurricane Wilma. Any portion of a      qualified Hurricane Wilma distribution may, during the period      beginning on October 23, 2005, and ending on February 28,      2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which a      rollover is permitted.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     3. Loans from qualified plans to individuals sustaining an          economic loss due to Hurricane Rita or Wilma                              Present Law     In general       An individual is permitted to borrow from a qualified plan      in which the individual participates (and to use his or her      accrued benefit as security for the loan) provided the loan      bears a reasonable rate of interest, is adequately secured,      provides a reasonable repayment schedule, and is not made      available on a basis that discriminates in favor of employees      who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated.       Subject to certain exceptions, a loan from a qualified      employer plan to a plan participant is treated as a taxable      distribution of plan benefits. A qualified employer plan      includes a qualified retirement plan under section 401(a), a      qualified annuity plan under section 403(a), a tax-deferred      annuity under section 403(b), and any plan that was (or was      determined to be) a qualified employer plan or a governmental      plan.       An exception to this general rule of income inclusion is      provided to the extent that the loan (when added to the      outstanding balance of all other loans to the participant      from all plans maintained by the employer) does not exceed      the lesser of (1) $50,000 reduced by the excess of the      highest outstanding balance of loans from such plans during      the one-year period ending on the day before the date the      loan is made over the outstanding balance of loans from the      plan on the date the loan is made or (2) the greater of      $10,000 or one half of the participant's accrued benefit      under the plan (sec. 72(p)). This exception applies only if      the loan is required, by its terms, to be repaid within five      years. An extended repayment period is permitted for the      purchase of the principal residence of the participant. Plan      loan repayments (principal and interest) must be amortized in      level payments and made not less frequently than quarterly,      over the term of the loan.     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 provides      special rules in the case of a loan from a qualified employer      plan to a qualified individual made after September 23, 2005,      and before January 1, 2007. A qualified individual is an      individual whose principal place of abode on August 28, 2005,      is located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area and who has      sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Katrina.       The exception to the general rule of income inclusion is      provided to the extent that the loan (when added to the      outstanding balance of all other loans to the participant      from all plans maintained by the employer) does not exceed      the lesser of (1) $100,000 reduced by the excess of the      highest outstanding balance of loans from such plans      during the one-year period ending on the day before the      date the loan is made over the outstanding balance of      loans from the plan on the date the loan is made or (2)      the greater of $10,000 or the participant's accrued      benefit under the plan.       In the case of a qualified individual with an outstanding      loan on or after August 25,     2005, from a qualified employer plan, if the due date for any      repayment with respect to such loan occurs during the period      beginning on August 25, 2005, and ending on December 31,      2006, such due date is delayed for one year. Any subsequent      repayments with respect to such loan shall be appropriately      adjusted to reflect the delay in the due date and any      interest accruing during such delay. The period during which      required repayment is delayed is disregarded in complying      with the requirements that the loan be repaid within five      years and that level amortization payments be made.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies and expands the special rules for      loans from a qualified employer plan provided under the      Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 to loans from a      qualified employer plan to a qualified Hurricane Rita or      Hurricane Wilma individual made on or after the date of      enactment and before January 1, 2007.       A qualified Hurricane Rita individual includes an      individual whose principal place of abode on September 23,      2005, is located in a Hurricane Rita disaster area and who      has sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Rita.      In the case of a qualified Hurricane Rita individual with an      outstanding loan on or after September 23, 2005, from a      qualified employer plan, if the due date for any repayment      with respect to such loan occurs during the period beginning      on September 23, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2006, such      due date is delayed for one year.       A qualified Hurricane Wilma individual includes an      individual whose principal place of abode on October 23,      2005, is located in a Hurricane Wilma disaster area and who      has sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Wilma.      In the case of a qualified Hurricane Wilma individual with an      outstanding loan on or after October 23, 2005, from a      qualified employer plan, if the due date for any repayment      with respect to such loan occurs during the period beginning      on October 23, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2006, such      due date is delayed for one year.       An individual cannot be a qualified individual with respect      to more than one hurricane.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.     4. Plan amendments relating to Hurricane Rita and Hurricane          Wilma relief                              Present Law     In general       Present law provides a remedial amendment period during      which, under certain circumstances, a plan may be amended      retroactively in order to comply with the qualification      requirements (sec. 401(b)). In general, plan amendments to      reflect changes in the law generally must be made by the time      prescribed by law for filing the income tax return of the      employer for the employer's taxable year in which the change      in law occurs. The Secretary of the Treasury may extend the      time by which plan amendments need to be made.     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 permits      certain plan amendments made pursuant to the changes made by      the provisions of Title I of the Act, or regulations issued      thereunder, to be retroactively effective. If the plan      amendment meets the requirements of the Act, then the plan      will be treated as being operated in accordance with its      terms. In order for this treatment to apply, the plan      amendment is required to be made on or before the last day of      the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2007, or      such later date as provided by the Secretary of the Treasury.      Governmental plans are given an additional two years in which      to make required plan amendments. If the amendment is      required to be made to retain qualified status as a result of      the changes made by Title I of the Act (or regulations), the      amendment is required to be made retroactively effective as      of the date on which the change became effective with respect      to the plan, and the plan is required to be operated in      compliance until the amendment is made. Amendments that are      not required to retain qualified status but that are made      pursuant to the changes made by Title I of the Act (or      regulations) may be made retroactively effective as of the      first day the plan is operated in accordance with the      amendment. A plan amendment will not be considered to be      pursuant to changes made by Title I of the Act (or      regulations) if it has an effective date before the effective      date of the provision under the Act (or regulations) to which      it relates.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies and expands the ability to make      retroactive plan amendments under the Katrina Emergency Tax      Relief Act of 2005 to apply to changes made pursuant to new      section 1400Q of the Code, or regulations issued thereunder.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.   B. Employee Retention Credit for Employers Affected by Hurricanes           Katrina, Rita and Wilma (New sec. 1400R of the Code)                              Present Law       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 provides a      credit of 40 percent of the qualified wages (up to a maximum      of $6,000 in qualified wages per employee) paid by an      eligible employer to an eligible employee.       An eligible employer is any employer (1) that conducted an      active trade or business on August 28, 2005, in the core      disaster area and (2) with respect to which the trade or      business described in (1) is inoperable on any day after      August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2006, as a result of      damage sustained by reason of Hurricane Katrina. An eligible      employer shall not include any trade or business for any      taxable year if such trade or business employed an average of      more than 200 employees on business days during the taxable      year.       The term ``core disaster area'' means that portion of the      Hurricane Katrina disaster area determined by the President      to warrant individual or individual and public assistance      from the Federal Government under such Act. The term      ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area with      respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the      President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of the      Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance      Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.       An eligible employee is, with respect to an eligible      employer, an employee whose principal place of employment on      August 28, 2005, with such eligible employer was in a core      disaster area. An employee may not be treated as an eligible      employee for any period with respect to an employer if such      employer is allowed a credit under section 51 with respect to      the employee for the period.       Qualified wages are wages (as defined in section 51(c)(1)      of the Code, but without regard to section 3306(b)(2)(B) of      the Code) paid or incurred by an eligible employer with      respect to an eligible employee on any day after August 28,      2005, and before January 1, 2006, during the period (1)      beginning on the date on which the trade or business first      became inoperable at the principal place of employment of the      employee immediately before Hurricane Katrina, and (2) ending      on the date on which such trade or business has resumed      significant operations at such principal place of employment.      Qualified wages include wages paid without regard to whether      the employee performs no services, performs services at a      different place of employment than such principal place of      employment, or performs services at such principal place of      employment before significant operations have resumed.       The credit is a part of the current year business credit      under section 38(b) and therefore is subject to the tax      liability limitations of section 38(c). Rules similar to      sections 280C(a), 51(i)(1) and 52 apply to the credit.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies the employee retention credit      provisions that were enacted in the Katrina Emergency Tax      Relief Act of 2005, and eliminates the provision that      restricted the credit to employers of not more than 200      employees.       The provision extends the retention credit, as modified to      eliminate the employer size limitation, to employers affected      by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma and located in the Rita GO Zone      and Wilma GO Zone, respectively. The reference dates for      employers affected by Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma,      comparable to the August 28, 2005 date of present law for      employers affected by Hurricane Katrina, are September 23,      2005, and October 23, 2005, respectively.                             Effective Date       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency      Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on the date of enactment.      The provision that repeals the employer size limitation is,      with respect to the Hurricane Katrina retention credit,      effective as if included in the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief      Act of 2005. The retention credit is effective for wages paid      after September 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Rita and      after October 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Wilma.C. Temporary Suspension of Limitations on Charitable Contributions (New                        sec. 1400S(a) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       In general, an income tax deduction is permitted for      charitable contributions, subject to certain limitations that      depend on the type of taxpayer, the property contributed, and      the donee organization (sec. 170).       Charitable contributions of cash are deductible in the      amount contributed. In general, contributions of capital gain      property to a qualified charity are deductible at fair market      value with certain exceptions. Capital gain property means      any capital asset or property used in the taxpayer's trade or      business the sale of which at its fair market value, at the      time of contribution, would have resulted in gain that would      have been long-term capital gain. Contributions of other      appreciated property generally are deductible at the donor's      basis in the property. Contributions of depreciated property      generally are deductible at the fair market value of the      property.     Percentage limitations       Contributions by individuals       For individuals, in any taxable year, the amount deductible      as a charitable contribution is limited to a percentage of      the taxpayer's contribution base. The applicable percentage      of the contribution base varies depending on the type of      donee organization and property contributed. The contribution      base is defined as the taxpayer's adjusted     gross income computed without regard to any net operating      loss carryback.       Contributions by an individual taxpayer of property (other      than appreciated capital gain property) to a charitable      organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (e.g., public      charities, private foundations other than private non-     operating foundations, and certain governmental units) may      not exceed 50 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base.      Contributions of this type of property to nonoperating      private foundations and certain other organizations generally      may be deducted up to 30 percent of the taxpayer's      contribution base.       Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to      charitable organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A)      generally are deductible up to 30 percent of the taxpayer's      contribution base. An individual may elect, however, to bring      all these contributions of appreciated capital gain property      for a taxable year within the 50-percent limitation category      by reducing the amount of the contribution deduction by the      amount of the appreciation in the capital gain property.      Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to      charitable organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(B)      (e.g., private nonoperating foundations) are deductible up to      20 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base.       Contributions by corporations       For corporations, in any taxable year, charitable      contributions are not deductible to the extent the aggregate      contributions exceed 10 percent of the corporation's taxable      income computed without regard to net operating loss or      capital loss carrybacks.       For purposes of determining whether a corporation's      aggregate charitable contributions in a taxable year exceed      the applicable percentage limitation, contributions of      capital gain property are taken into account after other      charitable contributions.       Carryforward of excess contributions       Charitable contributions that exceed the applicable      percentage limitation may be carried forward for up to five      years (sec. 170(d)). The amount that may be carried forward      from a taxable year (``contribution year'') to a succeeding      taxable year may not exceed the applicable percentage of the      contribution base for the succeeding taxable year less the      sum of contributions made in the succeeding taxable year plus      contributions made in taxable years prior to the contribution      year and treated as paid in the succeeding taxable year under      this provision.     Overall limitation on itemized deductions (``Pease''          limitation)       Under present law, the total amount of otherwise allowable      itemized deductions (other than medical expenses, investment      interest, and casualty, theft, or wagering losses) is reduced      by three percent of the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted      gross income in excess of a certain threshold. The otherwise      allowable itemized deductions may not be reduced by more than      80 percent. For 2005, the adjusted gross income threshold is      $145,950 ($72,975 for a married taxpayer filing a joint      return). These dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation.       The otherwise applicable overall limitation on itemized      deductions is reduced by one-third in taxable years beginning      in 2006 and 2007, and by two-thirds in taxable years      beginning in 2008 and 2009. The overall limitation is      repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009,      and reinstated for taxable years beginning after December 31,      2010.     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005--Increase in          percentage limitations       Under section 301 of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act      of 2005, in the case of an individual, the deduction for      qualified contributions is allowed up to the amount by which      the taxpayer's contribution base exceeds the deduction for      other charitable contributions. Contributions in excess of      this amount are carried over to succeeding taxable years as      contributions described in 170(b)(1)(A), subject to the      limitations of section 170(d)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).       In the case of a corporation, the deduction for qualified      contributions is allowed up to the amount by which the      corporation's taxable income (as computed under section      170(b)(2)) exceeds the deduction for other charitable      contributions. Contributions in excess of this amount are      carried over to succeeding taxable years, subject to the      limitations of section 170(d)(2).       In applying subsections (b) and (d) of section 170 to      determine the deduction for other contributions, qualified      contributions are not taken into account (except to the      extent qualified contributions are carried over to succeeding      taxable years under the rules described above).       Qualified contributions are cash contributions made during      the period beginning on August 28, 2005, and ending on      December 31, 2005, to a charitable organization described in      section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than a supporting organization      described in section 509(a)(3)). Contributions of noncash      property, such as securities, are not qualified      contributions. Under the provision, qualified contributions      must be to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A);      thus, contributions to, for example, a charitable remainder      trust generally are not qualified contributions, unless the      charitable remainder interest is paid in cash to an eligible      charity during the applicable time period. In the case of a      corporation, qualified contributions must be for relief      efforts related to Hurricane Katrina. A taxpayer must elect      to have the contributions treated as qualified contributions.       Qualified contributions do not include a contribution if      the contribution is for establishment of a new, or      maintenance in an existing, segregated fund or account with      respect to which the donor (or any person appointed or      designated by such donor) has, or reasonably expects to have,      advisory privileges with respect to distributions or      investments by reason of the donor's status as a donor. For      example, a segregated fund or account exists if a donor makes      a charitable contribution and the donee separately identifies      the donor's contribution on its books. The donor has advisory      privileges with respect to such segregated fund or account if      the donor, by written agreement or otherwise, reasonably      expects to provide advice to the donee as to the investment      or distribution of amounts from such fund or account. In      addition, a segregated fund or account also includes, but is      not limited to, a separate bank account or trust established      or maintained by a donee; however, in order for a      contribution to such account or fund necessarily to be not a      qualified contribution, the donor (or a person appointed or      designated by the donor) must have or reasonably expect to      have advisory privileges as to the investment or distribution      of amounts in such account or fund. For instance, a donor      reasonably expects to have advisory privileges with respect      to contributions made by the donor if the donor understands      that the donee will consider advice provided by the donor (or      a person appointed or designated by the donor) in making      investments or distributions. It is intended that a person      shall not be treated as having advisory privileges by virtue      of having a legal or contractual right or obligation, or a      fiduciary duty, with respect to a segregated fund or account.      If a donor makes a contribution for establishment of a new,      or maintenance in an existing segregated account or fund, and      the donor also provides advice with respect to amounts in      such account or fund by reason of the donor's position as an      officer, employee, or director of the donee, and not by      reason of the donor's status as a donor, then, under the      provision, the donor is not treated as having or reasonably      expecting to have advisory privileges with respect to such      fund or account. However, if by reason of a donor's      charitable contribution to a segregated account or fund, the      donor secured an appointment on a committee of the donee      organization that advised how to distribute or invest amounts      in such account or fund, the contribution would not be a      qualified contribution notwithstanding that the donor is an      officer, employee, or director of the donee organization.       The Act requires that qualified contributions by a      corporation be made for relief efforts related to Hurricane      Katrina. Corporate taxpayers must substantiate that the      contribution is made for this purpose.     Limitation on overall itemized deductions       Under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, the      charitable contribution deduction up to the amount of      qualified contributions (as defined above) paid during the      year is not treated as an itemized deduction for purposes of      the overall limitation on itemized deductions.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies the provisions in the Katrina      Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, and extends the definition      of qualified contributions (as described above), in the case      of corporations, to include contributions for relief efforts      related to Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.                             Effective Date       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency      Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The      expansion of the provision applies to contributions made on      or after September 23, 2005. D. Suspension of Certain Limitations on Personal Casualty Losses (New                        sec. 1400S(b) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, a taxpayer may generally claim a      deduction for any loss sustained during the taxable year and      not compensated by insurance or otherwise (sec. 165). For      individual taxpayers, deductible losses must be incurred in a      trade or business or other profit-seeking activity or consist      of property losses arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or      other casualty, or from theft. Personal casualty or theft      losses are deductible only if they exceed $100 per casualty      or theft. In addition, aggregate net casualty and theft      losses are deductible only to the extent they exceed 10      percent of an individual taxpayer's adjusted gross income.     Hurricane Katrina       Under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, the two      limitations on personal casualty or theft losses do not apply      to the extent those losses arise in the Hurricane Katrina      disaster area on or after August 25, 2005, and are      attributable to Hurricane Katrina (``Katrina casualty      losses''). Specifically, Katrina casualty losses meeting the      above requirements need not exceed $100 per casualty or      theft. In addition, such losses are deductible without regard      to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10 percent of a      taxpayer's adjusted gross income. For purposes of applying      the 10 percent threshold to other personal casualty or theft      losses, Katrina casualty losses are disregarded. Thus, such      losses are effectively treated as a deduction separate from      all other casualty losses.       For purposes of determining whether a loss is a Katrina      casualty loss, the term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area''      means an area with respect to which a major disaster had been      declared by the President before September 14, 2005, under      section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and      Emergency Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina. The      States for which such a disaster had been declared are      Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act      of 2005 rule for Katrina casualty losses and expands it to      include losses that arise in the Hurricane Rita disaster area      and are attributable to Hurricane Rita and losses that arise      in the Hurricane Wilma disaster area and are attributable to      Hurricane Wilma.                             Effective Date       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency      Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The      expansion of the provision applies to losses related to      Hurricane Rita arising on or after September 23, 2005, and to      losses related to Hurricane Wilma arising on or after October      23, 2005.E. Required Exercise of IRS Administrative Authority (New sec. 1400S(c)                               of the Code)                              Present Law     General time limits for filing tax returns       Individuals generally must file their Federal income tax      returns by April 15 of the year following the close of a      taxable year. The Secretary may grant reasonable extensions      of time for filing such returns. Treasury regulations provide      an additional automatic two-month extension (until June 15      for calendar-year individuals) for United States citizens and      residents in military or naval service on duty on April 15 of      the following year (the otherwise applicable due date of the      return) outside the United States. No action is necessary to      apply for this extension, but taxpayers must indicate on      their returns (when filed) that they are claiming this      extension. Unlike most extensions of time to file, this      extension applies to both filing returns and paying the tax      due.       Treasury regulations also provide, upon application on the      proper form, an automatic four-month extension (until August      15 for calendar-year individuals) for any individual timely      filing that form and paying the amount of tax estimated to be      due.       In general, individuals must make quarterly estimated tax      payments by April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15      of the following taxable year. Wage withholding is considered      to be a payment of estimated taxes     Suspension of time periods       In general, the period of time for performing various acts      under the Code, such as filing tax returns, paying taxes, or      filing a claim for credit or refund of tax, is suspended for      any individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United      States in an area designated as a ``combat zone'' or when      deployed outside the United States away from the individual's      permanent duty station while participating in an operation      designated by the Secretary of Defense as a ``contingency      operation'' or that becomes a contingency operation. The      suspension of time also applies to an individual serving in      support of such Armed Forces in the combat zone or      contingency operation, such as Red Cross personnel,      accredited correspondents, and civilian personnel acting      under the direction of the Armed Forces in support of those      Forces. The designation of a combat zone must be made by the      President in an Executive Order. A contingency operation is      defined as a military operation that is designated by the      Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the      Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions,      operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United      States or against an opposing military force, or results in      the call or order to (or retention of) active duty of members      of the uniformed services during a war or a national      emergency declared by the President or Congress.       The suspension of time encompasses the period of service in      the combat zone during the period of combatant activities in      the zone or while participating in a contingency operation,      as well as (1) any time of continuous qualified      hospitalization resulting from injury received in the combat      zone or contingency operation or (2) time in missing in      action status, plus the next 180 days.       The suspension of time applies to the following acts:       1. Filing any return of income, estate, gift, employment or      excise taxes;       2. Payment of any income, estate, gift, employment or      excise taxes;       3. Filing a petition with the Tax Court for redetermination      of a deficiency, or for review of a decision rendered by the      Tax Court;       4. Allowance of a credit or refund of any tax;       5. Filing a claim for credit or refund of any tax;       6. Bringing suit upon any such claim for credit or refund;       7. Assessment of any tax;       8. Giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of      any tax, or with respect to any liability to the United      States in respect of any tax;       9. Collection of the amount of any liability in respect of      any tax;       10. Bringing suit by the United States in respect of any      liability in respect of any tax; and       11. Any other act required or permitted under the internal      revenue laws specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.       In the case of a Presidentially declared disaster or a      terroristic or military action, the Secretary of the Treasury      also has authority to prescribe a period of up to one year      that may be disregarded for performing any of the acts listed      above. The Secretary also may suspend the accrual of any      interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to tax for      taxpayers in the affected areas.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, for taxpayers determined to be      affected by the Presidentially declared disaster relating to      Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, any administrative      relief from required acts, such as filing tax returns, paying      taxes, or filing a claim for credit or refund of tax, shall      be for a period ending not earlier than February 28, 2006.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.  F. Special Look-Back Rule for Determining Earned Income Credit and         Refundable Child Credit (New sec. 1400S(d) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Present law provides eligible taxpayers with an earned      income credit and a child credit. In general, the earned      income credit is a refundable credit for low-income workers      (sec. 32). The amount of the credit depends on the earned      income of the taxpayer and whether the taxpayer has one, more      than one, or no qualifying children. Earned income generally      includes wages, salaries, tips, and other employee      compensation, plus net earnings from self-employment.       Taxpayers with incomes below certain threshold amounts are      eligible for a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child (sec.      24). The child credit is refundable to the extent of 15      percent of the taxpayer's earned income in excess of $10,000.      (The $10,000 income threshold is indexed for inflation and is      currently $11,000 for 2005.) Families with three or more      children are allowed a refundable credit for the amount by      which the taxpayer's social security taxes exceed the      taxpayer's earned income credit, if that amount is greater      than the refundable credit based on the taxpayer's earned      income in excess of $10,000 (indexed for inflation).     Hurricane Katrina       Certain qualified individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina      may elect to calculate their earned income credit and      refundable child credit for the taxable year which includes      August 25, 2005, using their earned income from the prior      taxable year (a ``Katrina election''). Such qualified      individuals are permitted to make the election only if their      earned income for the taxable year which includes August 25,      2005, is less than their earned income for the preceding      taxable year.       Individuals qualified to make a Katrina election are (1)      individuals who on August 25, 2005, had their principal place      of abode in the Hurricane Katrina ``core disaster area'' or      (2) individuals who on such date were not in the core      disaster area but lived in the Hurricane Katrina disaster      area and were displaced from their homes. For purposes of      this election, the term ``core disaster area'' means that      portion of the Hurricane Katrina disaster area determined by      the President to warrant individual or individual and public      assistance from the Federal Government under such Act. The      term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area with      respect to which a major disaster had been declared by the      President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of the      Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance      Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina. The States for which such      a disaster had been declared are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,      and Mississippi.       In the case of a joint return for a taxable year which      includes August 25, 2005, a Katrina election may be made if      either spouse is a qualified individual. In such cases, the      earned income for the preceding taxable year which is      attributable to the taxpayer filing the joint return is the      sum of the earned income which is attributable to each spouse      for such preceding taxable year.       Any Katrina election applies with respect to both the      earned income credit and refundable child credit. For      administrative purposes, the incorrect use on a return of      earned income pursuant to a Katrina election is treated as a      mathematical or clerical error. A Katrina election is      disregarded for purposes of calculating gross income in the      election year.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies the Katrina election. It also      expands the rule governing Katrina elections to permit      certain qualified individuals affected by Hurricane Rita and      Hurricane Wilma to make similar elections.       In the case of Hurricane Rita certain qualified individuals      may elect to calculate their earned income credit and      refundable child credit for the taxable year which includes      September 23, 2005, using their earned income from the prior      taxable year (a ``Rita election''). Qualified individuals for      purposes of a Rita election are (1) individuals who on      September 23, 2005, had their principal place     of abode in the Rita GO Zone or (2) individuals who on such      date had their principal place of abode in the Hurricane Rita      disaster area but outside the Rita GO Zone and were displaced      from that residence.       In the case of Hurricane Wilma certain qualified      individuals may elect to calculate their earned income credit      and refundable child credit for the taxable year which      includes October 23, 2005, using their earned income from the      prior taxable year (a ``Wilma election''). Qualified      individuals for purposes of a Wilma election are (1)      individuals who on October 23, 2005, had their principal      place of abode in the Wilma GO Zone or (2) individuals who on      such date had their principal place of abode in the Hurricane      Wilma disaster area but outside the Wilma GO Zone and were      displaced from that residence.       Qualified individuals are permitted to make a Rita election      or Wilma election only if their earned income for the taxable      year which includes September 23, 2005 or October 23, 2005,      respectively, is less than their earned income for the      preceding taxable year.       In other respects, a Rita election or Wilma election is the      same as a Katrina election under present law, except that the      reference dates are September 23, 2005 for Rita and October      23, 2005 for Wilma and not August 25, 2005.                             Effective Date       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency      Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The      expansion of the provision applies to taxable years that      include September 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Rita and      October 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Wilma.  G. Secretarial Authority to Make Adjustments Regarding Taxpayer and            Dependency Status (New sec. 1400S(e) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       In order to determine taxable income, an individual reduces      adjusted gross income (``AGI'') by any personal exemptions      and either the standard deduction or itemized deductions.      Personal exemptions generally are allowed for the taxpayer,      his or her spouse, and any dependents (as defined in sec.      151). Personal exemptions are not allowed for purposes of      determining a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income.       For 2005, the amount deductible for each personal exemption      is $3,200. This amount is indexed annually for inflation. The      deduction for personal exemptions is phased out ratably for      taxpayers with AGI over certain thresholds. These thresholds      are indexed annually for inflation. Specifically, the total      amount of exemptions that may be claimed by a taxpayer is      reduced by two percent for each $2,500 (or portion thereof)      by which the taxpayer's AGI exceeds the applicable threshold.      (The phaseout rate is two percent for each $1,250 for married      taxpayers filing separate returns.) Thus, the personal      exemptions claimed are phased out over a $122,500 range      (which is not indexed for inflation), beginning at the      applicable threshold. The applicable thresholds for 2005 are      $145,900 for single individuals, $218,950 for married      individuals filing a joint return, $182,450 for heads of      households, and $109,475 for married individuals filing      separate returns. For 2005, the point at which a taxpayer's      personal exemptions are completely phased out is $268,450 for      single individuals, $341,450 for married individuals filing a      joint return, $304,950 for heads of households, and $170,725      for married individuals filing separate returns.       Present law provides eligible taxpayers with an earned      income credit and a child credit. In general, the earned      income credit is a refundable credit for low-income workers.      The amount of the credit depends on the earned income of the      taxpayer and whether the taxpayer has one, more than one, or      no qualifying children. Earned income generally includes      wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation, plus      net earnings from self-employment.       Taxpayers with incomes below certain threshold amounts are      eligible for a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child. The      child credit is refundable to the extent of 15 percent of the      taxpayer's earned income in excess of $10,000. (The $10,000      income threshold is indexed for inflation and is currently      $11,000 for 2005.) Families with three or more children are      allowed a refundable credit for the amount by which the      taxpayer's social security taxes exceed the taxpayer's earned      income credit, if that amount is greater than the refundable      credit based on the taxpayer's earned income in excess of      $10,000 (indexed for inflation).     Hurricane Katrina       With respect to taxable years beginning in 2005 and 2006,      the Secretary has authority to make such adjustments in the      application of the Federal tax laws as may be necessary to      ensure that taxpayers do not lose any deduction or credit or      experience a change of filing status by 62 reason of      temporary relocations caused by Hurricane Katrina. Such      adjustments may include, for example, addressing the      application of the residency requirements relating to      dependency exemptions in the case of relocations due to      Hurricane Katrina. Any adjustments made using this authority      must insure that an individual is not taken into account by      more than one taxpayer with respect to the same tax benefit.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision codifies the Secretarial authority with      respect to Hurricane Katrina. The provision also expands the      Secretary's authority to make adjustments in the application      of the Federal tax laws with respect to Hurricane Katrina to      include taxpayers affected by Hurricane Rita and Hurricane      Wilma.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective with respect to taxable years      beginning in 2005 or 2006.  H. Special Rules for Mortgage Revenue Bonds (New sec. 1400T of the                                  Code)                              Present Law     In general       Under present law, gross income does not include interest      on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are      classified generally as either governmental bonds or private      activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are      primarily used to finance governmental functions or are      repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are      bonds with respect to which the State or local government      serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental      persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The      exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not      apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued      for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity      bonds'') (secs. 103(b)(1) and 141).     Qualified mortgage bonds       The definition of a qualified private activity bond      includes a qualified mortgage bond (sec. 143). Qualified      mortgage bonds are issued to make mortgage loans to qualified      mortgagors for the purchase, improvement, or rehabilitation      of owner-occupied residences. The Code imposes several      limitations on qualified mortgage bonds, including income      limitations for eligible mortgagors, purchase price      limitations on the home financed with bond proceeds, and a      ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement. The income limitations      are satisfied if all financing provided by an issue is      provided for mortgagors whose family income does not exceed      115 percent of the median family income for the metropolitan      area or State, whichever is greater, in which the financed      residences are located. The purchase price limitations      provide that a residence financed with qualified mortgage      bonds may not have a purchase price in excess of 90 percent      of the average area purchase price for that residence. The      first-time homebuyer requirement provides qualified mortgage      bonds generally cannot be used to finance a mortgage for a      homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a principal      residence in the three years preceding the execution of the      mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement).       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to      targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one      located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70      percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or      less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of      chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the      income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of      the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits      and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors      whose family income is 140 percent or less of the applicable      median family income. The purchase price limitation is raised      from 90 percent to 110 percent of the average area purchase      price for targeted area residences. In addition, the first-     time homebuyer requirement does not apply to targeted area      residences.       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance      qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement      loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs,      and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such      alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect      or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the      property. Qualified home-improvement loans may not exceed      $15,000.       A temporary provision waived the first-time homebuyer      requirement for residences located in certain Presidentially      declared disaster areas (sec. 143(k)(11)). In addition,      residences located in such areas were treated as targeted      area residences for purposes of the income and purchase price      limitations. The special rule for residences located in      Presidentially declared disaster areas does not apply to      bonds issued after January 1, 1999.       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (``KETRA'') waives the      first-time homebuyer requirement with respect to certain      residences located in an area with respect to which a major      disaster has been declared by the President before September      14, 2005, under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford      Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by reason of      Hurricane Katrina (see sec. 404 of Pub. L. 109-73). KETRA      also increases to $150,000 the permitted amount of a      qualified home-improvement loans with respect to residences      located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area to the extent      such loan is for the repair of damage caused by Hurricane      Katrina.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, residences located in the GO Zone, the      Rita GO Zone, or the Wilma GO Zone are treated as targeted      area residences for purposes of section 143, with the      modifications described below. Thus, the first-time homebuyer      rule is waived and purchase and income rules for targeted      area residences apply to residences located in the     specified areas that are financed with qualified mortgage      bonds. For these purposes, 100 percent of the mortgages must      be made to mortgagors whose family income is 140 percent or      less of the applicable median family income. Thus, the      present law rule allowing one-third of the mortgages to be      made without regard to any income limits does not apply. In      addition, the proposal increases from $15,000 to $150,000 the      amount of a qualified home-improvement loan with respect to      residences located in the specified disaster areas.       The provision applies to residences financed before January      1, 2011.       (For a description of the extension of KETRA mortgage      revenue bond rules, see I.A.20,--Special Rules for Mortgage      Revenue Bonds, above.)                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment with      respect to financing provided before January 1, 2011.                      TITLE III--OTHER PROVISIONS                      A. Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds                              Present Law       Under Title 31, the Secretary, with the approval of the      President, may issue savings bonds and savings certificates      of the United States Government (31 U.S.C. sec. 3105).      Proceeds from the bonds and certificates are used for      expenditures authorized by law. Savings bonds and      certificates may be issued on an interest-bearing basis, on a      discount basis, or on an interest-bearing and discount basis.      The difference between the price paid and the amount received      on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest under      the Code.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision expresses the sense of Congress that the      Secretary designate one or more series of obligations issued      under Title 31 as ``Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds'' in response      to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment. B. Election To Treat Combat Pay as Earned Income for Purposes of the                Earned Income Credit (Sec. 32 of the Code)                              Present Law     Child credit       Combat pay that is otherwise excluded from gross income      under section 112 is treated as earned income which is taken      into account in computing taxable income for purposes of      calculating the refundable portion of the child credit.     Earned income credit       Any taxpayer may elect to treat combat pay that is      otherwise excluded from gross income under section 112 as      earned income for purposes of the earned income credit. This      election is available with respect to any taxable year ending      after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2006.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends the present-law rule relating to the      earned income credit for one year (through December 31,      2006).                             Effective Date       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning      after December 31, 2005.C. Modifications of Suspension of Interest and Penalties Where Internal   Revenue Service Fails to Contact Taxpayer (Sec. 6404(g) of the Code)                              Present Law       In general, interest and penalties accrue during periods      for which taxes were unpaid without regard to whether the      taxpayer was aware that there was tax due. The Code suspends      the accrual of certain penalties and interest starting 18      months after the filing of the tax return if the IRS has not      sent the taxpayer a notice specifically stating the      taxpayer's liability and the basis for the liability within      the specified period. If the return is filed before the due      date, for this purpose it is considered to have been filed on      the due date. Interest and penalties resume 21 days after the      IRS sends the required notice to the taxpayer. The provision      is applied separately with respect to each item or      adjustment. The provision does not apply where a taxpayer has      self-assessed the tax. The suspension only applies to      taxpayers who file a timely tax return. The provision applies      only to individuals and does not apply to the failure to pay      penalty, in the case of fraud, or with respect to criminal      penalties.       The suspension of interest does not apply to interest      accruing after October 3, 2004 with respect to underpayments      resulting from listed transactions or undisclosed reportable      transactions.       On October 27, 2005, the IRS announced a settlement      initiative for 21 identified transactions. (See Internal      Revenue Service Announcement 2005-80.) Under the terms of the      settlement initiative, participants will be required to pay      100 percent of the taxes owed, interest and, depending on the      transaction, either a quarter or a half of the penalty the      IRS will otherwise seek. The IRS will grant penalty relief      for transactions disclosed to the IRS or where the taxpayer      got a tax opinion from an independent tax advisor.      Transaction costs paid by the taxpayer, including      professional and promoter fees, will be allowed. The      application deadline for the settlement initiative is January      23, 2006.                        Explanation of Provision       Under the provision, the exception for listed transactions      and undisclosed reportable transactions also applies to      interest accruing on or before October 3, 2004. However,      taxpayers remain eligible for the present-law suspension of      interest if the year in which the underpayment occurred is      barred by the statute of limitations (or a closing agreement)      as of December 14, 2005. Taxpayers may also remain eligible      with respect to any transactions if the Secretary determines      that the taxpayers have acted reasonably and in good faith      with respect to that transactions.       In addition, under a special rule, taxpayers may remain      eligible for the present-law suspension of interest by      participating in the IRS settlement initiative described      above with respect to that transaction. In order to be      eligible under the special rule, the taxpayer must be      participating in the settlement initiative (or have entered      into a settlement agreement pursuant to the initiative) as of      January 23, 2006. Furthermore, a taxpayer's eligibility under      the special rule is revoked if the taxpayer ceases to      participate in the settlement initiative or the Treasury      determines that a settlement agreement will not be reached      within a reasonable period of time.       The special rule applies on a transaction-by-transaction      basis. Thus, participation in the settlement initiative with      respect to an individual transaction qualifies the taxpayer      for the present-law suspension of interest only with respect      to interest and penalties on underpayments resulting from      that transaction. If the taxpayer has entered into other      listed or nondisclosed reportable transactions and is not      participating in the settlement initiative with respect to      those transactions, the special rule does not apply to      interest and penalties resulting from those transactions.       The provision also provides that, if a taxpayer files an      amended return or other signed written document showing that      the taxpayer owes an additional amount of tax for the taxable      year, the relevant 18-month period is measured from the      latest date on which such documents were provided.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective as if included in the provisions      of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to which it      relates, except that the rule relating to the restart of the      18-month period is effective for documents provided on or      after the date of enactment.     D. Authority for Undercover Operations (Sec. 7608 of the Code)                              Present Law       IRS undercover operations are exempt from the otherwise      applicable statutory restrictions controlling the use of      Government funds (which generally provide that all receipts      must be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and all      expenses paid out of appropriated funds). In general, the      exemption permits the IRS to use proceeds from an undercover      operation to pay additional expenses incurred in the      undercover operation. The IRS is required to conduct a      detailed financial audit of large undercover operations in      which the IRS is using proceeds from such operations and to      provide an annual audit report to the Congress on all such      large undercover operations.       The provision was originally enacted in The Anti-Drug Abuse      Act of 1988. The exemption originally expired on December 31,      1989, and was extended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act      of 1990 to December 31, 1991. There followed a gap of      approximately four and a half years during which the      provision had lapsed. In the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, the      authority to use proceeds from undercover operations was      extended for five years, through 2000. The Community Renewal      Tax Relief Act of 2000 extended the authority of the IRS to      use proceeds from undercover operations for an additional      five years, through 2005.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends for one year the present-law      authority of the IRS to use proceeds from undercover      operations to pay additional expenses incurred in conducting      undercover operations (through December 31, 2006).                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.            E. Disclosures of Certain Tax Return Information     1. Disclosure of tax information to facilitate combined          employment tax reporting (sec. 6103(d)(5) of the Code)                              Present Law       Traditionally, Federal tax forms are filed with the Federal      government and State tax forms are filed with individual      States. This necessitates duplication of items common to both      returns. The Code permits the IRS to disclose taxpayer      identity information and signatures to any agency, body, or      commission of any State for the purpose of carrying out with      such agency, body or commission a combined Federal and State      employment tax reporting program approved by the Secretary.      The Federal disclosure restrictions, safeguard requirements,      and criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure and      unauthorized inspection do not apply with respect to      disclosures or inspections made pursuant to this authority.       The authority for this program expires December 31, 2005.       Under section 6103(c), the IRS may disclose a taxpayer's      return or return information to     such person or persons as the taxpayer may designate in a      request for or consent to such disclosure. Pursuant to      Treasury regulations, a taxpayer's participation in a      combined return filing program between the IRS and a State      agency, body or commission constitutes a consent to the      disclosure by the IRS to the State agency of taxpayer      identity information, signature and items of common data      contained on the return. No disclosures may be made under      this authority unless there are provisions of State law      protecting the confidentiality of such items of common data.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends for one year the present-law      authority for the combined employment tax reporting program      (through December 31, 2006).                             Effective Date       The provision applies to disclosures after December 31,      2005.     2. Disclosure of return information regarding terrorist          activities (sec. 6103(i)(3) and (i)(7) of the Code)                              Present Law     In general       Section 6103 provides that returns and return information      may not be disclosed by the IRS, other Federal employees,      State employees, and certain others having access to the      information except as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.      Section 6103 contains a number of exceptions to this general      rule of nondisclosure that authorize disclosure in      specifically 71 identified circumstances (including nontax      criminal investigations) when certain conditions are      satisfied.       Among the disclosures permitted under the Code is      disclosure of returns and return information for purposes of      investigating terrorist incidents, threats, or activities,      and for analyzing intelligence concerning terrorist      incidents, threats, or activities. The term ``terrorist      incident, threat, or activity'' is statutorily defined to      mean an incident, threat, or activity involving an act of      domestic terrorism or international terrorism, as both of      those terms are defined in the USA PATRIOT Act (see sec.      6103(b)(11) and 18 U.S.C. secs. 2331(1) and 2331(5)). In      general, returns and taxpayer return information must be      obtained pursuant to an ex parte court order. Return      information, other than taxpayer return information,      generally is available upon a written request meeting      specific requirements. The IRS also is permitted to make      limited disclosures of such information on its own initiative      to the appropriate Federal law enforcement agency.       No disclosures may be made under these provisions after      December 31, 2005.     Disclosure of returns and return information--by ex parte          court order       Ex parte court orders sought by Federal law enforcement and            Federal intelligence agencies       The Code permits, pursuant to an ex parte court order, the      disclosure of returns and return information (including      taxpayer return information) to certain officers and      employees of a Federal law enforcement agency or Federal      intelligence agency. These officers and employees are      required to be personally and directly engaged in any      investigation of, response to, or analysis of intelligence      and counterintelligence information concerning any terrorist      incident, threat, or activity. These officers and employees      are permitted to use this information solely for their use in      the investigation, response, or analysis, and in any      judicial, administrative, or grand jury proceeding,      pertaining to any such terrorist incident, threat, or      activity.       The Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate      Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or a United      States attorney, may authorize the application for the ex      parte court order to be submitted to a Federal district court      judge or magistrate. The Federal district court judge or      magistrate would grant the order if based on the facts      submitted he or she determines that: (1) there is reasonable      cause to believe, based upon information believed to be      reliable, that the return or return information may be      relevant to a matter relating to such terrorist incident,      threat, or activity; and (2) the return or return information      is sought exclusively for the use in a Federal investigation,      analysis, or proceeding concerning any terrorist incident,      threat, or activity.       Special rule for ex parte court ordered disclosure            initiated by the IRS       If the Secretary of Treasury possesses returns or return      information that may be related to a terrorist incident,      threat, or activity, the Secretary of the Treasury (or his      delegate), may on his own initiative, authorize an      application for an ex parte court order to permit disclosure      to Federal law enforcement. In order to grant the order, the      Federal district court judge or magistrate must determine      that there is reasonable cause to believe, based upon      information believed to be reliable, that the return or      return information may be relevant to a matter relating to      such terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The      information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary      to apprise the appropriate Federal law enforcement agency      responsible for investigating or responding to a terrorist      incident, threat, or activity and for officers and      employees of that agency to investigate or respond to such      terrorist incident, threat, or activity. Further, use of      the information is limited to use in a Federal      investigation, analysis, or proceeding concerning a      terrorist incident, threat, or activity. Because the      Department of Justice represents the Secretary of the      Treasury in Federal district court, the Secretary is      permitted to disclose returns and return information to      the Department of Justice as necessary and solely for the      purpose of obtaining the special IRS ex parte court order.     Disclosure of return information other than by ex parte court          order       Disclosure by the IRS without a request       The Code permits the IRS to disclose return information,      other than taxpayer return information, related to a      terrorist incident, threat, or activity to the extent      necessary to apprise the head of the appropriate Federal law      enforcement agency responsible for investigating or      responding to such terrorist incident, threat, or activity.      The IRS on its own initiative and without a written request      may make this disclosure. The head of the Federal law      enforcement agency may disclose information to officers and      employees of such agency to the extent necessary to      investigate or respond to such terrorist incident, threat, or      activity. A taxpayer's identity is not treated as return      information supplied by the taxpayer or his or her      representative.       Disclosure upon written request of a Federal law            enforcement agency       The Code permits the IRS to disclose return information,      other than taxpayer return information, to officers and      employees of Federal law enforcement upon a written request      satisfying certain requirements. The request must: (1) be      made by the head of the Federal law enforcement agency (or      his delegate) involved in the response to or investigation of      terrorist incidents, threats, or activities, and (2) set      forth the specific reason or reasons why such disclosure may      be relevant to a terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The      information is to be disclosed to officers and employees of      the Federal law enforcement agency who would be personally      and directly involved in the response to or investigation of      terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. The information      is to be used by such officers and employees solely for such      response or investigation.       The Code permits the redisclosure by a Federal law      enforcement agency to officers and employees of State and      local law enforcement personally and directly engaged in the      response to or investigation of the terrorist incident,      threat, or activity. The State or local law enforcement      agency must be part of an investigative or response team with      the Federal law enforcement agency for these disclosures to      be made.       Disclosure upon request from the Departments of Justice or            Treasury for intelligence analysis of terrorist            activity       Upon written request satisfying certain requirements      discussed below, the IRS is to disclose return information      (other than taxpayer return information) to officers and      employees of the Department of Justice, Department of      Treasury, and other Federal intelligence agencies, who are      personally and directly engaged in the collection or analysis      of intelligence and counterintelligence or investigation      concerning terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. Use      of the information is limited to use by such officers and      employees in such investigation, collection, or analysis.       The written request is to set forth the specific reasons      why the information to be disclosed is relevant to a      terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The request is to be      made by an individual who is: (1) an officer or employee of      the Department of Justice or the Department of Treasury, (2)      appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the      Senate, and (3) responsible for the collection, and analysis      of intelligence and counterintelligence information      concerning terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. The      Director of the United States Secret Service also is an      authorized requester under the Act.                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends for one year the present-law      terrorist activity disclosure provisions (through December      31, 2006).                             Effective Date       The provision applies to disclosures after December 31,      2005.     3. Disclosure of return information to carry out income          contingent repayment of student loans (sec. 6103(l)(13)          of the Code)                              Present Law       Present law prohibits the disclosure of returns and return      information, except to the extent specifically authorized by      the Code. An exception is provided for disclosure to the      Department of Education (but not to contractors thereof) of a      taxpayer's filing status, adjusted gross income and identity      information (i.e., name, mailing address, taxpayer      identifying number) to establish an appropriate repayment      amount for an applicable student loan. The disclosure      authority for the income-contingent loan repayment program is      scheduled to expire after December 31, 2005.       The Department of Education utilizes contractors for the      income-contingent loan verification program. The specific      disclosure exception for the program does not permit      disclosure of return information to contractors. As a result,      the Department of Education obtains return information from      the Internal Revenue Service by taxpayer consent (under      section 6103(c)), rather than under the specific exception      for the income-contingent loan verification program (sec.      6103(l)(13)).                        Explanation of Provision       The provision extends for one year the present law      authority to disclose return information for purposes of the      income-contingent loan repayment program (through December      31, 2006).                             Effective Date       The provision applies to requests made after December 31,      2005.                  TITLE IV--TAX TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS       The bill includes technical corrections and other      corrections to recently enacted tax legislation. Except as      otherwise provided, the amendments made by the technical      corrections and other corrections contained in the bill take      effect as if included in the original legislation to which      each amendment relates.                        A. Technical Corrections     Amendments Related to the Energy Policy Act of 2005       Repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935      (Act sec. 1263).--The provision repeals sections 1081-1083 of      the Code (relating to exchanges in obedience to SEC orders)      to conform to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding      Company Act of 1935. The repeal does not apply to any      exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale made      in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange      Commission.       Extension and modification of renewable electricity      production credit (Act sec. 1301).--The provision makes a      technical amendment to Code section 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) to change      the wording of the reference to ``nonhazardous lignin waste      material'' to ``lignin material'' so as not to infer that      lignin is hazardous or waste.       Clean renewable energy bonds (Act sec. 1303).--Section      54(1)(5) treats the credits received by a holder of clean      renewable energy bonds as payments of estimated tax for      purposes of sections 6654 and 6655. Under the provision,      section 54(1)(5) is repealed, as it may provide a double      benefit when computing the estimated tax penalty in the      manner prescribed under sections 6654(f) and 6655(g). The      conforming amendments to the Act section are made for taxable      years beginning after 2005.       Credit for production from advanced nuclear power      facilities (Act sec. 1306).--The provision clarifies the      production credit for advanced nuclear power (sec. 45J) to      carry out the intent that the phase-out is indexed for      inflation but the credit rate is not. Specifically, it is not      intended that the inflation adjustment rule referred to in      section 45J(e) be interpreted to apply to the credit rate in      section 45J(a)(1) as well as the phase-out referred to in      section 45J(c)(2). The provision clarifies that the phase-out      is indexed but the credit rate is not.       Expansion of amortization for certain atmospheric pollution      control facilities in connection with plants first placed in      service after 1975 (Act sec. 1309).--The provision clarifies      that the 84-month amortization period only applies to      facilities used in connection with a plant or other property      placed in service after December 31, 1975.       Five-year net operating loss carryover for certain losses      (Act sec. 1311).--A number of clerical amendments are made to      section 172(b)(1)(I).       Modification of credit for producing fuel from a      nonconventional source (Act sec. 1322).--The provision      clarifies that the credit is allowable without the      requirement to make an election.       Energy efficient commercial buildings deduction (Act sec.      1331).--The provision repeals as deadwood certain language in      section 1250.       Credit for residential energy efficient property (Act sec.      1335).--The provision clarifies that the dollar limitations      are applied without regard to carryovers of the credit from      prior taxable years.       Under the provision, the joint occupancy rule is redrafted      to apply to expenditures with respect to a dwelling unit      rather than the credit allowed with respect to the unit.       The rules relating to the carryover of unused personal      credits (including the new credit for residential energy      efficient property) are redrafted so as to include in the      Code rules for both the taxable years in which the credits      are allowed against the alternative minimum tax, and the      taxable years in which the credits are not so allowed. The      provision is effective for taxable years beginning after      2005.       Alternative motor vehicle credit and credit for      installation of alternative fueling stations (Act secs. 1341      and 1342).--Sections 30B(h)(6) and 30C(e)(2) separate      business and personal credits for purposes of applying      limitations on the credits. Credit property is treated as      subject to the business credit limitations if it is      depreciable property. Each of these rules provides that the      seller of property to a tax-exempt entity can claim the      credit. The provision provides that the credits for property      sold to a tax-exempt entity are subject to the business      credit limitations.       Expansion of research credit (Act sec. 1351).--The research      credit has an explicit rule preventing amounts from being      taken into account more than once under the credit (i.e.,      preventing double benefits). The provision clarifies that the      rule preventing amounts from being taken into account more      than once also applies to the provisions of the research      credit relating to energy research consortia.       The provision clarifies that qualified research with      respect to energy research consortia must be conducted in the      United States or Puerto Rico. This conforms the treatment of      such qualified research to the treatment of other qualified      research under the research credit in this respect.     Amendments Related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004       Deduction relating to income attributable to domestic      production activities (manufacturing deduction) (Act sec.      102).--With respect to the W-2 wage limitation on the      allowable amount of the domestic production activities      deduction, the Act does not require Forms W-2 actually to be      filed, and does not specify whether the employees must be the      common law employees of the taxpayer. The provision clarifies      that a taxpayer may take into account only wages that are      paid to the common law employees of the taxpayer and that are      reported on a Form W-2 filed with the Social Security      Administration no later than 60 days after the extended due      date for the Form W-2. Thus, the taxpayer may not take into      account wages that were not actually reported. The provision      also addresses situations in which the employer uses an agent      to report its wages.       The provision clarifies that, in computing qualified      production activities income, the domestic production      activities deduction itself is not an allocable deduction.      The provision also clarifies that no inference is intended      with regard to the interpretive relationship between the cost      allocation rules provided with respect to the domestic      production activities deduction and the cost allocation rules      provided with respect to provisions elsewhere in the Act      (e.g., incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the United      States). The provision also corrects a reference to ``income      attributable to domestic production activities'' to refer to      the defined term ``qualified production activities income.''       With regard to the definition of ``domestic production      gross receipts'' as it relates to construction performed in      the United States and engineering or architectural services      performed in the United States for construction projects in      the United States, the provision clarifies that the term      refers only to gross receipts derived from the construction      of real property by a taxpayer engaged in the active conduct      of a construction trade or business, or from engineering or      architectural services performed with respect to real      property by a taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of an      engineering or architectural services trade or business.       The provision clarifies that the term does not include      gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale,      exchange or other disposition of land.       The provision provides that gross receipts derived from      certain contracts (or subcontracts) to manufacture or produce      property for the Federal government are derived from the sale      of such property and, therefore, are domestic production      gross receipts. (Another section of the provision clarifies      the authority of the Secretary to prescribe rules to prevent      the domestic production activities deduction from being      claimed by more than one taxpayer with respect to the same      economic activity described in section 199(c)(4)(A)(i).)       The provision provides that, for purposes of determining      the domestic production gross receipts of a partnership and      its partners, provided all of the interests in the capital      and profits of the partnership are owned by members of the      same expanded affiliated group at all times during the      taxable year of the partnership, then the partnership and all      members of that expanded affiliated group are treated as a      single taxpayer during such period. Thus, for example, assume      such a partnership engages in an activity with respect to      property manufactured by the partners that are members of the      same expanded affiliated group, and the activity would be      treated as a manufacturing activity, but for the fact that      the partnership (rather than the partner) conducts the      activity. Under this provision, then, the gross receipts      derived from the activity are treated as domestic production      gross receipts of the partnership for such taxable year. Once      the partnership has determined its domestic production gross      receipts in this manner, such receipts and the expenses,      losses or deductions that are properly allocable to such      receipts, and any other items that are allocated to partners,      are allocated among the partners in accordance with the      requirements of section 199(d)(1) (as amended). Similarly, if      a partner engages in such an activity with respect to      property manufactured by the partnership, then the gross      receipts derived from the activity are treated as domestic      production gross receipts of the partner. The treatment of      the partners and the partnership as a single taxpayer under      this rule is only for the purpose of determining domestic      production gross receipts.       The provision clarifies that, with respect to the domestic      production activities of a partnership or S corporation, the      deduction under the Act is determined at the partner or      shareholder level. In performing the calculation, each      partner or shareholder generally will take into account such      person's allocable share of the components of the calculation      (including domestic production gross receipts; the cost of      goods sold allocable to such receipts; and other expenses,      losses, or deductions allocable to such receipts) from the      partnership or S corporation as well as any items relating to      the partner     or shareholder's own qualified production activities, if any.       The provision clarifies the treatment provided under the      Act of cooperatives and patrons with respect to the deduction      under section 199. The provision clarifies that a patron who      receives certain payments from an agricultural or      horticultural cooperative that are attributable to qualified      production activities income is allowed a deduction equal to      the portion of the deduction allowed to the cooperative that      is attributable to such income. The provision also clarifies      that the patron's deduction is allowed in the year that the      payment attributable to qualified production activities      income is received. The cooperative's taxable income is not      reduced under section 1382 by the portion of the payment that      does not exceed the portion so deductible by the patron. For      purposes of the deduction under section 199, the provision      clarifies that agricultural or horticultural marketing      cooperatives are treated as having manufactured, produced,      grown, or extracted any qualifying production property      marketed by the organization which its patrons have so      manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted. For purposes of      the deduction under section 199, an agricultural or      horticultural cooperative is a cooperative engaged in the      manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction in whole or      significant part of any agricultural or horticultural      products, or in the marketing of agricultural or      horticultural products.       The provision clarifies the definition of an expanded      affiliated group, so that a corporation eligible for the      deduction with respect to income of a subsidiary must own      more than 50 percent, rather than 50 percent or more, of the      subsidiary's stock by vote and value.       The provision rewrites the rule that the deduction under      section 199 in computing alternative minimum taxable income      (``AMTI'') is the same as in computing the regular tax,      except that, in the case of a corporation, the taxable income      limitation is the corporation's AMTI.       The provision clarifies that unrelated business taxable      income, rather than taxable income, applies for purposes of      section 199(a)(1)(B) in computing the unrelated business      income tax under section 511. (In computing AMTI of an      organization which is a corporation subject to tax under      section 511(a), AMTI applies for purposes of section      199(a)(1)(B). In computing AMTI of an organization other than      a corporation, the section 199 deduction is the same as for      the regular tax. See sec. 199(d)(6).)       The provision clarifies that the manufacturing deduction is      not taken into account in computing any net operating loss or      the amount of any net operating loss carryback or carryover.      Thus, the deduction under section 199 cannot create, or      increase, the amount of a net operating loss deduction.       The provision clarifies the authority of the Secretary to      prescribe rules to prevent the domestic production activities      deduction from being claimed by more than one taxpayer with      respect to the same economic activity described in section      199(c)(4)(A)(i).       The provision clarifies that the manufacturing deduction is      not taken into account in determining the amount of the      alternative tax net operating loss deduction. For example,      assume that for the calendar year 2005, a corporation has      AMTI (before the NOL deduction and before the manufacturing      deduction) and qualified production activities income of $1      million, and has an alternative tax net operating loss      (``ATNOL'') carryover to 2005 of $5 million. Assume that the      taxpayer has sufficient W-2 wages so as not to be limited      under that rule. The ATNOL deduction for 2005 is $900,000 (90      percent of $1 million), reducing AMTI to $100,000. The      taxpayer must then further reduce the AMTI by a manufacturing      deduction of $3,000 (three percent of the lesser of $1      million or $100,000) to $97,000. The ATNOL carryover to 2006      is $4,100,000.       The provision coordinates the computation of adjusted      taxable income of a corporation for purposes of computing a      corporation's limitation on the deduction for interest on      certain indebtedness with the deduction under section 199.      The provision also coordinates the computation of taxable      income for purposes of computing a corporation's charitable      contribution deduction and a taxpayer's deduction for      percentage depletion with respect to oil and gas wells with      the deduction under section 199.       The provision clarifies that, in applying the effective      date of the deduction under section 199, items arising from a      taxable year of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or      trust beginning before 2005 are not taken into account for      purposes of the rules providing that the deduction is      determined at the shareholder, partner or similar level and      the application of the wage limitation with respect to such      entities.       Family members treated as one shareholder of an S      corporation election (Act sec. 231).--The provision repeals      the requirement that a family must elect to be treated as one      shareholder for purposes of determining the number of      shareholders for purposes of subchapter S. The provision also      provides that the determination of whether a common ancestor      is more that six generations removed from the youngest      generation of shareholders is made at the latest of (i) the      date the subchapter S election is made; (ii) the date a      family member first holds stock in the S corporation; or      (iii) October 22, 2004.       The provision treats the estate of a family member as a      member of the family for purposes of determining the number      of shareholders.       The provision also conforms the provision relating to      certain adopted individuals and foster children with the      amendments made by title II of the Working Families Tax      Relief Act of 2004.       Transfer of suspended losses incident to divorce (Act sec.      235).--The effective date of section 235 of the Act is      corrected to provide that it is effective for transfers after      December 31, 2004.       REIT provisions (Act sec. 243).--The provision clarifies      that a REIT may cure de minimis failures of asset      requirements (other than the requirement that the REIT may      not hold more than 10 percent (five percent for certain prior      years) of the value of securities of a single issuer, for      which failure-specific procedures are provided) by using the      same procedures as the REIT may use for larger failures of      asset tests.       The provision clarifies that the new rules that permit the      curing of certain REIT failures apply to failures with      respect to which the requirements of the new rules are      satisfied in taxable years of the REIT beginning after the      date of enactment. Similarly, the provision clarifies that      the new rules governing deficiency dividends that allow the      taxpayer to make a determination by filing a statement with      the IRS apply to statements filed in taxable years of the      REIT beginning after the date of enactment.       It is intended that the provisions of the Act that allow a      REIT to correct failures of REIT qualification without losing      its REIT status apply to corrections of failures for which      the requirements for correction are satisfied after the date      of enactment, regardless of whether such failures occurred in      taxable years beginning on, before, or after the date of      enactment. Similarly, it is intended that the provisions of      the Act that allow deficiency dividends under section 860 to      correct distribution failures, provided the deficiency is      identified in a statement filed after the date of enactment      in accordance with the provisions of the Act, apply to      failures occurring in taxable years beginning on, before, or      after the date of enactment.       The provision clarifies that the new hedging rules apply to      transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after      the date of enactment.       The provision clarifies that securities of a partnership      held by a REIT prior to the date of enactment of the Act,      that would have qualified as straight debt securities if the      Act had never been enacted by virtue of the prior law      requirement that the REIT hold at least 20 percent of the      partnership equity, will continue to qualify (regardless of      whether they were disposed of before the date of enactment or      whether the REIT has disposed of its interest in the      partnership equity to the 1-percent-or-less interest required      by the Act) while held by the REIT (or its successor) until      the earlier of the disposition or the original maturity date      of such securities.       Expensing of certain films and television production costs      (Act sec. 244).--The provision clarifies that the $15 million      production cost limitation and the 75 percent qualified      compensation requirement are determined on an episode-by-     episode basis (not an aggregate basis).       The provision adds rules for recapture as ordinary income      of the deduction for expensing of certain films and      television production costs in a manner similar to the      recapture rules applicable to expensing under Code section      179.       Railroad track maintenance credit (Act sec. 245).--For      purposes of the rule that prevents the claiming of the credit      by more than one eligible taxpayer with respect to the same      mile of track, the provision clarifies that Class II and      Class III railroads that operate track under a lease are not      required to obtain assignment from the track owner in order      to utilize or assign the credit. Under the provision, the      credit is limited in respect of the total number of miles of      track (1) owned or leased by the Class II or Class III      railroad and (2) assigned by the Class II or Class III      railroad for purposes of the credit.       The provision clarifies that a Class I railroad is not      treated as a Class II or III railroad for purposes of the      credit (and it is not eligible to claim the credit with      respect to track it owns) by reason of performing track      maintenance services (on the same or different track) for a      Class II or III railroad.       The provision also clarifies the rules governing the      assignment of track by Class II or III railroads. A track      mile may be assigned only once per tax year, effective at the      close of the tax year, and any track mile assigned may not      also be taken into account by the assignor taxpayer for the      tax year. An assigned track mile is taken into account by the      assignee in the tax year which includes the effective date of      the assignment.       Election to determine corporate tax on certain      international shipping activities using per ton rate (Act      sec. 248).--The provision strikes as deadwood the rule added      by the Act regarding the operation of a qualifying vessel by      a non-electing corporation that is a member of an electing      group.       The provision clarifies section 1354(b) to provide that an      election to determine income tax on certain international      shipping activities using a per ton rate is timely if made on      or before the due date (including extensions) for filing the      tax return for the relevant taxable year.       The provision clarifies the treatment of operating      agreements under the tonnage tax rules. An operating      agreement is not a charter, but is instead an agreement with      an     owner or charterer of a qualifying vessel to provide      operating or management services in respect of a qualifying      vessel, for example, crew, technical, or commercial services.      The provision makes clear that a person providing services      for a vessel under an operating agreement is treated as      operating the vessel and may elect tonnage tax treatment,      assuming the other requirements for such treatment are met.      However, a subcontractor to a person providing services under      an operating agreement is neither treated as providing      services under an operating agreement nor as operating a      vessel for purposes of the tonnage tax. The provision of      equipment, tools, provisions, or supplies would not be      considered an operating agreement or part of an operating      agreement unless such equipment, tools, provisions, or      supplies are provided by the person providing the services      under the operating agreement, and such equipment, tools,      provisions, or supplies are provided in connection with such      services.       Present law provides that in order to elect tonnage tax      treatment, a person must meet a shipping activity requirement      as well as ``operate'' a qualifying vessel. In general, the      shipping activity requirement is met for a taxable year if,      on average during such year, at least 25 percent of the      aggregate tonnage of qualifying vessels ``used'' by the      corporation (or controlled group) are owned by such      corporation (or controlled group) or are chartered to such      corporation (or controlled group) on bareboat charter terms.      It is intended that a person providing services under an      operating agreement is deemed to be ``using'' tonnage of      qualifying vessels, and the appropriate amount of such      tonnage is taken into account for purposes of this test. For      example, if a corporation (not a member of a controlled      group) meets the shipping activity requirement by owning or      bareboat chartering sufficient tonnage of other qualifying      vessels, it will qualify for 82 the tonnage tax provisions in      respect of any qualifying vessel that it is treated as      operating by reason of providing services under an operating      agreement.       The provision clarifies that interests in operating      agreements are taken into account for purposes of allocating      the notional shipping income from the operation of qualifying      vessels among respective ownership, charter, and operating      agreement interests. In addition, in the case of a      partnership operating a vessel, the extent of a partner's      ownership, charter, or operating agreement interest is      determined on the basis of the partner's interest in the      partnership.       The provision makes a clerical amendment by eliminating      subparagraph (B) of section 1355(c)(3) of the Code, because      the rule of subparagraph (B) is encompassed in subparagraph      (A).       Computation of foreign tax credit in determining      alternative minimum tax by farmers and fisherman using income      averaging (Act sec. 314).--The provision clarifies that in      computing the regular tax for purposes of determining the      alternative minimum tax of a farmer or fisherman using income      averaging, the foreign tax credit does not need to be      recomputed.       Reforestation expensing recapture (Act sec. 322).--The      provision clarifies that the amortization provision applies      to trusts and estates, but the deduction applies to estates      (and not to trusts).       The provision provides that Code section 1245 is expanded      to provide recapture rules for the new expensing provisions      of Code section 194(b) (reforestation).       Depreciation allowance for aircraft (Act sec. 336).--     Present-law rules for additional first-year depreciation      provide criteria under which certain noncommercial aircraft,      and certain property having longer production periods (as      described in Code section 168(k)(2)(B)), can qualify for the      extended placed-in-service date. The provision clarifies that      either noncommercial aircraft or property having a longer      production period can qualify.       Recharacterization of overall domestic loss (Act sec.      402)--The provision clarifies that, in a case in which an      overall domestic loss is used as a carryback, the requirement      in Code section 904(g)(2) that the taxpayer have elected the      benefits of the foreign tax credit applies to the taxable      year in which the loss is used.       Look-through rules to apply to dividends from noncontrolled      section 902 corporations (Act sec. 403).--The provision adds      a transition rule under which a taxpayer may elect not to      apply the Act's look-through rules to taxable years beginning      before January 1, 2005.       Look-through treatment for sales of partnership interests      (Act sec. 412).--The provision clarifies that constructive      ownership is taken into account in determining whether a      controlled foreign corporation is a 25-percent owner of a      partnership for purposes of the rule treating a sale of a      partnership interest as a sale of a proportionate share of      the assets of the partnership. This provision conforms the      statutory language to the legislative history of the Act.       Repeal of foreign personal holding company rules and      foreign investment company rules (Act sec. 413).--The      provision repeals as deadwood Code section 532(b)(2),      which coordinated the foreign personal holding company and      accumulated earnings tax regimes, and instead provides      that in computing a corporation's accumulated taxable      income, a deduction is allowed in the amount of any income      of the corporation that resulted in an inclusion for a      U.S. shareholder under Code section 951(a). In the case of      a corporation that is otherwise subject to the accumulated      earnings tax on a gross basis (under Treas. Reg. sec.      1.535-1(b)), appropriate adjustments are made to this      deductible amount to take into account deductions that may      have reduced the inclusion under Code section 951(a), but      which would not otherwise have been allowable in computing      accumulated taxable income. For example, in the case of a      corporation that is generally subject to the accumulated      earnings tax on a gross basis, if Code section 954(b)(5)      has had the effect of reducing the amount of a subpart F      inclusion, it would be appropriate to reduce accumulated      taxable income by the amount that would have been included      under Code section 951(a) without applying Code section      954(b)(5).       The provision also repeals as deadwood Code section 6683,      which addresses the failure of a foreign corporation to file      a required personal holding company return, a rule that is no      longer needed in light of the provision of the Act exempting      foreign corporations from the personal holding company rules.       Modifications to treatment of aircraft leasing and shipping      (Act. sec. 415).--The provision clarifies that, for purposes      of the foreign tax credit limitation as in effect for taxable      years beginning before January 1, 2007, shipping income was      defined to include income that meets the definition of      foreign base company shipping income as in effect before the      definition was repealed under section 415 of the Act. The      repeal is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations      beginning after December 31, 2004, and taxable years of      United States shareholders with or within which such taxable      years of foreign corporations end.       Application of FIRPTA to distributions from REITS (Act sec.      418).--The provision clarifies that the new rules providing      an exception from FIRPTA do not apply to regulated investment      companies (``RICs''), but only to real estate investment      trusts (``REITs'').       The provision clarifies that the period of time during      which a foreign shareholder may not have held more than five      percent of the class of stock with respect to which the      distribution is made is the one-year period ending on the      date of the distribution.       The provision clarifies that the new rules apply to any      distribution of a REIT that is treated as a deduction for a      taxable year of the REIT beginning after the date of      enactment.       The provision clarifies that the new rules also apply to      deficiency dividends under section 860 that are paid after      the date of enactment but that are treated as deductible in      taxable years beginning on or prior to the date of enactment.      Such dividends qualify for the exclusion from FIRPTA      treatment under the Act if the other requirements of the Act      are met.       Incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the United      States (Act sec. 422).--The provision amends Code section      965(a)(2)(B) to clarify that distributions made indirectly      through tiers of controlled foreign corporations are eligible      for the benefits of Code section 965 only if they originate      with a dividend received by one controlled foreign      corporation from another controlled foreign corporation in      the same chain of ownership described in Code section 958(a).      Thus, the first dividend in the sequence cannot be a      portfolio dividend received by a controlled foreign      corporation, for example.       The provision clarifies that for purposes of determining      the amount of excess dividends eligible for the deduction,      only cash dividends received during the elected taxable year      are taken into account under Code section 965(b)(2)(A). (The      base-period amounts described in Code section 965(b)(2)(B)      include non-cash dividends, as well as cash dividends and      certain other amounts.)       The provision also provides the Treasury Secretary with      explicit regulatory authority to prevent the avoidance of the      purposes of Code section 965(b)(3), which reduces the amount      of eligible dividends in certain cases in which an increase      in related-party indebtedness has occurred after October 3,      2004. Regulations issued pursuant to this authority may      include rules to provide that cash dividends are not taken      into account under Code section 965(a) to the extent      attributable to the direct or indirect transfer of cash or      other property from a related person to a controlled foreign      corporation (including through the use of intervening      entities or capital contributions). It is expected that this      authority, which supplements existing principles relating to      the treatment of circular flows of cash, would be used to      prevent the application of the deduction in the case of a      dividend that is effectively funded by the U.S. shareholder      or its affiliates that are not controlled foreign      corporations. It is anticipated that dividends would be      treated as attributable to a related-party transfer of cash      or other property under this authority only in cases in which      the transfer is part of an arrangement undertaken with a      principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of the related-     party debt rule of Code section 965(b)(3).       For example, if a U.S. shareholder, as part of a plan to      avoid the purposes of Code section 965(b)(3), contributes      cash or other property to a controlled foreign corporation      and then has the controlled foreign corporation pay a      dividend to the U.S. shareholder (either to meet the base      period repatriation level or as a dividend described in Code      section 965(a)), or has the controlled foreign corporation      lend the cash or other property to another controlled foreign      corporation which     then pays a dividend to the U.S. shareholder, regulations      issued under this authority may require the U.S. shareholder      to reduce its Code section 965(a) qualifying dividends by the      amount of cash or other property contributed. In addition, if      as part of a plan to avoid the purposes of Code section      965(b)(3), a U.S. shareholder makes a loan to a controlled      foreign corporation after October 3, 2004, such controlled      foreign corporation pays a dividend to the U.S. shareholder,      and then the U.S. shareholder disposes of the stock of the      controlled foreign corporation, such that the U.S.      shareholder is not related to the controlled foreign      corporation on the last day of the U.S. shareholder's      election year, regulations issued under this authority may      require the U.S. shareholder to reduce its Code section      965(a) qualifying dividends by the amount of the loan.       It is anticipated that many other transfers of cash or      other property will not be regarded as effectively funding      dividend repatriations for purposes of this regulatory      authority. For example, if a U.S. shareholder, in the      ordinary course of its trade or business, transfers cash or      other property to a controlled foreign corporation in      exchange for property or the provision of services, such a      transfer will not be considered to have a principal purpose      of avoiding the purposes of Code section 965(b)(3). Likewise,      if a related person transfers cash to a controlled foreign      corporation in a sale of assets by the controlled foreign      corporation to the related person for non- tax business      purposes, such a transfer will not be considered to have a      principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code section      965(b)(3). Similarly, a transfer of cash or other property      to a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of      providing initial or ongoing working capital to the      controlled foreign corporation or expanding the controlled      foreign corporation's operations will not be considered to      have a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code      section 965(b)(3). In addition, a transfer by a U.S.      shareholder in repayment of an obligation owed to a      controlled foreign corporation will not be considered to      have a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code      section 965(b)(3), absent special circumstances indicating      that the U.S. shareholder is using the repayment      effectively to fund the dividend repatriation. It is      expected that these special circumstances would not be      found to exist in cases involving the repayment of short-     term debt (i.e., debt with a term of no more than three      years).       In light of the timing of this bill and the fact that Code      section 965 will expire for many affected taxpayers at the      end of 2005, it is understood that the Treasury Department in      all likelihood will not issue regulations under this      authority. If no such regulations are issued, it would be      expected that generally applicable tax principles would be      invoked to reach results consistent with the principles and      examples described above.       The provision also clarifies the definition of ``applicable      financial statement'' under Code section 965(c)(1). In the      case of a U.S. shareholder that is required to file a      financial statement with the Securities and Exchange      Commission (or is included in such a statement filed by      another person), the provision clarifies that the applicable      financial statement is the most recent audited annual      statement that was so filed and certified on or before June      30, 2003. For purposes of this rule, a restatement of a      previously filed and certified financial statement that      occurs after June 30, 2003 does not alter the statement's      status as having been filed and certified on or before June      30, 2003. In addition, the provision clarifies that the term      ``applicable financial statement'' includes the notes that      form an integral part of the financial statement; other      materials, including work papers or materials that may be      filed for some purposes with a financial statement but that      do not form an integral part of such statement, may not be      relied upon for purposes of producing an earnings or tax      number under the provision. For example, if a note that is an      integral part of an applicable financial statement states      that the U.S. shareholder has not provided for deferred taxes      on $1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign      subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be      reinvested permanently (or indefinitely) abroad, the U.S.      shareholder's limit under Code section 965(b)(1) is $1      billion. If an applicable financial statement does not show a      specific earnings or tax amount described in Code section      965(b)(1)(B) or (C), a taxpayer cannot rely on underlying      work papers or other materials that are not a part of the      financial statement to derive such an amount. If an      applicable financial statement states that an earnings or tax      amount is indeterminate (or that determination of a specific      amount of earnings or taxes is not feasible), then the      earnings or tax amount so described is treated as being zero.      A specific earnings or tax amount can be relied upon for      purposes of Code section 965(b)(1) as long as such amount is      presented on the applicable financial statement as satisfying      the indefinite reversal criterion of Accounting Principles      Board Opinion 23 (``APB 23'') relating to deferred taxes on      undistributed foreign earnings, and is disclosed as required      under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 109      (``FAS 109''), regardless of whether the exact words      ``permanently reinvested'' are used, and regardless of      whether APB 23 or FAS 109 is cited by name.       The provision also clarifies that the expense disallowance      rule of Code section 965(d)(2) applies only to deductions for      expenses that are directly allocable to the deductible      portion of the dividend. For these purposes, an expense is      ``directly allocable'' if it relates directly to generating      the dividend income in question. Thus, deductions for direct      expenses such as certain legal and accounting fees and      stewardship costs are disallowed under this provision.      Deductions for indirect expenses such as interest, research      and experimentation costs, sales and marketing costs, state      and local taxes, general and administrative costs, and      depreciation and amortization are not disallowed under this      provision.       In addition, the provision clarifies that foreign taxes      that are not allowed as foreign tax credits by reason of Code      section 965(d) do not give rise to income inclusions under      Code section 78.       The provision also clarifies that under Code section      965(e)(1), the only foreign tax credits that may be used to      reduce the tax on the nondeductible portion of a dividend are      credits for foreign taxes that are attributable to the      nondeductible portion of the dividend. Credits for other      foreign taxes cannot be used to reduce the tax on the      nondeductible portion of the dividend.       The provision also clarifies Code section 965(f) to provide      that an election to apply Code section 965 is timely if made      on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing      the tax return for the relevant taxable year.       Treatment of deduction for State and local sales taxes      under the alternative minimum tax (Act sec. 501).--The      provision clarifies that the itemized deduction for State and      local sales taxes does not apply in calculating alternative      minimum taxable income.       Naval shipbuilding (Act sec. 708).--The provision provides      that the five-taxable year period for use of the 40/60      percentage-of-completion/capitalized cost method is      determined with respect to the construction commencement      date, not the contract commencement date. The provision      further provides that any change of accounting method      required by the provision is not subject to section 481.       Credit for production of refined coal (Act sec. 710).--The      provision strikes the word ``synthetic'' from the definition      of refined coal to carry out the intent that qualifying solid      fuels produced from coal (including lignite) meet two new      primary standards, an emissions reduction test and a value      enhancement test, and not also be subject to a ``chemical      change'' test promulgated under Treasury guidance for certain      fuels from coal to qualify for credit under Code sec. 29.       Tax treatment of expatriated entities and their foreign      parents (Act sec. 801).--The provision clarifies that the      inversion gain rule of Code section 7874(a)(1) does not apply      to an entity that is an expatriated entity with respect to an      entity that is treated as a domestic corporation under Code      section 7874(b).       Expatriation of individuals (Act sec. 804).--The provision      clarifies that the exception to the requirement of minimal      prior physical presence in the United States is both for (i)      teachers, students, athletes, and foreign government      individuals, and (ii) individuals receiving medical      attention.       The provision clarifies that the Act does not create an      additional requirement that an individual file a statement      under section 6039G if such a filing was not already required      under present law.       The provision clarifies that taxpayers who lose citizenship      or terminate long-term resident status will continue to be      treated for Federal tax purposes as citizens or long-term      residents until they meet the notice and information      reporting requirements of section 7701(n).       Penalty for failure to disclose reportable transactions      (Act sec. 811).--The provision clarifies that the penalty for      failing to disclose participation in a reportable transaction      applies to returns and statements that are filed after the      date of enactment, without regard to the original or extended      due date for such return or statement.       Accuracy-related penalties for listed transactions and      reportable transactions with a significant tax avoidance      purpose (Act sec. 812).--The provision clarifies that      underpayments attributable to an understatement resulting      from participation in a listed transaction or a reportable      transaction with a significant tax avoidance purpose are not      subject to accuracy-related penalties under section 6662 to      the extent that an accuracy-related penalty under section      6662A is imposed upon such underpayment. (However, in the      case of underpayments resulting from substantial valuation      misstatements, the accuracy-related penalty under section      6662A does not apply to the extent that the accuracy-related      penalty under section 6662 is applied to such underpayments      (i.e., the section 6662 penalty amount is increased under      section 6662(h) because the substantial valuation      misstatement is determined to be a gross valuation      misstatement).) The provision clarifies that accuracy-related      penalties under section 6662A do not apply to underpayments      to which a fraud penalty under section 6663 is applied.       The provision clarifies that, with respect to disqualified      opinions, the strengthened reasonable cause exception to      section 6662A penalties does not apply to the opinion of a      tax advisor if (1) the opinion was provided to the taxpayer      before the date of enactment, (2) the opinion relates to a      transaction entered into before the date of enactment, and      (3) the tax treatment of items relating to the transaction      was included on a return or     statement filed by the taxpayer before the date enactment.       Statute of limitations for unreported listed transactions      (Act sec. 814).--The Act provides that the statute of      limitations with respect to an undisclosed listed transaction      does not expire until one year after the earlier of (1) the      date on which the Secretary is furnished the required      information, or (2) the date on which a material advisor      satisfies the list maintenance requirements with respect to a      request by the Secretary. The provision clarifies that a      ``material advisor'' for this purpose includes either a      material advisor as defined in section 6111(b)(1) or, in the      case of material aid, assistance, or advice rendered on or      before the date of enactment, a material advisor as defined      in Treasury regulations under section 6112. (See Treas. Reg.      sec. 301.6112-1(c)(2).)       Material advisor list maintenance requirement and penalty      (Act sec. 815).--The provision clarifies that the penalty      under section 6708 for failing to comply with the section      6112 list maintenance requirements applies to both (1)      material advisors with respect to reportable transactions      under present-law section 6112, and (2) organizers and      sellers of potentially abusive 88 tax shelters under prior-     law section 6112. (This provision also would clarify the      determination of the date on which a material advisor      satisfies the list maintenance requirements for purposes of      the extended statute of limitations for undisclosed listed      transactions under section 814 of the Act.)       Minimum holding period for withholding taxes on gain and      income other than dividends (Act sec. 832).--The provision      clarifies that the exception from the minimum holding period      for certain withholding taxes paid by registered or licensed      brokers and dealers on income and gain from securities also      apply to gain from the sale of stock.       Disallowance of certain partnership loss transfers (Act      sec. 833).--The provision redrafts the wording of the      provision relating to basis adjustments to undistributed      partnership property in Code section 734(b) to clarify that      it applies in the case of a distribution of property to a      partner by a partnership with respect to which there is a      substantial basis reduction.       Repeal of special rules for FASITs and modifications to      rules for REMICs (Act sec. 835).--The provision clarifies      that, if more than 50 percent of the obligations transferred      to, or purchased by, a REMIC are originated by a government      entity and are principally secured by an interest in real      property, then each obligation originated by a government      entity and transferred to, or purposed by, the REMIC is      treated as principally secured by an interest in real      property. Thus, the provision more closely aligns this rule      with the ``principally secured'' standard that generally is      provided by the definition of a qualified mortgage, and the      provision clarifies that the treatment of obligations as      principally secured by an interest in real property under      this rule does not extend to obligations that are not      originated by a government entity.       Importation or transfer of built-in losses (Act sec.      836).--The provision provides that on the tax-free      liquidation of a corporation, the fair market value basis      rule applies only to property described in section      362(e)(1)(B), i.e., property which became subject to U.S.      income tax on the liquidation. The provision is drafted to      conform the scope of the liquidation rule to the rule      applicable to transfers of property by shareholders to      corporations.       The provision provides that the election under section      362(e)(2)(C) to apply the basis limitation to the      transferor's stock basis is made at such time and in such      form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe, and, once      made, is irrevocable.       Sale of principal residence following section 1031 exchange      (Act sec. 840).--The provision clarifies that the exclusion      under section 121 is denied on the sale or exchange of a      principal residence by a taxpayer who did not recognize gain      under section 1031 on the exchange in which the residence was      acquired (or a by person whose basis in the residence is      determined in whole or in part with reference to the basis of      the residence in the hands of that taxpayer). The provision      also makes a clerical change to the numbering of paragraphs.       Limitation on deductions allocable to property used by tax-     exempt entities (Act sec. 849).--The Act establishes rules to      limit deductions that are allocable to tax-exempt use      property. For this purpose, the Act generally defines ``tax-     exempt use property'' by reference to the definition provided      in section 168(h). Section 168(h) generally provides that      tax-exempt use property includes tangible property that is      leased to a tax-exempt entity, as well as certain property      owned by a partnership that has a tax-exempt partner and      provides for certain special allocations. The provision      clarifies that the deduction limitation rules established      by the Act apply without regard to whether the tax-exempt      use property is treated as such by reason of a lease or      otherwise (e.g., because the property is owned by a      partnership that has a tax-exempt partner and provides for      certain special allocations). In the case of property      treated as tax-exempt use property other than by reason of      a lease, the provision clarifies that the deduction      limitation rules generally are effective for property      acquired after March 12, 2004.       Reporting with respect to donations of motor vehicles,      boats and airplanes (Act sec. 884).--The provision clarifies      that the acknowledgement by the donee organization is to      include whether the donee organization provided any goods or      services in consideration of the vehicle, and a description      and good faith estimate of the value of any such goods or      services, or, if the goods or services consist solely of      intangible religious benefits, a statement to that effect.       Nonqualified deferred compensation plans (Act sec. 885).--     The provision clarifies that the additional tax and interest      under the nonqualified deferred compensation provision of the      Act are not treated as payments of regular tax for      alternative minimum tax purposes. The provision also      clarifies that the application of the rule providing that      certain additional deferrals must be for a period of not less      than five years is not limited to the first payment for which      deferral is made. The provision also clarifies that Treasury      Department guidance providing a limited period during which      plans can conform to the requirements applies to plans      adopted before January 1, 2005. The provision also clarifies      that the effective date of the funding provisions relating to      offshore trusts and financial triggers is January 1, 2005.      Thus, for example, amounts set aside in an offshore trust      before such date for the purpose of paying deferred      compensation and plans providing for the restriction of      assets in connection with a change in the employer's      financial health are subject to the funding provisions on      January 1, 2005. Under the provision, not later than 90 days      after the date of enactment of this provision, the Secretary      of the Treasury shall issue guidance under which a      nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is in violation      of the requirements of the funding provisions relating to      offshore trusts and financial triggers will be treated as not      violating such requirements if the plan comes into      conformance with such requirements during a limited period as      specified by the Secretary in guidance. For example, trusts      or assets set aside outside of the United States that would      otherwise result in income inclusion and interest under the      provision as of January 1, 2005, may be modified to come into      conformance with the provision during the limited period of      time as specified by the Secretary.       Identified straddles (Act sec. 888).--The provision      clarifies that taxpayers are permitted to identify a straddle      as an identified straddle under section 1092(a)(2)(B) (by      making a clear and unambiguous identification on their books      and records) without regard to whether the Secretary has      prescribed regulations under the mandate in that section. The      provision provides that the Secretary's mandate under the      provision is to issue guidance in the form of regulations or      in another form.       Modification of treatment of transfers to creditors in      divisive reorganizations (Act sec. 898).--The provision      clarifies that the amount of the adjusted basis of property      that is taken into account for purposes of Code section      361(b)(3) is reduced by the liabilities assumed (within the      meaning of Code section 357(c)).       Nonqualified preferred stock (Act sec. 899).--The provision      clarifies that the ``real and meaningful likelihood''      requirement under the Act (which applies so that stock shall      not be treated as participating in corporate growth to any      significant extent unless there is a ``real and meaningful      likelihood'' of the shareholder actually participating in the      earnings and growth of the corporation) applies also for      purposes of determining whether stock is not stock that is      ``limited and preferred as to dividends.''       Consistent amortization period for intangibles and      treatment of partnership organizational expenses (Act sec.      902).--The provision corrects the reference to ``taxpayers''      to refer to ``partnerships'' in the rules relating to      deduction or amortization of partnership organizational      expenses.       Limitation of employer deduction for certain entertainment      expenses (Act sec. 907).--Section 907 of the Act limits the      deduction for certain entertainment expenses with respect to      specified individuals. A specified individual is defined as      any individual subject to the requirements of section 16(a)      of the Securities Act of 1934 with respect to the taxpayer or      who would be subject to such requirements if the taxpayer      were an issuer of equity securities. The provision clarifies      that a specified individual includes an individual who is      subject to the requirements of section 16(a) of the      Securities Act of 1934 with respect to a related entity of      the taxpayer or who would be subject to such requirements if      the related entity were an issuer of equity securities.     Amendment Related to the Working Families Tax Relief Act of          2004       Uniform definition of child (Act secs. 201, 203 and 207).--     The provision makes conforming amendments, consistent with      those enacted with respect to various other provisions, for      purposes of health savings accounts, the dependent care      credit, and dependent care assistance programs. Under the      conforming amendments, an individual may qualify as a      dependent for these limited purposes without regard to      whether the individual has gross income that exceeds an      otherwise applicable gross income limitation or is married      and files a joint return. In addition, such an individual who      is treated as a dependent under these conforming amendment      provisions is not subject to the general rule that a      dependent of a taxpayer shall be treated as having no      dependents for the taxable year of such individual beginning      in such calendar year.       The provision clarifies Code section 152(e) to permit a      divorced or legally separated custodial parent to waive, by      written declaration, his or her right to claim a child as a      dependent for purposes of the dependency exemption and child      credit (but not with respect to other child-related tax      benefits). By means of the waiver, the noncustodial parent is      granted the right to claim the child as a dependent for these      purposes. The provision clarifies that the waiver rules under      the uniform definition of qualifying child operate as under      prior law.     Amendment Related to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief          Reconciliation Act of 2003       Bonus depreciation (Act sec. 201).--Present-law rules for      additional first-year depreciation provide criteria under      which certain noncommercial aircraft, and certain property      having longer production periods (as described in Code      section 168(k)(2)(B)), can qualify for the extended placed-     in-service date. The provision clarifies that property      acquired and placed in service during 2005 pursuant to a      written binding contract which was entered into after May      5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, is eligible for 50-     percent additional first-year depreciation deduction.       The provision corrects the reference to a date in the rules      applicable to qualified New York Liberty Zone property so      that it refers to the January 1, 2005, date in the      corresponding rule for additional first-year depreciation in      Code section 168(k).     Amendments Related to the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act          of 2001       Rules relating to disclosure of taxpayer return information      (Act sec. 201).--The provision corrects cross references      within the disclosure rules (Code section 6103) relating to      disclosure to the National Archives and Records      Administration.     Amendments Related to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief          Reconciliation Act of 2001       Option to treat elective deferral as after-tax Roth      contributions (Act sec. 617).--A special rule allows      employees with at least 15 years of service with certain      organizations to make additional elective deferrals to a tax-     deferred annuity, subject to an annual and cumulative limit.      The cumulative limit is $15,000, reduced by any additional      pretax elective deferrals made for preceding years. For      taxable years beginning after 2005, plans may allow employees      to designate pretax elective deferrals as Roth contributions.      Under the provision, the $15,000 cumulative limit is reduced      also by designated Roth contributions made for preceding      years.       Equitable treatment for contributions to defined      contribution plans (Act sec. 632).--Under the law as in      effect before the Act, a special limit applied to      contributions to tax-sheltered annuities for foreign      missionaries with adjusted gross income not exceeding      $17,000. The special limit was inadvertently dropped by the      Act. The special limit was restored in a technical correction      in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, but      did not accurately reflect the pre-Act rule. The provision      revises the special limit to reflect the pre-Act rule.     Amendments Related to the Internal Revenue Service          Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998       Special procedures for third-party summons (Act sec.      3415).--Code section 7609(c)(2)(F) provides that section 7609      does not apply to a summons described in subsection (f) or      (g), which refers to a John Doe summons and certain emergency      summonses, respectively. The provision corrects this      reference, so as to make only the notice procedures of      section 7609(a) inapplicable to a John Doe summons or an      emergency summons, rather than making the entire section 7609      inapplicable.     Amendments Related to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997       Tentative carryback and refund adjustments and treatment of      carrybacks or adjustments for certain unused deductions (Act      sec. 1055).--The provision corrects a reference in rules      relating to tentative carryback and refund adjustments to      refer to coordination rules in Code section 6611(f)(4)(B).      The provision also corrects a reference in rules relating to      92 carrybacks or adjustments of certain unused deductions to      refer to the filing date within the meaning of Code section      6611(f)(4)(B).       Adjustments to basis of stock in controlled foreign      corporations (Act sec. 1112(b)).--The provision clarifies      that the basis adjustments of Code section 961(c) apply not      only with respect to the stock of the controlled foreign      corporation that earns the subpart F income that gives rise      to the basis adjustments, but also with respect to the stock      of higher-tier controlled foreign corporations in the same      chain of ownership.       Notice of certain transfers to foreign persons (Act sec.      1144).--The provision corrects the omission of a conjunction      in the description of transfers that are generally subject to      certain information reporting requirements.     Amendment Related to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of          1990       Depreciation of certain solar- or wind-powered equipment      (Act sec. 11813).--The provision clarifies that 5-year      property includes certain heating, cooling, and other      equipment using solar or wind (rather than solar and wind)      energy.     Amendment Related to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of          1987       Clarification of earnings and profits and stock basis where      LIFO recapture tax applies (Act sec. 10227).--Under present      law, the LIFO recapture amount is included in the income of a      C corporation that becomes an S corporation for its last      taxable year that it was a C corporation (sec. 1363(d)). Any      increase in tax by reason of this inclusion is payable in      four equal annual installments. The provision provides that      the rules relating to (1) the prohibition on adjustments of      earnings and profits of an S corporation and (2) the      requirement to reduce the basis of stock of the S corporation      by reason of nondeductible expenses do not apply to any      corporate tax imposed by reason of section 1363(d). No      inference is intended as to the treatment of other corporate      taxes.     Clerical amendments       The provisions include clerical and typographical      amendments to the Code, which are effective upon enactment.                          B. Other Corrections     Amendments Related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004       Expansion of bank S corporation eligible shareholders to      include IRAs (Act sec. 233).--The provision expands the      provision in the Act allowing certain bank stock to be held      by an IRA (or to be sold by an IRA to the beneficiary) to      include stock in a depository holding company (as defined in      section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). A      depository holding company includes a bank holding company      and a thrift holding company.       Exclusion of investment securities income from passive      income test for bank S corporations (Act sec. 237).--The      provision expands the rule in the Act which provides that, in      the case of a bank, bank holding company, or financial      holding company, certain interest and dividend income is not      treated as passive under the S corporation passive investment      income rules. Under the provision, this rule applies to a      bank and to a depository holding company (as defined in      section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). A      depository holding company includes a bank holding company      and a thrift holding company.       Information returns for qualified subchapter S subsidiaries      (Act sec. 239).--The provision provides that an S corporation      and a qualified subchapter S subsidiary are recognized as      separate entities for purposes of making information returns,      except as otherwise provided by the Treasury Department.                          ____________________
