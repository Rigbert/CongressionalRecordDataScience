Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  On Monday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour business and noon for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. In addition to several bills under suspension of the rules, a list of those bills of course will be made available by the close of business today, we will consider a resolution in commemoration of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. in a pro forma session. There will be no votes. No legislative business or votes are expected. The tragic loss of Mr. Gillmor saddened us all. His funeral is on that day, and many Members will be attending. It will take place that morning in Ohio.  There will later in the day, when those who are going to Ohio return, on the steps of the Capitol at 4:30 p.m. be a meeting of the Members who are here from both the Senate and the House in remembrance of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, in that tragic and vicious attack on our country and on so many innocent people.  The House will not meet on Wednesday or Thursday in observance of Rosh Hashanah and will meet at 10 a.m. in pro forma session on Friday, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.
