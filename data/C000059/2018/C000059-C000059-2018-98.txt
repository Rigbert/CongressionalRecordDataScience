Chairman, I just want to note that this bill provides $10 million above the President's request for Superfund Enforcement and $12 million above the fiscal 2018 enacted level for the entire Superfund program. We attempted to find middle ground on enforcement while also prioritizing on-the-ground cleanup efforts that returns land to productive uses.  I certainly appreciate the gentlewoman's support for the interest in the Superfund program, and while the amendment does not do as she intends, this amendment is something we are unable to support at this time.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
