Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I have to take issue with the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin). She says this bill involves itself in the most personal of family decisions. How does it involve itself in a family decision when the family does not even know about it? And what this bill requires is that the family at least know about the fact that their daughter is being taken across a State line in circumvention of a State law requiring parental involvement.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson).
