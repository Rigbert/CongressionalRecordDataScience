Mr. Speaker, President Bush has returned from a successful summit in Moscow. As the Cold War recedes more and more into memory, our relations with Russia continue to improve, as they should. Russia has made a significant contribution to the struggle against terrorism since the attacks on the United States last September. While there remain serious differences in the area of human rights, foreign policy, and economics, we should welcome President Putin's ``turn to the West'' and encourage Russia to further integrate into an international community of mutual security, free trade, and democratic structures.  Nevertheless, over this summit banquet of warm words about the ``new strategic relationship'' looms a ``Banquo's Ghost'' of tragic and monumental proportions.  I refer to the war in Chechnya--the subject of a recent hearing of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I co-chair--which continues to wreak havoc and death on combatants and non-combatants alike. The brutality of the so-called ``anti-terrorist operation'' of the Russian military has been amply documented by reputable Russian and international organizations. Bloody military ``sweeps'' of civilian areas, bestial ``filtration camps'' and ``holding pits'' have become hallmarks of what passes for Moscow's military strategy.  One month ago, the Helsinki Commission heard chilling testimony from Ms. Aset Chadaeva, a nurse from Chechnya who resided in a community near Grozny, Chechnya's capital. Ms. Chadaeva described an event in February 2000, when the Russian military carried out one of its most notorious ``anti-terrorists'' operations:       Young Chechen men living in Chechnya today have two      choices: to wage war or to wait for Russian soldiers to      arrest or kill them. All three of my brothers were illegally      detained by Russian servicemen. One of my brothers--     officially classified as disabled because of his poor      eyesight--was severely beaten by Russian soldiers in my      presence. When I asked the soldiers why they were arresting      him, they told me: ``He's a Chechen! That's reason enough!''      I treated women who had been raped by Russian soldiers, and      I've also seen the bodies of women who had been killed after      being raped. During both wars, I buried many dead. Bodies      were left lying in the streets. I, my brothers, and my      neighbors collected them so they wouldn't be eaten by dogs.  In February 2001, the remains of over fifty persons were found in a mass grave in a village located less than a mile from the Russian military headquarters in Chechnya. Russian authorities attribute their deaths to Chechen partisans.  In 2000 and 2001, the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva condemned the widespread violence against civilians and alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law'' by Russian forces. I would note that even Chechen officials who have sided with Moscow in the conflict with the secessionist movement have criticized the reign of terror created by the Russian military in Chechnya. Unfortunately, efforts to have a resolution passed this year at the HumanRights Commission failed with allies and friends casting the swing votes either in opposition to the resolution offered by the European Union or abstaining. The United States does not currently have a seat on the Commission and thus was not voting.  A Human Rights Watch report of February 2002 entitled ``Swept Under: Torture, Forced Disappearances, and Extrajudicial Killings During Sweep Operations in Chechnya'' describes the ``sweeps'' conducted by the Russian military in the summer of 2001:       Troops rounded up several thousand Chechens, mostly without      any form of due process, and took them to temporary military      bases in or near the villages. According to eyewitnesses,      soldiers extrajudicially executed at least eleven detainees,      and at least two detainees ``disappeared'' in detention. . .      . Twelve former detainees [gave] detailed testimony of      torture and ill-treatment, including electric shocks, severe      beatings, and being forced to remain in ``stress position.''      Eyewitnesses also gave testimony about widespread extortion,      looting, and destruction of civilian property.  Eventually, Russia's top military officer admitted that the troops had committed ``widespread crimes.'' International revulsion against the conduct of these ``sweeps'' was so great that in March of this year, the Russian military introduced ``Order No. 80,'' according to which ``sweeps'' are to be conducted ``only in the presence of procurators but also of the local authorities and the organs of internal affairs,'' and local authorities are to be provided with a list of detainees. However, reports by human rights groups indicate that even these minimal requirements are not being observed on the ground. In a rare admission, the military commander in Chechnya has acknowledged that innocent people have disappeared during the ``sweeps.''  In October 2000, Human Rights Watch issued ``Welcome to Hell,'' a vivid and horrifying description of arbitrary detention, torture and extortion in Chechnya. As described in the report, groups of Chechen non-combatants, usually men of military age, are detained on suspicion of participation or collaboration with Chechen guerrillas, and subjected to brutal and humiliating interrogations. This is the description of the procedure followed at the infamous Chernokozovo prison:       Detainees at Chernokozovo were beaten both during      interrogation and during nighttime sessions when guards      utterly ran amok. During interrogation, detainees were forced      to crawl on the ground and were beaten so severely that some      sustained broken ribs and injuries to their kidneys, liver,      testicles, and feet. Some were also tortured with electric      shocks.  In many cases, a detainee was released only after relatives or a loved one paid a bribe to his captors. In other cases, the detainee simply disappeared. Chechnya is filled today with desperate souls seeking word of their missing loved ones who are presumed dead.  Even if the Russian Government manages to create a graveyard in Chechnya and call it peace, it will be a Pyrrhic victory, sowing the seeds of social disintegration in Russia. The prominent Russian joumalist and military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has written, ``The complete impunity of the military leaders is leading to the moral decay of their subordinates.'' He concludes that ``the war in Chechnya is serving to destroy both the armed forces and the [Russian] state.''  Mr. Speaker, these comments should not be seen as an endorsement of Chechen separatism, and we must frankly admit that some Chechen partisans have been linked with international terrorist organizations who see Chechnya as a staging ground for ``jihad'' against Moscow. I am fully aware of the depredations visited upon the people of the North Caucasus by marauding kidnappers, highjackers and terrorists. According to press reports, some Chechen guerrillas have executed ``traitors'' who work for the pro-Moscow administration in Chechnya.  But this does not absolve the Government of Russia from having to live up to basic standards of conduct such as the Geneva Conventions and the Code of Conduct of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``Anti-terrorist operations'' and ``territorial integrity'' are not synonymous with waging total and barbaric war against one's own citizens.  How many more bodies will show up in mass graves? How many young Russian soldiers' bodies will be sent homes to grieving parents in Russia? How many more displaced persons will spend another winter in tents?  The Administration has called upon Chechnya's leadership to ``immediately and unconditionally cut all contacts with international terrorist groups, while calling for ``accountability for [human rights] violations on all sides,'' and a political solution to the conflict. I urge the Administration to continue to use every appropriate opportunity to condemn human rights violations in Chechnya, and impress upon Moscow the need for a just political solution. I trust that the return of the United States to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva will afford one more such opportunity.  The last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, once called Afghanistan a ``bleeding wound.'' Chechnya is now the ``bleeding wound'' for the Russian Federation. I say this as someone who wishes Russia and the people of Russia to prosper. The time for a cease-fire and serious negoitiations is at hand.                          ____________________
