President, let me explain to the body what the Lott amendment does. If you voted in favor of the Durbin-Bond amendment to give full deductibility of insurance premiums to self-employed small businesses and farmers, the Lott amendment eliminates that vote. If you voted with Senator Torricelli of New Jersey for lead screening under Medicaid to protect children, the Lott amendment eliminates that. If you voted with Senator Torricelli on special provisions in Medicare for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, the Lott amendment eliminates that. If you voted with Senator Burns to change business accounting to make it more fair to small businesses, the Lott amendment eliminates it.  This is done over and over in the House of Representatives by the Rules Committee. It clears the deck of all the activity and progress we have made. It is an effort to make a tabula rasa the last amendment of the day. If you believe the amendments we voted for are worth standing behind, I urge you to vote ``no'' on the Lott amendment.
