J. Res. 15. A joint resolution to revise United States policy on Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 15       Whereas in October 2002, Congress approved, and the      President signed into law, the Authorization for Use of      Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law      107-243);       Whereas the preamble of Public Law 107-243 sets forth the      threats to the national security of the United States that      required the authorization for the use of force, and those      threats were the Iraqi regime led by Saddam Hussein, its      weapons of mass destruction programs, its past record of      using chemical weapons, and its record of harboring and      supporting international terrorist organizations;       Whereas Saddam Hussein has been executed after conviction      for committing crimes against humanity, United States      intelligence and military units have not discovered weapons      of mass destruction in Iraq, and thorough reviews by the Iraq      Survey Group and the Special Advisor to the Director of      Central Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction      concluded that Iraq did not have any active weapons of mass      destruction programs in the final years of the Saddam Hussein      regime;       Whereas with the removal of the Iraqi regime led by Saddam      Hussein, the determination that there were no weapons of mass      destruction in Iraq, and the establishment of a democratic      constitution and a freely-elected government in Iraq, the      United States objectives set forth in Public Law 107-243 are      no longer relevant to the current situation;       Whereas sectarian violence is the primary cause of      instability in Iraq;       Whereas, Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable      political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the      failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary      cause of increasing violence in Iraq;       Whereas the responsibility for halting sectarian violence      in Iraq must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq and      Iraqi security forces, and not United States Armed Forces;       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``United States      Policy in Iraq Resolution of 2007''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this joint resolution to repeal the      authorization for the use of force provided in 2002, to      transition United States Armed Forces in Iraq to a more      limited mission, and to secure the phased redeployment from      Iraq of such forces not essential to that new mission.     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF 2002 RESOLUTION.       The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq      Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is repealed.     SEC. 4.
