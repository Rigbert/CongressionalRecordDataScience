 As the chairman knows, I have been a long-time advocate of our Nation's job training programs as an effective tool to help people get the skills they need to secure family-wage jobs, improve their quality of life, and keep our communities healthy and competitive. In fact, I believe that giving workers the opportunity to grow their skills is one of the critical elements of our Nation's economic security. That's why I fought for the passage of the Workforce Investment Act in 1998 and will continue to push for its reauthorization and increased funding levels for its job training programs. Workforce boards around the country, including those in my home State of Washington, administer great job training programs that help millions of Americans get off unemployment rolls or out of low-paying, dead-end jobs.  I think the program that my colleague described sounds like an initiative that is certainly worth study. Indeed, any ideas that could help even more people avoid the economic turmoil and emotional hardship foreclosures cause for themselves and their families should be considered.
