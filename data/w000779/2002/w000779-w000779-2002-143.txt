Collins) submitted the following concurrent resolution; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                            S. Con. Res. 94       Whereas census estimates indicate that some 42,000,000      people in the United States are without health insurance      coverage, many of whom are among the most vulnerable and can      be financially devastated by serious illness, disease, or      accident;       Whereas studies have shown that people with health      insurance are healthier than those who are uninsured and      receive care through emergency rooms or safety net health      care services, because the insured are entitled to, and      receive, more preventive care, follow-up care, and care for      chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure;       Whereas over 17,300,000 of the uninsured are employed but      are not offered health insurance through their employers;       Whereas such employers are small business owners who are      often unaware of the benefits of offering health insurance,      including that such benefits are tax deductible, reduce      employee turnover, and reduce employee sick days;       Whereas over 16,000,000 people in the United States, more      than \1/3\ of the uninsured, are in families where at least 1      member of the family has been offered employer based health      care coverage but has declined coverage;       Whereas many individuals are eligible for public assistance      programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance      Program, known as SCHIP, and the medicaid program, but are      not currently enrolled due primarily to lack of outreach,      education, and accessible enrollment processes;       Whereas studies have shown that many individuals and small      businesses are unaware of the various options they have for      obtaining affordable health care coverage;       Whereas surveys have shown that many individuals who cite      expense as the reason for not purchasing insurance find      insurance affordable once they are informed of the true cost      of various options; and       Whereas education about health care coverage helps      uninsured individuals and employers understand the critical      value of health insurance as a preventive measure and the      ways to keep their health insurance premiums manageable once      they have health care coverage: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month be      established to--       (A) promote a multifaceted educational effort about the      importance of health care coverage;       (B) increase awareness of the many available health care      coverage options; and       (C) inform those eligible for public insurance programs on      ways to access those programs; and       (2) the President issue a proclamation calling on the      Federal Government, States, localities, citizens, and      businesses of the United States to conduct appropriate      programs, fairs, ceremonies, and activities to promote this      educational effort.
