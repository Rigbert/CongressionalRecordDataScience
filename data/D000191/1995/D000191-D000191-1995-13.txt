Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 2621, a transparent political gesture by the Republic leadership. This is nothing more than Speaker Newt Gingrich and other House Republican leaders trying to blackmail the President into accepting their Medicare premium increase as part of a temporary Government funding bill. Congress under its new leadership has utterly failed to complete its constitutional responsibility to fund the Federal Government this year. Instead of playing high stakes political games with the hopes and fears of Federal employees, retirees, and Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries, Republican leaders would be well advised to finish the work they should have finished more than 1 month ago.
