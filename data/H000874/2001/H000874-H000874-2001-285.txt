Speaker, I represent the 5th Congressional District of Maryland which is home to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate the achievements of Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard who, 75 years ago this month, launched the world's first liquid propellant rocket. Indeed, the flight of Goddard's rocket on March 16, 1926, at Auburn, MA, was a feat as epochal in history as that of the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk. During his lifetime Dr. Goddard designed, built, and launched 35 rockets of increasing sophistication. Dr. Goddard was the first scientist who not only realized the potential of missiles and space flight but also contributed directly in bringing them to practical realization.  Mr. Speaker, on September 16, 1959, the 86th Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of a gold medal in honor of Dr. Goddard. When measuring the importance of Dr. Goddard's innovative contributions, there is no greater proof of his originality than his United States patents. In addition to the two patents issued in July 1914, 56 more would be issued to him in his lifetime. Thirty-five patents pending were issued after his death in 1945. An additional 131 patents, based upon his notes, sketches, and photographs, were applied for by his widow, Esther C. Goddard. In 1960, the U.S. Government acquired the rights to use these 214 patents.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Goddard created the building blocks which others would later invent independently. Dr. Goddard considered both manned and unmanned vehicles to explore the moon and planets, solar power, electric propulsion, and even flight to the stars. Today, the Armed Forces, NASA, and many others in the science community are able to construct rockets, missiles, weather instruments due to Dr. Goddard's vision. On this day, I would like to honor and recognize one of the greatest scientists and the father of modern rocket propulsion, Dr. Robert H. Goddard.                          ____________________
