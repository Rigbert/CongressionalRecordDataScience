Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I would like to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) chairman of the Committee on Resources, which also has jurisdiction, for allowing this resolution to be considered on the floor in such a timely fashion.  I include the following letter from the Committee on Resources as part of the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2004.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Cannon House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that the Committee on      Veterans' Affairs wishes to schedule for rapid Floor      consideration H. Con. Res. 409, recognizing with humble      gratitude the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the      United States Armed Forces during World War II and the      Americans who supported the war effort on the home front and      celebrating the completion of the National World War II      Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia.      This bill was referred primarily to your committee and      additionally to the Committee on Resources.       I have reviewed the legislation and have no objection to      its consideration. In fact, I have asked the author to add me      as a cosponsor before the bill is voted on by the House of      Representatives. Therefore, I have no objection to the      Committee on Resources being discharged from further      consideration of the bill. Of course, this action should not      be construed as waiving the Committee on Resources'      jurisdiction over the bill or as precedent for other bills.      In addition, if a conference on H. Con. Res. 409 should      become necessary, I ask that you support my request to have      the Committee on Resources be represented on the conference.      Finally, because no bill report will be prepared on the      legislation, I ask that you include this letter and any reply      in the Congressional Record during consideration of H. Con.      Res. 409.       I congratulate you and Mr. Moran for producing a timely and      thoughtful bill and I look forward to working with you again      on other matters of mutual interest.           Sincerely,                                                 Richard W. Pombo,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
