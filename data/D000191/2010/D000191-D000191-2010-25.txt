Speaker, I was in my office and heard this debate, which was sort of a departure from reality on the Republican side of the aisle. They say we should blame the victims of the Wall Street-led crash in America. These people are lazy; they don't want to work. Why, if we just cut off their unemployment benefits, maybe they will go out and find a job. The jobs don't exist. They were destroyed by greed on Wall Street, by the reckless Republican policies of deregulation at any cost, of tax cuts for the wealthiest among us because trickle down would help the working people of America and put them back to work. Craziness.  I have 60,000 Oregonians, a State with over 10 percent unemployment, hard hit who will benefit from this bill. Now, they would say that's a special interest or an earmark to help 60,000 Oregonians who have exhausted their unemployment benefits. Let me just talk about one who I met in the unemployment office. Shame on you on that side of the aisle. Shame on you.                Announcement By the Speaker Pro Tempore
