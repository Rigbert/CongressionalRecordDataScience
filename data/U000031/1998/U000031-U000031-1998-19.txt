Speaker, last year I voted against MFN. I did so for a variety of good reasons--primarily because of changes regarding nuclear technology issues and the suspicion that indeed we had seen the transfer of such to other countries.  I had a pretty good feeling that then, and now, MFN would continue. The issue of ``engagement'' would indeed prevail. But I voted against it in 1997 because I believed that we should send them a signal--if not now, when?  The last number of days, I, and a number of my colleagues have had lengthy discussions with the State Department, Defense Department, USTR, and others regarding the real security of these technologies.  I'm convinced, that we have made real progress in sending the message that any transfer of these technologies to other countries is simply not acceptable. Engagement this past year has indeed been productive on this front and I am glad to see real improvements.  I am hopeful that this progress will continue and I will also continue to watch world events with a careful eye.  My vote today will be cast in favor of normal trade between our two countries.
