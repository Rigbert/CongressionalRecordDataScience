President, my amendment, which has been accepted by both sides, would authorize funding for the identification and development of atlernatives to anti-personnel landmines, including those used in mixed mine systems. I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin for their invaluable assistance, patience and support in getting this amendment adopted.  This is a modest but important amendment. Contrary to what some misinformed people have suggested, it does not ban anti-personnel landmines. There is an international Convention that has been signed by 126 nations, including every one of our NATO allies except Turkey, which bans the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel mines, but that is not this amendment. I mention it, though, because the White House recently committed the United States Government to sign that Convention when alternatives to anti-personnel mines are available, and to search aggressively for alternatives. They set a target date of 2006 for signing the Convention, and last September President Clinton announced that the United States will stop using anti-personnel mines outside Korea by 2003. It is my hope and expectation that by working together and with the resources to do the job, we can join the Convention by 2003. That is also about the same time that signatories to the Convention must have destroyed their stockpiles of anti-personnel mines, and when our NATO allies have said they want our mines removed from their territory. It is a logical deadline.  As I have said, when the White House announced that the United States will sign the Convention when alternatives are available, they also committed to ``search aggressively'' for alternative tactics, technologies and/or operational concepts to anti-personnel mines that are compliant with the Convention. This amendment simply authorizes the next year of funds to do that--a total of $17,200,000 for fiscal year 1999, and it calls for two separate studies to be done by independent scientific organizations. Although they are not named in the amendment, it is our intention and expectation that the Pentagon will initiate contracts with the National Academy of Sciences and the Rand Corporation to do the studies. Both are widely respected organizations that have done similar types of studies in the past. The National Academy estimates that such a study would take a year to complete and cost approximately $750,000. It is our hope that these studies will assist in steering the Pentagon in the right direction so rapid progress can be made in finding and deploying alternatives.  Mr. President, there are respected, retired military officers who believethat suitable alternatives already exist. They have done considerable research on existing weapons systems and are convinced that, since an effective minefield must be kept under constant observation, a combination of sensors and smart munitions that can destroy moving armored vehicles can provide a comparable combat capability to our mixed mine systems. Therefore, it may not be necessary to develop new technologies, because tactics, technologies and/or operational concepts may already exist that can be adapted, modified, or otherwise utilized with comparable effect. That is why the amendment refers explicitly to the ``adaptation, modification, and research and development,'' of both ``existing and new tactics, technologies, and operational concepts.'' It is important that the search for alternatives explore all possible options.  It is no secret that I had hoped that the United States would be among the first to sign the Convention when it was opened for signature in Ottawa last December. However, that was not to be, and since then I have sought to find a common approach so the United States could signal to the world our clear intention to join the Convention as soon as practicable. Over a period of months, General Ralston, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisory Sandy Berger and I discussed a number of issues including a way for the United States to join the Convention in a manner that is acceptable to the Pentagon. We now have that commitment, and while it may be some years before the United States signs, there are interim steps we can take to support the Convention.  We should urge other governments that have not yet signed, including Russia and China, to declare their intention to do so as soon as practicable, as we have. They too should undertake to remove whatever obstacles are in the way. We can also use the framework of the Convention to share technology, disclose mine stockpiles, identify mined areas, and support demining and assistance for mine victims.  Mr. President, this has been a long time in coming. President Clinton first called on the Pentagon to search for alternatives to anti-personnel mines back in 1994, and then for two years nothing happened. Then in May 1996 and again last September, he directed the Pentagon to do so. A few million dollars have been spent, but there has not been anything resembling a serious program. The prevailing attitude at the Pentagon has been that there are better uses of time and money, so let's do as little as possible and say we tried.  Obviously, if the Pentagon wants to avoid finding alternatives to landmines they know how to do that. They can try to hold back the money for research, they can say they cannot find alternatives that do absolutely everything landmines do, and they can continue to overstate their need for landmines. This will be a test of their good faith. I would urge them to approach this with the kind of ``can-do'' attitude they like to be known for, and to look closely at the technologies they already have. As I have said before, if we can drive a rover on Mars from a laptop on Earth, we can do this. I am convinced that it is a matter of will and resources.  General Ralston and Sandy Berger have pledged to make every effort to get the job done. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David Jones, accepted President Clinton's offer to monitor the Pentagon's progress in finding alternatives. These are men of their word and I have no doubt that they will do everything possible to see this through. I will support them in every way possible.  Again, I want to thank the managers of the bill, Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin and their staffs.
