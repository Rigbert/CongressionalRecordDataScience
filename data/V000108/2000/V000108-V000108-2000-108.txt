Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Katrina Marie Domijancic, Elizabeth Ann Jackson and Carrie Colleen Taylor for attaining the Girl Scout Gold Award. They are members of the Senior Girl Scout Troop #326 located in Hobart, Indiana, and will receive this honor at a Girl Scout Gold Award Ceremony on Sunday, May 28, 2000 at the Hobart Scout Cabin.  A special significance is attached to the title of Girl Scout Gold Award, a significance that accompanies a young woman throughout her life. As she pursues endeavors in higher education, business, industry and community service, she will carry with her the lofty goal of success through leadership. To qualify for the Gold Award, each Girl Scout must fulfill rigorous requirements in the areas of leadership, career interest and service. Upon completing the above requirements, a prospective Gold Award candidate must find and complete a project that meets a need in the community. Katrina, Carrie, and Elizabeth's Gold Award Project involved enhancing the underused areas of the Hobart Scout Cabin to provide more useable space.  Katrina Domijancic is the daughter of John and Rebecca Domijancic of Hobart, Indiana. She has been a Girl Scout for nine years, and has been president of Senior Girl Scout Troop #326 since 1998.
