Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture appropriations bill, H.R. 1976. In particular, I would like to thank the conferees for providing an additional $500,000 to the Agriculture Research Service to begin research on a virus that threatens California's citrus industry--Citrus Tristeza Virus [CTV].  California's citrus industry is a $1.5 billion industry. CTV puts at risk the only remaining disease free budwood stock as well as our $485 million export market. The ARS' work on CTV in California will compliment ongoing private sector research in the State. Ultimately, I hope it will give our farmers the tools to eradicate this threat. I believe funding for this research is an investment in the long-term health of California's economy.
