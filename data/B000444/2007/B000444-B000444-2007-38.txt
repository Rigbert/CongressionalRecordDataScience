 President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, Senator Murray, in introducing legislation--the Facilitating Outstanding Classrooms Using Size Reduction (FOCUS) Act of 2007--that will provide $2 billion in funding to help, States and school districts hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size, particularly in the early grades.  When a teacher is responsible for a classroom of 25, 30, or more students, how can we expect each student to receive enough time and attention? One pillar of our education system should be small classes. The body of research around class size has consistently shown that smaller classes improve student performance, including reading and mathematics, in the early grades as well as in subsequent years when students are placed in larger classes. Research also shows that at the end of fifth grade, students who were in small classes in first through third grades were about half a school year ahead of students from larger classes in all core subjects--reading, language arts, math, and science. Additionally, studies have found that students from small classes earn better grades in high school, take more advanced courses, and are more likely to take college-entrance exams. They are also more likely to graduate from high school than students in larger classes.  Small classes also enable teachers to teach better. Any teacher will tell you that small classes make a difference. Small classes allow teachers to spend more time on instruction, get to know their students better, spend less time on discipline problems, and better identify students who need individually tailored assistance. The difference between teaching large classes and teaching small classes is substantial, and the pedagogy required for each differs.  I have stood with Senator Murray on previous legislation to reduce class size in our Nation's schools, and I am proud to stand with her again today in support of a class size reduction bill. The bill we offer today strengthens our earlier efforts to reduce class size. First--the FOCUS Act would provide a dedicated funding stream for class size reduction. The No Child Left Behind Act incorporated the Class Size Reduction Program into title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Murray-Biden FOCUS Act would create a separate funding stream in title V for the class size reduction initiative--ensuring that efforts to reduce class size would not have to competefor funding with a broad array of other teacher and administrator professional development and training funds.  Another provision that has been added are instructions that States and schools districts allocate their funding in a manner that creates a continuum of small classes for students as they progress from kindergarten to third grade and beyond. Research has shown that the benefits of attending small classes are the greatest for students in kindergarten through third grade, with further benefits accruing to those students for each additional year spent in small classes. The ultimate goal is that a student in the kindergarten grade matriculates through first, second, and third grades--each with an average class size of 18 students or less.  The bill also establishes a Web-based National Clearinghouse on Class Size that would provide research, best practices, and resources for small classroom instruction. This information needs to be broadly available and easily accessible to the education community as well as the public.  Additionally, the legislation requires an independent evaluation to be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the initiative and the National Center for Education Statistics to report on average class size data. It is imperative that we understand, objectively, how these funds are spent, and what outcomes are achieved.  Mr. President, the ultimate success of our education system depends on teachers. Ask any teacher if it matters whether they are teaching a class of 18 students or 25 students and you will get the same answer every time: absolutely. Smaller classes will provide teachers with the resources they need to create the opportunities for learning that our students deserve.                                 ______                                       By
