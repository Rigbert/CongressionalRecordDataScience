President, the first comment this morning is that everybody wishes the President well in his upcoming surgery. It is almost like those in some of the terrorist groups that go out and kneecap somebody and then send flowers to them in the hospital. I am not suggesting that there is hypocrisy in it, but I am waiting for all of the requests for special counsel and for some of my friends on the other side to ask for a resolution to spend money to send Senators in surgical gowns out to Bethesda to make sure the President really is out there having an operation.  It has reached that kind of a level around here. For some of my colleagues, if President Clinton were to walk across the water to save somebody from drowning, the headline in their statement would be, ``It proves he can't swim.''  When I hear some of the statements being made, I am reminded of a what a former Republican President--who, incidentally, was one of the best fundraisers I have ever known--said, ``Well, there you go again.''  Some in the Congress simply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the gun, draw the most negative possible inferences, and take every opportunity to discredit those who serve in the Government, and, as one who has served for years in law enforcement, they also take every possibility to discredit those who serve in law enforcement, and demand yet another costly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable and potentially destructive independent counsel investigation so long as it is limited to only investigating a Democratic President.  Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of justice. I think it is a kind of partisan effort at political spin. It comes at the end of a week during which the Senate rejected the majority leader's version of a resolution to restrict the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation. That resolution, before it passed, was altered during our floor debate to include examination of improper as well as illegal fundraising activities and finally to include such activities in congressional as well as the Presidential campaign. It then passed 99 to nothing.  The joint resolution before us is a similarly ill-conceived effort. It was introduced before the Rules Committee or the Senate moved to consider, amend and reamend the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was introduced before the Judiciary Committee met on a committee resolution on March 6. It was introduced before the Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees sent letters to the Attorney General. Those letters are the congressional actions contemplated by the independent counsel law. This resolution is not.  In fact, this resolution, if it were introduced as a bill rather than merely a sense of the Senate resolution and then passed as a law, would not pass constitutional muster.  It is very, very easy to stand here and say go out and look at the President; do not look at anything we do. Whatever you do, do not look at the House or Senate Members of Congress. But let us go after the President.  Mr. President, what we are saying is that our regular law enforcement agencies cannot do the job. We in Congress can. That is a laugh. As I said, I spent nearly 9 years in law enforcement. I know that the Attorney General and the others in law enforcement here have the independence to do what needs to be done. But I also know that it is the height of hypocrisy to say look at them; do not look at us.  The American people, the public, want more than anything else real campaign reform. The Republican leadership of the House and Senate could bring campaign reform measures to the floor today and ask us to have votes on them. Instead, they want to spend days and days and days bashing the President. Even while he is lying in the hospital in Bethesda for surgery, they will spend days bashing him, hoping that nobody will notice the tens of thousands of dollars we will spend in this Chamber in this debate and the printing costs of it all. They are hoping that maybe the American public will not ask the question: If you have all that time and money and effort to spend, why not debate real campaign finance reform and vote on it--campaign finance reform that would apply not just to the President and Vice President but would apply to every Democrat, Republican and Independent in the House and Senate and every Democrat and Republican and every Independent who might challenge an incumbent.  The fact is that if you took a poll today and asked the American public, do you want real campaign finance reform, the response would be a resounding yes. I hope the America public will ask the Republican leadership of the Senate and the Republican leadership of the House, because they are the ones responsible for setting the legislative agenda, when are you going to bring campaign finance reform to the floor? The President has said he will sign the bill. Unlike the last strong, tough campaign finance reform bill that was passed by the House and Senate and went to the White House for signature and was vetoed by the former President, this President has said he will sign such a bill.  It is going to be easy during the vacation set up in a week for the House and Senate, for Members to go home and give wonderful speeches and say we are in favor of campaign finance reform. We are all in favor, just like we are in favor of God and motherhood. But I hope people ask, but have you voted on it? When are you going to vote on it? Bring it up and have a vote on real campaign finance reform.  Now, some Members will vote against it and some Members will vote for it. But at least the American public will know how their Member of the House and their Senators voted. That is all we are asking.  I understand and I have great respect for some Senators who do not want to vote for a campaign finance reform bill, even those who oppose campaign finance reform legislation. I do not question their motives. Let them vote against it. But I also respect those such as Senator Feingold and Senator McCain who have brought forward a campaign finance reform bill, and they ought to have a vote on it. That is all I am asking. Stop the smokescreens of Friday afternoon talks about investigating the President. I am sure they will pause at some point to wish him well during his surgery this afternoon and then they will go right back to bashing him.  Why not say here, Mr. President, we will actually do what we are hired to do, what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do. We will pass a campaign finance reform law.  In fact, while we are at it, maybe we ought to pass the chemical weapons treaty.  While we are at it, maybe we ought to pass a budget. My good friends on the other side of the aisle criticize the President's budget. Well, they have a majority of the votes in the House and Senate to pass their own. In fact, the law requires them to do it shortly after the vacation. Let us see if they will pass one.  It occurs to me the kind of votes necessary to pass a budget are the kind of votes that might cause some political pain on the right and the left, and maybe that is why we do not actually vote on those kinds of things. It occurs to me that if we passed a bill on campaign finance reform, it would actually cause some pain, especially for those of us who are incumbents, and maybe that is why the leadership will not bring that bill to the floor. It occurs to me that the reason these resolutions about investigations are very carefully aimed at the President and exclude any consideration of possible improper activity on the part of Members of Congress is that maybe--maybe--some who are supporting them want to make sure no gaze of a special prosecutor is directed at activities of Members of Congress.  There are only 100 people at any one time who are given the opportunity to be in the Senate. I do not question the fact that you have to have some partisan motivations to get elected in the first place. But when you are here and take an oath of office, an oath to uphold the Constitution, to represent the whole country and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, let us not have partisan games that are more reflective of somebody running for some minor county office somewhere. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of all of the United States. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of all people. What we do as the Senate should reflect the conscience of the United States. The Senate should be, and at times has been, the conscience of this great country. But, when we engage in partisan games aimed at sliming the President, but at the same time protecting every single thing we do, that is not representing the conscience of the United States. That is not rising to the level of what the U.S. Senate should be.  If Members want to investigate the President on fundraising activities, then be honest enough to say we will apply the same searchlight, the same magnifying glass, the same standards to ourselves. Do not give a hypocritical image of the U.S. Senate to the American people by saying we will go after the President but we will make sure that nobody looks at us, nobody asks us if any of us had done the exact same things we are asking the President not to do. That is not showing the kind of respect we should have for this Senate, for this body, for the precedents we establish here.  This resolution before us is not authorized by the independent counsel law. If it were a separate bill, it would not pass constitutional muster. It is an inappropriate effort to pressure the Attorney General to prejudge these matters. It would pervert the independent counsel process under the law. The independent counsel law was designed to protect the independence of investigatory and prosecutorial decisions, including those of the Attorney General. This resolution would say that Congress does not want the Attorney General to be independent. The resolution says that we want to step in and tell her what to do and how to do it. The independent counsel law was passed to ensure that investigative and prosecutorial decisions are made without regard to political pressure, but this action by the Senate would subvert that purpose by subjecting the critical initial decisions about invoking the law to just such political pressure.  We are saying to the Attorney General, do not you use any of your judgment. We will tell you what you have to think. When I was a prosecutor, I know what I would have told any legislative body that told me how to exercise my prosecutorial discretion. It is not Congress' place to determine whether and when to bring criminal charges. As a former prosecutor, I say this body is ill-suited to that purpose. The administration of justice is ill-served by efforts to intimidate a prosecutor to begin a case, just as it would be ill-served by the legislature trying to intimidate a prosecutor to end a case.  This resolution will serve only to undermine the investigation that the Attorney General now has underway. It will undercut the independent counsel law and I believe it further erodes public confidence in Government's abilityto do its job. We ought to do our job and let the Attorney General do hers.  Part of our job would be to pass campaign finance reform. But you see absolutely no effort by the Republican leadership to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. Part of our job would be to vote up or down on the chemical weapons treaty, but you see no effort on the part of the Republican leadership to bring that to a vote. Part of our job would be to pass a budget, vote it up or down, but you see no effort on the part of the Republican leadership to bring that to a vote on the floor. What this resolution does is take the Senate down another detour, away from the critical work that we should be doing and is being left undone.  I have been here 22 years. I have been proud to work with Republicans and Democrats on major legislation. On the floor of the Senate during last year's Presidential election, I took the floor of the Senate to praise the former Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole. I praised him during the height of the Presidential election year, saying he is a man I had worked with closely for bipartisan solutions on farm bills, on hunger issues, on school lunch, school breakfasts, and the Women, Infants, and Children Programs. We forged a bipartisan consensus, just as I have been proud to do with so many other Members on the Republican side, and just as so many real leaders in the Republican Party have done as they have worked with Members of the Democrat side to form a bipartisan consensus on issues that are most important to the United States of America.  Unfortunately, when you have things like this resolution, which are so blatantly partisan, where little effort is made to bring about a bipartisan resolution, we find ourselves going further away from the kind of bipartisan approach to the Nation's problems that we heard so much about when this session was beginning.  It is almost as though some go out and have a pollster ask, ``What do you American people want of us?'' They will get back from the pollster that the people want us to work together, they want us to have bipartisan solutions, they want us to show more civility, they want us to work together in the interests of the country. So what do these well-informed legislators proceed to do? They go on the Sunday talk shows and have weekend press conferences and say that it is a new day, that there is an effort for bipartisan consensus. They say what they think the people want to hear.  But do we see a bipartisan effort on a budget resolution? No. Do we see a bipartisan effort on a chemical weapons treaty? No. Do we see a bipartisan effort to confirm Federal judges?  There has not been one single judge confirmed yet this Congress. You know, there is a heck of a lot more effort given to somehow influencing the appointment of an independent counsel or special prosecutor, by this body, than there is to considering and confirming Federal judges. Not one single Federal judge has been confirmed by this Congress. Not one court of appeals judge was confirmed in the last session of Congress. The Chief Justice of the United States, a conservative Republican, appointed first by one Republican President as a member of the Supreme Court and subsequently by another Republican President as Chief Justice, has said we have reached a crisis situation. There are nearly 100 vacancies in our Federal courts. Justice is not only delayed, justice is denied to American people--all American people, Republicans and Democrats alike.  Everybody knows it is a crisis. But this Senate, with all the talk about bipartisanship, has not confirmed one single Federal judge. In fact, I think there is only one scheduled for consideration by the Senate. At this rate--I am 56 years old--through normal attrition and all, if we keep on at this rate, when I am 156, instead of 100 vacancies we will have 300 or 400 vacancies.  This is not the way to show any kind of bipartisan consensus. If we spend one-tenth as much of an effort at confirming Federal judges that we are supposed to, that we are paid to do, that we are elected to do we might begin to fulfill our responsibilities. If we spend one-tenth the effort on confirming judges that we spend on cranking up more and more multimillion dollar investigations of the President, we might accomplish something. But, obviously, that is not intended in this new era of bipartisanship.  We spent the first 2 months of this year debating a proposed constitutional amendment that is unnecessary, unsound, and unwise, but a bumper-sticker approach to the problems of budget deficits and the need to balance our Federal budget. We have not spent 38 seconds on this floor actually debating a real budget. We have not spent 21 seconds; we haven't spent a nanosecond. We spent 2 months talking about something that might take effect in the next century. But we have not spent 2 seconds debating something that will take effect this year.  Mr. President, I fear for the Senate. I am proud of the Senate. I am proud of being here for 22 years. I am proud of serving with great Republican leaders and great Democratic leaders. I am proud of serving with men and women from both the Republican and Democratic side whom I consider true national leaders.  What makes me proud is they have come together for the best interest of the United States, not leaving behind their party allegiances, but being first and foremost Americans and U.S. Senators and doing what is best for the country. I do not see that happening now, Mr. President. It fills this Senator with a great deal of sorrow.  This is not the way we do things in my State. In my State, we will fight for our elections. Some win, some lose. Then we come together as Republicans and Democrats for what is best for Vermont. We, U.S. Senators, 100 of us having a chance to represent more than 250 million Americans, ought to do what is best for this country. A quarter of a billion Americans expect the 100 men and women of this body to do that, and we are not bringing together the bipartisan consensus we used to and that we need to achieve.  I talked about the bumper-sticker sloganeering of the constitutional amendment. It failed here. In the House, they have not even had a committee markup. The Republican Party decided not to do that. For whatever their reasons are, I hope now, after spending months on that ill-fated effort, we can actually debate and pass a budget. I tell my friends on the other side of the center aisle that if they really want to work on a bipartisan budget, we can. For that matter, they do not have to ask for a single Democratic vote. There are enough Republicans in the House and Senate to pass a budget, as the law requires, by April 15, if they really want to.  Mr. President, I have talked about judicial vacancies. Twenty-five percent of the current vacancies have persisted for more than 18 months. A quarter of the judicial vacancies in this country have been there for a year and a half. This is justice delayed, this is justice denied, this is wrong.  I have served here twice in the majority and twice in the minority. I have served here when the President of the United States was President Gerald Ford, then President Carter, then President Reagan, then President Bush, and now President Clinton. Never in my memory, under Republican Presidents or Democratic Presidents, with Republican Senates or Democratic Senates, never has the leadership of this body ever allowed a situation when judicial vacancies would exist in this number for this long. Never.  Republican leaders like Howard Baker or Bob Dole or Hugh Scott, Democratic leaders like Mike Mansfield or Bob Byrd or George Mitchell or Tom Daschle never countenanced such a thing. Never would these great leaders have done this. Never have they allowed the Federal judiciary to get in such an abysmal state, when the Chief Justice has to say it is a crisis, when the Chief Justice says: ``It is hoped that the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.'' And yet, we have to tell him today that we are not doing it, we are not doing our job.  A little over a year ago, the Republican majority of the House and Senate closed down the whole Government, for days on end, weeks on end, to make a political point. The political point is that they wasted hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money and the American public found out the Speaker of the House, atone point, had to go out the back door of Air Force One--obviously, the kind of affront that they felt justified wasting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.  They were making a political point and the Government was closed down. Some say billions of dollars were wasted. It was an enormous inconvenience to the American taxpaying public who were wondering what was going on.  Having had this failed experience of closing down the executive branch of Government, it appears they now want to close down the judicial branch of Government. This is the kind of capricious meanness that you see in a schoolboy plucking the wings off a fly. This is beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate. This is beneath the dignity of being a U.S. Senator. This is beneath the dignity of our Constitution. This is wrong. This has never been done. It was never done under the leadership of Senator Baker and Senator Dole, under the leadership of Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, or Senator Daschle. I doubt if it was ever done under the leadership of those who came before them.  The Senate is not fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. It is interfering with the President's authority to appoint Federal judges. It is hampering the third, coequal branch of our Government.  The Republicans controlling the 104th Congress shut down the executive branch, this Congress they seem intent on shutting down the judicial branch for political gain. It is a scandal in the making. It is high time for the Senate to do its duty to consider and confirm judges to the vacancies that have persisted for so long.  Instead, they bring to the Senate floor this resolution and say, ``Hey, Mr. President, I hope you enjoy your time in Bethesda. Turn on C-SPAN. We're going to stand here and bash you for a day or two or three.''  I suggest this: If you want to do that--if the leadership figures that the only thing to do, because they cannot pass a budget, cannot ratify a treaty, cannot pass anything else that might significantly improve the lives of the American people--if, instead, they want to use this Senate to bash the President, could we have maybe an hour every day to do the people's business? Maybe an hour a day? For 10 hours, they can bash the President and 1 hour each day we could actually debate their budget resolution, if they had a budget resolution. For 10 hours a day, bash the President, an hour a day actually consider and confirm Federal judges.  It is getting a little ridiculous. Do people know that we get paid $133,000 a year, and we have not had 1 second of debate on the budget resolution that the Republican leadership of the Senate and the House are supposed to bring before us for a vote? Do they know that we get paid $133,000 a year, but if you want to litigate a case in a Federal court, you probably cannot get before a Federal judge because of the vacancies that our inaction is perpetuating?  Do they know how much it is costing to do the bashing per page of the Congressional Record? Maybe it is a sort of full-employment opportunity for printers. As a printer's son, maybe I ought to be happy, but I do not think this is what my father would think was the best thing for this body to do.  So, Mr. President, some of this could be humorous if it were not for the enormous cost to the taxpayers, if it were not for the fact that we are not doing what we are supposed to do, if it were not for the fact that the kind of bipartisanship that has always made me proud to be a Member of the U.S. Senate has broken down more than I have ever seen before. Maybe it would be funny if so many people were not hurt.  The Attorney General will look into any issues that there may be at the White House. She will report back to us, as she is required to do. We can look at that report and we can determine whether we agree with it or not. But as a former prosecutor, I must tell you, I find it very offensive to tell a prosecutor, ``Here is what you must do and must not do. Here are the conclusions you must reach and must not reach.''  That is basically what this resolution is saying and it is also saying: ``Oh, by the way--by the way--there's one thing thou shalt not do. Thou shalt not ask any question of a Member of Congress. We, the Republicans, who control the majority in the Congress, are saying, thou shalt not ask questions of us, what we might have done in fundraising.'' I will guarantee you, Mr. President, when we bring up an alternative resolution which calls on the Attorney General to look at Members of Congress, that in lockstep the Republican majority will vote that down. A herd of elephants will trample that into the dust.  Why is that? They say, go investigate the President. We have already spent $30, $40 million investigating the President and found nothing that says he has done anything wrong. We have already spent about $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor, who also goes out and gives speeches to organizations that seek to defeat the President. We spent $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor who has clients whose PAC's have worked very hard to defeat the President. We spent $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor who would not recognize a conflict of interest if it hit him up alongside the head.  Now they say, ``Let's just go after the President some more, but, please, make sure you understand what we are saying: Don't touch us.'' It reminds me of the tax debate where the distinguished former chairman of the Finance Committee, and one of the real giants of the Senate, Russell Long, in debate said, ``The kind of taxes we want are, don't tax me, don't tax thee; tax the man behind the tree.'' Well, in this case, my good friends on the Republican side want to hide behind that tree and say, ``Investigate everybody on the other side of the tree. Don't look at us.''  I would like to think, Mr. President, this is because all the Members who are going to vote against any investigation of the Senate or the House, all the Members who want to block that, are as pure as Caesar's wife. I would like to follow that analogy, Mr. President, but I could not do it with a straight face.  It is really very blatant what is going on here. The majority does not want to have a vote on a budget. The majority does not want to have a vote on a chemical weapons treaty. Lord knows, the majority does not want to do anything significant in filling the 100 vacancies now persisting in the Federal courts. And those vacancies will grow just through the normal retirements, deaths, and so forth. But let them pound the President.  Oh, I would not be surprised if at some point in here we will probably have a resolution calling for the President's speedy recovery from the surgery this afternoon, but they will just pound the heck out of him in the meantime.  You know, Mr. President, I am not sure anybody is fooled by this. If it was just a silly partisan exercise, it would be one thing. At most, it would be an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate. But it goes beyond that. Because now we find that not only--not only--has there been an unprecedented attack on the Constitution by blocking Federal judges, but now the other shoe has dropped. We have heard from Members in the other body that they want the impeachment of judges. If they disagree with their decision, they want them impeached.  I say to my friends on the other side who are calling for impeachments, they should take the time--I was going to say to ``reread'' a history book, but I think that might be presupposing to say ``reread'' one--but go and read a history book. And I cannot say ``reread'' the Constitution, because that also presupposes they read it. Read the Constitution.  This Nation, the greatest democracy that history has ever known, the most powerful nation on Earth and still remaining a democracy, is here because of the independence of the three branches of Government: The legislative, the executive, and the judiciary.  Mr. President, everywhere I go in this country and throughout the world I find such enormous respect for our independent Federal judiciary. Look at some of the countries that are seeking democracy. One of the biggest problems they have is that they have never had an independent judiciary. We pride ourselves on our independent judiciary. But for us to say, ``I disagreed with a decision, impeach him,'' it is like Alice in Wonderland, the queen saying, ``Offwith their heads, off with their heads.'' It is that silly.  There are, after all, appellate courts. I have tried cases. I have won some and I have lost some. I have known I could always appeal. That is what you do. If a judge rules differently than you like, appeal the decision. Do not say ``Oh, we'll impeach them.'' What kind of respect do you think there will be for our Federal courts if that could be done?  This makes me think, Mr. President, of those who had billboards out ``Impeach the Supreme Court'' because the Court ruled against segregation. It was wrong then for those who wanted to violate the independence of our courts because the courts dared point their finger at the sin and the stain of segregation. It was just as wrong then as it is today.  If my friends on the other side persist in destroying the independence of our Federal judiciary, what kind of a legacy do they leave their children and their children's children?  My children will live most of their lives in the next century. I think to myself every day, what kind of a century will we give to them if, after 200 years of building up the greatest democracy history has ever known, we start with this piece and this piece, tearing down what made it a great democracy, tearing down the Constitution, tearing down the independent judiciary, and, yes, Mr. President, tearing down the Senate and tearing down the House by our own statements and by our own actions? That is wrong.  Mr. President, before this gets any further out of control, I pray that Republicans and Democrats will start coming back together as we did under the great leaders with whom I have had a privilege to serve--Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell and now Senator Daschle, and on the other side, Senator Baker and Senator Dole. These were men who were willing to fight for their partisan beliefs but who knew that there were some issues where the American people have to be heard first and foremost and that we needed to come together.  I pray that our Members might pause here today--at least let the President of the United States go to surgery this afternoon without us trying to tear him apart--and ask ourselves, Republicans and Democrats alike, what are we doing to the Senate? What are we doing to the House? What are we doing to our Federal Judiciary? What are we doing to the protection of our Constitution when we say judges should be impeached not for high crimes and misdemeanors, as the Constitution speaks of, but because we disagree with them?  If anybody has ever tried cases, and I have tried a lot of cases, you will find judges to disagree with. The other side might be delighted. The next week the judge may agree with you and the other side is angry. That is the way it works. I tried a lot of cases in the appellate court and I have tried a lot of cases in trial courts. However, sometimes I disagreed with a determination.  Mr. President, when I began this statement there were no other Senators on the floor seeking recognition. I now see my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island and will suspend my remarks at this point to allow him an opportunity to be heard.  I do ask unanimous consent that a copy of the March 13 letter to the Attorney General that is signed by seven Democrats serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record. It has been quoted already today, but out of context, so I feel compelled to include the complete letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.     Hon. Janet Reno,     Attorney General of the United States.     U.S. Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Attorney General: We expect that certain      Republican members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary      have forwarded to you a letter, purportedly pursuant to 18      U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(1), that you apply for the appointment of      an independent counsel to investigate ``possible fundraising      improprieties in connection with the 1996 presidential      campaign.'' We will leave it to you to evaluate and respond      to that letter in accordance with your statutory      responsibilities to determine whether grounds to investigate      were furnished in that letter. Rather than provide specific      information and credible sources the Republican letter      appears to us to be a political document that strings      together a series of negative inferences, unanswered      questions and damning conclusions.       We, the undersigned members of the Committee on the      Judiciary, are concerned about illegal and improper      fundraising and spending practices in Federal election      campaigns and the need for campaign finance reform. Whereas      press accounts and reported allegations of improper      fundraising in Federal campaigns undermine public confidence      in the integrity of our electoral process, we want to do all      that we can to restore public confidence and get to the      bottom of such alleged wrongdoing as soon as possible.       Should you determine that an application for appointment of      an independent counsel is appropriate, we request that your      application avoid partisanship and include the full scope of      fundraising irregularities. The written request from our      Republican colleagues focuses entirely on allegations of      fundraising irregularities by the 1996 Clinton/Gore      Presidential Campaign and by the Clinton Administration, with      a primary focus on two areas: first, whether senior White      House officials and other Executive Branch officials      ``improperly solicited and/or received contributions on      federal property''; and second, whether foreign contributions      ``were funneled into U.S. election offers to influence U.S.      foreign policy.''       In addition to the areas outlined by our Republican      colleagues, we request that you also examine additional      items. First, revelations in the press have been rampant      about Republican campaign fundraising improprieties,      including soliciting contributions on federal government      property. Other Republican fundraising activities also raise      significant questions about the appearance of conflicts of      interest and whether any quid-pro-quo is involved in      legislative activities. Additional revelations raise      questions about how Republicans have in some instances      violated campaign finance laws and in other instances skirted      the spirit, if not the letter of the law, by using not-for-     profit organizations to funnel money for use in campaigns      without the reporting requirements and limitations that apply      to formal campaign committees. Second, we are concerned about      the possibility that foreign governments are seeking to      influence our domestic and foreign policy through campaign      contributions, including to congressional candidates for      federal office.       We understand that you have already formed a Task Force of      experienced prosecutors from within the Public Integrity      Section of the Criminal Division to investigate whether      criminal conduct took place in 1996 federal election      campaigns and that the Task Force is already well underway in      its investigation. We further understand that over thirty      special agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have      been assigned to work on this investigation. Indeed, the      press has reported that this Task Force has already served      subpoenas and presented testimony to a grand jury. We      appreciate your pressing forward without delay and credit      your past statements that you are continuing to evaluate      whether you need apply for the appointment of an independent      counsel. We also appreciate that appointment of an      independent counsel is not always a panacea. We believe that      the cost and delay of independent counsels have not always      been justified, that they have not been accountable and that      the judicial panel responsible for appointing such an      independent counsel in these circumstances may well have its      own conflict of interest. Most importably, we understand that      were you to shift your approach at this point in order to      conduct a preliminary investigation under the independent      counsel law, you would have no authority to convene grand      juries or issue subpoenas. Thus, the work being done by the      current Task Force would have to cease abruptly and the      matter would go forward with less authority and fewer      investigative powers and options.       The decision to invoke the independent counsel process in a      particular matter rests with you and not with the United      States Congress or any member or members thereof. You have      demonstrated your willingness to invoke the independent      counsel law in the past and we have the utmost confidence      that you will invoke the law again, if and when the legal      standards have been met in a particular matter. These      standards are clearly set forth in the independent counsel      statute. You must invoke the independent counsel process when      there is specific information from a credible source that a      crime may have been committed by enumerated ``covered      persons'', under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(a). You may exercise your      discretion to invoke this process when there is specific      information from a credible source that a crime may have been      committed by any other person and where the Justice      Department has a personal, financial or political conflict of      interest, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(c)(1); or when there is      specific information from a credible source that a crime may      have been committed by a member of Congress and where it      would be in the public interest to do so, under 28 U.S.C.      Sec. 591(c)(2).       Partisan requests for invocation of the independent counsel      process give the appearance of attempting politically to      influence a decision by the Attorney General whether to      invoke the independent counsel process in a particular      matter. To our mind, this will result in further undermining      the public confidence's in the integrity of government, the      independent counsel process and in the criminal justice      system as a whole. Consequently, we urge you to exercise your      best     professional judgment, without regard to political pressures      and in accordance with the standards of the law and the      established policies of the Department of Justice, to      determine whether the independent counsel process should be      invoked, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(a) or (c), to      investigate allegations of criminal misconduct by any      government official, member of Congress or other person in      connection with the 1996 federal election campaigns.       Only this week the Senate authorized the Governmental      Affairs Committee to begin its investigation into illegal and      improper fundraising activities in the 1996 federal election      campaigns. We are sure that you, as well as we, will monitor      that investigation and those hearings closely to determine      whether grounds for application for the appointment of an      independent counsel arise.       In conclusion, please report back to the Committee,      identify the allegations you are presently investigating, and      indicate whether you have begun or will begin a preliminary      investigation as limited by the independent counsel law,      indicate whether you believe these allegations to which we      have referred are based on specific information from credible      sources, and indicate whether these matters present a      conflict of interest with respect to a covered person or,      with respect to members of Congress, whether it would be in      the public interest to apply for the appointment of an      independent counsel. Please also provide your reasons for      those determinations. In the event you conduct a preliminary      investigation, but do not apply for the appointment of an      independent counsel, or apply for an independent counsel, but      only with respect to some of the various allegations on which      you have received or developed information, please identify      all those allegations which in your view do not warrant      appointment of an independent counsel, and explain your view      whether those allegations warrant further investigation,      pertain to a covered individual, present a conflict of      interest or with respect to members of Congress, why the      public interest is served by proceeding in the manner that      you have chosen.           Sincerely,     Herb Kohl,     Patrick J. Leahy,     Richard J. Durbin,     Dianne Feinstein,     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Edward M. Kennedy,     Robert Torricelli,       U.S. Senators.
