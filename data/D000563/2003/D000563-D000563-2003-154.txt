 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Sallie Mae, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2003.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,     U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Shelby and Sarbanes: I am writing to update      you on how Sallie Mae reports the credit performances of our      customers to the national credit bureaus.       Our goal is to ensure that our customers get the credit      they have earned. To that end, we have been reporting to one      of the national credit bureaus all along, as required by law.      When we learned recently that one of our borrowers has not      had full access to his credit history, we began negotiating      again with the other two credit bureaus so that we could      resume reporting to them.       I am pleased to let you know that following extensive      discussions with the other two credit bureaus, Sallie Mae has      agreed to resume reporting to them and will provide each with      credit information for our customers. We will keep you and      your staffs apprised as we move forward in implementing this      decision.       We are pleased that the credit bureaus are being responsive      to our concerns and we look forward to working with them.      Thank you for your interest in this important issue. Please      feel free to contact me if you have questions or need      additional information.           Sincerely,                                                Rose DiNapoli,                             Vice President, Government & Industry                                            Relations, Sallie Mae.
