 Madam Chair, I do rise in opposition to the Lee amendment. The Lee amendment would strip dozens of important limitations and restrictions that routinely apply to funding appropriated by Congress with bipartisan support and through the normal appropriation process.  For example, this amendment would strike limitations that, as has been noted, would prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to destroy life. And, frankly, they have been in place since the seventies, going back to the Henry Hyde days in the House.  The Lee amendment would also strike other commonsense protections that normally apply to appropriated funds. This includes restrictions that prevent Federal grants from being awarded to tax cheats.  The Lee amendment would be a vote, should it pass, to allow abuse of taxpayer funds. So I would urge the House to reject this amendment.  We carefully wrote provisions that the riders that are in place would apply to each of the years of the NIH funds. And I think that that is appropriate, that the Lee amendment would undermine that.  So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  I yield back the balance of my time.
