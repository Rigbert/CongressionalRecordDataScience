 President, I rise today to address the conference report on the African Growth and Opportunity Act and to express my deep disappointment that the conference decided to strip out of the report the amendment which has been spoken about on this floor which addresses HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. This is an amendment I offered with the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.  This amendment was accepted by the Senate, and it was intended to provide African countries experiencing an HIV/AIDS crisis with the ability to institute measures consistent with the World Trade Organization intellectual property rules that are designed to ensure the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical technology to afflicted populations.  We offered this amendment because we believed the act inadvertently threatened to undermine the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa. Our amendment was a simple, commonsense approach consistent with international law to fix this oversight. I believe the action of the conference in stripping this amendment was unconscionable. I found it especially disappointing because my office and staff had been working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Roth, to develop compromise language that met our concerns and would be acceptable to the conference.  Chairman Roth negotiated in good faith, and he and the other Senate conferees--Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Baucus--wanted to do the right thing. Unfortunately, as I understand it, because of the way in which the House and Senate Republican leadership dealt with this conference, the majority leader and the Speaker, as I have been told, decided my amendment was to be eliminated and presented a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the conferees. The conference was never really even given a chance to address this issue.  Perhaps they did not understand the full impact of what is happening in Africa, and in these remarks I hope to make both the extent and the nature of the AIDS crisis better known. I say this as someone who supports the legislation. I voted in favor of it. I believe the underlying principles of this legislation--opening up new possibilities for economic engagement and trade between the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa--are good ones. I know the countries of this region want to receive the benefits of the bill which will assist their economic development and promote democracy in the region.  I said in earlier remarks the problem is that the way things are going, there will not be an Africa left for this bill to help. I think people underestimate the impact of that statement. What I hope to do in these remarks is talk about the scope of the problem, give specific country reports, talk about the economic, social, and political impact of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, the need for affordable access to pharmaceuticals, what compulsory licensing and parallel importing is, and why the Feinstein-Feingold amendment is necessary.  I want to talk about drug companies' revenues from these drugs and what else is to be done.  But before I do so, I acknowledge the fact that this morning the White House has signed an Executive order to carry out the provisions of the Feinstein-Feingold amendment.  At this point, I will read into the Record the following letter, dated May 10:       I am pleased to inform you that today I will sign an      Executive Order that is intended to help make HIV/AIDS-     related drugs and medical technologies more accessible and      affordable in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. The      Executive Order, which is based in large part on your work in      connection with the proposed Trade and Development Act of      2000, formalizes U.S. government policy in this area. It also      directs other steps to be taken to address the spread of HIV      and AIDS in Africa, one of the worse health crises the world      faces.       As you know, the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken a      terrible toll in terms of human suffering. Nowhere has the      suffering been as great as in Africa, where over 5,500     people per day are dying from AIDS. Approximately 34 million      people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected, and, of      those infected, approximately 11.5 million have died. These      deaths represent more than 80 percent of the total HIV/AIDS-     related deaths worldwide.       To help those countries most affected by HIV/AIDS fight      this terrible disease, the Executive Order directs the U.S.      Government to refrain from seeking, through negotiation or      otherwise, the revocation or revision of any law or policy      imposed by a beneficiary sub-Saharan government that promotes      access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.      This order will give sub-Saharan governments the flexibility      to bring life saving drugs and medical technologies to      affected populations. At the same time, the order ensures      that fundamental intellectual property rights of U.S.      businesses and inventors are protected by requiring sub-     Saharan governments to provide adequate and effective      intellectual property protection consistent with World Trade      Organization rules. In this way, the order strikes a proper      balance between the need to enable sub-Saharan governments to      increase access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical      technologies and the need to ensure that intellectual      property is protected.       I know that you preferred that this policy be included in      the Conference Report on the Trade and Development Act of      2000, as did I. However, through this Executive Order, the      policy this Administration has pursued with your support will      be implemented by the U.S. Government. The Executive Order      will encourage beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to      build a better infrastructure to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS      as they build better lives for their people. At the same      time, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 will strengthen      African economies, enhance African democracy, and expand      U.S.-African trade. Together, these steps will enable the      United States to forge closer ties with our African allies,      broaden export opportunities for our workers and businesses,      and promote our values around the world.       Thank you for your leadership on this critically important      issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Clinton.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the Executive order itself be printed in the Record.
