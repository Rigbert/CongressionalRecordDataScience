Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I congratulate the gentlewoman on being sensitive to the needs of her district, which has a very real problem, and this is fully within the authority of the Corps. I wish they had more money with which to do more projects around the country. I tried that yesterday, and it didn't work, but I will certainly be happy to support this.  I yield back the balance of my time.
