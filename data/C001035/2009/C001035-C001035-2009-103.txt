President, the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, are a sobering reminder that terrorists continue to threaten our Nation and civilized people throughout the world. An alert citizenry is our first line of defense against terrorist attacks, particularly attacks like those in Mumbai. Our laws must protect individuals from frivolous lawsuits when they report, in good faith, suspicious behavior that may indicate terrorist activity. That is why I am introducing legislation, with Senator Lieberman, that will provide these important protections.  In the 2007 homeland security law, Chairman Lieberman and I coauthored a provision to encourage people to report potential terrorist threats directed against transportation systems. This new legislation would expand those protections to reports of suspicious behavior in sectors other than transportation. For example, reports of suspicious activity could be equally important in detecting terrorist plans to attack ``soft targets'' like the hotels, restaurants, and religious institutions targeted in Mumbai.  Real life examples highlight the need for this bill. In December 2008, a Federal jury convicted 5 men from New Jersey of conspiring to murder American soldiers at Fort Dix. According to law enforcement officials, the report of an alert store clerk, who reported that a customer had brought in a video showing men firing weapons and shouting in Arabic, triggered their investigation. But for the report of this vigilant store clerk, law enforcement may not have disrupted this plot against Fort Dix.  That store clerk's action likely saved hundreds of lives. It also reveals a core truth of the dangerous times in which we live. Our safety depends on more than just police officers, intelligence analysts, and soldiers. It also depends on the alertness and civic responsibility of all Americans.  We must encourage citizens to be watchful and to report suspicious activity whenever it occurs. That imperative is even stronger in the aftermath of the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, where it appears that the terrorists performed reconnaissance on a number of the targets before the actual attacks.  Senator Lieberman and I recently convened two hearings in the Homeland Security Committee to examine lessons learned from those horrific attacks. These hearings have reinforced our long-standing concern that terrorists might shift their attention from high-value, high-security targets to less secure commercial facilities, where there is the potential for mass casualties and widespread panic. As we witnessed during the three-day siege of Mumbai, commercial facilities or ``softtargets,'' such as the Taj Mahal, Trident, and Oberoi Hotels, are vulnerable, tempting targets.  Many of the Committee's witnesses during these hearings, including Charles Allen, DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer, Donald Van Duyn, the FBI's Chief Intelligence Officer, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelley, and Al Orlob, Marriott International's Vice President for Corporate Security, endorsed the idea of expanding the 2007 law beyond the transportation sector. Indeed, Commissioner Kelley said that the 2007 law ``made eminently good sense'' and recommended ``that it be expanded [to other sectors] if at all possible.''  Unfortunately, we have seen that our legal system can be used to chill the willingness of citizens to come forward and report possible dangers. As widely reported by the media in 2006, US Airways removed 6 Islamic clerics from a flight after other passengers expressed concerns that some of the clerics had moved out of the their assigned seats and had requested, but were not using, seat belt extenders that could possibly double as weapons. In response to these concerns, US Airways officials removed these individuals from the plane so that they could further investigate.  For voicing their reasonable fears that these passengers could be rehearsing or preparing to execute a hijacking, these honestly concerned travelers found themselves as defendants in a civil rights lawsuit and accused of bigotry. The old adage about how ``no good deed goes unpunished'' is quite apt here.  The existence of this lawsuit clearly illustrates how unfair it is to allow private citizens to be intimidated into silence by the threat of litigation. Would the passengers have spoken up if they had anticipated that there would be a lawsuit filed against them? Even if such suits fail, they can expose citizens to heavy costs in time and legal fees.  The bill we introduce today would provide civil immunity in American courts for any person acting in good faith who reports any suspicious transaction, activity, or occurrence related to an act of terrorism. Specifically, the bill would encourage people to pass on information to Federal officials with responsibility for preventing, protecting against, disrupting, or responding to a terrorist act or to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials without fear of being sued for doing their civic duty. Only disclosures made to those responsible officials would be protected by the legislation.  Once a report is received, those officials would be responsible for assessing its reasonableness and determining whether further action is required. If they take reasonable action to mitigate the reported threat, they, too, would be protected from lawsuits. Just as we should not discourage reporting suspicious incidents, we also should not discourage reasonable responses to them.  Let me make very clear that this bill does not offer any protection whatsoever if an individual makes a statement that he or she knows to be false. No one will be able to use this protection as cover for mischievous, vengeful, or biased falsehoods.  Our laws and legal system must not be hijacked to intimidate people into silence or to prevent our officials from responding to terrorist threats. Protecting citizens who make good faith reports--and that's an important condition in this bill--of potentially lethal activities is essential to maintaining our homeland security. Our bill offers protection in a measured way that discourages abuses from either side.  Each of us has an important responsibility in the fight against terrorism. It is not a fight that can be left to law enforcement alone. The police simply can't be everywhere. Whether at a hotel, a mall, or an arena, homeland security and law enforcement officials need all citizens to alert them to unattended packages and behavior that appears out of the ordinary.  Many national organizations, such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, and the National Association of Town Watch, support this legislation.  If someone ``sees something'' suspicious, Congress has an obligation to ensure that he or she will ``say something'' about it. This bill promotes and protects that civic duty. I urge my colleagues to support it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows;                                   National Troopers Coalition                                                   March 24, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Troopers      Coalition and its 40,000 members comprised of State Troopers      and Highway Patrol Officers, I am writing in support of your      efforts to pass the ``See Something, Say Something Act''. We      applaud your efforts to keep this country safe.       Our nation is currently at war against terrorists that want      to destroy our country and disrupt our way of life. It is      vital that we remain vigilant in our efforts to combat      terrorism and keep our country safe. The See Something, Say      Something Act, will provide necessary liability protections      for citizens that report suspicious activity and for law      enforcement officers that act upon these reports. We live in      a litigious society and one should not be fearful of      litigation when determining if he or she should report      suspicious activities that could prevent catastrophic loss of      life. What we have learned in our efforts to combat terrorism      is that everyone needs to remain vigilant and report all      suspicious activities.       We support your efforts to provide liability protections      for citizens acting in good faith that report suspicious      activity. We can not turn a ``blind eye'' to the terrorists      we are fighting and we must encourage and support an ever      vigilant society.           Respectfully,     A. Bradford Card,       Federal Government Affairs (NTC), for: Michael Edes,      Chairman, National Troopers Coalition.                                  ____                               National Sheriffs' Association,                                   Alexandria, VA, March 24, 2009.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Sheriffs'      Association (NSA), I am writing to express our support for      the See Something, Say something Act of 2009.       As you may know, the National Sheriffs' Association is the      creator of the Neighborhood Watch Program which is one of the      oldest and best-known citizen and law enforcement based crime      prevention concepts in the United States. In the late 1960s,      an increase in crime heightened the need for a crime      prevention initiative focused on residential areas involving      local citizens. We responded, creating the National      Neighborhood Watch Program in 1972 to assist citizens and law      enforcement.       For nearly four decades, particularly after the terrorist      attacks in 2001, the nation's sheriffs have witnessed      firsthand, citizens becoming more empowered by becoming      active in homeland security efforts through participation in      Neighborhood Watch. Thus, we understand and recognize the      importance of encouraging citizen involvement and the role      they play in ensuring homeland security.       The proposed measure would build on this concept by      providing the needed legal protections to individuals who      report suspicious activity to an authorized official, in good      faith, that might reflect terrorist threats. Additionally, it      would provide qualified immunity from civil liability for an      authorized official who takes reasonable action in good faith      to respond to the reported activity.       We thank you for your continued leadership and support of      the nation's emergency responders.           Sincerely,                                            Sheriff David A. Goad,     President.                                  ____                                       National Association of                                                   Town Watch,                                    Wynnewood, PA, March 24, 2009.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association      of Town Watch (NATW), I am writing to express our support for      the See Something, Say Something Act of 2009.       The National Association of Town Watch is a nonprofit,      crime prevention organization whose members include citizen      crime watch groups, law enforcement agencies and other      organizations across the country involved in organized,      anticrime activities. NATW also sponsors the annual      ``National Night Out'' crime prevention event which has grown      to involve over 15,000 communities from all 50 states on the      first Tuesday each August.       Since 1981, NATW has always promoted the concept of      citizens working in close cooperation with their local law      enforcement and serving as ``extra eyes and ears.'' The      proposed legislation blends beautifully with NATW's mission.      It is critical to legally protect individuals who report      suspicious activity to an authorized official, in good faith,      that might reflect terrorist threats. This legislation also      would provide qualified immunity from civil liability for an      authorized official who takes reasonable action in good faith      to respond to the reported activity.       We thank you for bringing this legislation forward and for      supporting law enforcement     and concerned citizens across our great nation.           Sincerely,                                                   Matt A. Peskin,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                          National Fraternal Order                                                    of Police,                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2009.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, On behalf of the membership of the      Fraternal Order of Police, I am writing to advise you of our      strong support for the bill you have introduced entitled the      ``See Something, Say Something Act.''       Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 every      American, especially law enforcement officers, have become      more vigilant. Unfortunately, the increasingly litigious      nature of our society may result in many citizens choosing to      ``stay out of it''--even if they see something or someone      suspicious. Citizens who have reported suspicious activity      and law enforcement officers who have acted on these reports      have been sued in Federal, State and local courts even though      their concerns were reasonable and without malice. The result      is that all of us may be more hesitant to report or act upon      any suspicious behavior we might see.       Congress took a step in the right direction in 2007 when it      passed legislation granting immunity from civil liability for      citizens who report suspicious activity and law enforcement      officers who act upon such reports involving threats to      transportation security. Your bill would expand this immunity      to cover all suspicious activity whether it is in a train      station, a Federal building, or a sports stadium. This bill      will not only protect vigilant individuals from frivolous      lawsuits, but it also greatly increases our nation's      security.       On behalf of the more than 327,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I would like to thank you again for your      leadership on this issue. If I can be of any further      assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me, or      Executive Director Jim Pasco, in my Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,                                               National President.                                 ______                                       By
