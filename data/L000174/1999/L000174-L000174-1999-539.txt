President, just a point of clarification before we start to vote. Each side gets 1 minute before these votes. I urge Senators on both sides to give attention to both proponents and opponents so they can be heard. Senator Hatch and I have worked very hard to get it down to this list, so we should make sure both sides are protected and can be heard.                           Amendment No. 352
