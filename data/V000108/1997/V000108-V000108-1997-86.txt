Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Lithuanian American Council of Lake County, IN, and the Lithuanian community on the 79th anniversary of Lithuanian independence.  The Lithuanian American Council celebrated Lithuanian independence from the Soviet Union, which occurred in 1918, on Sunday, February 16, 1997, at St. Casimir's Church in Gary, IN. Following tradition, the anniversary ceremony began with a church service starting at 11:30 a.m. After the church service, the Lithuanian American Council held a flag raising ceremony outside of the church to honor those Lithuanians who pledged their allegiance to independence for their people. The event concluded with a dinner in the church hall.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Lithuanian American Council ofLake County and its officers, including: Vincent J. Gumulauskis, who has been president for 5 years; Pete D. Auksel and Casimir Balt, both of whom are vice-presidents; Birute Vilutis, secretary; and Walter Ruzga, treasurer. Allow me to also commend the board of directors, whose members include the Reverend Ignatius Urbonas, Aleksas Degutis, Alex Navardauskas, Dan Pauls, Frank Petrites, Brone Tampauskas, and Izidorius Tavaras. Finally, I would like to commend every member of the Lithuanian American Council for the loyalty and enthusiasm they have displayed.  The Lithuanian American Council of Lake County, IN, is a branch of the Lithuanian American Council, Inc. It was founded in 1940 and originated in large cities such as Boston, Chicago, and New York. The organization in Lake County was initially headquartered at St. Francis Church in East Chicago, IN, until recently when the building was demolished. The organization was then moved to St. Casimir where its home is today.  It is my sincere hope that 1997 will bring renewed prosperity for all members of the Lithuanian community and their families. May this 79th anniversary year prove to be a most joyous one.                          ____________________
