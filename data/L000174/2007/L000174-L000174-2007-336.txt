President, this amendment is not germane. It is subject to the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I would be happy to hold hearings on it. This is so overbroad that you could have all kinds of problems. It could invite racial and religious profiling. Suppose somebody is wearing religious garb and it frightens somebody. They could immediately--or maybe it doesn't frighten them, but they could say it does. It broadly protects Government officials from potential misconduct. It sets a new standard for a government official responding to reports of activity, and it is basically a court-stripping bill.  If this is for more than a political point on this bill, fine, bring it to the Judiciary Committee. We will hold a hearing on it before the committee that has jurisdiction.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
