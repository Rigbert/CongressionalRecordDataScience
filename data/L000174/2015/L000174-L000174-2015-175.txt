President, I just wish to praise the senior Senator from Illinois. He has been consistent on this issue since he came here. He was one of the architects of a major overhaul of our immigration system a year and a half ago, which passed by a two-thirds majority, by Republicans and Democrats alike.  We have gone such a long way toward solving this problem. The Republican leadership in the House--even though the votes were there to pass it in the House--refused to bring it up.  I am proud to align myself as a follower of the leadership of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, on this issue.  With the way we apply the laws now, I wonder whether my grandparents would have been able to come to Vermont from Italy and see their grandson become a U.S. Senator or would have seen their highly decorated son serve in World War II. I wonder if my wife's parents would have been able to come from Canada so she could be born in Vermont.  Come on. We are a nation of immigrants. Let's welcome them. They can often make our country much stronger than it was before.  I applaud the Senator from Illinois.                          ____________________
