President, like the Senator, I am frustrated because we are trying to simply recognize the reality that there are many, many individuals in the United States who have been here for years and who deserve an opportunity to become permanent residents, and it is not only within the Latino community but the Liberian community. These individuals from Liberia came over legally, under temporary protective status. That is one of the pieces of legislation also frustrated by this device to preclude amendments.  I wonder if the Senator might amplify the fact that, indeed, if we were successful to get a vote on this measure, we could also address the issue of 10,000 Liberians who are literally perhaps hours from being deported, except for administrative order, and it is a population that has contributed to our communities; and we should recognize that they deserve the opportunity to adjust to permanent status, and they are being ignored by these parliamentary maneuvers--worse than ignored.
