 President, I believe this amendment has been cleared on both sides. What the amendment does is require procedures for a child support order for the child of minor parents, where the mother is receiving assistance for the child, to be enforceable against the paternal grandparents of the child.  For just a moment--what the Dole bill does is require a minor mother and her child to live at home with her parents, so the maternal parents are responsible. What my amendment would do is say, where it is possible, a child support order should be obtained against the parents of the male involved. It takes two to tango in this instance, and the responsibility for the care of the child should not only belong to the maternal grandparents but the paternal as well.  So this solves the other half of the problem.
