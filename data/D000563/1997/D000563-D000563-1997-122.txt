President, I rise today to honor the people of Pakistan on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of their independence. In August of 1947, Pakistan gained its independence from the British Empire. For the past fifty years, the people of Pakistan have shared with the people of the United States a common interest in the establishment of democracy. In recent years, Pakistan has reasserted its committment to democratic government and is deserving of both our recognition and our support.  The friendship between the United States and Pakistan goes back many years. In the mid-1950's, Pakistan and the United States joined together in a security agreement to resist Soviet expansion in South Asia. In late 1955, Pakistan joined the South East Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, demonstrating Pakistan's committment to the Free World. This commitment proved invaluable during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, as our two nations united in opposition to Soviet aggression. Without a doubt, a close, constructive friendship between the United States and Pakistan has been essential to the security of both nations.  Beyond the affairs of state, there are the economic and cultural exchanges which spur growth and development and enrich the lives of our nations. In 1996, the total value of U.S. trade with Pakistan was $1.3 billion. Pakistan has recently embarked on an ambitious economic reform program to jumpstart the economy of Pakistan and provide the necessary foundation for free and fair trade. The United States should support these efforts, as Pakistan has the potential to one day become a model for the newly independent states of West and Central Asia.  Pakistani-Americans are a vibrant part of American cultural and economic life. Across the nation, Pakistani-Americans share their knowledge and heritage with other Americans, contribute to our economy, and create homes and neighborhoods which are a vital contribution to the American dream.  And so, on this the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of Pakistan, I rise to honor the people of Pakistan and their commitment to forge a free and democratic society. I look forward to many years of continued friendship between the people of Pakistan and the United States.                          ____________________
