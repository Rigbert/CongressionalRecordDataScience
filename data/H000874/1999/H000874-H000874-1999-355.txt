Speaker, I rise today to remember a horrifying event in our world's recent history. Eleven years ago, Saddam Hussein bombed the Kurdish town of Halabja with chemical weapons. Clouds of poison gas including mustard gas and sarin were rained down on Saddam's own people, merely because they were Kurds.  This heinous act resulted in the death of over 5,000 innocent civilians and injury to approximately 10,000 others. However, Halabja was neither the first nor the last of the chemical warfare attacks Saddam Hussein unleashed against the Iraqi Kurds. Throughout 1988, Saddam's brutal regime continued to use chemical weapons against its own people. In only 6 months, over 200 Kurdish villages were attacked and 25,000 people were killed by chemical weapons during the vicious Anfal Campaign. This campaign ultimately led to the destruction of 4,500 Kurdish villages and the death of 500,000 Kurdish people. More than 200,000 Kurds remain missing and 500,000 have been internally displaced.  Although the people of Halabja undoubtedly suffered beyond words when this horrifying event occurred 11 years ago, their children and their children's children will feel the effects of this one action of Saddam Hussein for generations to come. For, 11 years hence, the Halabja attack has not really ended. Many people in the region continue to suffer from respiratory problems, eye conditions, neurological disorders, skin problems, and cancers. All of these effects are attributable to long-term damage to DNA caused by the chemicals used by Saddam in the attack.  The Iraqi regime has never expressed remorse for Halabja, nor have Saddam Hussein and his thugs ever been called to account for these crimes they have committed against their own citizens. We do know that whether in attacks on Iraqis or neighboring states, inhumanity is precisely the common element of Saddam Hussein's policies. We must never forget the innocent people who died and those who continue to suffer from Saddam's ruthlessness.                          ____________________
