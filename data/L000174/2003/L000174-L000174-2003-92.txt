As a good friend of mine in the Republican Party said the other day: Pat, I know this whole argument is bogus. I guess we are making it for fundraising letters. But I do know President Bush has had far more of his nominees confirmed with both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate than anybody has in decades.  Yes, it is true, and I do agree with my Republican friend that the argument is bogus. But the only objection I have to the bogus argument being made is that we should be voting on the money for our veterans. We should be voting on the money for our law enforcement. We should be voting on the money for housing. And, we should be passing those bills that, by law, we were supposed to have passed way back in September.  I ask unanimous consent that the entire L.A. Times article that has been referred to by the distinguished Senator from Nevada be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 6, 2003]           Vacancy Rate on Federal Bench Is at a 13-Year Low                          (By David G. Savage)       Washington.--The vacancy rate on the federal bench is at is      lowest point in 13 years, because of a recent surge of judges      nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate.       The intense partisan battle over a handful of judges aside,      Bush has already won approval of 168 judges, more than      President Reagan achieved in his first term in the White      House. And with 68 of his nominees winning confirmation in      2003 as of Wednesday, President Bush has had a better record      this year than President Clinton achieved in seven of his      eight year in office.       Experts who track federal judgeships say Republican      complaints about Democratic filibuster of four judges have      obscured the larger picture.       ``The Bush administration has been spectacularly successful      in getting the overwhelming proportion of its judicial      nominations confirmed,'' said political scientist Sheldon      Goldman at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ``There      are only a relative handful being filibustered and held up.      And this contrasts with the dozens of Clinton nominees who      were held up by the Republicans in the last six years of the      Clinton administration. The truth is the Republicans have had      an outstanding record so far.''       The Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee lists      39 vacancies among the 859 seats on the U.S. district courts      and the U.S. courts of appeal--a 4.5% vacancy rate.       This is the fewest number of vacancies since 1990. During      Clinton's term in office, the number of vacancies on the      federal bench was never fewer than 50, according to the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.       Today, the Senate committee is set to vote on four more      judicial nominees, including California Supreme Court Justice      Janice Rogers Brown. She is likely to be opposed by almost      all of the panel's Democrats, one of whom called her a      ``right-wing judicial activist'' during a hearing two weeks      ago.       If confirmed by the full Senate, Brown would fill a seat on      the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia that is      vacant in part because Republicans blocked two candidates      that Clinton nominated in 1999.       Washington lawyer Allen Snyder, a former clerk to U.S.      Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, had a      hearing in the committee, but despite a lack of opposition,      he failed to gain a confirmation vote in the Senate. White      House lawyer Elena Kagan was denied even a hearing in the      GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee. She has since become a      dean of Harvard Law School.       Upon taking office, President Bush named Washington lawyers      John Roberts and Miguel A. Estrada to the same appeals court.      Roberts, also a former clerk to Rehnquist, won confirmation      this year and is now the junior judge on the U.S. Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia. Democrats filibustered      and blocked a final vote on Estrada, who subsequently      withdrew.       In July, President Bush chose Brown to fill the vacancy.       Even if she wins a narrow approval today, the minority      Democrats may block her from a final vote in the Senate.      Besides Estrada, they have blocked votes on Mississippi Judge      Charles W. Pickering Sr., Texas Supreme Court Justice      Priscilla R. Owen and Alabama Atty. Gen. William H. Pryor Jr.      Also waiting a final confirmation vote is Los Angeles      Superior Court Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl, Bush's nominee to the      U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.       Administration officials concede that most of Bush's judges      are being approved, but they point to the blocking of the      appeals court nominees as extraordinary.       The vacancy rate ``has been getting lower, but the real      problem is the showdown at the circuit courts. We have seen      an unprecedented obstruction campaign against the president's      nominees for the circuit courts,'' said John Nowacki, a      Justice Department spokesman. The department's Web site says      there are 41 vacancies on the federal bench, if the U.S.      Court of Claims and the International Trade Court are      included in the total.       The administration says Bush has made 46 nominations to the      appeals court, but only 29 have won confirmation. ``That's a      63% confirmation rate.        Clinton had an 80 percent confirmation rate at the same      time,'' Nowacki said. ``There is something different going on      here. It's an obstruction at entirely different level.''        Goldman, the University of Massachusetts professor, said      both parties have blocked prospective judges they viewed as      extreme, but they have done it in different ways.        ``The Republicans obstructed quietly in the committee,''      Goldman said. ``If they didn't want to approve you, you just      didn't get a hearing. The Democrats have obstructed through      the use of the filibuster, which is very open and visible.''        During Clinton's final six years in office, Republicans      controlled the Senate, and they refused to confirm more than      60 of his judicial nominees.                             Bench strength        Here's how President bush's confirmed nominations to      Federal judgeships compares with his three predecessors:        President George W. Bush: 2003: 68; 2002: 72; and 2001:      28**.        President Bill Clinton: 2000: 40*; 1999: 33*; 1998: 65*;      1997: 36*; 1996: 20*; 1995; 55*; 1994: 101; 1993: 28; and      1992: 66*.        President George H. W. Bush: 1991: 56*; 1990: 55*; and      1989: 15*.        President Ronald Reagan: 1988: 41*; 1987: 43*; 1986: 44;      1985: 84; 1984: 43; 1983: 32; 1982: 47; and 1981: 41.        * Senate controlled by opposition.        ** Senate evenly divided until Sen.
