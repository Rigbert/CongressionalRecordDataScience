President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, will hold a hearing entitled ``Conquering Diabetes: Are We Taking Full Advantage of the Scientific Opportunities For Research?'' This Subcommittee hearing will examine the devastating impact that diabetes and its resulting complications have had on Americans of all ages in both human and economic terms. Additionally, we will review the recent recommendations of the Congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working Group and will look at the current Federal commitment to diabetes research to determine if sufficient funding has been provided to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunities to ultimately conquer this disease and its complications.  The hearing will take place on Thursday, October 14, 1999, at 9:30 a.m., in Room 628 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Lee Blalack of the Subcommittee staff at 224-3721.                          ____________________
