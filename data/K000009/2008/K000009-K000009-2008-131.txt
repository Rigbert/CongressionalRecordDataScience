Bob O'Connell of Toledo, Ohio. Recently, Bob was acknowledged by a wonderful story published in the Toledo Blade tracing his many accomplishments. Our entire community applauds him for his life's achievements, and thanks him.  Bob has taught and mentored thousands and thousands of young athletes across our community in his chosen sport of tennis. For 21 years, he coached students at Rogers and Ottawa Hills High Schools during the regular school year and summer. Truly, he has been a teacher's teacher and a coaches' coach and has been recognized in the Ohio High School Tennis Coaches Hall of Fame. Bob also taught history and worked to develop his students as well-rounded persons who are both academically and physically fit. I can personally attest to his skill and patience having been one of his many students so many years ago. Bob taught not just the skills of tennis and endurance, but also what it meant to be a good sport. He held his racket with distinction, kept focus, and airily breezed across the court with an ease that demonstrated this indeed was his sport.  Bob raised another generation of O'Connell's who follow in his footsteps, his son Kevin, Sr., was the No. 1 singles player for 3 years at St. Francis and earned a scholarship to college as a result. Now his children, Kevin Jr. achieved rank as an All-City League first team player all 4 years as a high school and Kelly O'Connell was the No. 1 singles player at St. Ursula for 3 years.  It is hard to place an adequate value on a man who has played such a significant father-figure role not just to his family but to our community, using his teaching and coaching abilities to rear the next generation. I feel personally honored to have been coached by Bob O'Connell and recognize his extraordinary accomplishments as an American who gave so much of himself, so quietly and effectively, to the next generation. He is the kind of man that deserves admiration for he exemplifies what it means to be a man for others. May he and his family enjoy many years together and may he and they know how truly our community expresses its gratitude to him. Onward.                          ____________________
