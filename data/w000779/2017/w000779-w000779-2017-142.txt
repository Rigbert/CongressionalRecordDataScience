President, very briefly, I strongly support this amendment, colleagues.  The point of this is, this is an amendment that does what the President says he wants to do, which is not give relief to the people at the top, but the reality is, when you look at their proposal, it really does drive much of the wealth in America to those at the very top.  The Sanders amendment is to ensure that people at the top of the top don't get relief. We get it to working families and the vulnerable. I urge colleagues to strongly support this amendment.
