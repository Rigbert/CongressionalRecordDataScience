Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1150) to amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts, and through stronger and more flexible political responses to religious freedom violations and violent extremism worldwide, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.
