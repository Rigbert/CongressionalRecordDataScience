Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I have been listening to this debate for about 1 hour and 45 minutes here on the floor, and I have some specifics that I can reference and I will revise and extend and include those.  But I rise, Mr. Chairman, because we talk about specific items. I want to follow up on the comments of the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spence].  I am one of those who believes that both sides of the aisle are putting at risk defense. One side of the aisle argues that we need tax cuts. I would like to have tax cuts.
