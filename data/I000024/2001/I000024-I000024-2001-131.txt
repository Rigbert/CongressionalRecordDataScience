President, I rise today in recognition of the hard work that Mr. Eddie Rathbun and the staff of the Natural Resources Conservation Service have done for the people of Bridge Creek, OK.  I have often spoke of the incredible kindness Oklahomans have demonstrated through trying times, and Mr. Eddie Rathbun's actions have been an example of this. I am sure you remember the horrible tornados that ravaged Oklahoma in May of 1999 that killed 44 people and injured 795 others. For many of my constituents this was a very difficult time and Mr. Rathbun and the staff of the Natural Resources Conservation Service went out of their way to be helpful to those who's lives had been altered by this disaster. Mr. Rathbun and his crew worked long hours, in difficult working conditions, to ensure that the people in Bridge Creek could return their lives to normal. The people of this community have informed me that he was a great help to them in a time of need, and have expressed a deep appreciation of him, which I share here today.  Mr. Eddie Rathbun and the crew of the Natural Resources Conservation Service exemplify the Oklahoma spirit of going beyond what is necessary to help a neighbor in a time of need. I wanted to recognize the efforts of a good man, for the kindness he has provided to the people of Oklahoma.                          ____________________
