Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to thank the gentlewoman from California for offering this amendment. I had an amendment that would have also used the $67 million, but obviously, being the ranking member of the committee, hers in the prioritization came first. But it is unfortunate that we would be looking to use the money for one thing and cannot get to the other. The money that I was hoping to use it for would be for the construction of refugee camps.  I was part of the Armey delegation that just got back from Macedonia and Albania along with the presiding Speaker, and 19 of us were there and heard it was unanimity. Everybody we talked to, from the two star General to the AID people, that they desperately needed to build two more refugee camps in Albania to accommodate 20,000 people each.  As my colleagues know, we got to remember there are, according to General Wesley Clark, 820,000 internally displaced people and more than 700,000 people who have exited the borders and are now officially called refugees, an enormous number of people, and unfortunately, because of budget caps and things of that kind, we are unable.  Last night I went to the Committee on Rules and respectfully asked that I be able to offer $100 million additional moneys for the construction of those two refugee camps. They are $50 million a pop, and, like the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) and his food aid amendment, I was turned down, and that is most unfortunate.                              {time}  1615  Let me just say, when this gets into conference, it is my desperate hope, because we are looking at the possibility of cholera and other contagious and infectious diseases, we need to stabilize this situation and the military, no one does it better when it comes to constructing these camps.  I would like to ask our very distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), if he will help us, because I know his heart.  He added $70 million to the refugee camp account over and above what the President requested and did make that appeal to the President to be more generous, not less.
