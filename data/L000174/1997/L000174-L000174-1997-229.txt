President, I might note for my colleagues, the distinguished President pro tempore, the senior Senator from South Carolina, has set a remarkable example. In my 23 years here in the Senate, I think I have seen him as President pro tempore opening the Senate more times than I have seen anybody else. I note that this happens whether we have been in session half the night and coming in early in the morning, or whenever it is. I compliment my good friend from South Carolina. I am glad, however, to see that he does not carry the baseball bat here that was presented to him by the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and myself at the Judiciary Committee meeting last week.  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?                          ____________________
