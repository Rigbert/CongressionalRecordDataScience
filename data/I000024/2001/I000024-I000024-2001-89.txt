President, in a couple of days, July 27th to be exact, I will be going to Oshkosh, WI, to attend ``2001 Air Venture'' or the Oshkosh Fly-In for those of us who are involved in general aviation. This will be the 23rd consecutive year that I have gone and it is an event that I look forward to each July.  As in years past, I will use the opportunity to catch up with old friends, watch a couple of air shows, and look over hundreds of planes. In addition, this year I will have the opportunity to meet a true American hero, Colonel Harold Dean Weekley, retired, who will be honored by the WAR BIRDS for his 30 years of service in the Army Air Corp and then the United States Air Force. During World War II, Colonel Weekley flew B17's where he had a great many close calls but in each instance heroically finished his mission and on several occasions put his own life on the line to protect his crew.  I know all my colleagues will agree with me that we owe the men and women of the Armed Forces a tremendous debt of gratitude because they are the ones on the front lines protecting our liberty. Colonel Weekley and his generation went above and beyond the call of duty when they put their lives and careers on hold to fight in a conflict a half a world away which many at the time did not believe should involve the United States. Certainly in hindsight, American involvement in World War II was not only the right thing to do but critical to our own security. It was courageous individuals like Colonel Weekley that won the war. Therefore, I think it very fitting that the WAR BIRDS honor Colonel Weekley for his service and urge my colleagues to join me in thanking the Colonel for the sacrifices he has made for us.                          ____________________
