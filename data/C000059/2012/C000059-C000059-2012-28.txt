Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group of individuals--heroes--who are receiving the recognition and honor they deserve for their service to our country. Operation Recognition is operated by the Riverside County Office of Education with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veterans' Services. The program awards high school diplomas to veterans who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  A recognition ceremony was held on November 7, 2012, for the following individuals who received their high school diplomas through Operation Recognition:  Edward A. Alfaro; Anthony John Amoroso; Edward Barr; Leroy Burbidge; Justino Castillo; Harry J. Dillon; James N. Ellis; James Albert Finch; Irving G. Fowler; Robert Ray Gooch, Jr.; Herb Levine; Donald George Marion; Marvin Odell Pace; Anastacia P. Panarites; Thomas James Plouffe; Michael Loren Rittenhouse; Robert Rodriguez; Edward L. Ryan; Robert Irwin Stover; Glenn C. Waggoner Jr.; Robert Lee Williamson; James Verne Olson; and Thomas Eugene Butler.  Our country owes a debt of gratitude to all the above recipients for their service and sacrifice. I salute all the above individuals and congratulate them on receiving their high school diploma.                          ____________________
