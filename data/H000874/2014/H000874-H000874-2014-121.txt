Speaker, I want to thank the majority leader for his continuing positive comments with respect to assuring that every American not only has the right to vote, but has the access to vote and that we facilitate one's casting of that vote.  I look forward and my office looks forward to continuing to work with him towards that objective. Time, of course, is of the essence on this, so I am hopeful that we can move forward sooner, rather than later.  The last subject I would bring up--and we have also had brief discussions on this, Mr. Speaker, with the majority leader--is that the Export-Import Bank authority will expire in the not too distant future.  We believe on this side of the aisle that this is a very, very important piece of legislation. We have an agenda called Make It In America. One of the things that is important for the Make It in America agenda is to encourage and to facilitate the exporting of goods overseas. We think the Export-Import Bank does exactly that.  I would ask the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, if there is any prospect of bringing that to the floor. I might observe that the majority leader and I worked very, very closely and effectively, in a bipartisan way, when we authorized the Export-Import Bank the last time. I am hopeful that we can continue to do the same.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader.
