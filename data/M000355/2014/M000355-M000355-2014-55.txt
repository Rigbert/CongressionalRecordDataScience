 I have had an opportunity to get to know Debbie Smith pretty well, as Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy have. We have met on several occasions.  The bill passed the House of Representatives a few months ago on a voice vote. We tried to clear it when it came over here. Unfortunately, there was an objection on the other side of the aisle. But I am glad we are where we are and that the bill will be reauthorized.  It is certainly fitting for Congress to pass this bill that is named for such a tireless advocate for those who suffered this terrible abuse.
