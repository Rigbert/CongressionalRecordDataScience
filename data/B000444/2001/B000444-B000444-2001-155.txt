 The Senator from Delaware voted yes on that amendment. I have cast over 10,000 votes as a U.S. Senator. It was one of the two votes I most regret ever having cast. The other one was voting for a fine, decent man, Supreme Court Justice Scalia. I regret that because his view turned out to be so fundamentally different than my view of the Constitution.  One of the reasons why I think what the Senator is saying is so important is it took the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware--you doing the right thing in the first instance, me making a mistake--it took us almost 20 years to bail out. I have the scars on my back, as does the Senator. He did not deserve them, I do--for the efforts we had to undertake to put the budget back in shape.  We did that at a time when we had expanding productivity, when we had a lot of unmet capacity in the country, when, in fact, we were moving--there was a chance to rectify it. There will be no chance because when this kicks in--and I am going to sit down--when this kicks in, because it is the same time guys like the Senators from Connecticut and Delaware, the baby boom generation, are going to be retiring.
