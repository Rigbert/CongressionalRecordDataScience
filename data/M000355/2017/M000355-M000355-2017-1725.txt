 Let me say that again--truly historic, unprecedented, harmful, and pointless obstruction. It is one thing to obstruct to get some outcome. Really, these are a collection of futile gestures not changing the outcome on any of these nominations.  They have postponed committee meetings as long as they possibly could. They forced unnecessary procedural hurdles, and they have even boycotted markups altogether.  So as I indicated, to what end? It hasn't prevented the Senate from moving forward with the confirmation of these nominees. And, by the way, it hasn't--and it won't--change the outcome of the election, either, which was back in November. I think it is pretty clear that that is what this is all about.  Instead, this Democratic obstruction has just kept many of our Nation's most critical agencies without a leader for too long--needlessly delaying the President from fully standing up this new administration. It has led to what is now the longest it has taken to confirm most of the President's Cabinet since George Washington--what a record for our Democratic colleagues to hold.  Enough is enough. We need to put the rest of the President's Cabinet into place without further delay. Confirming these well-qualified nominees is what is best for our country. My goodness, isn't that what we should all want?  I yield the floor.
