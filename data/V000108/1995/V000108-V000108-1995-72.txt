Speaker, northwest Indiana lost a great business leader last month. William N. Kenefick, who devoted every ounce of his spirit to the Indiana Port Commission and development of northwest Indiana, passed away on August 10, 1995.  William was the son of a lawyer and a grandson of Michigan City, IN's, first judge. He graduated from Notre Dame University, the Benjamin Franklin School of Accounting, and Georgetown University Law School.  Following service in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1946 as a lieutenant, he began his law practice in Michigan City. William actively practiced law until 1978. It was at this point in time that William launched another career as a land developer. William's major projects included the Marina Park South, Commerce Square, Medical Plaza, and Congress Park condominium and office complexes in Michigan City.  Moreover, in 1989, William joined the Indiana Port Commission, which oversees all three of Indiana's port sites. In 1991, William became the head of the commission. During his tenure, William stressed maritime-related industrial development at port properties. William succeeded in developing family-wage jobs for residents of northwest Indiana. As Indiana's International Port at Burns Harbor, IN, celebrates its 25th anniversary, the citizens of northwest Indiana can thank William for his dedication to the Port Commission to make Indiana's ports a success.  William's determination to better northwest Indiana for all of its residents did not stop in the business community. In 1968, William underwent surgery for cancer of the larynx and then traveled to Arizona to learn to speak without a voicebox. He later counseled people facing the same operation.  Mr. Speaker and my other distinguished colleagues, William Kenefick's legacy is a superb example of how the business community can make a difference for everyone in northwest Indiana. William will be missed by all who loved him.                          ____________________
