In the event that we don't have legislation coming back from the Senate that we needed to deal with on Friday, or our business that is scheduled does not take longer than Thursday, then it is possible that we would not be in session. But, again, I would caution Members that we have 2 weeks left to go and those days will be scheduled and will be utilized if needed.
