Speaker, at the request of the Committee on Financial Services, I hereby submit for the Record correspondence between that Committee and the Committee on the Judiciary relating to the Financial Services Committee's agreement to waive its consideration of H.R. 333, the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001.''                              Committee on Financial Services,                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2001.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Jim: On February 14, 2001 the Committee on the      Judiciary ordered reported H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse      Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001. As you know,      the Committee on Financial Services was granted an additional      referral upon the bill's introduction pursuant to the      committee's jurisdiction under Rule X of the Rules of the      House of Representatives over banks and banking, credit, and      securities and exchanges.       Because of your willingness to consult with the Committee      on Financial Services     regarding this matter, your continuing support for our      requested changes, and the need to move this legislation      expeditiously, I will waive consideration of the bill by the      Financial Services Committee. By agreeing to waive its      consideration of the bill, the Financial Services Committee      does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 333. In addition,      the Committee on Financial Services reserves its authority to      seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within      the Financial Services Committee's jurisdiction during any      House-Senate conference that may be convened on this      legislation. I ask your commitment to support any request by      the Committee on Financial Services for conferees on H.R. 333      or related legislation.       I request that you include this letter and your response as      part of your committee's report on the bill and the      Congressional Record during consideration of the legislation      on the House floor.       thank for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                 Michael G. Oxley,     Chairman.                                  ____                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, February 22, 2001.     Hon. Michael G. Oxley,     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn          House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mike: This letter responds to your letter dated      February 21, 2001, concerning H.R. 333, the ``Bankruptcy      Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001'' which      was favorably reported by the House Committee on the      Judiciary on February 14, 2001.       I agree that the bill contains matters within the Financial      Services Committee's jurisdiction and appreciate your      willingness to be discharged from further consideration of      H.R. 333 so that we may proceed to the floor.       Pursuant to your request, a copy of your letter and this      letter will be included in the report of the Committee on the      Judiciary on H.R. 333.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule. I had hoped that the House would have had an opportunity to debate the amendment sponsored by myself and Representatives Kanjorski, Nadler, and Jackson-Lee, that would have addressed the very serious problem of misleading and deceptive credit card practices. It is extremely disappointing that the Rule only provides for a handful of amendments. But, the Rule is thereby consistent with the history of this legislation, for H.R. 333 is the product of a shadow conference, not full congressional deliberations, where issues important to consumers and working families could have been seriously considered. The Financial Services Committee never even availed itself of the opportunity to review the bill, although it contains significant changes to the Truth In Lending Act.  The bill is not balanced. H.R. 333 attempts to deal with the results of the increasing level of consumer bankruptcies. But the bill fails to deal adequately with one of the principal causes. That cause is the aggressive promotion of consumer debt by credit card companies, without any attention to reasonable underwriting standards, and increasingly targeted at vulnerable populations that can neither afford it nor, often, repay it. As policymakers, we cannot expect consumers to willingly assume the greater financial responsibility contemplated under this bill unless we also simultaneously protect them from abusive practices which unfairly trap them into debt they can ill afford.  Our amendment addresses credit card company practices that directly contribute to the increasing level of consumer debt and the rise in consumer bankruptcies. It goes beyond the traditional emphasis on disclosure and provides stronger protections for all consumers against credit card company practices that are at the very least misleading and, often, intentionally deceptive. In particular, it addresses the concerns of populations which have proven to be most vulnerable. People in their twenties are the fastest growing group filing for bankruptcy. To a large degree, that is the result of aggressive targeting of students and young people just starting out in life by credit card companies that trap them into a cycle of debt before they have adequate income to sustain it.  The few provisions in H.R. 333 that attempt to address this issue are inadequate and may turn out to be illusory because their effective date could be delayed indefinitely through a mandatory regulatory process.  The credit card industry is asking Congress for relief from allegedly inadequate bankruptcy statutes. Congress should not consider such relief unless it also relives vulnerable consumers of the burden of abusive credit card company practices. We must do a better job of bringing balance to this bill, and ensuring that credit card issuers take responsibility for their own actions that have helped to create the consumer debt problems that America faces today.  I urge that my colleagues vote against this Rule, and let the Committees do their job and hold full and fair hearings on these issues.
