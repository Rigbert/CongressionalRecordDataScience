Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the season, I have a little gift for the gentleman from Maryland. It comes from a little shop in my hometown, family-owned. They are excited about what we have been able to do this Congress. It is a little candy that might sweeten his spirit, and he might even be more likely to work with us to solve the problem.  Merry Christmas.
