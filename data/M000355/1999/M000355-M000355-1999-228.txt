 Considering the fact that barely 40 percent of the interest to be derived from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the IMF gold would actually be available to the HIPC nations for debt relief, it seems to me that this amounts to a cruel hoax. Of particular concern to me is the fact that the sale of the IMF gold would reduce gold prices to such an extent that the harm done to HIPC nations' economies will likely exceed any benefit from this debt relief effort. I believe the issue of debt relief for the HIPC nations is important and must be dealt with, but such a program must be designed to reduce the economic burden on these countries not compound them.
