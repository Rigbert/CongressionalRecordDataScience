Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I can only say, Members may not know that George is a person that can speak three different languages. He served in the military with honor as an officer. He has probably the greatest knowledge of anybody I have ever met. To have George Gekas as a dear friend, ashe was and is, is something I will always cherish. We are two opposites. I am the barbarian and he is the intellect. But we worked together. I watched him on this floor especially during the impeachment time, the dignity he brought and the knowledge that he had, the legal background that he used; I have the greatest respect for his abilities. I cherished his friendship and tonight was a crowning night for him. We did lose him, but we really have never lost him because he will always be in our hearts.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman's comments.
