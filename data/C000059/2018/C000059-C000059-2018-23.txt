Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, EPA was directed by the President to take a second look at the methane rule promulgated by the Obama administration. In conjunction with that review, EPA attempted to provide the regulating community with some certainty by postponing some implementation dates. However, the courts have blocked that from happening.  In light of these challenges, the time is ripe for a temporary pause on the enforcement of these requirements, so I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
