 Chairman, that is the CBO, 1999.  Mr. Chairman, I can well understand why some of my friends from various States are here to defend this program. I can understand that.  The reality is that unlike the weatherization program, which is well distributed to all 50 States, the lion's share of fossil fuel research money goes to relatively few States. In fact, over 50 percent of the designated funds goes to four States, while 38 percent of that money goes to two States. This amendment is good environmental policy, it is good public policy, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.
