It is a large bill that deals with the education of our children, the health of our people, and the ability of our working people to succeed. I know that there is great attention being given to that bill. We are hopeful that it will come to the floor, and we are hopeful when it comes to the floor, there will be an opportunity to vote up or down on increasing the minimum wage over a period of time. Is there any hope or expectation that that bill might come to the floor?
