Speaker, I stand in favor of this bill. I also want to commend the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means for an excellent job.  It certainly is an historic week. For the first time in a generation, we will balance the budget and provide tax relief to working families across the Nation. This Congress will leave the legacy of a smaller, less invasive government to our children. At the same time, we will ensure that middle-class Americans keep more of their money.  Today we will refund to the American people one-third of President Clinton's tax increase, the largest in history. Back in my congressional district, the per-child tax credit will mean families with children can save $47 million next year. California has had some tough years, as the Speaker knows. We are looking forward to having better years. This is going to help, Mr. Speaker.  Some said this day would never happen. Thanks to the Republican Congress, it has. But the real winners this week are my constituents and the rest of the American people. We look forward to future days like this.
