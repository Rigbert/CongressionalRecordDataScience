Mr. Chairman, I have asked her and relayed a message that there is a growing concern in Congress, among the American people that, if they move in or evolve into some kind of abortion promotion, which some of their people would like to see, it is over. We will find other ways of using our money to advance the child survival revolution. We need to continue, I think, to give those messages in a very real way, and I will offer the amendment on the floor, if anything, to curtail that funding and make sure that it is given to other child survival programs throughout the world.
