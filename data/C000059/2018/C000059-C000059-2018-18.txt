 On July 19, the House passed H.R. 6147 by a vote of 217-199, which includes the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies and the Financial Services and General Government bills.  The Senate has now sent H.R. 6147 back to the House with the Agricultureand Transportation bills added to the package. With the appointment of these conferees, the House and the Senate may begin to resolve differences, with the goal of passing H.R. 6147 before the end of the fiscal year.  As such, I strongly support this motion.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the motion.  The previous question was ordered.  The motion was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at the desk.
