 President, I wish to offer a few words regarding our outgoing President. I had a chance, as some others did yesterday, to receive a call from him, which I appreciated. I want to say farewell to President Obama. I think it is worth, once again, reflecting on the significance of his election and the historic achievement it represented in terms of our country's past. That is something both he and our country should be very proud of.  It is no secret that the President and I and other Members of my party have not always seen eye to eye. Over the years, we have pursued totally different legislative priorities. Everybody around here knows that.
