 President, the Nation has lost a brave patriot who died defending freedom. Sergeant Joseph A. Richardson, who grew up in Algona, IA, was killed during a patrol in Paktika province, Afghanistan on November 16, 2012. He was clearly an accomplished, professional soldier as evidenced by his numerous awards, including: the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, NATO Ribbon, and the Combat Infantry Badge.  SGT Richardson's family released a statement that described Joe as someone who ``lived his life full of energy and with passion for everything he did.'' They also said that, ``He loved his job; he loved fighting for his country and our freedom.'' In fact, he demonstrated this by re-enlisting for six more years in the Army shortly before his untimely death. His love of country and willingness to serve marks Joseph Richardson as one of our nation's finest citizens, and his noble sacrifice immortalizes him among the ranks of our most honored war dead. We owe SGT Richardson and all those like him who have fallen in the name of liberty our infinite gratitude.  We ought also to remember his family in our prayers, including his wife Ashley, his mother, Ginette, his father, Greg, and many other family and friends who will feel his loss very deeply. As those closest to Joseph Richardson remember the life of their loved one, it is incumbent on all Americans to preserve his memory and to reflect on the enormous price he and other like him have paid to preserve our free way of life.                          ____________________
