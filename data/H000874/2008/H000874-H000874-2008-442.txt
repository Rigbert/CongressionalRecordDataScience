 On Monday, the House will not be in session, in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, which was on January 15, but will be celebrated and honored on Monday.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills, as is the normal course, will be announced by the close of business tomorrow. On Wednesday, we will also take up the President's veto of the children's health insurance legislation.  The House will not be in session on Thursday or Friday. The minority party is having its conference at that point in time, as we will have the following week.
