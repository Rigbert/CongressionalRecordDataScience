Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and commend a young lady from my district who has brought pride and honor to her family, friends and school. Macie Hanrahan, a student at Raney Intermediate School in Corona, California, won first place in the junior division individual performance category at National History Day.  National History Day is an annual competition in which students research and learn about events in history. Competitions are held at the district, state and national levels and are judged by historians and educators. Students present their historical findings in papers, exhibits, performances and media presentations. The theme of this year's event was ``Migrations in History: People, Ideas, Cultures.''  As an American of Irish descent, Macie chose Irish Migration of the 1840's as her topic, with a performance entitled ``Deori! Forced From Erin's Soil.'' In her performance, she used the voices of three girls from Ireland, England and America to show differing perspectives of the Irish potato famine, the forced migration that followed, and the experiences that people of different cultures went through during this time in history. To win this event, Macie conducted exhaustive research, including using the National Archives, the Library of Congress, U.S. and Irish Census Records, and original diaries, letters and newspapers of the time.  On behalf of the residents of the 43rd congressional district of California, I congratulate Macie for her hard work and a job well done and wish her continued success in all of her future endeavors.                          ____________________
