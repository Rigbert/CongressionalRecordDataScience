Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on International Relations be discharged from further consideration of the Senate bill (S. 180) to facilitate famine relief efforts and a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
