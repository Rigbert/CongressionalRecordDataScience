 President, I just want to commend the distinguished leader for offering the Jordanian debt relief amendment. This is exactly the same amendment which I offered earlier this year to the defense bill.  Essentially what the leader's amendment would do, it would provide $50 million in debt relief, which would be obligated in fiscal year 1995, and $225 million for 1996.  The point is, this is the final installment in the agreement that we have with the Jordanians. The King was in town, as we all know, last week. Many of us met with him. He is making a good-faith effort to turn his country around and to be an important part of this growing peace movement in the Middle East.  I think this is an extremely important measure. I commend the majority leader for offering it to this bill. Maybe it will make this bill a little sweeter for those who seem not to want it to go anywhere. I, obviously, hope this will be approved at the appropriate time.  I thank the leader.
