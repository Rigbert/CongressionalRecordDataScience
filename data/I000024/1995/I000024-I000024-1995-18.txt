President, I, like many people, have been distressed over the weekend listening to a lot of the comments as to what is going on in Bosnia, and this seems to be--and it is portrayed by this administration that it is--a done deal. Many Republicans and many Democrats are also saying that it is a done deal; that the troops are going to go; the President has made up his mind. The President, back in February 1993, made a commitment of 25,000 American troops on the ground in Bosnia, and he has decided they are going to go. So I guess the easy thing is to say, well, the President made the decision; I may not agree with it or I may agree with it but nonetheless the decision is made, and we want to support our troops that are over there.  I am really getting tired of the demagoging that is going on about supporting the troops that are over there, as if this thing is a done deal. I grant you, Mr. President, I agree that the President of the United States does have the constitutional right to deploy troops. I think it is wrong, and historically it has not been done. The Presidents have come to the American people and have come through Congress for resolutions of approval, and this President has chosen not to do this.  Of course, I will remind all America that the House of Representatives, the other body, has already on two occasions expressed itself in a very, very strong vote in opposition to the deployment of ground troops to Bosnia. So we turn on the talk radio shows and we look at the news accounts, and they say, well, it is already a done deal and Congress has no role; Congress is not relevant in this debate.  I just do not buy that. I think this is still America, and the American people can be heard, and the best way for the American people to be heard is through their elected representatives. I think we have just a few hours to stop this thing. I am talking now about the mass deployment.  Yes, the President has already sent several hundred troops into the area of Tuzla, which is the northeastern sector, in which I had occasion to spend quite a bit of time, and I see an environment which is the most hostile environment that perhaps we have ever had the occasion to deploy any American troop into in the history of this country. We talk about and can identify that there are more than 6 million mines of all shapes and sizes that are out there, and you cannot do anything about rendering those mines harmless because the ground is now frozen and they will not appear really until a heavy vehicle gets on top of them. Of course, we are talking about the deployment of 130 M1 tanks and several other armored vehicles, so it is a very frightening thing. It is a frightening thing to think it is not just a matter of three factions that do not like each other in the former Yugoslavia. It is not just the Serbs and the Croats and the Moslems, because in addition to that you have the Bosnian Serbs, you have the Bosnian Moslems, you have the Arkan Tigers, you have the Black Swans, you have the Afghanistans, you have the Iranians. You have all of these, what we call rogue factions over there. And yet they say it is a done deal.  I think it is too easy to say that. I hope that everyone in America will demand that their Senator get on record on this issue. Mr. President, we are going to give them the opportunity to get on record on this issue. Last week, I served notice that there is going to be an up-or-down vote on the sending of troops into Bosnia.  It is not a matter of supporting our troops that are there. You bet we support them. I know something about being a troop. I used to be in a troop, and I wanted the support of the American people and got it. I think every Member of this Senate, every Member of the other body, is going to support our troops wherever they are.  That is not the issue. That is a copout. The issue is, should they be over there to begin with? I can remember so well when Michael Rose, who was the commanding general of the troops, the U.N. troops, in Bosnia said, if America sends troops over there, they will have more casualties than they had in the Persian Gulf. That was 390.  In the Senate Armed Services Committee, when I asked Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher and General Shalikashvili--I said, ``Is that mission to contain a civil war and to protect the integrity of NATO worth more than 400 American lives?'' And Secretary Perry said yes; Secretary Christopher said yes; General Shalikashvili said yes. But I say no, because, you see, Mr. President, they were speaking on behalf of the President of the United States, the top people, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and, of course, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  So now we say it is a done deal and that Congress is not relevant. But I say we are going to have a vote on this, and people are going to have to be responsible for it.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that at this point an editorial be printed in the Record, a December 1 editorial by Abraham Sofaer.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Clinton Needs Congress on Bosnia                         (By Abraham D. Sofaer)       President Clinton has appealed to Congress and the American      people to support his policy committing 20,000 ground troops      to implement the peace agreement reached between Serbia,      Croatia and Bosnia. It is a tribute to the American people      that the president is accorded the greatest deference when he      calls for the greatest sacrifice. Americans respond, at least      initially, to such appeals from their President.       But Mr. Clinton is exploiting this quality. He has      presented the agreement and the American role in its      enforcement as an accomplished fact, though the documents      have yet to be signed by the parties, and numerous      preconditions to U.S. involvement have yet to be fulfilled.      He is consulting with Congress, but he is already sending      troops to the area without any form of legislative approval.      Indeed, he claims that, while he would welcome Congress's      approval, he plans to go ahead regardless.       Presidents often try to get what they want by leading      aggressively. Congress nevertheless has a duty to study      carefully the proposed operation and then express its view.      The essential first step in that debate is to read the      documents signed recently in Dayton. The complex agreement,      with 12 annexes, calls for Bosnia to remain a single but      divided nation, and all the warring factions      to withdraw to specific lines. The agreement covers virtually all      aspects of future life in Bosnia, including the division of      its governments, the contents of its constitution, the      selection of its judges, and the manner in which its police      force is to be chosen and trained. Of principal interest to      Congress, though, are those aspects of the agreement that      create obligations and expectations for the U.S. to fulfill.                            our obligations       These obligations, when carefully examined in context,      carry to the ultimate extreme the policy of forcing a      settlement on the Bosnians, rather than attempting to create      an internal situation that is militarily balanced. Most      significantly, the agreement makes the U.S., through the      ``implementation force'' (IFOR), the military guarantor of      the overall arrangement.       The role of U.S. troops cannot be characterized as      ``peacekeeping.'' Even ``implementation'' understates our      obligation, IFOR will be close to an occupying army, in a      conflict that has merely been suspended. We are likely to      have as many difficulties acting as occupiers without having      won a victory as the U.N.'s war crimes tribunal is having in      attempting to apply its decisions in Bosnia without the power      to enforce them.       IFOR's principal responsibilities are set out in Annex 1(a)      of the agreement:       The parties agree to cease hostilities and to withdraw all      forces to agreed lines in three phases. Detailed rules have      been agreed upon, including special provisions regarding      Sarajevo and Gorazde. But IFOR is responsible for marking the      cease-fire lines and the ``inter-entity boundary line and its      zone of separation,'' which in effect will divide the Bosnian      Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian Serbs. The parties agree      that IFOR may use all necessary force to ensure their      compliance with these disengagement rules.       The parties agree to ``strictly avoid committing any      reprisals, counterattacks, or any unilateral actions in      response to violations of this annex by another party.'' The      only response allowed to alleged violations is through the      procedures provided in Article VIII of the Annex, which      establishes a ``joint military commission''--made up of all      the parties--to consider military complaints, questions and      problems. But the commission is only ``a consultative body      for the IFOR commander,'' an American general who is      explicitly deemed ``the final authority in theater regarding      interpretation of this agreement. . . .'' This enormous      power--to prevent even acts of self defense--will carry      proportionate responsibility for harm that any party may      attribute to IFOR's lack of responsiveness or fairness.       IFOR is also given the responsibility to support various      nonmilitary tasks, including creating conditions for free and      fair elections; assisting humanitarian organizations;      observing and preventing ``interference with the movement of      civilian populations, refugees, and displaced persons'';      clearing the roads of mines; controlling all airspace (even      for civilian air travel); and ensuring access to all areas      unimpeded by checkpoints, roadblocks or other obstacles.      Taken together, these duties essentially give IFOR control      of the physical infrastructure of both parts of the      Bosnian state. It seems doubtful that the 60,000-man force      could meet these expectations.       Article IX of the agreement recognizes the ``obligation of      all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution      of war crimes and other violations of international      humanitarian law.'' This is an especially sensitive matter.      Yet there is no mechanism in the accord for bringing to      justice men who haven't been defeated in battle and who      aren't in custody. This means that IFOR is almost certain to      come under pressure by victims and human rights advocates to      capture and deliver up the principal villains. Will it do      better than we did in fulfilling our promise to capture      Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia?       The agreement makes vague promises about reversing ``ethnic      cleansing'' by guaranteeing refugees the right to return to      their homes. Since this is in practice impossible, the West      will end up paying billions in compensation awards promised      in the agreement.       The agreement contains numerous provisions regarding the      manner in which Bosnia is to be governed, with checks and      balances built in that are based on ethnic or geographic      terms. But Americans traditionally have not believed in such      divisions of political authority. We fought the Civil War to      put into place an undivided nation based on the principle      that all people are of equal worth, and all must live in      accordance with the law. It took a Tito to keep the      ethnically divided Yugoslavia together. Will IFOR now assume      his role of enforcing a constitution based on principles      abhorrent to Western values? Even if the basic structure of      the government works, what role will IFOR have to play in      resolving disputes over the numerous sensitive areas that the      parties have seen fit to write into the accords? If the      parties don't resolve some matters successfully, they are      likely to blame IFOR for these failures.       Finally, the agreement draws a vague distinction between      ``military'' and ``civilian'' matters. Ultimate authority      over the latter is allocated to a U.N. high representative,      who is to act through a ``joint civilian commission''      consisting of senior political representatives of the parties      and the IFOR commander or his representative. The high      representative is to exchange information and maintain      liaison on a regular basis with IFOR, and shall attend or be      represented at meetings of the joint military commission and      offer advice ``particularly on matters of a political-     military nature.'' But it is also made clear that the high      representative ``shall have no authority over the IFOR and      shall not in any way interfere in the conduct of military      operations or the IFOR chain of command.''       This may seem a reassuring confirmation of IFOR's power to      avoid U.N. restrictions on the use of force. Ultimately,      however, IFOR's role could be made untenable if it finds      itself in a confrontation with the U.N.'s designated      representative about the proper handling of a ``political''      matter. What would happen, for example, if the U.N. high      representative determined that U.S. forces had gone too far      in defending themselves under President Clinton's policy of      effectively responding to attacks ``and then some''?                               either/or       Congress cannot redo the agreement reached by the parties.      But there is no need for lawmakers to accept President      Clinton's either/or approach--either support his plan to      implement the agreement, or pull out entirely. If the      agreement represents a genuine desire for peace among the      warring parties, then presumably the accord is not so fragile      as to depend on the oral commitment of U.S. troops made by      the administration (and which isn't even part of the      agreement). Congress can and should consider other options.      The U.S., for example, could assist European forces in      demarcating the boundary lines, and could enforce peace in      the area through the threat of air strikes on important      targets. Or the U.S. could offer greater monetary and      diplomatic support for the agreement but not any ground      troops.       Whatever happens with the troop commitment, Congress should      insist that the agreement's provisions allowing the training      and arming of the Bosnian Muslims be rigorously adhered to. A      balance of power among the hostile parties is ultimately the      only basis for long-term stability in the region. And if      American troops are sent to Bosnia, they will be unable to      leave responsibly until such a balance has been developed.      That would certainly take longer than the yearlong limit      imposed by the administration.
