 President, I am pleased to introduce companion legislation to H.R. 3638, a bill introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson in November 2003. This bill will adjust the boundary of Redwood National Park in the State of California to include the addition of the Mill Creek property.  In 2002, the California Department of Parks and Recreation acquired from the Save-the-Redwoods League 25,500 acres of forest land known as the Mill Creek property in Del Norte County, which is contiguous with the Redwood National and State parks boundary. This bill would include within the park boundary the Mill Creek acquisition and about 900 acres of land acquired and added to the State redwood parks since the 1978 expansion of the Redwood National Park boundary. There would be no Federal costs for land acquisition or development resulting from this legislation.  These lands will be managed by the same cooperative management agreement between the National Park Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation. This partnership is viewed as a model of interagency cooperative management efforts and will provide for more efficient and cost-effective management of an ecologically significant resource.  This bill enjoys strong support from local and Federal officials, including Del Norte County and the Department of the Interior. Given this support and lack of controversy, I believe introducing companion legislation to be of great importance to ensure that our Redwood National Park is further protected.  I have long held a deep interest in protecting California's magnificent Redwoods. The Headwaters Agreement that was negotiated in part in my offices in 1996 protected approximately 7,500 acres of old growth redwoods, which was the largest grove of redwoods held in private ownership at the time.  I applaud Congressman Mike Thompson's commitment to this issue and hope that this bill receives strong bipartisan support.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
