Chairman, I think we ought to clarify this debate. We are not talking about the government controlling prices of pharmaceuticals and drugs. We are only talking about specific categories of drugs developed under research at taxpayers' expense. An example is Levamisole which was a drug, a veterinary drug, 6 cents a dose, they discovered they could use it to treat colon cancer. The company that took that government research and sold it then started selling that 6-cent drug for $6. So consumers across America got no benefit from the government research.  The same thing is true with Taxol. Government research developed this drug that cost $500, then it was sold to consumers by a private company for $10,000. At a time when health care costs are going through the roof, when we worry about the vitality of programs like Medicare, we have got to do what we can to help consumers across America.  The gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] is merely promoting a policy which was accepted by this government under Republican administrations for years and years. I urge the Members to think twice about opposing this amendment which will help keep health care costs under control.
