 President, I rise to introduce the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009.  This is a bill that is very important to me and to many other Members of Congress. It would authorize the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian to record and preserve an oral history of the Civil Rights Movement.  The bill is cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Bennett, Cochran, Kennedy, and Schumer. In the 110th Congress, then-Senator Clinton introduced it, and I want to thank Secretary Clinton very much for her work on behalf of the bill.  Last month, the United States celebrated the inauguration of our first African-American President. It was a historic event, and it was one more example that we, the American people, can live up to our highest ideals and aspirations. Although there is much left to be done, critical progress has been made.  As we reflect on this historical moment, it is important for us to remember that it did not happen all at once. As Senator Robert Kennedy once said, ``It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped.''  Our society today would not be possible without the extraordinary people who dedicated themselves to the Civil Rights Movement.  Whether on a bus in Montgomery, at a lunch counter in Greensboro, in a high school in Little Rock, or on a bridge in Selma, these courageous individuals risked their lives to bring real and necessary change to our country.  The bill I am introducing today would help to ensure that we never forget their stories.  The bill would direct the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History to record--in audio and video--firsthand stories from the Civil Rights Movement. Like the Veterans History Project started by the Library of Congress in 2000, these recordings would document the memories of Civil Rights pioneers for generations to come. Students would be able to hear the stories in their own voices, and historians would have primary sources on which to draw for research.  We need to start recording this history as soon as possible. In the last three years alone, we have lost Civil Rights leaders like Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King--whose contributions would have been invaluable.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of the project be a maximum of approximately $4 million over 5 years, and that much of this cost will be offset by private donations. Even at its maximum cost, the project will be well worth it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There beinig no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 395       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights History Project      Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:       (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that      individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and      fight for justice.       (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil      Rights movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a      shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in      events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins,      the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for      voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.       (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible      leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King,      Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and      experience were just as important to the cause but who are      not as well known.       (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess      an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the      movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories      and memories will provide a rich, detailed history of our      Nation during an important and tumultuous period.       (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project      to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil      Rights movement so future generations will be able to learn      of their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source,      eyewitness material. A coordinated Federal project would also      focus attention on the efforts undertaken by various public      and private entities to collect and interpret articles in all      formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a      model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries,      and universities throughout the Nation.       (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution      are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make      available to the public a collection of these oral histories.      The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management      of documentation projects, and experience in the development      of cultural and educational programs for the public.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new      federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will      coordinate at a national level the collection of video and      audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of      individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights      movement that will build upon and complement previous and      ongoing documentary work on this subject, and to assist and      encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such      individuals so that Americans of all current and future      generations may hear from them directly and better appreciate      the sacrifices they made.     SEC. 3.
