 LCpl Jonathan B. Thornsberry was tragically killed during combat operations in Iraq back on October 25, 2006. He was 22 years old. He left behind a family and friends who love him and remember that today, March 11, is his birthday.  For his heroic service with the U.S. Marines, Lance Corporal Thornsberry received several medals, awards, and decorations, including the National Defense Service Medal and the Purple Heart.  The man called ``Jon-Jon'' by family and friends was following a family tradition when he elected to wear America's uniform. His brother, father, and grandfather all served in the military.  ``It was just something he wanted to do,'' Jonathan's brother Jeff recalls of why Jonathan signed up. ``It was a decision he made.'' Jonathan's parents, Jackie and Judy, remember their son saying, ``We have to go over there. If we don't go over there, they will be here.''  Jonathan grew up in Floyd County where he attended McDowell Elementary School and South Floyd High School. He played catcher on his high school baseball team. Everybody remembers how good he was, and South Floyd High has retired his old No. 13 in his memory.  The name of the McDowell Elementary School's sports team is the Daredevils. Jonathan certainly fit that description growing up, as he liked to play in the mountains, go four-wheeling, and go hunting. This is not to say he did not have any sense of responsibility.  Once when he was just 4 or 5 years old, Jonathan and his father were hunting when they climbed too high on a mountain. ``We need to go down. Mommy will be worried about us,'' Jonathan said.  Jonathan was very close to his father, and the two of them worked together in the coal mines before Jonathan joined the Marines. Jonathan was also a father himself. He and his wife Toni Renee have a daughter, Haylee Jo. Haylee Jo recently turned 5 years old, and she likes to tell people she has her daddy's green eyes.  Jonathan was also close to his aunt, Edia Hamilton, better known in the family as Aunt Edia Girl. She would always buy candy for her favorite nephew even though she was on a fixed income.  Jonathan graduated from South Floyd High School in 2002, and after working alongside his father in the coal mines enlisted in the Marines in January 2004. He was assigned to the Marine Forces Reserve's 3rd Battalion, 24th Regiment, 4th Marine Division, based out of Johnson City, TN.  After training in California, Jonathan was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006. His family recalls he left California on September 26, and just 1 month later his life was tragically lost.  A few days before his death, Jonathan called his mother Judy to wish her a happy birthday, but she was at the grocery store and missed his call. Jonathan did get to talk to his wife Toni. Toni and Judy talked later, and Judy remembers they shared an uneasy feeling.  ``I could feel God all around me that morning and I should have known something,'' Judy says. ``I [could] feel God protecting me from the harshness of this.'' Later that day they received the horrible news.  Funeral services were held at the Little Rosa Church in McDowell, where Jonathan's two favorite songs, ``The Old Ship of Zion'' and ``Amazing Grace,'' were played. Tributes to him were held in Frankfort and back at South Floyd High School.  Today, on Jonathan's birthday, Madam President, our thoughts are with the many loved ones he has left behind. We are thinking of his wife Toni Renee; his daughter Haylee Jo; his parents Jackie and Judy; his brother and sister-in-law, Jeff and Angela; his grandmother, Alice Moore Lawson; his nephews, Thomas and Jack; his nieces, Evelyn Grace and Julia Ann; his aunt, Edia Hamilton; and many more family members and friends.  One year after Jonathan's death, his family, friends, and fellow marines gathered to remember him at a service in Pikeville City Park. Friends recalled him as the ``type of guy who would give you the shirt off his back.'' Another remembered the last time he saw Jonathan and what they talked about.  His wife Toni talked about how much she had lost. ``We loved each other from the moment we laid eyes on each other,'' she said. Then she read a poem that got across how her husband was a man who did not ask for much.  ``If you have a place for me, Lord, it needn't be so grand,'' she read.  A place of honor will be kept in the Senate for LCpl Jonathan B. Thornsberry, who sacrificed everything for his country. Today, on his birthday, I know my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to his service.  Madam President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
