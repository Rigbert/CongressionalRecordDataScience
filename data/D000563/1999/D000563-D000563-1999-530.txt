His point is well taken.  Before we end this debate, let's stop talking about health for a minute and let's talk about politics.  If this is such an important issue, and the debate on this issue is really one where we could have some debates, why are we not considering it on the floor of the Senate?  We spent 5 days debating protection for computer companies against lawsuits--5 days to protect these computer companies. It is an important debate. Can't we spend 5 hours talking about protecting American families when it comes to their health insurance? We are afraid of amendments, the Republicans say. We want to make sure that we have a limited number of amendments--no more than 20 on the side. In fact, that may be too many.  As Senator Kennedy said, on the next bill we will consider there are over 50 amendments. We haven't disqualified that bill from consideration. We understand that it is important that we do our business and debate these things and vote on them.  The bottom line here is that there are Members on the other side of the aisle who do not want to face votes on these issues. They don't want to have to go home and explain why they stood with the insurance companies and voted against the people they are supposed to represent--the families, the consumers, those who are literally worried on a day-to-day basis as to whether they have health insurance protection.  I think, frankly, they have to face their responsibility on this side of the aisle as we do on our side of the aisle, a responsibility to face a tougher vote, make a choice, go home, and defend your vote. That is the nature of this government.  For them to try to construct some sort of a strategy on the floor to protect themselves from criticism is at the expense of the families across America who do not have adequate health insurance and expect Congress to do something to protect them.
