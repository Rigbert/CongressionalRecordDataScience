Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  I think it needs to be reiterated that human rights groups have reported several instances of people being hurt upon their return, jailing, interrogation about anticommunist political activities in the camps, discrimination in employment and housing, and in Loas the disappearance and the probable killing of Hmong leader Vue Mai.  The American Legion again, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], brought the American Legion, relying on their own contacts with former Vietnamese comrades in arms who corroborate these accounts. One reason that the United Nations cannot find any persecution is that they have only eight monitors for all of Vietnam and only two for Laos.  I wanted to remind the membership we are talking about people that are going out with a support staff that has been hired through the Vietnamese and the Laotion Government. This is a situation where the person that is with the repatriation monitor is reporting to a government, and the government is hostile in many instances to these individuals. Who can blame them for not speaking openly after being forcibly repatriated in the first place? I do think there is underreporting as well.
