President, my colleague, Senator Cruz, is ill and unable to speak on this nomination. He has, however, expressed his concerns to me in the form of a letter. I appreciate his contributions to this debate throughout the committee process.  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                                February 14, 2013.     Senator James Inhofe,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I continue to have considerable      concerns with the unnecessary rush to force through a vote on      Chuck Hagel's nomination before he has adequately responded      to multiple requests from members of the Armed Services      Committee for additional information.       Our requests directly relate to matters he would have      significant influence over as our nation's Secretary of      Defense and are based on his alarming record on foreign      policy matters. For instance, Sen. Hagel has repeatedly      declined to support measures to crack down on state sponsors      of terrorism, belittled the notion of using any means to      prevent a nuclear Iran, advised U.S. leaders to engage in      direct negotiations with rogue nations and hostile terrorist      groups, and expressed remarkable antagonism towards the      longstanding U.S. alliance with Israel. Moreover, these are      all positions he's disavowed since his nomination.       These deeply concerning positions rightfully raise the      question of what conflicts of interest could exist as a      result of financial compensation he has received in the      recent past. Under the Senate's responsibility to advise and      consent on nominations, it is completely appropriate to make      these requests for disclosure--requests that are absolutely      relevant to the role of our nation's Secretary of Defense.      Several senators, who currently oppose such requests for      information, contradict their own past statements that affirm      the importance of disclosures related to executive branch      nominations.       In a February 6 letter, 25 senators, including every      Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and both      the Minority Leader and the Whip, agreed that neither the      Committee nor the full Senate has sufficient information to      assess Sen. Hagel's nomination.       In order to have sufficient information, we have submitted      several requests. This includes requests for disclosure on      the personal compensation that he has received in the last      five years--information which is entirely within his own      control; requests for additional disclosure on foreign funds      that he may have received indirectly, and whether any such      foreign funds raise conflicts of interest; requests for a      complete list of his prior public speeches, notably multiple      speeches on controversial topics have been made public by the      press, despite those speeches having been omitted from his      own disclosures; and a critical request from the      Administration regarding additional information about the      precise actions taken on September 11, 2012, during and      immediately following the tragic murder of four Americans in      Benghazi.       I believe that to date, responses to these requests are      insufficient. Very few positions have as great an impact on      national security as does the Secretary of Defense and it is      our responsibility to ensure that those nominated to serve in      this critical position are held to the highest standards.       I am prepared to move forward on Senator Hagel's nomination      in a timely manner, but I do not believe the Senate should      vote on that nomination unless and until he provides adequate      disclosure in response to these requests.           Sincerely,                                                         Ted Cruz.
