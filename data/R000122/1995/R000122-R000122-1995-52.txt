Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce legislation today, along with my colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Kennedy, to designate the main U.S. Post Office in Providence, RI, as the ``Harry Kizirian Post Office.''  Harry Kizirian is a truly remarkable individual. The most decorated living veteran in Rhode Island, Harry displayed qualities of leadership and courage at a very young age. At the age of 15, Harry had to go to work to support his widowed mother, but he continued to maintain his excellent academic record at Mt. Pleasant High School in Providence. Upon graduation, Harry enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to Okinawa.  On Okinawa, Harry fought with tenacity and courage, while engaged continuously in fierce combat. Harry was severely wounded while leading an infantry assault. For his extraordinary heroism, Harry was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star with V Device for Valor, the Purple Heart with a Gold Star, and the Rhode Island Cross.  Upon Harry's return, he immediately went to work at the main post office in Providence where he had worked during high school. At work, Harry displayed the same commitment and teamwork he showed on the frontlines at Okinawa, and was eventually appointed as the Postmaster. He was confirmed by the United States Senate in 1961, and held the position of Postmaster for 25 years.  Throughout his career with the Postal Service, Harry also devoted much of his time to the community, serving on numerous boards and committees. Harry served on the board of directors for Butler Hospital, Big Brothers of RI, RI Blue Cross, the RI Heart and Lung Associations, and numerous others.  One of Harry's greatest accomplishments was raising a wonderful family. He and his wife, Hazel, raised five children and have three grandchildren.  Harry has served his country in every capacity: in the military, as a civil servant, as a devoted husband and father, and as a loyal American. Harry Kizirian is a source of inspiration for the young and old, and he is a particularly cherished member of Rhode Island's proud and vibrant Armenian community.  This bill would commemorate his generosity and valor for future generations, and it would pay tribute to a remarkable gentleman who has given so much to his nation, his community, and his family. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Harry Kizirian by supporting this bill.                          ____________________
