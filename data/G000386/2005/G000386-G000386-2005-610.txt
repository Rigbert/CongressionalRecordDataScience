 President, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations and gratitude to an extraordinary Iowan. LTG Roger C. Schultz is stepping down from his distinguished position as Director of the Army National Guard for the National Guard Bureau. He assumed this position in 1998 and has served for 7 years, the longest anyone has held this title. I would like to take this opportunity to show Lieutenant General Schultz the appreciation that the country, the State of Iowa, and myself personally, have for his extensive commitment to the Army National Guard. He joined the Iowa Army National Guard in 1963, and from there he began a career that lasted 42 years.  Lieutenant General Schultz has had an extensive career. In his most recent position as director, he was responsible for the formulation, development, and implementation of all programs and policies affecting the Army National Guard. Previously, he served as Deputy Director for Military Support on the Department of the Army Staff, where he was responsible for coordinating all Department of Defense military support to civilian authorities, which included disaster relief. While stationed with the Iowa Army National Guard, he was in Command of the 2nd Brigade, 34th Division and served as the Army Guard Chief of Staff and Deputy Adjutant General. General Schultz also received several awards and recognitions for his exemplary service. He is honored with the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, Meritorious Service Medal with Two Oak Leaf Clusters, Department of the Army Staff Badge, Army Superior Unit Award, Humanitarian Service Award, the Combat Infantry Badge for service in the Republic of Vietnam, and many others.  General Schultz was born in LeMars, IA and enlisted when he was 18 years old. He was a student at officer candidate school at the Iowa Military Academy. Following these studies, he was commissioned in 1967 as an infantry officer. Shortly thereafter, he was sent to serve his country in the Republic of Vietnam with the 25th Infantry Division. During his several assignments, he also earned a bachelor's degree in management from Upper Iowa University and a Masters degree in public administration from Shippensburg State University in Pennsylvania. He also attended Army War College.  I share my appreciation for the general with not only his neighbors in the State of Iowa but the entire country. He has proven himself to be versatile and fully capable of accepting and mastering the tasks placed before him. His enduring commitment to the safety of Americans is cause for admiration.  Again, I offer my congratulations and sincere appreciation to LTG Roger Schultz for his remarkable achievements in the Army National Guard. He has continually provided an invaluable service to his country and I thank him for his dedication and devotion to Iowa and to America.                          ____________________
