 President, I rise to address an aspect of the budget resolution that we are debating today. I am going to focus on one of the Finance Committee's tasks that is included in the resolution. I am referring to growth package and reconciliation instruction to the Finance Committee. I would first like to put all of this into context. After that, I will describe an agreement with Senators Snowe and Voinovich.  When I was thinking about the budget, Former Senator Barry Goldwater's words came to mind. Among legislators, you will find purveyors of perfection and those who practice the art of compromise. Reflecting on Senator Goldwater's words, I came up with a new version of Senator Goldwater's famous statement. With a little bit of poetic license, here is the version that I think sums up where we are:       Let me remind you that extremism in tax policy at the      expense of no budget resolution is a vice. Moderation in tax      policy in pursuant of a budget resolution is a virtue. Fiscal      conservatism is a virtue. No budget equals no spending      ceilings and that equals a vice against taxpayers.  Our economy has not recovered as we had hoped. Too many factories are shut or running below capacity. Too many workers are looking for work and need jobs to provide for their families. Stock prices have remained well below the ``bubble'' prices of the late 1990's. Americans wonder when their 401(k) accounts will bounce back.  To me, there is a clearly demonstrated need for bold fiscal policy to give our economy a ``kick start.'' President Bush took the initiative and the responsibility.
