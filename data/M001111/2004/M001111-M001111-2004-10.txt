 President, today I pay tribute to the life of Valentin J. Riva--a friend and transportation industry leader that was taken from us at far too young an age. Earlier this month, I was shocked and saddened to learn that Val Riva had passed away suddenly as a result of complications from heart surgery. Val was only 50 years old. I and many of my colleagues who work closely on transportation policy will remember Val as a truly visionary leader and trusted colleague. Moreover, Val was an extraordinarily dedicated father and husband.  Over the last two decades, Val has held leadership positions in several transportation organizations. Throughout, Val has been an articulate advocate for investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Val served as vice president of government affairs for the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association from 1988 until 1991 and as vice president and general counsel of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association from 1991 until 1997.  From August of 1997 until the time of his unfortunate death, Val Riva served as president and chief executive officer of the American Concrete Pavement Association. And in his most recent position, Val not only continued to be a powerful voice in the fight for infrastructure investment, but he also was a strong proponent of making sure that adequate resources were being dedicated to advancing pavement technology and transportation research. We have often heard Members speak on this floor about the deteriorating condition of our Nation's roads and bridges. Val Riva recognized that we not only need to replace and rehabilitate those crumbling roads and bridges but we also need to conduct the necessary research to create new technologies that will help prolong the lifespan of our infrastructure.  Val Riva was also respected by his peers in the transportation industry. Best of all, Val had the rare gift of being both thoughtful and funny. He was considered a trusted colleague and, more importantly, a loyal friend to those individuals that had the good fortune to work with him. I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to be one of those individuals.  And while Val was very dedicated to his work in the transportation industry, there was no job more important or rewarding to him than being a father to Clare, Michael and David. No one ever had a meeting with Val without hearing about his children and hearing a historical reference. I express my heartfelt condolences to his three children and to his wife, Marti. Val's passing is much more than just their loss. It is a loss to the entire national transportation enterprise and the great many of us that recognized his leadership in it. While we will miss Val's personable nature, his humor and his strength, I and many of my Senate colleagues know that his contributions will live on for a very long time to come.                          ____________________
