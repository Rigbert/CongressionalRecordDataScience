 Since 1910, Louis Gelder & Sons has proudly supplied the folks of southwest Michigan with tractors and other agriculture equipment and supplies. Today, operated by Bruce and Joe Gelder, the company is a fourth-generation family-run business.  The story of Louis Gelder & Sons begins in Millburg, Michigan, only a few miles away from their current location. Like many small businesses, their long history speaks to the power of the American entrepreneurial spirit, having endured two of the deepest economic recessions in modern history. Our Nation has faced many challenges and changes over the past century, but Louis Gelder & Sons has stood the test of time.  Behind great companies with this kind of endurance you will always find great people. The folks at Louis Gelder & Sons work as a team, which makes all the difference between a good company and a great one.  The long success of Louis Gelder & Sons is a remarkable achievement, and we are all very proud to see them continuing to provide service to the people of Michigan. Congratulations to the Gelder family and their employees. Here's to the next 100!                          ____________________
