Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge an individual with a longstanding commitment to native American heritage in the State of Rhode Island. Joseph McKinley Hazard of the Silver Cloud Senior Citizens, Inc., of the Narragansett Indian Tribe exemplifies strength and dedication to tribal and cultural tradition.  Born in 1901 to Charles Frederick and Hannah Mariah Hazard, Joseph is the oldest known active member of the Narragansett Indians who meet at the Narragansett Indian longhouse in Charlestown, RI. In 1920, he married Nancy Ellen Hubbard in Norwich, CT, and then settled back in Charlestown, raising four children: Joseph, Jr., Raymond Atwood, Nancy, and Dorrance. After his wife, Nancy Ellen, passed away in 1965, Joseph remarried, to Ruth Brown Michaels in 1970. Joseph is now the only surviving member of his family.  Throughout his long and fruitful life, Joseph has been a member of the Narragansett Tribal Council. He also sits on the board of the Narragansett Indian Church and was a dedicated Boy Scout leader.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Joseph M. Hazard for his constant and dutiful commitment to the preservation of the Narragansett Indian Tribe's way of life. It is my sincere belief that outstanding individual embodies the spirit of history and tradition of native Americans in the Ocean State and throughout our Nation.                          ____________________
