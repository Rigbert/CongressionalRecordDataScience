Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about foreign ownership of critical United States infrastructure assets. A number of people have followed the controversy regarding the UAE control over a number of critical American ports.  Now, there is certainly some room for concern there, as many of us have spoken previously. The UAE was very closely tied to the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. They were one of three governments in the world that recognized the Taliban.  They have recently been useful and helpful to the United States of America, but the history is not great, and people may have been embedded years ago in their government who would control it, it is not a private entity, who would be not friendly towards the interests of the United States. So there is concern there.  And the concern is even compounded by the fact that we do not know who owns the ships. The U.S. has bound itself through international agreements that allow secret ownership of ships under flags of convenience, countries that barely exist or do not exist, Liberia, Malta, who is very happy to make money on this, but turns a blind eye. Osama bin Laden could own a fleet of ships. We are not allowed to know. But they can dock here in United States.  We have done nothing about that. We do not know who crews the ships. They can buy papers in the Philippines and in International Maritime Organization School that the U.S. has been forced to recognize by being part of this agreement. And, again, we do not know who these people are.  So we do not know who crews the ships, we do not know who owns the ships, we do not know what is on the ships. They have to send us a manifest and tell us what might be on the ship. It is an electronic transmission or a piece of paper. That does not mean that is what is really on the ship.  We do not track the ships from port to port, so they could have stopped somewhere. Even if they do not have a nuclear bomb on board when they left Singapore, they could have picked one up on the way. And then we do not have the equipment that we need on this side of the ocean.  So that is a tremendous concern. If you add on the concern of the ownership of Dubai, it reaches even higher proportions.  But I also rise to talk about something else the Bush administration is trying to do. For them commerce is everything. National security is second or tertiary in terms of their concerns. They are trying to reinterpret the meaning of the word ``control.''  They said, when Congress said foreigners cannot control United States airlines, Congress did not mean control. In fact, in their world they are saying, well, foreigners could control U.S. airlines, they could only just control them commercially, but they could not safety and security.  If you have foreign management, foreign ownership, how do you wall off safety and security? So they are proposing, by administrative rule, sometime later this month or early next month, to defy the dictionary and legal interpretations of control and say Congress did not mean what it said.                              {time}  1930  Now, if you think there is an outcry about the ports, wait until we are sending U.S. troops overseas on what is called part of the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. The large planes that our airlines fly are actually part of our Reserves, and we fly our troops with these planes over to the Mideast and other trouble spots around the world. Wait until we are asking U.S. troops to get onboard a plane being flown by a pilot from Dubai or from Indonesia or somewhere else around the world. This would be an extraordinary national security problem, in addition to losing domestic air service. Because what is happening here is airlines like United, who have been managed into the ground by overpaid CEOs, and others are looking to sell themselves out to foreign airlines. Their first choice is Lufthansa, but they may well go with the UAE, and then to cut off most of their domestic service, shed the wide-body planes and bring in foreign pilots to do the overseas routes and provide minimal domestic service.  So not only are we putting at threat our national security and the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet, we are also putting at risk the American public and we are certainly degrading the capability of providing the service we need to have a system of universal air transport which serves our economy and the businesses in the United States of America.  This is a colossally bad idea with the Bush administration trying to do it in back rooms by pretending that when Congress said foreigners cannot control our airlines that we did not really mean it.  If the Bush administration persists in this, 6 months or a year from today, we will be here on the floor of the House if this Congress does not preempt this, which they have thus far refused to do. If they do not preempt this, we will be back here arguing about the UAE or Indonesia or some other country taking over a major U.S. airline and the assets of our Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. We should preclude that.  Next week when we bring up prohibition of ownership of critical infrastructure assets, airlines should be part of that bill. There is big resistance from the administration and some of the leadership. The membership has to overcome that and do what is right for the American people and national and economic security.                          ____________________
