  This amendment is simple and straightforward. At a time when home heating prices are going through the roof--and I think every Member who goes back to his or her State understands that the cost of home heating oil is soaring--people understand that in areas around this country, including the State of Vermont, the weather has been well below zero. What this amendment would do is provide real relief to millions of senior citizens on fixed incomes, low-income families with children, and people with disabilities.  Specifically, this amendment would provide $800 million in emergency funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--otherwise known as LIHEAP--a program that has won bipartisan support year after year here in Congress because people know it works.  Its goal is simply stated: to keep Americans from going cold in the wintertime. It has done this for years, and we have to appropriate more money to make sure we do that again this year. Specifically, $400 million of the $800 million would be distributed under the regular LIHEAP formula, while the other $400 million would be used under the emergency LIHEAP program.  This amendment has strong support not only from many Members of the Senate and Members of the House, but it has strong support from the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislators, the AARP, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, and many other groups.  Let me very briefly quote from a letter I received from the National Governors Association in support of this amendment.       Additional funding distributed equitably under this      amendment will support critically needed heating and cooling      assistance to millions of our most vulnerable, including the      elderly, disabled and families who often have to choose      between paying their heating or cooling bills and food,      medicine and other essential needs.  According to the National Governors Association, this amendment will provide much needed energy assistance to at least 1 million American families--1 million. Others already receiving LIHEAP will receive more help due to the skyrocketing costs of home heating fuel.  Let me very briefly quote from a letter I recently received from the AARP. This is what the AARP says:       People should not have to choose between heating and      eating. Older Americans who are more susceptible to      hypothermia and heat stroke know the importance of heating      and cooling their homes. They pay their utility bills and      skimp on other necessities to get by. However, no one in      America should be forced to skip their medications or cut      back on essential nutritional needs in order to keep their      heat on.  That is from the AARP.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         AARP,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2008.     Hon. Bernard Sanders     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: AARP applauds you for your continued      efforts to increase funding for the Low Income Energy      Assistance (LIHEAP) program. We thank you for offering an      amendment to increase LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 by $800      million on S. 1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act      Amendments of 2007. We are pleased to support your amendment.       People should not have to choose between heating and      eating. Older Americans, who are more susceptible to      hypothermia and heat stroke, know the importance of heating      and cooling their homes; they pay their utility bills and      skimp on other necessities to get by. However, no one in      America should be forced to skip their medications or cut      back on essential nutritional needs in order to keep their      heat on.       LIHEAP helps the poorest of the poor. Nearly three out of      four families receiving LIHEAP assistance have incomes of      less than 100% of the federal poverty level ($16,600 for a      family of three) and almost one in two have incomes less than      75% of the federal poverty level ($12,225 for a family of      three).       LIHEAP is serving more households than ever before, but      still cannot meet the need. Since 2002, an additional 1.5      million households are receiving LIHEAP assistance. At the      same time, requests for LIHEAP assistance in 2006 soared to      the highest level in 12 years.       Additional funding is needed now. High energy prices have      not gone away and the weather has proven very unpredictable--     additional funding is needed now and in the future to protect      some of the most vulnerable populations in America. Should      you have any questions regarding this request, please contact      me or Timothy Gearan of our Federal Affairs staff.           Sincerely,                                             David P. Sloane,                                          Senior Managing Director,     Government Relations and Advocacy.                                  ____                               National Governors Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2008.     Hon. Bernie Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of the nation's governors,      we write to express our support for the Sanders-Snowe      amendment to add $800 million in emergency funding to the      Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for FY      2008. We commend you and your colleagues for working in      partnership to build bipartisan support for this proposal,      and we believe the compromise of splitting this funding      equitably between the LIHEAP base formula grant under the      ``Tier II'' formula and the contingency fund is a step in the      right direction.       Additional funding distributed equitably under this      amendment will support critically needed heating and cooling      assistance to millions of our most vulnerable, including the      elderly, disabled, and families that often have to choose      between paying their heating or cooling bills and food,      medicine and other essential needs. With greater financial      support, states will be better able to increase benefit      levels in correspondence with rising energy costs, and to      reach at least a million other federally-eligible households      who currently do not receive assistance due to funding      limitations.       The National Governors Association applauds the bipartisan      efforts of you and your colleagues in reaching this      compromise, and fully supports adding $800 million to FY 2008      to help LIHEAP respond to the current emergency energy      situation.           Sincerely,     James H. Douglas,       Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.     Jon S. Corzine,       Vice Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.                                  ____                                            National Conference of                                           State Legislatures,                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2008.       Dear Senator, I am writing on behalf of the National      Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to strongly urge you      to support the amendment offered by Senator Sanders and      Senator Snowe that would add an additional $800 million to      the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)      funding for FY 2008. The amendment would divide the      additional funding equally between the formula and emergency      contingency portions of the program.       LIHEAP is a highly efficient federal block grant program      that helps our most vulnerable low-income households pay      their heating bills in the winter and cooling bills in the      summer. LIHEAP prioritizes at-risk households that shelter      America's elderly, disabled, and very young and protects      public health and safety by helping low-income families cover      energy costs. By leveraging private dollars to supplement      federal dollars, LIHEAP has nurtured positive, effective      partnerships between the private sector and both federal and      our state governments.       Millions of low-income families are burdened with the      hardship of paying arrearage from both last winter's heating      bills and summer's cooling bills, in addition to grappling      with impending and actual shut-off situations. At a time of      heightened need and with energy prices expected to continue      to climb, state legislatures do not want our citizens      choosing between paying an energy bill and putting food on      the table, or purchasing necessary medications. For      individuals and households facing these difficult choices,      funding from LIHEAP makes an intrinsic difference in their      ability to address such formidable challenges.       Since LIHEAP's inception, the number of eligible households      has increased by 78 per cent, yet in FY 2006, states were      only able to serve less than a quarter of the 24.4 million      eligible households. An increase in funding for LIHEAP will      help ensure that households in all regions are prepared to      handle both the cold and warm, and in the past few years      unpredictable, weather. NCSL believes that increased LIHEAP      funding should be a top priority to help low-income families,      senior citizens, and disabled individuals maintain economic      stability while addressing ever-increasing energy prices.       We urge you to support the Sanders-Snowe LIHEAP amendment,      and to continue the fight for full funding of LIHEAP.           Sincerely,                                                 Pete Hershberger,           Arizona Representative, Chair, NCSL Committee on Human      Services & Welfare.                                  ____                              Southern Governors' Association,                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2007.   Statement on Additional FY 2008 Low Income Home Energy Assistance                         Program (LIHEAP) Funding       Due to high and rising energy costs, efforts are underway      in Congress to allocate an additional $800 million to the      LIHEAP program for FY 2008. Senator Dole has worked with her      colleagues from cold weather states on a compromise agreement      that would equitably distribute these additional funds by      splitting them equally between the LIHEAP base formula grant      and the contingency fund. The additional $400 million in the      base formula grant would be distributed by the LIHEAP ``tier      II'' formula, which bases funding to states on the actual      energy needs of low-income households, and therefore provides      for equitable distribution to Southern slates.       Recognizing the increasing need for LIHEAP funds and the      interest of the Congress in providing these funds, the      Southern Governors' Association supports this compromise. SGA      supported a similar compromise in FY 2006 when Congress made      an additional $1 billion available for LIHEAP, split equally      between the base formula grant and the contingency fund.       This compromise is an important step towards the long-term      goal of a more equitable distribution of LIHEAP funding among      all states. SGA urges Congress to move immediately to address      equity as a priority as part of LIHEAP reauthorization.
