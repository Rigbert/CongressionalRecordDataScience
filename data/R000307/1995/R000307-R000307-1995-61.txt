And after the Committee on Agriculture finishes its consideration of the sugar program, if he is not satisfied with the committee's actions, I can assure the gentleman and his colleagues that they will have an opportunity to amend the sugar program during the farm bill debate.  Many are called; few are chosen. The gentleman from Florida will be one of the chosen.
