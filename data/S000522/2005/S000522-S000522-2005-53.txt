Mr. Speaker, to conclude, before yielding back, I do want to thank Chairman Davis from the Government Reform Committee for his cooperation because there were some issues of jurisdiction, and he acted in a very cooperative and collegial way to help make this legislation possible.  I would also like to thank Kristen Gilley for her fine work in working on this legislation, and to my good friend and colleague Mr. Lantos as well.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
