SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Military Commissions Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to      Congress the power ``To define and punish . . . Offenses      against the Law of Nations'', as well as the power ``To      declare War . . . To raise and support Armies . . . [and] To      provide and maintain a Navy''.       (2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for      the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of      the law of war.       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of      military commission by statute and recognized the existence      and authority of military commissions.       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the      President and by military commanders in the field to try      offenses against the law of war.       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise      its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation      authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to      try and punish violations of the law of war.     SEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS.

(b) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) may not      be construed to alter or limit the authority of the President      under the Constitution and laws of the United States to      establish military commissions for areas declared to be under      martial law or in occupied territories should circumstances      so require.       (c) Scope of Punishment Authority.--A military commission      established pursuant to subsection (a) shall have authority      to impose upon any person found guilty under a proceeding      under chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as so      enacted), a sentence that is appropriate for the offense or      offenses for which there is a finding of guilt, including a      sentence of death if authorized under such chapter,      imprisonment for life or a term of years, payment of a fine      or restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition      of punishment as the military commission shall direct.       (d) Execution of Punishment.--The Secretary of Defense is      authorized to carry out a sentence of punishment imposed by a      military commission established pursuant to subsection (a) in      accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may      prescribe.       (e) Annual Report on Trials by Military Commissions.--       (1) Annual report required.--Not later than December 31      each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the      Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of      Representatives a report on any trials conducted by military      commissions established pursuant to subsection (a) during      such year.

Definitions       ``In this chapter:       ``(1) Alien.--The term `alien' means an individual who is      not a citizen of the United States.       ``(2) Classified information.--The term `classified      information' means the following:       ``(A) Any information or material that has been determined      by the United States Government pursuant to statute,      Executive order, or regulation to require protection against      unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security.       ``(B) Any restricted data, as that term is defined in      section 11 y. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.      2014(y)).       ``(3) Lawful enemy combatant.--The term `lawful enemy      combatant' means an individual who is--       ``(A) a member of the regular forces of a State party      engaged in hostilities against the United States;       ``(B) a member of a militia, volunteer corps, or organized      resistance movement belonging to a State party engaged in      such hostilities, which are under responsible command, wear a      fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry      their arms openly, and abide by the law of war; or       ``(C) a member of a regular armed force who professes      allegiance to a government engaged in such hostilities, but      not recognized by the United States.       ``(4) Unlawful enemy combatant.--The term `unlawful enemy      combatant' means an individual engaged in hostilities against      the United States who is not a lawful enemy combatant.     ``Sec. 948b. Military commissions generally       ``(a) Purpose.--This chapter establishes procedures      governing the use of military commissions to try alien      unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the      United States for violations of the law of war and other      offenses triable by military commission.       ``(b) Construction of Provisions.--The procedures for      military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon      the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under      chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military      Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms,      apply to trial by military commission except as specifically      provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the      provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms      inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial      construction and application of chapter 47 of this title is      therefore not binding on military commissions established      under this chapter.       ``(c) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--(1) The      following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial      by military commission under this chapter:       ``(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any      rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.       ``(B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b),      and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to      compulsory self-incrimination.       ``(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.       ``(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall      apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only      to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by      this chapter.       ``(d) Status of Military Commissions Under Common Article      3.--A military commission established under this chapter is a      regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary      `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by      civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the      Geneva Conventions.       ``(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents.--The findings,      holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military      commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or      considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a      court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title. The      findings, holdings, interpretations, and other     precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not      form the basis of any holding, decision, or other      determination of a court-martial convened under that chapter.       ``(f) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Source of      Rights.--No alien enemy unlawful combatant subject to trial      by military commission under this chapter may invoke the      Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at his trial by      military commission.     ``Sec. 948c. Persons subject to military commissions       ``Any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities      or having supported hostilities against the United States is      subject to trial by military commission as set forth in this      chapter.     ``Sec. 948d. Jurisdiction of military commissions       ``(a) Jurisdiction.--A military commission under this      chapter shall have jurisdiction to try any offense made      punishable by this chapter, sections 904 and 906 of this      title (articles 104 and 106 of the Uniform Code of Military      Justice), or the law of war when committed by an alien      unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after September 11,      2001.       ``(b) Lawful Enemy Combatants.--Military commissions under      this chapter shall not have jurisdiction over lawful enemy      combatants. Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of      war are subject to chapter 47 of this title. Courts-martial      established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try      a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable      under this chapter.       ``(c) Punishments.--A miliary commission under this chapter      may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe,      adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter,      including the penalty of death when authorized under this      chapter, chapter 47 of this title, or the law of war.          ``SUBCHAPTER II--COMPOSITION OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS``Sec.``948h.

Definitions; construction of certain offenses;        common circumstances       ``(a) Definitions.--In this subchapter:       ``(1) The term `military objective' means combatants and      those objects during an armed conflict which, by their      nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to      the war-fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing      force and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or      neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage      to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of an      attack.       ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled      to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions,      including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities,      military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds,      or detention, and military medical or religious personnel.       ``(3) The term `protected property' means any property      specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings      dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable      purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the      sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent      such property is not being used for military purposes or is      not otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects      properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the      Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property      that is a military objective.       ``(b) Construction of Certain Offenses.--The intent      required for offenses under sections 950hh, 950ii, 950jj,      950kk, and 950ss of this title precludes their applicability      with regard to collateral damage or to death, damage, or      injury incident to a lawful attack.       ``(c) Common Circumstances.--An offense specified in this      subchapter is triable by military commission under this      chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of      and associated with armed conflict.     ``Sec. 950bb. Statement of substantive offenses       ``(a) Purpose.--The provisions of this subchapter codify      offenses that have traditionally been triable by military      commissions. This chapter does not establish new crimes that      did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those      crimes for trial by military commission.       ``(b) Effect.--Because the provisions of this subchapter      (including provisions that incorporate definitions in other      provisions of law) are declarative of existing law, they do      not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date      of the enactment of this chapter.     ``Sec. 950cc. Principals       ``Any person is punishable as a principle under this      chapter who--       ``(1) commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or      aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission;       ``(2) causes an act to be done which if directly performed      by him would be punishable by this chapter; or       ``(3) is a superior commander who, with regard to acts      punishable under this chapter, knew, had reason to know, or      should have known, that a subordinate was about to commit      such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the      necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to      punish the perpetrators thereof.     ``Sec. 950dd. Accessory after the fact       ``Any person subject to this chapter who, knowing that an      offense punishable by this chapter has been committed,      receives, comforts, or assists the offender in order to      hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial, or punishment      shall be punished as a military commission under this chapter      may direct.     ``Sec. 950ee.

TITLE II--TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept communications between people inside the United      States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects      overseas.       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either a      congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely      upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet &      Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to      Congress the power ``To define and punish . . . Offenses      against the Law of Nations'', as well as the power ``To      declare War . . . To raise and support Armies . . . [and] To      provide and maintain a Navy''.       (2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for      the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of      the law of war.       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of      military commission by statute and recognized the existence      and authority of military commissions.       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the      President and by military commanders in the field to try      offenses against the law of war.       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise      its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation      authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to      try and punish violations of the law of war.     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS.       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to establish      military commissions for the trial of alien unlawful enemy      combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States      for violations of the law of war and other offenses      specifically made triable     by military commission as provided in chapter 47 of title 10,      United States Code, and chapter 47A of title 10, United      States Code (as enacted by this Act).       (b) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) may not      be construed to alter or limit the authority of the President      under the Constitution and laws of the United States to      establish military commissions for areas declared to be under      martial law or in occupied territories should circumstances      so require.       (c) Scope of Punishment Authority.--A military commission      established pursuant to subsection (a) shall have authority      to impose upon any person found guilty under a proceeding      under chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as so      enacted), a sentence that is appropriate for the offense or      offenses for which there is a finding of guilt, including a      sentence of death if authorized under such chapter,      imprisonment for life or a term of years, payment of a fine      or restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition      of punishment as the military commission shall direct.       (d) Execution of Punishment.--The Secretary of Defense is      authorized to carry out a sentence of punishment imposed by a      military commission established pursuant to subsection (a) in      accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may      prescribe.       (e) Annual Report on Trials by Military Commissions.--       (1) Annual report required.--Not later than December 31      each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the      Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of      Representatives a report on any trials conducted by military      commissions established pursuant to subsection (a) during      such year.

Definitions       ``In this chapter:       ``(1) Alien.--The term `alien' means an individual who is      not a citizen of the United States.       ``(2) Classified information.--The term `classified      information' means the following:       ``(A) Any information or material that has been determined      by the United States Government pursuant to statute,      Executive order, or regulation to require protection against      unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security.       ``(B) Any restricted data, as that term is defined in      section 11 y. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.      2014(y)).       ``(3) Lawful enemy combatant.--The term `lawful enemy      combatant' means an individual who is--       ``(A) a member of the regular forces of a State party      engaged in hostilities against the United States;       ``(B) a member of a militia, volunteer corps, or organized      resistance movement belonging to a State party engaged in      such hostilities, which are under responsible command, wear a      fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry      their arms openly, and abide by the law of war; or       ``(C) a member of a regular armed force who professes      allegiance to a government engaged in such hostilities, but      not recognized by the United States.       ``(4) Unlawful enemy combatant.--The term `unlawful enemy      combatant' means an individual engaged in hostilities against      the United States who is not a lawful enemy combatant.     ``Sec. 948b. Military commissions generally       ``(a) Purpose.--This chapter establishes procedures      governing the use of military commissions to try alien      unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the      United States for violations of the law of war and other      offenses triable by military commission.       ``(b) Construction of Provisions.--The procedures for      military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon      the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under      chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military      Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms,      apply to trial by military commission except as specifically      provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the      provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms      inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial      construction and application of chapter 47 of this title is      therefore not binding on military commissions established      under this chapter.       ``(c) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--(1) The      following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial      by military commission under this chapter:       ``(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any      rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.       ``(B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b),      and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to      compulsory self-incrimination.       ``(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.       ``(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall      apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only      to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by      this chapter.       ``(d) Status of Military Commissions Under Common Article      3.--A military commission established under this chapter is a      regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary      `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by      civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the      Geneva Conventions.       ``(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents.--The findings,      holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military      commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or      considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a      court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title. The      findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of      military commissions under this chapter may not form the      basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a      court-martial convened under that chapter.       ``(f) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Source of      Rights.--No alien enemy unlawful combatant subject to trial      by military commission under this chapter may invoke the      Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at his trial by      military commission.     ``Sec. 948c. Persons subject to military commissions       ``Any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities      or having supported hostilities against the United States is      subject to trial by military commission as set forth in this      chapter.     ``Sec. 948d. Jurisdiction of military commissions       ``(a) Jurisdiction.--A military commission under this      chapter shall have jurisdiction to try any offense made      punishable by this chapter, sections 904 and 906 of this      title (articles 104 and 106 of the Uniform Code of Military      Justice), or the law of war when committed by an alien      unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after September 11,      2001.       ``(b) Lawful Enemy Combatants.--Military commissions under      this chapter shall not have jurisdiction over lawful enemy      combatants. Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of      war are subject to chapter 47 of this title. Courts-martial      established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try      a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable      under this chapter.       ``(c) Punishments.--A miliary commission under this chapter      may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe,      adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter,      including the penalty of death when authorized under this      chapter, chapter 47 of this title, or the law of war.          ``SUBCHAPTER II--COMPOSITION OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS``Sec.``948h.

Definitions; construction of certain offenses;        common circumstances       ``(a) Definitions.--In this subchapter:       ``(1) The term `military objective' means combatants and      those objects during an armed conflict which, by their      nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to      the war-fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing      force and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or      neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage      to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of an      attack.       ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled      to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions,      including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities,      military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds,      or detention, and military medical or religious personnel.       ``(3) The term `protected property' means any property      specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings      dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable      purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the      sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent      such property is not being used for military purposes or is      not otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects      properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the      Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property      that is a military objective.       ``(b) Construction of Certain Offenses.--The intent      required for offenses under sections 950hh, 950ii, 950jj,      950kk, and 950ss of this title precludes their applicability      with regard to collateral damage or to death, damage, or      injury incident to a lawful attack.       ``(c) Common Circumstances.--An offense specified in this      subchapter is triable by military commission under this      chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of      and associated with armed conflict.     ``Sec. 950bb. Statement of substantive offenses       ``(a) Purpose.--The provisions of this subchapter codify      offenses that have traditionally been triable by military      commissions. This chapter does not establish new crimes that      did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those      crimes for trial by military commission.       ``(b) Effect.--Because the provisions of this subchapter      (including provisions that incorporate definitions in other      provisions of law) are declarative of existing law, they do      not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date      of the enactment of this chapter.     ``Sec. 950cc. Principals       ``Any person is punishable as a principle under this      chapter who--       ``(1) commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or      aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission;       ``(2) causes an act to be done which if directly performed      by him would be punishable by this chapter; or       ``(3) is a superior commander who, with regard to acts      punishable under this chapter, knew, had reason to know, or      should have known, that a subordinate was about to commit      such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the      necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to      punish the perpetrators thereof.     ``Sec. 950dd.

Solicitation       ``Any person subject to this chapter who solicits or      advises another or others to commit one or more substantive      offenses triable by military commission under this chapter      shall, if the offense solicited or advised is attempted or      committed, be punished with the punishment provided for the      commission of the offense, but, if the offense solicited or      advised is not committed or attempted, he shall be punished      as a military commission under this chapter may direct.     ``Sec. 950hh.

A bill to establish procedures for the review of electronic surveillance programs; read the first time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3931       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept communications between people inside the United      States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects      overseas.       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either     a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only      rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet &      Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to      Congress the power ``To define and punish . . .

(2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for      the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of      the law of war.       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of      military commission by statute and recognized the existence      and authority of military commissions.       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the      President and by military commanders in the field to try      offenses against the law of war.       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise      its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation      authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to      try and punish violations of the law of war.     SEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS.       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to establish      military commissions for the trial of alien unlawful enemy      combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States      for violations of the law of war and other offenses      specifically made triable by military commission as provided      in chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code, and chapter      47A of title 10, United States Code (as enacted by this Act).       (b) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) may not      be construed to alter or limit the authority of the President      under the Constitution and laws of the United States to      establish military commissions for areas declared to be under      martial law or in occupied territories should circumstances      so require.       (c) Scope of Punishment Authority.--A military commission      established pursuant to subsection (a) shall have authority      to impose upon any person found guilty under a proceeding      under chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as so      enacted), a sentence that is appropriate for the offense or      offenses for which there is a finding of guilt, including a      sentence of death if authorized under such chapter,      imprisonment for life or a term of years, payment of a fine      or restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition      of punishment as the military commission shall direct.       (d) Execution of Punishment.--The Secretary of Defense is      authorized to carry out a sentence of punishment imposed by a      military commission established pursuant to subsection (a) in      accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may      prescribe.       (e) Annual Report on Trials by Military Commissions.--       (1) Annual report required.--Not later than December 31      each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the      Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of      Representatives a report on any trials conducted by military      commissions established pursuant to subsection (a) during      such year.

Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms,      apply to trial by military commission except as specifically      provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the      provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms      inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial      construction and application of chapter 47 of this title is      therefore not binding on military commissions established      under this chapter.       ``(c) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--(1) The      following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial      by military commission under this chapter:       ``(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any      rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.       ``(B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b),      and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to      compulsory self-incrimination.       ``(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.       ``(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall      apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only      to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by      this chapter.       ``(d) Status of Military Commissions Under Common Article      3.--A military commission established under this chapter is a      regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary      `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by      civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the      Geneva Conventions.       ``(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents.--The findings,      holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military      commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or      considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a      court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title. The      findings, holdings, interpretations, and other     precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not      form the basis of any holding, decision, or other      determination of a court-martial convened under that chapter.       ``(f) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Source of      Rights.--No alien enemy unlawful combatant subject to trial      by military commission under this chapter may invoke the      Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at his trial by      military commission.     ``Sec. 948c.

Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of      war are subject to chapter 47 of this title. Courts-martial      established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try      a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable      under this chapter.       ``(c) Punishments.--A miliary commission under this chapter      may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe,      adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter,      including the penalty of death when authorized under this      chapter, chapter 47 of this title, or the law of war.          ``SUBCHAPTER II--COMPOSITION OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS``Sec.``948h.

Definitions; construction of certain offenses;        common circumstances       ``(a) Definitions.--In this subchapter:       ``(1) The term `military objective' means combatants and      those objects during an armed conflict which, by their      nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to      the war-fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing      force and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or      neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage      to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of an      attack.       ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled      to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions,      including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities,      military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds,      or detention, and military medical or religious personnel.       ``(3) The term `protected property' means any property      specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings      dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable      purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the      sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent      such property is not being used for military purposes or is      not otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects      properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the      Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property      that is a military objective.       ``(b) Construction of Certain Offenses.--The intent      required for offenses under sections 950hh, 950ii, 950jj,      950kk, and 950ss of this title precludes their applicability      with regard to collateral damage or to death, damage, or      injury incident to a lawful attack.       ``(c) Common Circumstances.--An offense specified in this      subchapter is triable by military commission under this      chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of      and associated with armed conflict.     ``Sec. 950bb. Statement of substantive offenses       ``(a) Purpose.--The provisions of this subchapter codify      offenses that have traditionally been triable by military      commissions. This chapter does not establish new crimes that      did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those      crimes for trial by military commission.       ``(b) Effect.--Because the provisions of this subchapter      (including provisions that incorporate definitions in other      provisions of law) are declarative of existing law, they do      not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date      of the enactment of this chapter.     ``Sec. 950cc. Principals       ``Any person is punishable as a principle under this      chapter who--       ``(1) commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or      aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission;       ``(2) causes an act to be done which if directly performed      by him would be punishable by this chapter; or       ``(3) is a superior commander who, with regard to acts      punishable under this chapter, knew, had reason to know, or      should have known, that a subordinate was about to commit      such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the      necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to      punish the perpetrators thereof.     ``Sec. 950dd.

Conviction of lesser offenses       ``An accused may be found guilty of an offense necessarily      included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit      either the offense charged or an attempt to commit either the      offense charged or an offense necessarily included therein.     ``Sec. 950ff.

Solicitation       ``Any person subject to this chapter who solicits or      advises another or others to commit one or more substantive      offenses triable by military commission under this chapter      shall, if the offense solicited or advised is attempted or      committed, be punished with the punishment provided for the      commission of the offense, but, if the offense solicited or      advised is not committed or attempted, he shall be punished      as a military commission under this chapter may direct.     ``Sec. 950hh.

TITLE II--TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept communications between people inside the United      States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects      overseas.       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either a      congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely      upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet &      Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to      Congress the power ``To define and punish . . .

(2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for      the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of      the law of war.       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of      military commission by statute and recognized the existence      and authority of military commissions.       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the      President and by military commanders in the field to try      offenses against the law of war.       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise      its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation      authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to      try and punish violations of the law of war.     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS.

(b) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) may not      be construed to alter or limit the authority of the President      under the Constitution and laws of the United States to      establish military commissions for areas declared to be under      martial law or in occupied territories should circumstances      so require.       (c) Scope of Punishment Authority.--A military commission      established pursuant to subsection (a) shall have authority      to impose upon any person found guilty under a proceeding      under chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as so      enacted), a sentence that is appropriate for the offense or      offenses for which there is a finding of guilt, including a      sentence of death if authorized under such chapter,      imprisonment for life or a term of years, payment of a fine      or restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition      of punishment as the military commission shall direct.       (d) Execution of Punishment.--The Secretary of Defense is      authorized to carry out a sentence of punishment imposed by a      military commission established pursuant to subsection (a) in      accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may      prescribe.       (e) Annual Report on Trials by Military Commissions.--       (1) Annual report required.--Not later than December 31      each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the      Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of      Representatives a report on any trials conducted by military      commissions established pursuant to subsection (a) during      such year.

Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms,      apply to trial by military commission except as specifically      provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the      provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms      inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial      construction and application of chapter 47 of this title is      therefore not binding on military commissions established      under this chapter.       ``(c) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--(1) The      following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial      by military commission under this chapter:       ``(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any      rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.       ``(B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b),      and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to      compulsory self-incrimination.       ``(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of      Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.       ``(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall      apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only      to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by      this chapter.       ``(d) Status of Military Commissions Under Common Article      3.--A military commission established under this chapter is a      regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary      `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by      civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the      Geneva Conventions.       ``(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents.--The findings,      holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military      commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or      considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a      court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title. The      findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of      military commissions under this chapter may not form the      basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a      court-martial convened under that chapter.       ``(f) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Source of      Rights.--No alien enemy unlawful combatant subject to trial      by military commission under this chapter may invoke the      Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at his trial by      military commission.     ``Sec. 948c.

Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of      war are subject to chapter 47 of this title. Courts-martial      established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try      a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable      under this chapter.       ``(c) Punishments.--A miliary commission under this chapter      may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe,      adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter,      including the penalty of death when authorized under this      chapter, chapter 47 of this title, or the law of war.          ``SUBCHAPTER II--COMPOSITION OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS``Sec.``948h.

Definitions; construction of certain offenses;        common circumstances       ``(a) Definitions.--In this subchapter:       ``(1) The term `military objective' means combatants and      those objects during an armed conflict which, by their      nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to      the war-fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing      force and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or      neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage      to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of an      attack.       ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled      to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions,      including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities,      military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds,      or detention, and military medical or religious personnel.       ``(3) The term `protected property' means any property      specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings      dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable      purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the      sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent      such property is not being used for military purposes or is      not otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects      properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the      Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property      that is a military objective.       ``(b) Construction of Certain Offenses.--The intent      required for offenses under sections 950hh, 950ii, 950jj,      950kk, and 950ss of this title precludes their applicability      with regard to collateral damage or to death, damage, or      injury incident to a lawful attack.       ``(c) Common Circumstances.--An offense specified in this      subchapter is triable by military commission under this      chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of      and associated with armed conflict.     ``Sec. 950bb. Statement of substantive offenses       ``(a) Purpose.--The provisions of this subchapter codify      offenses that have traditionally been triable by military      commissions. This chapter does not establish new crimes that      did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those      crimes for trial by military commission.       ``(b) Effect.--Because the provisions of this subchapter      (including provisions that incorporate definitions in other      provisions of law) are declarative of existing law, they do      not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date      of the enactment of this chapter.     ``Sec. 950cc. Principals       ``Any person is punishable as a principle under this      chapter who--       ``(1) commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or      aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission;       ``(2) causes an act to be done which if directly performed      by him would be punishable by this chapter; or       ``(3) is a superior commander who, with regard to acts      punishable under this chapter, knew, had reason to know, or      should have known, that a subordinate was about to commit      such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the      necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to      punish the perpetrators thereof.     ``Sec. 950dd.

Solicitation       ``Any person subject to this chapter who solicits or      advises another or others to commit one or more substantive      offenses triable by military commission under this chapter      shall, if the offense solicited or advised is attempted or      committed, be punished with the punishment provided for the      commission of the offense, but, if the offense solicited or      advised is not committed or attempted, he shall be punished      as a military commission under this chapter may direct.     ``Sec. 950hh.

A bill to establish procedures for the review of electronic surveillance programs; read the first time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3931       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept communications between people inside the United      States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects      overseas.       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either     a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only      rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet &      Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.
