President, I rise today to celebrate the centennial of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 309 in Collinsville, IL. On September 11, 1902, eleven electrical workers from my hometown of East St. Louis, IL committed to support a united labor effort by forming their own local chapter. Despite the dangers in developing the electrical industry, the group continued its work and advanced to become highly trained and skilled journeymen.  The group has grown from its eleven original members to 1,100 and has helped shape the Metro-east and surrounding areas of southern Illinois. Local 309 has been a leader in the electrical industry, with advancements in training, organizing, market recovery, and member services. Its apprentice program has been registered in the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and has been producing skilled and experienced workers for the past 100 years. It continues to show its commitment to the education of its members in this, its centennial year.  Through their expertise and solidarity, today's members of Local 309 continue the legacy of their founders by uniting the electrical workers of southern Illinois under the common goals of fairness, justice, and leadership in their field.  Congratulations to the members of Local 309 on their centennial celebration. Best wishes for the next 100 years.                          ____________________
