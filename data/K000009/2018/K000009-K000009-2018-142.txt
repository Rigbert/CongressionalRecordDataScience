Speaker, I rise to include in the Record my speech at yesterday's event, ``Human Rights without Borders,'' organized by the Wei Jingsheng Foundation and the European Union Parliamentary Liaison Office. It was my privilege to receive the ``Human Rights and Freedom Defender'' award.  We must continue to shine a light on human rights abuses in China. I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan bases to continue to carry the torch for liberty in China and globally.       Thank you all so much for the invitation to this very      poignant exhibit, ``Human Rights without Borders.''       Thank you to Wei Jingsheng as well as Antoine Ripoll of the      European Parliament Liaison Office for so graciously hosting      this very special event.       Wei, what a pleasure to see you again. I had the honor of      hosting him in my district 16 years ago at the Toledo Labor      Day Parade, as well as an event at the University of Toledo.       And thank you all for continuing to carry forward the flame      of human rights in China, and across the world.       What an honor to receive this reward. I am truly humbled.       I would like to dedicate it to all the freedom fighters in      China and across the world that are being detained, tortured,      or persecuted due to their pursuit of liberty.       As you all know, human rights and democratic principles are      not just for wishful thinking.       These principles are central to our nation's security      because we know a more democratic world is a more secure      world. We know that countries with strong human rights      records are more prosperous, stable, and reliable partners to      build world peace.       Tragically, the Chinese regime has a deeply troubling human      rights record.       As we speak, up to one million Uyghur Muslims are      languishing in concentration camps in North West China.       At least 321 Tibetans have been detained since 2012, yet      heroically continue their struggle for self-determination.       Meanwhile, millions of Chinese workers toil away at penny-     wages in slave conditions to benefit the Chinese regime and      transnational corporations.       There is no freedom of association to form trade unions,      leaving the level of occupational disease and injuries      alarmingly high. And also prevents oversight of child labor      and severe abuse of migrant and ethnic minority workers.       During peak production season, workers are forced to cover      80-175 overtime hours per month with little to no      protections, exposed to hazardous chemicals and deadly      working conditions.       More than 480 million people in China--one third of its      population--live on less than $2 a day.       The lack of an independent judiciary, independent press,      rule of law, and due process raise serious concerns of core      principals of fundamental human rights.       With such an ancient and rich culture, the Chinese people      deserve better than this brutish and crude oppression.       As Congress debated allowing China into the World Trade      Organization, many argued that welcoming China into the world      fold would lead to democratization. They said that a middle      class would demand their rights.       Instead, we've seen more oppression and a more aggressive      Chinese foreign policy that can use its new-found riches to      challenge American influence abroad.       China has yet to open its markets to American goods. Our      trade deficits have soared, clocking in at over $375 billion      in 2017 alone and despite promises from the Trump      Administration to correct this gaping imbalance.       As a result, American workers in Ohio and across the      Midwest have lost thousands of jobs to corporate greed and      offshoring.       Free trade with China has surely been a one-sided deal.       Just as China shows a blatant disdain for human rights and      rule of law in their own country, she tramples upon      international law and seeks to overturn the global rules-     based order.       As a strategic competitor, she seeks to spread its      propaganda and tear down the virtues of democracy. She would      seek to replace the blessings of liberty and replace it with      its oppressive and dark ideology.       China provides diplomatic cover and assistance to the      pariah-state North Korea that threatens global security with      nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles.       China fails to control illicit flows of fentanyl into the      United States killing so many unsuspecting victims in my      District, Northern Ohio, and across America.       While the United States takes a step back in global      leadership and diplomacy, China is too eager to fill the      void. We see China investing millions in developing nations      in South American and Africa, spreading its undemocratic and      tyrannical influence.       We watch as Chinese foreign aid and influence pays      dividends in nations as they shift to recognize mainland      China over a free and democratic Taiwan.       China seeks to illegally take control of international      waters in the South China seaway and undertakes aggressive      naval maneuvers to challenge stability in the region provided      by our naval fleet.       China's global strategy and dominance is that of a sleeping      dragon. But with its aggressive state-driven Belt and Road      Initiative, which will invest $1 trillion on development      projects globally, America can no longer tip-toe around the      dragon.       As a Member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on      China, I join my colleagues in the commitment to work to hold      China accountable on its deeply disturbing human rights      record.       We need to take China's failure to live up to its      commitment much more seriously. We need a trade policy that      creates jobs in the U.S. And we must continue to check      China's revisionist and aggressive foreign policy.       Thank you all again for this great honor, and I look      forward to working with you and my colleagues on a bipartisan      basis to continue carrying the torch for human rights in      China and globally.                          ____________________
