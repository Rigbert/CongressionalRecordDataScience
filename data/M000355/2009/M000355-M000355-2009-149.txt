 President, we know the House-passed health care bill will cut Medicare, raise taxes, and raise premiums. We also know the bill being developed by the majority leader will do the same. This morning, I want to focus on the $\1/2\ trillion cuts in Medicare--$\1/2\ trillion over 10 years.  We have here the House-passed health care bill in its entirety. This is a 2,000-page, as the Wall Street Journal called it, ``monstrosity.'' In the area of the Medicare cuts, what does that mean? When you say you are going to cut Medicare by $\1/2\ trillion over 10 years, what does it mean? It means cuts to hospitals, cuts to Medicare Advantage, cuts to nursing homes, cuts to home health care, and cuts to hospice. Those vital programs would be collectively subjected to $\1/2\ trillion in cuts over 10 years.  Focusing on hospice, this is the section of the bill that deals with hospice. The legalese is a little bit mind-boggling, but to give you a sense of how these things are written, it says, ``Subclause (VII) of section''--and it goes on:       . . . 1814(i)(1)(c)(ii) of the Social Security Act . . . is      amended by inserting after ``the     market basket percentage increase'' the following: ``(which      is subject to the productivity adjustment . . . ''  Described in another section.  You would have to be steeped in legalese and minutia to understand what that means, so I am going to interpret it for our colleagues so they will know what that means. It means an $8 billion cut to hospice. That is what that language means, an $8 billion cut to hospice.  What does that mean for seniors? According to Victoria Scarborough, who is a nurse in Danville, KY, it means sacrificing patient care. Here is what she had to say about the prospect of an $8 billion cut to hospice:       We are able to do this--provide excellent health care at      low cost--because we are present at the bedside with the      patient, sitting at the kitchen table, holding a spouse's      hand. We depend upon our highly skilled personnel; our      ``services'' are our people. For hospices the productivity      adjustment makes little sense, we need our people.  That illustrates the impact of an $8 billion cut in hospice.  On the chart behind me, I mention the other areas that are being cut: hospitals, Medicare Advantage, nursing homes, home health, and hospice, which I just described.  Another cut would be to Medicare Advantage. The section of the bill--this is the front page--dealing with the Medicare Advantage reforms, they are called, says ``Phase-In Of Payment Based On Fee-For-Service Costs.'' What does that mean? What does ``Phase-In Of Payment Based On Fee-For-Service Costs'' mean? It means that $236 billion in cuts to Medicare will occur--$236 billion in this program out here, Medicare Advantage, that will occur as a result of this bill. What does that mean, the $236 billion of cuts to Medicare Advantage? The Congressional Budget Office has said it means fewer benefits for seniors. That is the Congressional Budget Office that says it means fewer benefits for seniors.  Norma Hylton of Lexington, KY, recently wrote:       Mr. Obama says he'll take away the Medicare Advantage      plans. . . . This makes us very concerned about the      healthcare plans being debated. I truly believe all seniors      (maybe others) will suffer.  We know the overall bill raises taxes, raises health insurance premiums for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, and cuts Medicare by $\1/2\ trillion. This morning, what I tried to do is point out what some of those cuts mean; what taking $8 billion out of hospice means, this important program dealing with folks who are at the end of life; and what taking $236 billion out of Medicare Advantage means, as a practical matter, to constituents in my State and across the country.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
