Speaker the draft farm bill, unfortunately, contains serious damage to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the foundational food lifeline for millions of Americans. What a shame when unemployment levels remain too high, with the cost of living rising, with food prices going up that affect so many of our senior citizens, and millions of Americans who live at the edge. Surely this Congress can do better.  Wall Street speculators and bankers got to keep all their bonuses, and the Republican majority can't seem to find their way to ask the richest to pay something to help our Republic close the gap. Millionaires and billionaires, couldn't they forego some of their ill-gotten treasure, especially the speculators who led this Republic to the edge?  What do the Republicans do? Literally take food out of the mouths of children, seniors, the unemployed, the disabled--$16 billion worth. Citizens who live at the edge of poverty receive $1.50 per meal in benefits.  The farm bill thus far takes food off the table of up to 3 million Americans and asks nothing of millionaires and billionaires. What a shame.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the cuts to SNAP.                          ____________________
