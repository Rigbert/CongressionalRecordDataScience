Mr. Speaker, I guess everybody now knows how far the so-called pro-choice movement will go. They will lie, as one top pro-abortionist recently admitted, to sustain the myth that abortion is somehow sane, compassionate, and even pro-child.  Americans will now see that the real extremists are not the people who insist on calling attention to the grisly details of abortion, such as dismemberment of an unborn child, injections of poison, or puncturing the child's skull and sucking out his or her brains. Americans now know that the real extremists are those who actually do these abusive acts, and then lie through their teeth to sanitize and conceal the truth. The dangerous person is not the one who shows the pictures of partial-birth abortion, the dangerous person is the child abuser who holds the scissors at the base of the skull of that baby's brain.  Let us end partial-birth abortion. We have the opportunity today. I hope we have a good bipartisan vote to do so later on this afternoon.                          ____________________
