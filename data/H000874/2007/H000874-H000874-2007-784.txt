 This is the second time I have come to the Floor this year to sing Kacie's praises. On the first occasion, I commended her win in the National Championship. And today, I rise to celebrate her win in the National Derby Rally Championships--held in the great State of Indiana on Friday July 27--where she won her world title.  Earning the title ``world champion'' is no small feat. It takes hard work, determination, intelligence and athletic ability--all of which were on display when Kacie achieved her ultimate goal and became the best in the world at her chosen pursuit.  Madam Speaker, I had the pleasure of meeting Kacie this morning, and I can tell you that she is an incredibly well-rounded young woman from whom we expect even greater things in the future.  Today, I want Kacie and her family to know that her district, State and Nation are proud of her accomplishment and wish her nothing but the best in whatever the future may hold.                          ____________________
