President, the Senator is absolutely right. The distinguished assistant Democratic leader pointed out just a short while ago that we have had a number of votes on the Energy bill, which were very close votes, which could have gone either way. We had a good debate going and we were actually voting. Now, instead we spend more time in quorum calls and bringing up judicial votes that are not going anywhere.  I must say to my friend from North Dakota, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, if we would have taken the time that has been wasted on things not going anywhere, if we had taken time to vote through some of the judges, where I believe we could get consensus of both Democrats and Republicans, and vote and confirm them and let them go to the bench, that would be a better way. We spent a whole month, as I mentioned, trying to get the Republicans to allow a vote on Judge Edward Prado for a circuit court of appeals position. He had been nominated by President Bush and was strongly supported by President Bush. For a month, they blocked it from going to a vote. We found out afterward it was because they went to the same members of the press they havegone to this week and they said: This is terrible. The Democrats aren't allowing us to vote.  Democrats, time after time, came on the Senate floor and said we can have unanimous consent to go to a vote, and they objected.
