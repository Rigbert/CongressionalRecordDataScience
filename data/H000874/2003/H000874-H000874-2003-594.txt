Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Porter who bravely served as a private in the Maryland Militia during the War of 1812 and was killed in the line of duty.  The War of 1812 should be remembered and revered for its final and permanent confirmation of American Independence.  Mr. Porter served in the Maryland Militia as a member of the 33rd Regiment and served under Captain Benjamin Massey in the Battle of Bladensburg, also known as ``the battle to protect the heart of America.'' The Maryland Militia served at a moment's notice with great enthusiasm, demonstrating the honor and dignity with which they believed came from defending their country and serving this patriotic duty.  The British had three reasons for attacking the Chesapeake Region during the Battle of Bladensburg: to burn Washington, D.C. in order to avenge America's burning of York in Canada; to destroy Baltimore to prevent future naval attacks; and to draw American troops away from the Canadian front. Despite these interests, the Maryland Militia was able to aid their country by defending both Washington and Baltimore and allowed troops to remain on the Canadian front.  John Porter fought valiantly during this battle, and was one of many members of the Maryland Militia who gave their lives in defense of their country.  Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, please join me in recognizing the sacrifice and service of Mr. Porter to both the state of Maryland and to our great nation.                          ____________________
