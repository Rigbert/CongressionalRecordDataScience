Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again I rise in support of this resolution.  I have listened to the words of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) with reference to Dr. Ibanez, and I concur in those remarks.  Mr. Speaker, the Smithsonian Institution is, as my colleagues know, both a museum of extraordinary note but also a very distinguished academic institution. It not only displays knowledge, but it diffuses knowledge, as well.  Dr. Ibanez has served with distinction on the Smithsonian Board. So we have had Mr. Spoon, who is going to bring a new perspective, and Dr. Ibanez, who will continue to have an institutional memory of what has come before and what should go in the future.  So I am very pleased to rise in support of this resolution and to, frankly, thank Dr. Ibanez for agreeing to continue to expend his very valuable time in this volunteer way on behalf of a great American institution, in fact a great world institution, the Smithsonian Institution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
