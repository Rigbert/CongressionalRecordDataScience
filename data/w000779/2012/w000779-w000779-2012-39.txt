President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Trade in Seafood Act.  Right now, our country is proud to be a world leader in the fishing and seafood processing industries. We rank among the world's top five exporters of seafood, and its largest importer. However, the U.S. seafood industry faces many challenges on the global stage from unfair competition. The Congress should be doing everything it can to make sure we retain our status as global leader. That is why I am introducing the Fair Trade in Seafood Act. This bill will establish this issue as a Principal Negotiating Objective of the United States in the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership and World Trade Organization talks.  Why is this bill important? According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 85 percent of the world's fisheries are fully exploited, overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion--the highest percentage since the Food and Agricultural Organization began keeping records.  Many governments continue to provide significant subsidies that push their fleets to fish longer, more intensively, and farther away than otherwise would be possible. These destructive fisheries subsidies are estimated to be at least $16 billion annually, an amount equivalent to approximately 20 percent of the value of the world catch. The detrimental effects of these illegal subsidies are so significant that eliminating them is the single greatest action that can be taken to protect the world's oceans.  In contrast to these nefarious actors, the U.S. does not just talk about the importance of sustainable fishing practices and marine conservation. We are practicing what we preach. That means enforcing regulations and changing old, counterproductive, destructive habits. Our seafood industry is stronger because of it. At the same time, our market is open. In my view, this is the way every country ought to run its seafood industry. Our foreign trading partners, as I mentioned, often support practices that can cause long-term harm to marine habitat. In addition, our trading partners put up trade barriers that prevent sustainably caught U.S. seafood from reaching foreign consumers. These are practices that skew the playing field in a competitive marketplace. They skew the playing field against American fishers and give foreign competitors a huge advantage in an industry that depends on global trade. Forty percent of global fishery products are traded internationally, and seafood is more globally sourced than coffee, rice, and tea combined.  These harmful foreign trade barriers and practices that encourage overfishing are top priorities that need to be addressed. These foreign trade barriers harm our country's ability to create good-paying jobs. Preserving the wealth of the world's marine environment is of paramount importance. The U.S. seafood industry represents a major portion of our economy, employing over 1.5 million workers in the commercial sector alone. The commercial seafood industry has a significant presence in over 23 States and is an industry and, in fact, a way of life, a way of life that binds communities and stitches together the regions of our country. The seafood sector employs more people than the mining or oil industries.  It is also a foundation of our economy because, without fish, there are no jobs. Preserving the wealth of our oceans and rivers is an economic imperative as much as a moral one. That is why I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Fair Trade in Seafood Act.  In short, this Act will codify an official trade negotiating objective of the United States with respect to government fisheries subsidies. More specifically, the negotiating objective will be to eliminate fisheries subsidies provided by governments that unfairly destroy markets to the detriment of the United States commercial fishing interests and that perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices. The bill aims to ensure that any commitments with respect to such subsidies are enforceable under appropriate trade laws. This negotiating objective will apply to any trade agreement that includes any negotiations relating to the elimination or reduction of government fisheries subsidies.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3518       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in Seafood Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of      the United Nations, 85 percent of the world's fisheries are      overexploited, fully exploited, significantly depleted, or      recovering from overexploitation, the highest percentage ever      on record.       (2) A primary reason for the global fisheries crisis is      government subsidies that create perverse incentives for      continued fishing in the face of declining catches.       (3) Despite the dire conditions of the world's marine      resources, some of the countries that engage in the most      fishing continue to provide significant subsidies to their      fishing fleets.       (4) Fisheries subsidies are estimated to be approximately      20 percent of the value of the world catch and have helped      create a global fishing fleet that is up to 250 percent      larger than that needed to fish sustainably.       (5) Many long-range foreign fleets are supported by      government subsidies for fuel, other operational expenses,      and vessel construction that allow their fleets to fish      longer, at greater distances, and more intensively than is      commercially or environmentally warranted. Those fleets would      not be viable without the support of government subsidies.       (6) Many developing countries are particularly affected by      fisheries subsidies provided by other governments because the      developing countries are unable to compete against subsidized      industrial fleets.       (7) Fisheries subsidies offered by the governments of other      countries give the fleets of those countries an unfair      advantage over United States fishermen by reducing the costs      of operations and increasing the number, size, and power of      vessels competing for fish. Foreign fisheries subsidies also      undermine opportunities for United States fishermen in      potential export markets.       (8) Without committed global leadership to reduce      ``overfishing subsidies'', there is a significant risk that      the oceans will become too depleted to fish, resulting in a      catastrophic blow to the world economy and environment.       (9) As one of the world's largest importers of seafood and      one of the top five exporters of seafood, the United States      has a particular responsibility to lead trade negotiations to      address fisheries subsidies and make the establishment of      strong new rules on fisheries subsidies a core priority in      United States trade negotiations.       (10) Paragraphs 28 and 31 of the Ministerial Declaration of      the World Trade Organization adopted at Doha November 14,      2001, which launched the Doha Development Agenda, called for      negotiations to clarify and improve disciplines on trade-     distorting government fisheries subsidies.       (11) Paragraphs 9 through 11 of Annex D of the Ministerial      Declaration of the World Trade Organization adopted at Hong      Kong December 18, 2005, reinforced the Doha fisheries      subsidies mandate, noting that ``there is broad agreement      that the Group should strengthen disciplines on subsidies in      the fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of      certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to      overcapacity and over-fishing'' and calling on ``Participants      promptly to undertake further detailed work to, inter alia,      establish the nature and extent of those disciplines,      including transparency and enforceability''.       (12) The negotiations on fisheries subsidies in the World      Trade Organization and negotiations for the Trans-Pacific      Partnership Agreement are two of the most important, and      promising, international efforts to stop global overfishing      and represent meaningful efforts to directly address a key      environmental issue that directly impacts international      trade.       (13) On November 12, 2011, the leaders of the 9 countries      in negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement--     Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand,      Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States--announced      the achievement of the broad outlines of an ambitious, 21st-     century agreement. According to a statement released by those      leaders, the agreed outline calls for ``[a] meaningful      outcome on environment [that] will ensure that the agreement      appropriately addresses important trade and environment      challenges and enhances the mutual supportiveness of trade      and environment. The TPP countries share the view that the      environment text should include effective provisions on      trade-related issues that would help to reinforce      environmental protection and are discussing an effective      institutional arrangement to oversee implementation and a      specific cooperation framework for addressing capacity      building needs.''. Various proposals, including a proposal by      the United States, to bring disciplines to government-     subsidized fishing are under active discussion as part of the      negotiations on the environment chapter of the Trans-Pacific      Partnership Agreement.       (14) The United States continues to make achievement of an      agreement on disciplines on government fisheries subsidies a      priority in negotiations in the World Trade Organization and      for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. On December 16,      2011, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade      Organization in Geneva, the United States Trade      Representative issued a statement urging ``continued work      toward an ambitious outcome on fisheries subsidies under the      WTO''. Noting the acute impact of declining catches on      developing countries, the Trade Representative further      stated, ``We stand ready to explore new negotiating      approaches that can move us towards the elimination of      harmful subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and      overfishing. . . . WTO Members have a duty to address one of      the root causes of overfishing and overcapacity--the      fisheries subsidies that encourage fishing enterprises to      fish longer, harder, and farther than would otherwise be      sustainable without subsidy aid. . . . The United States is      ready to continue this work in the WTO and in other      appropriate fora--including free trade agreements such as the      Trans-Pacific Partnership and other bilateral, regional and      multilateral initiatives.''.       (15) A strong fisheries subsidies agreement by the World      Trade Organization and in the Trans-Pacific Partnership      Agreement would set an historic precedent by showing that      international trade can directly benefit the environment      while promoting exports and open markets.     SEC. 3. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES                    WITH RESPECT TO GOVERNMENT FISHERIES SUBSIDIES.       It shall be a principal negotiating objective of the United      States in negotiations for a trade agreement--       (1) to eliminate fisheries subsidies provided by      governments that unfairly distort markets to the detriment of      United States commercial fishing interests and that      perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices; and       (2) to ensure that any commitments with respect to such      subsidies are enforceable under appropriate trade laws.     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act takes effect on the date of the enactment of this      Act and applies with respect to negotiations for a trade      agreement that--       (1) include any negotiations relating to the elimination or      reduction of government fisheries subsidies; and       (2) are entered into--       (A) on or after such date of enactment; or       (B) before such date of enactment if the negotiations      continue on or after such date of enactment.                          ____________________
