Just as the door was closed on Dan Inouye of Hawaii when, as a Japanese American from Hawaii, he wanted to serve his country, the unanimous consent request from the Republican leader closed the door on anyone who wished to serve this country if it involved the issue of immigration. It had one intent: stop the DREAM Act, stop these young people from being given a chance to serve their nation. That is clearly the intent. Unfortunately, the partisan rollcall that followed is evidence that was the strategy.  Just as Dan Inouye prevailed and persisted and not only served his country admirably but with the highest level of valor, I am convinced that many of the young people who leave heartbroken today by this vote will get their chance someday, just as the Senator did, and they will serve this country with distinction and they will serve this Nation as the Senator has led us in the Senate.
