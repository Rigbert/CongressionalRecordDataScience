We need this legislation to correct the current situation.  One of the many times I personally have run into this problem of holds was in the case of the nomination of Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee I was trying to shepherd the nomination of Governor Leavitt through my committee.  At that time in 2003, Governor Leavitt was being run through unprecedented hoops by the Democrats to obstruct his nomination even though we had an affirmative statement from my Ranking Member Senator Jeffords that he considered Governor Leavitt a friend and admission that he was going to receive the vote of Senator Jeffords.  Pursuant to this situation, Roll Call wrote the following piece that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Roll Call, Oct. 6, 2003]                    Inhofe Considers Rules Amendment                           (By Mark Preston)       Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe (R-     Okla.) is considering asking his Senate colleagues to amend      chamber rules to terminate the minority party's ability to      block committees from reporting out legislation and      nominations.       Such a measure would impose uniform guidelines on how the      Senate's 19 standing committees and lone special panel      operate.       ``I am going to have to look to see what can be done,      because the Democrats could effectively shut down the      government altogether,'' Inhofe said.       The EPW chairman's contemplation of a new rule was sparked      by committee Democrats' successful effort last week to delay      a vote on Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt's (R) nomination to head the      Environmental Protection Agency. Democrats charge that      Leavitt has failed so far to adequately answer their written      questions posed to him, and therefore boycotted the hearing.       Inhofe is likely to face stiff opposition if he pursues a      change in the rules, which would require 67 votes on the      Senate floor.       ``I am not in favor of changing the rules much,'' said Sen.      Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a staunch defender of Senate      tradition. ``The rules have been here for a long time and      they are the product of decades of experience.''       Currently, each committee adopts its own rules of procedure      at the outset of every Congress. EPW rules require that at      least two members from the minority party be present for a      nominee to be reported out of committee. Democrats took      advantage of that stipulation by not attending the Leavitt      hearing and thereby preventing Inhofe from holding a vote on      the nomination.       ``I think we may have to change the rules in the Senate in      terms of how committees operate because they say you can't      conduct business unless you have members of both sides''      present, Inhofe said. ``What they did [Wednesday] is far      worse than stopping a guy's confirmation. It goes to the      whole heart of how the committee system works.''       Even though EPW requires at least two minority party      representatives to be present to take action, other      committees have less stringent rules. For example, the      Finance Committee requires that a quorum include at least one      member from each party to be present when the full committee      votes on a bill or a nomination. And the Rules and      Administration Committee requires that a majority of panel      members be present to vote on legislation or a nominee, but      does not stipulate that a member from either the majority or      minority be present when such an action is taken.       Inhofe said he is also interested in amending the rule that      allows committees to only meet for two hours after the Senate      gavels into session unless both parties agree--on a daily      basis--to waive it. In recent years, this unanimous consent      agreement has been rejected by several Senators for various      reasons.       ``One party can stop government completely, and I don't      think that was certainly the intent of those people who made      the rules to start with,'' the Oklahoma Republican said.       Inhofe's proposals for adding to and altering the current      rules are just two among a handful of reforms that      Republicans have been championing since taking over the      majority earlier this year.       ``The Senate Republican majority is going to have to look      at a number of them,'' Rules Chairman Trent Lott (R-Miss.)      said of potential changes. ``I do think our rules have not      been seriously considered in quite some time.       ``We need to take a look at the way the Senate functions,''      Lott added.       One rules change is currently waiting action by the full      Senate. Lott's panel approved a measure in June that would      end the use of a filibuster to stop a nomination. All 10      Republicans on the panel voted to report the bill out of      committee, but it still needs the backing of 67 Senators on      the Senate floor for it to be enacted. Democrats on the Rules      panel did not attend the June 24 hearing and have vowed to      prevent the rule change from passing on the floor.       Republicans are seeking this change to stop Democrats from      blocking President Bush's judicial nominees. Already, one of      Bush's picks for a seat on the appellate court has withdrawn      his name because Democrats refused to allow a vote on his      nomination. Currently, Democrats are blocking two other      judicial nominees and have pledged to block U.S. District      Judge Charles Pickering's nomination to the appeals court.       The disagreement over judges has added to the partisanship      in the traditionally collegial Senate.       ``I think the judge issue is poisoning the well around here      and it is unfortunate,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH). ``It      has never happened before this filibuster on the judges at      this level, and that has created frustration.''       But Democrats contend Bush is to blame for the judicial      filibusters, because he refuses to work with Democrats to      pick candidates acceptable to both political parties.       ``I would like to point out, when people are opposed to      some of these nominees, don't look at the Senators, ask the      guy who sent the nominees,'' said Judiciary ranking member      Patrick Leahy (D-VT). ``That is part of the problem. The      White House doesn't make an effort to really work with      everybody.''       Another rules change advocated by several Senators is one      ending the use of an anonymous ``hold.'' A hold is a tactic      used by a Senator to stop a nomination or a bill the lawmaker      opposes, or often to gain leverage on another issue.       It is a huge problem for the leaders,'' Lott said of the      use of secret holds. And Lott, a former Majority Leader,      warned that Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Minority      Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) will experience the ``devastating''      consequences of this practice when the two leaders try to      wrap up legislative business for the year.       They are fixing to find out the last week we are here they      are going to say, `The hold is a really bad creation,' ''      Lott said. ``I know it, but they have got to see it. That is      when conferences are coming through, and that is when bills      need to move.''       As for the Leavitt nomination, Inhofe has scheduled three      consecutive meetings beginning Oct. 15 in which a vote on the      Utah governor's nomination could occur. But it is unclear      what action Democrats will take.       ``He hasn't answered our questions,'' said Sen. Barbara      Boxer (D-CA). ``So if we get the answers to our questions      from Leavitt that is a different circumstance.''       ``Let's see how he answers our questions,'' she added.       Inhofe could change his panel's rules to allow him to      report Leavitt out of the committee, but he would still need      two Democrats present to take a formal vote on the change.
