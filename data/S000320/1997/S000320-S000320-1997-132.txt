 President, I oppose the public disclosure of the overall level of intelligence funding as proposed by the Torricelli amendment. It does not take an act of Congress to declassify the top line of intelligence spending. The President of the United States has always had the authority to disclose this figure, and has always chosen to keep it classified. Determining the classification is the responsibility and, I believe, the duty of the Chief Executive and Commander in Chief. Presidents Truman through Clinton have determined that this figure is to remain classified and we should not overrule that judgment.  I yield the remainder of my time. I ask my colleagues to vote no on the Torricelli amendment.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
