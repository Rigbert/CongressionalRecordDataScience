President, I rise in support of H.R. 2867, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2011.  Many of our Nation's Founders fled religious persecution, and they placed great importance on religious freedom. George Washington summed up the prevailing view when he said, ``In this land of equal liberty, it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws.''  In 1791, the first amendment of the Constitution was ratified, enshrining freedom of religion as the ``First Freedom'' of all Americans. The first amendment became an inspiration to people all over the world who struggle to throw off the yoke of religious persecution.  Throughout our history, the United States has sought to protect and promote the fundamental human right of religious freedom at home and around the world. Just last week, on December 10, we celebrated Human Rights Day, the 63rd anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. After World War II, under Eleanor Roosevelt's leadership, the United States spearheaded the ratification of the Universal Declaration, which recognized freedom of religion as a fundamental right of all people.  As the founding chairman of the first-ever Senate subcommittee focused on human rights, I am deeply committed to protecting religious freedom, and I strongly support the mission of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. However, as I will outline below, I am concerned that USCIRF has gone astray in recent years. Therefore, I offered an amendment to H.R. 2867, the USCIRF Reauthorization Act, including good-government reforms like term limits for Commissioners, a prohibition on employee discrimination, and a requirement that Commissioners follow Federal travel regulations. My amendment also included changes to H.R. 2867 that will make USCIRF stronger, extending its reauthorization from 2 to 3 years and increasing the number of Commissioners from five to nine. The Durbin amendment will allow the USCIRF to more effectively pursue its mission.  On Monday, the Senate adopted my amendment and passed the USCIRF reauthorization bill on a unanimous vote. The bill is now awaiting consideration in the House of Representatives. USCIRF's current authorization is scheduled to expire tomorrow, December 16, so I urge my colleagues in the House to quickly take up and pass H.R. 2867.  I would like to take a moment to outline the provisions of the amendment that I offered to H.R. 2867.  Although the plain language of USCIRF's authorizing statute limits Commissioners to two, 2-year terms, for a total of 4 years of service, this term limit has never been observed. In fact, several Commissioners have served more than 10 years. The members of many governmental boards and commissions are term limited, and USCIRF would be well served by the new ideas and fresh perspective that new Commissioners would bring.  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 includes a provision that limits Commissioners to serving two consecutive terms. However, the bill creates two new exceptions to the term limit provision in USCIRF's existing authorization. First, the bill would allow a Commissioner to serve an unlimited number of nonconsecutive terms. Second, the bill would allow each current Commissioner to complete his or her current term and then serve one additional term, regardless of how long the Commissioner has served. As a result, Commissioners who have already served more than 10 years would be permitted to serve an additional full term and unlimited nonconsecutive terms.  These loopholes are a step backwards from existing law and undercut the purpose of a term limit, which is to make sure that new voices from a range of viewpoints and faiths are rotated into the Commission periodically to collaborate in strengthening and shaping the Commission's mandate. In keeping with this spirit, my amendment includes in H.R. 2867 a firm term limit of two, 2-year terms--4 years total--with no grandfathering of current Commissioners.  USCIRF has taken the position that its employees do not enjoy the same antidiscrimination protections as allother Federal employees. It is simply unacceptable for a Federal agency charged with promoting human rights to argue that it has the legal right to discriminate against its employees. The Durbin amendment includes in H.R. 2867 a provision which allows pending civil rights claims against USCIRF to proceed under the Congressional Accountability Act.  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 provided antidiscrimination protections to USCIRF employees for future incidents of discrimination through the Congressional Accountability Act. However, I was concerned that this provision did not apply to former employees or past discrimination. As a result, there would have been no legal remedy for any incidents of discrimination that may have taken place prior to enactment of H.R. 2867.  Specifically, last year a former USCIRF employee filed a discrimination claim based on her allegation that her permanent employment offer was rescinded after the Commissioners learned of her prior job with a Muslim civil rights organization. Though she subsequently received a temporary contract with USCIRF, she claims she was terminated when she filed her discrimination claim. The Commission argued that it is not subject to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The case is now on appeal.  There must be some avenue for resolving--on the merits--past allegations that USCIRF discriminated against its employees. Accordingly, my amendment to H.R. 2867 provides that pending civil rights claims against USCIRF may proceed under the Congressional Accountability Act.  The House-passed version of H.R. 2867 reduced the number of Commissioners from nine to five, which would make it more difficult for USCIRF to carry out its mission. Moreover, the bill accomplished this reduction in a disproportionate fashion by reducing the number of Commissioners appointed by the President from three to one. The Durbin amendment strikes the provision from H.R. 2867 which reduces the number of Commissioners from nine to five.  Religious freedom advocates allege that some USCIRF Commissioners have traveled first class and stayed in five-star hotels, in violation of Federal travel regulations. This is deeply troubling, particularly during a time when all Federal agencies are being asked to do more with less. The Durbin amendment simply clarifies that USCIRF Commissioners are subject to Federal travel regulations, like other Federal employees.  H.R. 2867 reauthorizes USCIRF until September 30, 2013. With the good-government reforms in the Durbin amendment, it would be more appropriate to reauthorize USCIRF until September 30, 2014, so that USCIRF Commissioners and staff have more certainty about the future of the Commission.  I strongly support the mission of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, but I have been deeply troubled by allegations of misconduct, misuse of funds, and discrimination at the Commission. For example, according to the Washington Post:       Some past commissioners, staff and former staff of the U.S.      Commission on International Religious Freedom say the agency      charged with advising the president and Congress is rife,      behind-the-scenes, with ideology and tribalism, with      commissioners focusing on pet projects that are often based      on their own religious background. In particular, they say an      anti-Muslim bias runs through the commission's work. . . .      Rumors about infighting and ineffectiveness have swirled for      years around the commission.  My amendment will make good-government reforms to USCIRF that should help to address the concerns that have been raised about USCIRF. Moreover, my amendment will make USCIRF stronger by increasing the number of Commissioners in the reauthorization bill from five to nine and by extending the reauthorization from 2 to 3 years. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights Subcommittee and a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, I will closely monitor the work of the USCIRF in the coming months and years to ensure that it is functioning in a transparent fashion and effectively performing its mission of promoting and protecting international religious freedom.  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to quickly take up and pass H.R. 2867 so that the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom can be reauthorized.                          ____________________
