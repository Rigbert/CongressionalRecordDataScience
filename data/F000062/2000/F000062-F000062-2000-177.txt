 President, I am very pleased that yesterday the Senate unanimously passed a bill I introduced to name a United States Post Office after Joseph Santos Ileto. He was the U.S. Postal Service employee of Filipino descent who was brutally gunned down last August by the same man who opened fire on the North Valley Jewish Community Center. This bill designates the new post office located at 14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California as the ``Joseph Ileto Post Office.''  Joseph Ileto's death on the job exemplifies the ultimate sacrifice of public service. He served our nation with honor and will be remembered by his family, friends, and community as a kind-hearted man who touched many lives. Despite the tragedy of his death, we can take comfort in knowing that Joseph's life will continue to touch others.  By passing this bill, Congress recognizes the urgent need to address and condemn hate crimes and racism. Dedication of the newly constructed post office in Joseph's hometown is the very least we can do to honor a man who gave his life to his country. The companion legislation, sponsored by Congressman Gary Miller, has already passed. It is my hope that the bill will be signed into law expeditiously.                          ____________________
