Chairman, the amendment which I have offered neither changes the law nor imposes any new duties on any Federal employee. Under the rules of the House, the House is free to specify what is not to be funded in a bill. The House may decline to fund specific activities under rule XXI. This is a strict limitation and totally within the four corners of the existing rules and limitation amendments which have been allowed time and again.
