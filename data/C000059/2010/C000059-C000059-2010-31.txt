On June 12, 2010, Les passed away at the age of 79. Though Les has passed on from this life, he leaves a lasting legacy of generosity and accomplishment that will never be forgotten.  Born in Fresno, California, on October 6, 1930, Les attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he played football and graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1952. Before starting a career in professional football, Les served 2 years in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. In 1954, he started with the Los Angeles Rams, who traded a record 11 players in order to get Les. He played linebacker and place kicker for the Rams for nine seasons--eight of those being All-Pro. In 1982 he entered the College Football Hall of Fame, and he is still considered one of the greatest linebackers in professional football.  After retiring from football, Les' interests turned to auto racing, and from 1963 to 1984 he ran the Riverside Raceway in Riverside, California. He then moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, where he worked for NASCAR for 10 years, and was named executive vice president of competition in 1986, and the senior vice president of operations in 1992. He is largely recognized as one of three key race track executives that helped guide and advise NASCAR founder ``Big Bill'' France, who made NASCAR the success it is today. Les built various tracks around the NASCAR circuit and was influential in helping expand the sport's national appeal. After leaving NASCAR, Les returned to Riverside, where he oversaw the development of the Auto Club Speedway.  Aside from his professional endeavors, Les was known for contributing to the community of Riverside. In fact, Les was an original member of the Monday Morning Group, a group of civic and business leaders who come to Washington every year to meet with legislators from southern California to further the goals of the Inland Empire region. Additionally, Les chaired the board of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce and also served on the Riverside Community College District board of trustees.  Les is survived by his wife, Marilyn; daughter, Anne Guerrucci; and three grandchildren.  Although Les was known for his great success in his profession, he will be remembered for his gentle manner, humility and great sense of humor. I have personally been influenced by Les, and consider him one of my most valued mentors.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is an honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend Les Richter. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
