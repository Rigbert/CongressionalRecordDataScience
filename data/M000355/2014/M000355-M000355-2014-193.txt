 This is the issue Americans say they care the most about. So it is hard to see why Senate Democrats seem so allergic to various jobs ideas we have been proposing, not to mention dozens of job-creating bills already passed by the House.  Look, our constituents want us to work together to rebuild the middle class, to help create opportunities for the families struggling out there just to pay the bills. In recent days we have given our Democratic colleagues ample opportunity to do that. We have offered one innovative proposal after another, proposals that haven't had much of a problem attracting bipartisan support in the past, ideas such as reducing the tax burden on small businesses, freeing them to grow, to hire, to innovate, ideas such as approving the Keystone Pipeline, which would create thousands of jobs right away; ideas such as repealing the medical device tax which even Democrats acknowledge is killing jobs--although they haven't acted to fix it yet--and ideas such as eliminating ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek mandate, a rule that cuts people's hours against their will, that disproportionately affects women and is forcing too many Americans to look for extra work to get by.  But we go even further than just tackling the causes of joblessness. Our ideas go beyond just helping Americans secure jobs with a steady paycheck and the hope of a better future. Because we have also put forward legislation that offers Americans more choices and greater flexibility in the workforce. This is something a lot of our constituents are asking for, and we are responding to those concerns.  One bill we have proposed would let working moms and dads take more time off to strike a better work-life balance. Another bill would prohibitunion bosses from denying pay increases to an employee who works harder than her coworkers.
