Leader, with respect to the energy bill, it is my understanding that there is some discussion that the energy bill may proceed not next week but the week following. Can you tell me whether that is a reasonable possibility, or probability?  Mr. DeLAY. We are contemplating several major pieces of legislation that we would hope to complete before the Easter break, and we are also contemplating several bills that we contemplate completing prior to the Presidents' Day district work period.  The comprehensive energy bill, which we passed in the last Congress and in the 107th Congress, is a very high priority for this year. There is a good chance that we could consider a national energy policy bill before the Presidents' Day district work period.
