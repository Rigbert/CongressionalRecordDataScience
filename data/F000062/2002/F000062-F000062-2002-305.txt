 President, I offer this amendment to update and somewhat improve the so-called sugar program. The sugar subsidy program has been driving the domestic cane refinery industry out of existence, and it has eliminated thousands of good jobs. This amendment helps strike a new balance between saving our Nation's domestic refinery jobs and protecting sugar producers from foreign competition.  What this amendment does is ensure that the amount of sugar allowed to come into the United States actually makes it to the market. The amendment would reallocate the unfilled portion of a country's quota when that country doesn't fill its quota, which happens almost annually.  The Secretary of Agriculture does have the ability under present law to reallocate the quota, but it is a fight every year for domestic refineries to get enough sugar to refine, and it is also a fight to get the Secretary--regardless of whether it is a Democratic or Republican administration--to make this reallocation.  The amendment would allow refineries to obtain more sugar under the quota by taking some allocation from nations not exporting as much sugar as they are allowed and giving it to nations that would export more sugar to the United States.  The amendment is supported by the United States Cane Sugar Refiners' Association and the following independent refineries: C Sugar in Crockett, CA; Colonial Sugar in Gramercy, LA; Savannah Foods in Port Wentworth, GA; Imperial Sugar in Sugar Land, TX.  In the past, we have failed to balance the refineries and the growers of the sugar industry successfully. This farm bill represents an opportunity to make a change before more refineries are forced to close. This amendment will help the country's sugar refining industry. It will not strip the domestic producers of any benefits.  Something must be done to save our sugar refining industry. Since 1981, 13 out of 23 cane refineries in the United States have been forced out of business. Here they are on this chart: Hawaii, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Missouri, and Louisiana. The loss of jobs between 1981 and today is over 4,000. Those refineries that do remain open today struggle to survive under what are very onerous import restrictions.  At the end of the last year, we had a debate and the Senate overwhelmingly, regretfully, voted to continue the sugar subsidy program. I continue to oppose these sugar subsidies, but I recognize there are not the votes to eliminate the sugar program right now.  I first became involved in this issue when David Koncelik, the president and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, known as C, informed me in 1994 that his 88-year-old refinery in Crockett, CA, was forced to temporarily close because it could not get cane sugar on the market to refine.  C is the largest refinery in the United States. It is the only such facility on the west coast. It refines about 15 percent of the total cane sugar consumed in the United States. The company is capable of producing and selling about 800,000 tons of refined sugar annually. It is currently producing about 700,000 tons.  Anyone who has driven from San Francisco to Sacramento and crossed the Carquinez Straits, as you go on to the bridge, you look down and you see this old, large brick refinery known as C All of us grew up to the C commercial where they sang ``pure cane sugar from Hawaii''--something like that--and I have seen the struggle go on year after year.  Hawaii is C's sole source of domestic raw cane sugar. But the Hawaii sugarcane industry has been in decline now for over a decade. In fact, from 1996 through 2001, cane acreage fell by 50 percent in Hawaii, according to the Congressional Research Service. C can only make up for the lack of Hawaiian cane output by importing cane from other countries.  There is the rub. Our Nation's restrictive sugar import quota limits the amount of sugar available for C to refine. Simply put, C has been unable to get enough sugar to refine and has been forced to send workers home on several occasions.  In 1981, C had 1,313 employees. It is a union plant. In 1995, the company had 812. By 1999, that number dropped to 580 employees. Today, the refinery employs 565 workers.  The U.S. sugar refining industry will continue to be at risk unless we adjust this imbalance in the industry and reform the sugar program. This amendment provides an opportunity to provide immediate relief to C and the other domestic refineries without compromising one single benefit to sugar producers. It is going to be interesting to see if we can get it through, because even though it does not take anything from them, they still oppose this. I have a hard time understanding why. This is not an attack. It is simply a way to update and improve the quota system.  Let me repeat that. This amendment is not an attack on the sugar program. Sugar imports have been restricted almost continuously since 1934 in order to support high prices for domestic sugarcane and sugar beet producers. The USTR, working with the Department of Agriculture, allocates shares of the quota among 40 designated countries. Since the 1994 Uruguay Round of trade talks, the United States has allowed the designated countries to export 1.256 million tons of sugar to the United States under the quota. Today's sugar import restrictions are based on a formula derived from trade patterns that prevailed over a quarter of a century ago, and therein lies the rub and the major problem for domestic refiners such as C The quota does not accurately reflect how much countries are able to export to the United States.  Some of the 40 designated countries have even been forced to provide an export allocation when they do not export any sugar at all. Does that make sense? I think not. In fact, according to the GAO, on the average, from 1993 through 1998, 10 of the 40 countries were net importers of sugar. This means they do not export sugar to the United States if they need to import sugar to their own country. Therefore, that allocation, that part of the quota, goes unused. Our refineries that would like to buy that raw sugar on the open market cannot buy it. It makes no sense.  Other countries continue to export sugar, but they have substantially reduced their production. For example, since the allocations were made, the Dominican Republic has experienced a 50-percent decline in sugar production, and the Philippines, a 27-percent drop, but the allocation for both countries has remained the same. If the Philippines is not going to export and the Dominican Republic is not going to export their quota, all we want to do is let some country get that shortfall and put it on the market to give our domestic sugar refiners the opportunity to buy it.  Some countries have substantially increased their sugar production but not seen the amount they are allowed to export to the United States increase. For example, since the allocations were made, Guatemala, Colombia, and Australia have increased their production by 219 percent, 96 percent, and 61 percent, respectively, while their shares of the allocation have remained the same.  Some countries have similar allocations under the quota despite dramatically different levels of sugar exports. For example, Brazil and the Philippines are both allowed to export 14 percent of the total quota, but Brazilexports 21 times more sugar than the Philippines worldwide. It is unacceptable that quota allocations have not been revised for 20 years, or 2 decades, despite dramatic changes in the ability of many countries to produce and export sugar.  Is there a way to update the sugar export amounts allowed into the United States without adversely impacting growers? I believe there is, and the amendment I have offered will provide the slight change to the sugar export quota that is desperately needed.  The United States has imported on the average about 3 percent less sugar than the quota allowed from the 1996-through-1998 allocation because some countries did not fill their allocations. So there is that 3 percent out there. Since the sugar quota does not reflect the current capability of many countries to produce and export sugar, the GAO has concluded:       The United States Trade Representative's current process      for allocating the sugar tariff rate quota does not insure      that all of the sugar allowed under the quota reaches the      United States market.  There is the point. There is the differential. The sugar that does not reach the market in the quota should be made available.  I would like to read some of the July 1999 report on the sugar program issued by the GAO:       The current allocation process has resulted in fewer sugar      imports than allowed under the tariff rate quota. From 1996      through 1998, the United States raw sugar imports averaged      75,000 tons less annually than the amount USDA allowed the      United States Trade Representative to allocate under the      tariff rate quota. According to domestic refinery officials,      this shortfall has exacerbated recent declines in the overall      availability of raw cane sugar on the U.S. market.  If there is a shortfall in sugar exported to the United States, and refineries are shut down because there is not enough cane to refine, we need to allow the quota to be flexible when there is this shortfall. The amendment I have offered will reallocate unused sugar in the quota to other countries when there is an export shortfall. This is exactly what the USTR did as recently as 1995. It is also the precise recommendation of the GAO in its 1999 report. In suggesting change to the sugar program, the GAO advised:       Changes could include such actions as providing a means of      reallocating the current quota.  All this amendment does is ensure the amount of sugar allowed to come into the United States is actually making it to the market. How is that so threatening to people? This opportunity to reallocate the quota when there is a shortfall will not hurt growers because the shortfall does not represent enough sugar to affect price. Of course, that is what they will say, that this will affect price. It will not affect price. It has not affected price before. There is no reason to believe it will affect it now.  In the 1999 report, the GAO found:       Because the shortfalls in the tariff rate quota reduced      total U.S. sugar supplies by less than 1 percent, they had a      minimal effect on the domestic price of sugar.  If you do not trust me, trust the GAO. The inefficiencies of the current import restrictions demand that Congress accept this amendment.  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It will help make the sugar program operate more effectively and efficiently. If this body can't accept this simple amendment, it clearly tells me that not only is the sugar allocation outdated, but it is essentially controlled to manipulate so certain people can do business while others cannot.  These refineries are very important. My Crockett refinery is the major source of jobs in that entire Crockett community. Each year, the CEO has to come back here to plead with his representatives in Congress:       I can't buy enough sugar on the market to keep my people      employed. I pay them good salaries. It is important I be able      to operate and refine sugar. I want to buy it on the open      market and I can't--is simply wrong.  It is flawed public policy. I ask for this body's support to pass this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the New York Times.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 2001]                   Sugar Rules Defy Free-Trade Logic                           (By David Barboza)       For anyone who thinks of the United States as a free-trade      nation, the 10 story brick sugar refinery on Highway 90A here      on the outskirts of Houston is startling.       The plant can produce up to 500,000 tons of sugar a year,      enough to sweeten about 90 billion doughnuts. But while      America has a sweet tooth, it does not need all that sugar.      Indeed, America is swimming in sugar, largely because the      sugar business is one of the economy's most protectionist      niches. Sugar programs that protect growers from foreign      competition cost American consumers almost $2 billion a year      in higher prices for everything from candy bars to cold      cereal, according to government studies. Artificially high      prices have led to overproduction, leaving taxpayers the      owners of one million tons of sugar that they pay $1.4      million a month just to store, some of it in Sugar Land.       Yet earlier this year the owner of the plant here--the      Imperial Sugar Company, the nation's biggest sugar refiner--     was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,      because it has lost so much money lately turning relatively      high-priced raw sugar into the refined sugar it sells into a      depressed, glutted market.       Now, refiners are demanding an overhaul of the sugar      program. Consumer groups want it abolished. And even its      backers and beneficiaries--big growers that are major donors      to both political parties--are dissatisfied. They want more      protection, complaining that new trade initiatives, like the      North American Free Trade Agreement, threaten to undermine      the industry and further depress the price of sugar.       Congress is now hearing testimony on these matters as it      takes up a new farm bill. The conventional wisdom is that      Washington is unlikely to scrap a program that has bipartisan      support, any more than it has been prone to eliminate      supports for other farmers.       But some lawmakers say sugar policy, in particular, is ripe      for revision.       ``Events of the past year indicate that the sugar program      is becoming increasingly unmanageable and that radical      reforms are needed urgently,'' said Richard G. Lugar,      chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a longtime      opponent of the program.       At the heart of the debate is a sugar policy that since the      New Deal has held that domestic growers ought to be shielded      from the vagaries of the commodity markets. The current      program, put in place in 1981, promised that kind of      stability by limiting imports and making loans to growers.       But in recent years, helped by technology and weather,      production has exploded. And government policies and price      supports, on balance, encouraged farmers to abandon even more      seriously depressed crops in favor of sugar beets and cane.       Overproduction sent prices tumbling, hurting growers. But      the hardest hit were cane refiners. At times, the prices they      paid for raw sugar were higher than those at which they could      sell refined sugar.       If nothing changes, industry officials fear a feroclous      one-two punch: the possible loss of cane-refining capacity at      home, which could hurt food producers, and a steady rise in      imports, which could wipe out both domestic growers and      refiners.       Free-market economists say that might be the most efficient      outcome, but no industry disappears without a fight. The      refiners are just one of the interest groups that have      stormed Capitol Hill.       None are so powerful as the nation's largest producer of      raw sugar, the Flo-Sun Corporation of Palm Beach, Fla., run      by Jose Pepe Fanjul and Alfonso Fanjul, Cuban exiles who      created a sugar empire in the Florida Everglades and who are      now big donors to both Republicans and Democrats.       Flo-Sun and other giant producers want to strengthen the      program by putting new restrictions on domestic production of      sugar beets and cane. They also want to limit the scope of      any future trade deal that might lead to what they consider      unfair competition.       ``We don't believe we ought to sacrifice the American      farmer to bring in sugar that is subsidized by other      governments,'' said Judy Sanchez, a spokeswoman at U.S.      Sugar, one of Florida's biggest cane producers.       Critics of the program--from food producers to refiners to      consumer groups--would like the program discarded or      significantly weakened.       ``We want the program phased out,'' said Jeff Nedelman, a      spokesman for the Coalition for Sugar Reform, a trade group      that represents food and consumer groups, taxpayer watchdogs      and environmental organizations. ``This is corporate welfare      for the very rich. The program results in higher prices for      consumers, direct payments by U.S. taxpayers to sugar      growers, and it's the Achilles' heel of U.S. trade policy.''       Chicago, home of Sara Lee cakes and Brach's Starlight Mints      candies, has aligned itself with the critics. A few weeks      ago, Mayor Richard M. Daley and other city leaders announced      that they would lobby Congress to end the sugar program,      which they said was hurting the city's makers of candy and      food by inflating costs.       Indeed, the General Accounting Office says the sugar      program cost consumer about $1.9 billion in 1998, with the      chief beneficiaries being beet and cane growers.       Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is a      strong backer of the     sugar program, says Americans are not being overcharged.      Rather, he contends, prices on the world market are      artifically depressed by surplus sugar from countries that      subsidize production.       ``The world price has nothing to do with the cost of      sugar,'' he said. ``And my contention is that the program      causes stable prices.''       Americans' appetite for sugar is measured in pounds. The      average person in this sugar-saturated country consumes more      than 70 pounds a year of refined sugar and that does not      include most soft drinks, sauces and syrups, which are      sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup.       But even that appetite is no match for current levels of      sugar production. A record 8.5 million tons of sugar was      produced in the United States in 1999, and that sent raw      sugar prices tumbling to 18 cents a pound, the lowest level      in 20 years. The Agriculture Department stepped in last      June to buy 132,000 tons, at a cost of $54 million, or 20      cents a pound.       Imperial Sugar--already burdened by $500 million in debt      because of an acquisition spree--was hit harder than anyone      in the industry. The company was forced to buy raw sugar cane      at about the same price that it could sell the finish      product.       ``We're out of gas before we turn the lights on,'' said      I.H. Kempner III, Imperial Sugar's chairman, whose family      acquired its first holdings in 1907. Imperial filed for      bankruptcy protection in January.       The New York-based Domino, a unit of Tate & Lyle of Britain      and a leading supplier of pure cane sugar to grocery chains,      is also ``in desperate shape,'' said Margaret Blamberg, a      spokeswoman. C Sugar, a big California refiner, is      struggling both with low sugar prices and the state's rising      energy costs.       For growers, the biggest threat is the political tide      favoring free trade. Under Nafta, Mexico is getting greater      access to the American sugar market. And in 2008, the      agreement will give Mexico unlimited access to the American      market.       Just how much Mexican sugar can enter the American market      this year is in dispute. American trade officials say that      about 100,000 tons of surplus sugar is allowed in, while      Mexican officials say the figure is 500,000 tons. Under an      agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks      in 1994, the United States is required to import about 1.1      million tons of sugar a year.       The solution, the growers say, is more protection for the      industry. Two weeks ago, the House Agriculture Committee      heard testimony from the major sugar producers, who proposed      stricter market and production controls at home and more      restrictive trade policies.       ``You have to fix the big trade problems,'' said Luther      Markwart, chairman of the American Sugar Alliance, which      represents the major growers.       Trade experts, however, say the sugar program makes free-     trade talk seem hollow.       ``Sugar is a nightmare in terms of trade negotiations,''      said Prof. Robin A. King, an expert on trade policy at      Georgetown University. ``This is one reason other countries      get frustrated with our position on free trade. They say, `We      want to trade, but the items were produce you won't let in.'      ''
