Speaker, reserving the right to object, if I can make an inquiry to the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that the procedure tomorrow morning is that the House will go into session at 9 a.m., and we will immediately begin to vote on those matters that have been deferred, beginning with the Tancredo amendment, relative to the general investigations dealing with $9.9 million, that would be a 15-minute vote; the second Tancredo amendment would then be a 5-minute vote in sequence; the Hinchey amendment would be a 5-minute vote; the Kucinich amendment would be a 5-minute vote; and then there would be a 5-minute vote on the Bonior amendment? Those all would be taken together? There would be no break in time after the Kucinich amendment and the Bonior amendment?
