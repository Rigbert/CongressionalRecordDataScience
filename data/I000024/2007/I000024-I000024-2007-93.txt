Reclaiming my time, I think you are being very generous when you say we don't always agree on every issue. In fact, there are no two people who probably disagree more. That tells you something. That tells you we have to do this. This is something this country cannot do without.  Let me give you an example. I spent several years as the mayor of a major city, Tulsa, OK. The greatest problem we had was not crime in the streets, it was not prostitution, it was unfunded mandates. Now, what we do in this is go back to some of these small communities and say: We have mandated that in your drinking water system, your wastewater system, you do these things. And we should be responsible for helping you to comply with these mandates. It is very important.  There is a group called Citizens Against Government Waste. I have right here--and I am going to submit this as part of the Record. For 16 years prior to right now, they have identified 76,000 projects they thought were--that fall into this category of being earmarks.  Do you know the interesting thing about this, I ask my friend from California, Senator Boxer. It is interesting that all of these projects, with very few exceptions, were not authorized.  Now, if you look at what the Congressional Research Service comes up with, around 115,000, those include the ones that were authorized. So that tells you where the problem is. The problem is not in projects that were authorized, it is in projects that are not authorized. That is why we are doing the responsible thing today. I am hoping there is no one on either side who will hold up this bill because we have to keep moving with it before the recess.
