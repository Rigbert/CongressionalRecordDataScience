 I was telling my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee, congratulations to him for his obtaining the chairmanship. A thoughtful and hardworking Member of this House will chair the Rules Committee. I am going to be introducing an amendment to the rules that, my presumption is, we will adopt today which will return this symbol of respect, this symbol of inclusion, this symbol of colleagueship, if you will, to our six representatives of American citizens.                              {time}  1540  I hope my friend will hold hearings on that. I would like to testify on that issue.  And I say to my friends that I hope we reject these rules so that we can correct both the trillions of dollars of exposure that it creates and to ensure the inclusion, in a real and meaningful way, but not constitutionally objectionable way, our friends who representthe District of Columbia and our territories.
