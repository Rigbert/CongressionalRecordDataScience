Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment to try to increase the amount of money in the refugee account. As I think my colleagues know, I chair the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. Just a few days ago we passed legislation that significantly enhanced the money provided for refugee protection, some $750 million. My amendment today, regrettably, does not even come close to realizing that.  I understand that the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), my good friend and colleague, has an enormous difficulty with the budget constraints in providing the necessary funds. But this amendment--and I will be withdrawing it, but reluctantly--has the support of all of the major refugee organizations, including the Catholic Conference, the Council on Jewish Federations, Church World Services, U.S. Committee for Refugees, and others. But my hope is, and I would ask the distinguished chairman if he could at least try, when conference does occur, to try to restore this $20 million to the migration and refugee account. I do have every confidence he will make every effort.
