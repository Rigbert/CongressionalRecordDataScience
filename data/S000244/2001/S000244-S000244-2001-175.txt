 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), the chairman of the Committee on Small Business. I want him to know how much I appreciate knowing of his concerns regarding the important role of our country's patent system, and I am prepared to work with him on this subject. In fact, I share his appreciation of the entrepreneurial spirit of America, whereby inventors apply their creativity and ingenuity to technology every day in this country.  I want to reassure the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) that since this issue is squarely in the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, it will fully get the proper attention it deserves.  The bill we consider today, H.R. 1886, will not prejudice inventors, small businesses or anyone else connected with inventive activity. In fact, it will help level the playing field in this area regarding the patent code procedures. This will help us achieve our goals beyond patent reexamination, which include giving investors confidence in a patented invention so that doubts can be cast aside and that capital may be raised to help in the financing of entrepreneurial concern.  Second, this bill does not create new tools for litigation to harass or abuse inventors. In the past I have opposed such legislation and will continue to do so in the future.  Finally, I appreciate the concerns that the gentleman has raised. The Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property held two hearings on this subject earlier this year. In an effort to continue exploring this vital subject, I am directing my staff to schedule a third hearing on this subject and other issues of importance to inventors.  I thank the gentleman and look forward to working with him on his issue.
