President, I thank the distinguished Senator, the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, for all of his hard work. I really believe that our committee has spent a lot of time, has had a lot of bipartisan cooperation in coming up with a product, which I think is still inadequate but is still the very best that we could come up with at this time.  I think it is very unfortunate that most American people do not realize what a crisis our country is in in terms of our defense. I was very proud the other day before Senator Thurmond's committee when the four Chiefs of the four services came in and made the statement that we are $20 billion underfunded in our procurement accounts. I think this is something thatwe have to listen to because this is unprecedented. At least I do not recall any time in history when the Chiefs themselves have come in and said that the President's budget is underfunding procurement by $20 billion. They said that we need to get it up there in order to have the very minimum requirements the American people expect to defend our country.  The administration's request is almost $20 billion less, in real terms, than we are spending this year, and there are several of us who are trying to do something about this by adding back an amount of money.  So I guess what I am trying to say is that the authorization that we are dealing with in this bill is still, in my opinion, inadequate. Yet, I think it is the best that we can do at this time. Our budget has actually decreased for 12 consecutive years.  There is a lot of talk about what to do about the deficit. All of the liberals will point toward defense and say, ``We need to cut defense spending,'' when we have done nothing but cut defense spending for the last 12 consecutive years. Back during the Kennedy administration, 60 percent of our budget went to defending America and 17 percent to human services. Now, 17 percent of our budget goes to defending America and 60 percent goes to human services. It just shows the change that has taken place in the attitude of the function of Government.  We talked about the balanced budget amendment not long ago, and the fact that we need to do something to bring it into balance. So they always point toward national defense, when we have already taken cuts there.  It is kind of interesting that there is a study documented --and it has not been refuted on the floor of the Senate, and I brought this up several times--that shows that if we were to put growth caps on Government--one was a 2-percent cap, and one was a 2.5-percent cap--we could actually balance the budget without cutting one Federal program. I can assure you that I would be delighted to have that kind of treatment in our defense budget because it has deteriorated and consistently gone down over the years. Since World War II, there have only been 4 years that have been lower than we are right now--1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950. This is the lowest budget since 1950.  So it gets down to the question, is there a reason for this? Is it because the threat is not as great out there as it was in previous years? I suggest that that is a matter of interpretation. You will get a lot of difference of opinion on this floor. To me, it is incontrovertible.  I have some articles I will submit for the Record. I am going to paraphrase these. The first one--this is just in the last few days--was in the Washington Times. The last paragraph of this is:       In a report released ahead of publication today, Stern--  That is the German magazine.     Said the plant was similar to one in Tarhunah, Libya. The      United States says that complex is a chemical weapons      factory. Libya says it is an irrigation plant.  Then we have what appears to be a new relationship between Syria and Iraq. This was an article in the Washington Times on June 5.  The third article I will submit is ``U.S. Investigates Ukraine-Libya Alliance.'' This is kind of a scary thing that is going on right now. All of these are recent.  The fourth article is, ``Report Cites China-Pakistan Missile Links.''       A new, draft U.S. Government report states that all      intelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that      Pakistan has obtained medium-range ballistic missiles made by      China, and says for the first time that Pakistan probably has      finished developing nuclear warheads for these missiles, U.S.      officials said yesterday.  Of course, we have been talking, time and time again, about the threat that is out there that is different than it has been before. I understand that we are not going to be really addressing the national missile defense problem that we have. We tried to do that with the Defend America Act.  We have a President in the White House who vetoed last year's authorization bill because his veto message was that he did not want to spend more money on national missile defense.  Time and time again, we have Members of this body stand up and talk about, well, we cannot spend another $50, $60, $70, or $80 billion more on star wars. Star wars is just a term to try to make it appear as if there is not any real threat out there. I suggested that back in 1983. We recognized that, in the medium term, we were going to have to defend America against ICBM's, a missile attack with weapons of mass destruction.  Now, everything has gone in accordance with the schedule that was articulated at that time by President Reagan. So that here we are today with a system that was to be in place by the year 2000, and we have an investment of approximately $50 billion in a national missile defense system.  Yet, we stopped it dead in its tracks in spite of the fact that the Russians have missiles, that China has missiles, and the Taepo Dong II missile from North Korea is one that will be able to reach the United States by somewhere around between the year of 1999 and 2002.  So the threat is very real. It is out there. And we have people that are of the caliber of Saddam Hussein who made the statement back at the time of the Persian Gulf war. He said, ``If we had waited to invade Kuwait for 5 more years we would be able to have the missile capability of reaching the United States.'' Would he do it? Sure he would. Anyone who would kill his own grandchildren would do something like that. Look at what is happening in Libya. Qadhafi is developing weapons of mass destruction, and they have a new alliance with the Ukraine. We have very real problems that are out there.  The Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, mentioned the crisis, the disaster, the bombing of the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City and all the tragedy that was linked to that. It is something--that unless you are there to see not just the loss of lives of 168 innocent people but the brutality that was with it; the fact that all that happened with one bomb that is the equivalent of 1 ton of TNT. The smallest nuclear warhead known is 1 kiloton--1,000 times that power; that explosive power. So just imagine. No one is immune from that type of threat.  We saw just recently China and how overt they are getting right now in the Taiwan Straits with their missile testing that is taking place. Then the statement that was made by a high ranking Chinese official--it has been verified that he did say it. He said, ``We are not concerned with the United States coming in and defending Taipei because they would rather defend Los Angeles.'' At a very minimum it is an indirect threat. Are we being held hostage? I think we are.  We see the new developments in Syrian-controlled Lebanon and throughout the Middle East; that when Jim Woolsey 2 years ago--it has been 2 years now since. He certainly would not be considered a Republican. He was a CIA Director under two Democratic Presidents including President Clinton--said 2 years ago that we know of between 20 and 25 nations that have or are developing in the final stages weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear, and working on the missile means of delivering it. That was 2 years ago. He has come out since then and expanded that up to 30 nations.  So we are not talking about the days when we had two superpowers. Of course, we are looking at elections taking place right now in Russia. We do not know how they are going to come out. But we see a change in attitude in the former Soviet Union. We saw what happened in the newest elections last December when the Communists took over 153 seats to Yeltsin's 54 and Zhirinovsky roughly 53 or 54 seats. So we are seeing a change there.  But let us assume that there was tranquillity and there was no problem between the United States and the former Soviet Union, as we talked about, during the cold war. The threat was there. I have always contended that the threat during the cold war was not as great as the threat is now because at least we could identify who enemy was at that time. We had the Soviet Union and we had the United States. We had at that time a treaty, an ABM Treaty, and said that we were going to agree to downgrade our nuclear capability. That was called mutually assured destruction. ``You shoot at us. We shoot back at you. Everyone dies, and everybody is happy.'' That is no longer the case. I did not agree with the policy. That was not a Democratic policy. It came under Nixon and Kissinger. That did not make any sense. Butthere were those who did believe it was worthwhile. I talked to Kissinger about it. He said, ``It's nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' That is what we have done. So here we are out there adhering to a policy through START II, which in my interpretation puts us back with the ABM Treaty where we are downgrading our nuclear capability with one other nation while the rest of the 25 or so rogue nations are increasing their nuclear capability.  So I think that we do not address that in this. We should be addressing that in this authorization bill. But I know what would happen if we did. We would not get it passed and the President would veto it because he said that he would.  So I say, Mr. President, that this bill does not go far enough. We have real serious problems today. During the Persian Gulf war we had 26 divisions. We are going to be down to 15 divisions with this. I think that it is a very serious threat. We are right now No. 9, as I understand it, in ground forces, having been passed by Pakistan.  So America is not at the strength level that America should be. While I say that, I am supporting this bill because it is the only dog in the fight. We need to have an authorization bill. I support this.  Since the beginning of our country's history, national security has been the most solemn obligation our Government holds with its citizens. In order to honor this obligation, top priority must be given to the forces that guarantee our national security. These forces do not ask much of us for their service. But they do need a certain amount of support from their Government in order to carry out their duties and protect the security of the United States as well as maintain our status as the world's preeminent military power.  However, in order to allow our military to honor their sworn duty, we have to provide them with the means to do many things. We must give them the authority to retain ample manpower in the form of adequate end strengths. Our military must have the means to recruit high-quality personnel to carry us into the 21st century. In addition, in order to keep our high-quality personnel, and protect their quality of life which is so important in maintaining morale, we must provide them with equitable pay and benefits--including a 3-percent pay raise to protect against inflation--and appropriate levels of funding for the construction and maintenance of troop billets and military family housing.  We must keep the battle sword sharp by providing enough resources to maintain readiness and continue modernization efforts to provide the capabilities needed for future wars. Our military must also be given the means to field the type and quantity of weapons systems and equipment needed to fight and win battles decisively, with minimal risk to our troops, just as they did in the gulf war.  Another important lesson learned in the gulf war was that we need to be able to protect our troops from ballistic missiles, missiles that are capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Whether it is nuclear, chemical, or biological, we must protect our forces while they are in the field and we must protect their families at home. The way we do this is through the development and deployment of missile defense systems: land and sea-based theater missile defense systems, which can protect United States and allied forces against cruise and ballistic missiles while deployed in the field; and a national missile defense system to defend American families at home. We will have a ballistic missile defense, it will either be before--or after--we first need it.  I have spoken about what we must provide for our military, now I would like to point out what we can take away. To begin with, we can eliminate defense spending that does not contribute directly to the national security of the United States; such as policing of the Olympic Games. More importantly, we should stand back and evaluate U.S. involvement in nontraditional military operations, and its impact on combat readiness, budgeting, and our national interests. Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti; these and other police actions continue to drain defense funds and put a strain on personnel who are already being stretched beyond their breaking point--the breaking point that our military as a whole is rapidly approaching. Bosnia alone is going to cost American taxpayers $3 billion in defense dollars.  Some people never seem to see a breaking point, however. They say we are spending enough on defense. Some say that we are spending far more money on defense than other countries.  Well--of course we spend more money on defense than other countries. In fact, in 1996 the United States will spend three times as much on defense as any other country on Earth, and more than all its prospective enemies and neutral nations combined.  There are two problems with this comparison, however: it assumes that all countries are equal, and it suggests that the comparison between how much the United States spends versus other nations is a legitimate measure of which side will prevail in a conflict. But because of geography, all things aren't equal. We are separated from our potential enemies by two great oceans. And rather than fighting wars in our own backyard, Americans prefer to fight ``over there.'' Because we prefer to fight abroad, it will naturally cost us much more than it costs our enemies to field the same force, since we have to transport, sustain and operate our fighting force in a place where his already is. Each of these activities--moving, sustaining and fighting far away--increases the cost of our military without significantly changing the friendly-to-enemy force ratio. This cost is raised further if we want to field a force that is not just equivalent to our enemy's, but one that can defeat his force, again, with minimal casualties as in the gulf war. The question, therefore, is not whether we will be paying more for our armed forces than our enemy does, but rather how much more we must pay. Is the right number three times as much, as with Russia, or more?  More than 2,000 years ago, Sun Tzu said you should have five times the strength of an enemy to assure success. Well, there have been some changes in warfare since Sun Tzu's time. We now have tanks, and planes, and submarines, so the ratio has changed a little. And we can stand here and argue till we are blue in the face over what the proper force level is; two times, three times, five times as much as the other guy. But the cost of our unique geography makes any comparison between what we pay and what our enemies pay irrelevant. The point is: if you want to fight, ``over there,'' and win, decisively, with minimal losses, then you can expect to pay many times what the enemy pays for his military.  Now, the people who complain that we spend three times as much on defense as any other country on Earth are smart people. They know that we must cross our oceans to fight. They know that what we consider defense spending may not be what our enemies consider defense spending: First, there is the high cost of our high-quality volunteer military: recruiting, paying, providing medical care and retirement. Many people do not realize it, but two-thirds of our defense budget is spent on paying people. Then there is the cost of supporting our worldwide surveillance network, our nuclear deterrent and so on. They know these costs are unique to the United States but they choose to ignore it in their arguments. Why? Because it supports their view of proper levels of defense spending.  We can disagree on what it takes to field a given capability, but let us drop these invalid comparisons and let us deal with the facts. And with the facts in hand, let us spend no more than necessary to get the job done, and let us spend enough to fight, ``over there,'' and win, decisively, with minimal losses.  In this regard, I have to say I was disappointed by the administration's budget request for 1997 defense spending. The administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request was $18.6 billion less in real terms than the level enacted for fiscal year 1996. Now, let me put that another way; in real terms, since the end of WWII, there have only been 5 years that the United States has spent less than the Clinton administration is recommending for fiscal year 1997. Only in fiscal year 1947, fiscal year 1948, fiscal year 1949, fiscal year 1950, those years immediately following WWII, and fiscal year 1955 immediately after the Korean War, has defense spending been so low that it is lessthan the President's recommendation for this year. Not even during the hollow force years of the 70's have we spent so little on defense. Clearly, it is time that we address these shortcomings.  As we prepare to vote on the fiscal year 1997 defense bill, it should come as no surprise, that I am truly concerned about the effects that decreasing levels of defense spending have had upon our Armed Forces. If the general public fully understood the severity of defense cuts under the Clinton administration, I believe that they would also be very concerned. In my State of Oklahoma, I have heard this message already. We can see the cuts all around us and it is time to put these reckless defense cuts to an end. History has demonstrated that superpower status cannot be sustained cheaply, nor can it be sustained by budget requests which do not provide for adequate funding of our forces. I am committed to maintaining America's superpower status. However, I am skeptical about the administration's commitment to this goal.  Right now our military--the finest fighting force on this Earth--is being torn in two directions. Our spending on defense is decreasing, while at the same time, the demands on our personnel are increasing. We are stretching the rubber band tighter and tighter, and if defense funding levels do not increase, I fear the rubber band will break and this dangerous combination may result in an exodus of high quality, trained-personnel and, ultimately, a military crises.  It is our duty, as Senators of the United States, to do our part in providing for our national security. In doing our part, we must vote for a defense bill which gives our military the means to do their part. Our forces do not ask much of us for their service, but they do need a certain amount of support from their Government in order to carry out their duties and protect the security of the United States of America.  I feel it is time we take a more responsible approach to defending this Nation, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 1997 DOD authorization and its modest increase over the administration request.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, June 5, 1996]               U.S. Informs Bonn of Syrian Toxic-Gas Unit       Bonn.--Syria is building a poison gas factory in the      western city of Aleppo that could constitute a major threat      to Israel's national security, a German magazine reported      yesterday.       The weekly Stern said U.S. intelligence officials had      passed on satellite photographs of the plant to their German      counter-parts, who were checking if any Germans were      involved.       In a report released ahead of publication today, Stern said      the plant was similar to one in Tarhunah, Libya. The United      States says that complex is a chemical weapons factory; Libya      says it is an irrigation plant.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Times, June 5, 1996]              Iraqi Opposition Tells of Talks in Damascus       London.--A prominent Iraqi businessman with close ties to      the regime of his president, Saddam Hussein, is in Damascus      to discuss future cooperation between Syria and Iraq, an      Iraqi opposition group reported yesterday.       Sattam Kaoud, who heads the Jordanian Iman company and      oversees other companies owned by Saddam's son Uday, arrived      in Damascus June 1 and is staying at the Meridien Hotel      there, according to the Iraqi Broadcasting Corp. (IBC), run      by the umbrella Iraqi National Congress.       Mr. Kaoud's trip was arranged by a man named Mishaan      Jibouri, who is also in Damascus, the IBC said. It did not      provide details on Mr. Jibouri's identity, but other Iraqi      opposition sources say he attended an Iraqi opposition      conference in Syria this year.       Mr. Jibouri and Mr. Kaoud have discussed the possibility of      reopening the Iraqi-Syrian border, the IBC said. Iraq, which      has been under international sanctions since its 1990      invasion of Kuwait, reached agreement last month with the      United States to resume limited oil sales to buy humanitarian      supplies.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Times, June 13, 1996]                U.S. Investigates Ukraine-Libya Alliance       The State Department is investigating reports that Ukraine      and Libya are working on a strategic alliance that could      involve the transfer of weapons technology to the pro-     terrorist regime in Libya, a department spokesman said.       ``We're looking into it. We take it seriously,'' spokesman      Nicholas Burns said in response to a report of the Ukrainian-     Libya cooperation in Monday's editions of The Washington      Times.       Mr. Burns said the Clinton administration believes Ukraine      will honor existing U.S. sanctions against Libya, but it will      continue to watch the Libyan government to ensure it is not      acquiring weapons technology.                                                                    ____                       [From the Washington Post]               Report Cites China-Pakistan Missile Links                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)       A new, draft U.S. government report states that all      intelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that      Pakistan has obtained medium-range ballistic missiles made by      China, and says for the first time that Pakistan probably has      finished developing nuclear warheads for these missiles, U.S.      officials said yesterday.       The classified report's unanimous reaffirmation of a long-     standing intelligence conclusion that complete Chinese M-11      missiles are in Pakistan puts additional pressure on the      Clinton administration to consider imposing tough economic      sanctions against both nations, as required under a U.S. law      aimed at punishing the global spread of such missiles, the      officials said.       In the past, U.S. policymakers have repeatedly said that      while components of the M-11 missiles may be in Pakistan,      Washington lacks concrete evidence that the complete missiles      are there. As a result, these policymakers have said,      Washington need not invoke the law and cut off U.S.      government contracts with China, halt licenses for U.S.      exports to China or ban Chinese imports worth up to several      billion dollars.       But with the imminent completion of the new report, which      updates a U.S. intelligence assessment on the issue that was      prepared in 1994, policymakers may have a tougher time      fending off calls by many proliferation experts, intelligence      analysts and certain lawmakers to acknowledge publicly that      the M-11 missiles are in Pakistan.       Details of the draft report are emerging at a sensitive      moment in U.S.-Chinese relations, as administration officials      are conducting final negotiations with Beijing regarding      possible sanctions against China for copying U.S. commercial      goods. The administration is also defending a decision by      President Clinton to renew the most-favored-nation trading      status that allows Chinese goods to be imported with low U.S.      tariffs.       The refusal of top policymakers to accept the intelligence      community's judgment regarding the presence of the M-11      missiles, as well as its recent decision not to impose      sanctions against China for selling nuclear weapons-related      equipment to Pakistan, has rankled certain U.S. officials who      favor a much tougher policy toward China. This      dissatisfaction has helped fuel a series of leaks about      Chinese wrongdoing over the years.       The first U.S. intelligence report regarding the M-11s was      leaked in 1992. Last July, the Washington Post quoted      Intelligence officials as saying that more than 30 of the      missiles were stored in crates at Pakistan's Sargodha Air      Force Base west of Lahore.       Several U.S. officials said yesterday that is where the      entire intelligence community believes the missiles remain.      But they added that a sharp dispute has broken out within the      community over whether the missiles should nonetheless be      described in the new report as ``operational,'' a term that      would raise policy alarms in Washington and upset the Indian      government.       Yesterday's Washington Times reported the existence of the      new draft report and first described the dispute about its      contents.       Representatives of the CIA and the Defense Intelligence      Agency, in particular, have argued that because a unit of the      Pakistani army has been assigned to operate the missiles and      has been trained by Chinese experts, the missiles can      probably be withdrawn from their crates and deployed in the      field within a matter of days.       The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research      (INR), alone among U.S. intelligence agencies, has argued to      the contrary that not enough information is known about      Pakistani training practices to reach this judgment. The      missiles cannot be considered operational until they have      actually been withdrawn from the crates and been used in such      training--and act that has not yet occurred, the bureaus has      argued.       ``There is nothing new on this issue [of missile      operations],'' said one policymaker. That means ``it is kind      of a semantic question,'' rather than an act reflecting a      shift in Pakistani military strategy or security policy.       A similar dispute has broken out over the draft report's      new conclusion that ``it is probable'' Pakistani weapons      engineers have completed the arduous task of creating nuclear      warheads compact enough to fit atop the missiles.       Several officials said this conclusion is derived from an      estimate of how long Pakistan has been trying to complete      this task and certain information about the sophistication of      its weapons designs. But INR analysts have argued to the      contrary that the effort cannot be considered successful      until the warhead has been flight-tested--an act that again      has not yet occurred.       Officials said the final wording of the report is to be      decided by CIA Director John M. Deutch, after further      drafting by the Weapons and Space Systems Intelligence     Committee, a little-known panel that includes representatives      of all U.S. intelligence agencies as well as officials from      Australia, Canada and Britain, Australia and Canada have      sided with INR in concluding the M-11s are not yet      ``operational'' and that Pakistan might not yet have      completed the requisite nuclear warheads.
