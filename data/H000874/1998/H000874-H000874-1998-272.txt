I thank him for his work. I agree that all of us together need to heighten expectations. I frankly think what happened in the 1970s, inthe 1960s in particular was that we lowered expectations of performance of ourselves and of others and somehow society did not feel it incumbent upon them to hold others accountable for that which they ought to be responsible for. I think this is one example, but it is a broader example than that. I frankly think under the gentleman's leadership, frankly I think under President Clinton's leadership in terms of talking about responsibility which he talked about in 1992 and which we followed through in this Congress, I think we are seeing much better performance, but we need to do much more. I thank the gentleman for his remarks and his leadership.
