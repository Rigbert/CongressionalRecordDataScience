President, before my friend and colleague leaves, we have worked together for years, and I respect very much his legislative capability. He and I are working together on some very important legislation.  I am not a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I don't know if the Senator from Iowa is a member--he is not. This is a subject matter that is in the jurisdiction of that committee.  Let me just concede at the outset that reporting 174,000 names to the FBI goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far. We need to find a reasonable way to identify those suffering from serious mental illness who would endanger themselves, their families, or others and to sort out those who don't fit in that category. We can do that and we should do that in a reasonable way, so we are respectful of veterans and also respectful of the general public's right to be safe from the misuse of firearms.
