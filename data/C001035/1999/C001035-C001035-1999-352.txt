President, I rise today to join Senator Snowe in offering a resolution congratulating the University of Maine Men's Ice Hockey team, who, as many of my colleagues know, won the 1999 NCAA Division I Hockey Championship earlier this year.  Like all who watched the thrilling championship game on April 3, I was on the edge of my seat when Marcus Gustafsson scored the game-winning goal to give the Black Bears a heart-stopping 3-2 overtime victory over the University of New Hampshire Wildcats. This incredible victory gave the Black Bears their second national championship in seven years--and nearly gave me a heart attack. I must say, had the game not been as close as it was, I would have been able to relax a bit more that night. But as any sports fan knows, a close game--particularly a game that is won in overtime--is all the more rewarding, and much more befitting as the crowning achievement of a national champion.  In Maine, where we take our sports seriously despite not having any major league sports teams, the Black Bears are a tremendous source of pride. As anyone traveling on the Maine Turnpike can tell you, signs that once welcomed you to ``Vacationland'' now welcome you to the home of the NCAA Hockey Champions. This year the Black Bears once again earned our admiration with an impressive record of 31 wins, 6 losses, and 4 ties. Also, they repeatedly wowed the faithful Maine fans by winning all but one game on their home ice--the beloved Alfond Arena.  Throughout the season, the players and coaching staff all showed tremendous dedication and heart, and their ability to work together as a team was second to none. They advanced boldly through the NCAA tournament, beating Boston College in overtime at the ``Frozen Four,'' and ultimately earned the right to play in the championship game against the University of New Hampshire Wildcats--a team that had beaten the Black Bears twice earlier in the season. Not to be denied, the Black Bears persevered and beat the Wildcats when it mattered the most.  True to form for any national championship team, the Black Bears have a tremendous amount of talent. Four Maine men were selected in this year's National Hockey League draft, and I suspect that several more of their teammates will eventually join them in playing professional hockey. What made this team great, however, was its strong determination, its ability to work together, and its perseverance. It is these qualities that produce championships, and they are qualities that will continue to serve these fine young men very well--both on and off the ice.  Since winning the championship, the Black Bears have enjoyed a substantial amount of much-deserved recognition. I was proud to be among those fans who were on hand to welcome the victorious team home, and I was also pleased to speak at an awards dinner in the team's honor. Soon, Maine's players and coaches will be honored by the President at the White House. Therefore, I believe it is altogether fitting and proper that the Senate add its voice, and recognize the Black Bears' accomplishments, by adopting the resolution that I so proudly offer with Senator Snowe. While the Senate chamber may not be Alfond Arena, it is most appropriate that I close my remarks with the chant, ``M-A-I-N-E Gooooooo Blue!''  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
