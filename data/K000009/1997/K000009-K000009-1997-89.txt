Chairman, if I might reclaim my time, I think the GAO was very clear in the analysis that they did on an objective basis, and there are serious questions about who is making money.  I think the taxpayers of our country would be pretty upset if they knew that they were paying for commissions to the private sector. That is not quite the way they think it is supposed to work. They do not understand a lot of the details about what crop insurance is all about, but the point is that it is not a program that has a terrific reputation and, therefore, we were trying to be fair.  We did meet the requirements of the Department of Agriculture. They asked for $154 million. We passed that at the subcommittee level. When it went to the full committee, all of a sudden some of the powers that be, the ones that like making those bigger commissions, made their weight felt.  I think the gentleman from Wisconsin has a responsible amendment. He represents a very agricultural State, as do I. We have seen abuses in this program, and this is a way of sending a very strong message that we are not going to overly reward those who are performing this service.
