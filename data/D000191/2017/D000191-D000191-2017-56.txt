Speaker, I rise today to recognize University of Oregon Assistant Vice President and University Registrar Sue Eveland who is retiring after fourteen years of service to the university.  Ms. Eveland has been an invaluable member of the UO community since she was first hired in 2001 and subsequently with her appointment as the Interim University Registrar in 2008 and later University Registrar.  During this time, Ms. Eveland also served as President of both the Pacific Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (PACRAO) and the Oregon Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (OrACRAO), demonstrating her commitment not only to University of Oregon faculty, students and staff, but also to her colleagues nationwide. Prior to her career at the University of Oregon, Ms. Eveland spent 17 years at Iowa State University, serving in various roles in the Offices of Admissions and the Registrar.  Colleagues report that Ms. Eveland has shown herself to be innovative and effective, bringing opportunities for staff development, growth and collaboration into each of her roles. Alongside her team at the UO, she was able to implement online grading, online course evaluations, an online graduation application and a schedule builder, among other efficiencies. Her work has continually simplified and improved the lives of the students she serves. Her colleagues say she encourages her staff to keep perspective, remain positive, be creative and have fun.  Sue Eveland retires from the University of Oregon having dedicated nearly two decades to improving services for students. I join with the University of Oregon in recognizing Sue Eveland for her contributions to higher education, and I congratulate her for her many years of exemplary service.                          ____________________
