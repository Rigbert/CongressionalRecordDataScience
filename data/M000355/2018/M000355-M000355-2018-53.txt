 President, earlier this year the Knott County, KY, community lost a beloved member with the passing of Burl Bowen at the age of 98.  Born in Wheelwright, Burl grew up in southeastern Kentucky and later joined the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant trees in the region. Like so many of his generation, Burl earned his place in the ``greatest generation'' by serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. He carried his patriotism and love for his country throughout the rest of his career and his life, inspiring those around him. Burl spent a number of years in Detroit, working in a steel mill and operating a barber shop. He returned to Kentucky upon his retirement with his wife Anita.  Later in his life, Burl made a particularly large impact on the young men of the Knott County Central High School's basketball team. Known as the team's No. 1 fan, Burl could always be found in the front row of the stands cheering on his team. He was 95 when the team won the 14th region championship, and Burl proudly climbed the ladder to help cut down the net. At his funeral, the players paid their respects by serving as Burl's pallbearers.  Along with the Knott County community, Elaine and I send our condolences to Anita, their family, and allwho loved Burl. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in paying tribute to such a remarkable Kentuckian.                          ____________________
