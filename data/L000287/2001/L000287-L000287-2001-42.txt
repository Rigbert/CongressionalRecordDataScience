Mr. Speaker, let me just thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my friend, my colleague, my brother, and thank the gentleman and his wife for making the trip. It is my hope and my prayer that we will continue, all of us, to work together to make real the very essence of our democracy, the idea of one person, one vote, not only that people must have a right to vote but also have their vote counted.                          ____________________
