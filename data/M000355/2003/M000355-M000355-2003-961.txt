 President, as I said earlier, looking at the remainder of the week, in addition to the energy bill, the Senate may begin consideration of any of the following items tomorrow: State Department reauthorization bill, the air cargo security bill, the FAA reauthorization bill, the NATO expansion treaty, as well as any additional nominations that can be cleared. Therefore, Members should anticipate rollcall votes during tomorrow's session. I encourage all of our Members to plan for a very busy week with votes possible each day.                          ____________________
