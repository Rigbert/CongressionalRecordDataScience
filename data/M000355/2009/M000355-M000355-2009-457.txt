 President, let me briefly echo the remarks of the majority leader and congratulate Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg and say we have a lot of freshmen Senators. You probably think this is a tough day. I might mention to you, this is one of the least tough budget days we have had in the time that I have been here. I think I see the Vice President smiling. He would agree with that.  That is a tribute largely to Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad. Thank you so much for an excellent job.
