 Three heroes were lost when a medical helicopter came down in the parking lot of Paces Creek Elementary School outside the town of Manchester on June 6 of this year. Crewmembers Eddy Sizemore, the pilot, Herman ``Lee'' Dobbs, the flight paramedic, and Jesse Jones, the flight nurse, sadly died in this crash.  The crew of this medical helicopter was returning back to their Manchester base after transporting a patient in urgent need of care to a hospital in London, KY. Medical helicopters help transport patients in remote areas to hospitals where they can receive all necessary medical attention. Sadly, these three crewmembers who worked to save others' lives lost their own.  Pilot Eddy Sizemore was 61 years old and a native of Laurel County, KY. He was a former chief deputy in the Laurel County Sheriff's Office. He worked most of his life in law enforcement, and was a veteran of the U.S. Army; he served his country in Vietnam and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. He is remembered by his three daughters, Stacey Johnson, Kacey Bolton, and Jessica Sizemore; his son, Justin Sizemore; his father, Frank Sizemore; his brother, Jerry Sizemore; the mother and stepmother of his children, Pam Brock Sizemore; 10 grandchildren; and many other family members and friends.  Flight paramedic Herman ``Lee'' Dobbs, of London, KY, was 40 years old. He had worked for Knox County EMS and had a love of horses that led to his being put in charge of a horseback search unit for the Knox County Special Operations Response Team. He is remembered by his wife, Emilee Dobbs; his parents, Herman Dobbs and Patsy Light Dobbs; his children, Jordan, Hayden, and Walker Dobbs; his sister, Lori Crawford; his brother, Chad Dobbs; his aunt, Sherri Blakely; his uncle, Dale Light; his mother-in-law, Candace Hutton; and many other family members and friends.  Flight nurse Jesse Jones was 28 and from Bell County, KY. He graduated from Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College as a registered nurse in 2007 and then pursued his dream of becoming a flight nurse. He is remembered by his grandparents, Mac and Ruby Jones; his son, Tyson Lee Jones; his father, Eddie Gene Jones; his stepmother, Patricia Maye Jones; his brother, Wiley Gene Jones; and many other family members and friends.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that was published recently in a southeastern Kentucky publication describing the very moving memorial service held for the three crewmembers of the tragic Air Evac 109 flight be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Whitley County Times-Tribune, June 17, 2013]                      ``God Speed and Blue Skies''                      Air Evac 109 Crew Remembered                            (By Jeff Noble)       Corbin.--After the funerals of three of their crew members      last week, it was time for Air Evac Lifeteam to remember Eddy      Sizemore, Jesse Jones and Lee Dobbs.       On Saturday morning the company did just that, during an      emotional and moving memorial service in London.       Outside the North Laurel High School Gymnasium, the weather      was sunny and the skies blue, when an estimated 300 persons--     including the families of the three who died, as well as Air      Evac crews and first responders from Kentucky and other      states as far away as Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota and North      Carolina--came to say goodbye to their brothers who paid the      ultimate price while doing their duty.       For all of them, the memory of what happened on that late      Thursday night, June 6, will forever be seared in their      hearts and minds.       Sizemore was the pilot. Jones was the flight nurse. Dobbs      was the flight paramedic. All three died when their medical      helicopter crashed in the parking lot of Paces Creek      Elementary School in Clay County, just about 150 yards from      the helipad where the crew is based in Manchester.       For the crews, it was their time to mourn. To persevere.      And to have closure.       It was Pastor Donald Sims, of the City of Hope Community      Fellowship in Manchester, whose opening prayer began the      memorial service.       ``Lord, be with the families, their friends, and bring      hope, healing and comfort to all who are here,'' he prayed.       From the St. Louis suburb of O'Fallon, Missouri, came Air      Evac Lifeteam's president, Seth Myers. He was the first      speaker at the service, and told the audience and his      employees, ``It with a heavy heart that I stand here. To      honor the life of Eddy Sizemore, Lee Dobbs and Jesse Jones.''       He spoke of the three who perished, and spoke of the many      first responders who came to pay their respects.       ``I see uniforms of all colors. They all represent one      thing. That's the dedication to serve others. The attendance      today is a testament of these three people who served. They      loved doing what they did, and the crews working with them.      They helped to save lives and make a difference in peoples'      lives. They're gone from us today, but they'll never be      forgotten,'' Myers said.       He then read a letter from a woman, thanking the crews for      their service.       ``I can't imagine the emotions at this time, but you will      work as a team and persevere . . . For Eddy, Lee and Jesse,      their impact lives on in the life of every person they saved      . . . I challenge you to move forward. A Japanese proverb      said, `Fall down seven times, stand up eight.' Signed, Mandy      Curley,'' the letter said.       Eulogies were given for all three members of the helicopter      crew by friends and family. Eddy Sizemore was remembered      first.       ``My definition of a hero is someone laying down their life      helping someone they don't know. All three of those men did.      I'm alive and able to stand on this stage today, because of      Eddy's experience as a helicopter pilot. Eddy saved my      life,'' said Officer Chuck Johnson of the Laurel County      Sheriff's Department.       Johnson recalled riding with Sizemore as a spotter during a      marijuana search in 2005 when both worked together with the      sheriff's office. They were in the air when the chopper hit      guy wires, then plunged to earth, hit the ground and skidded      96 feet on the blacktop. Johnson said it was Sizemore's      skills, and cool in the hot seat, that brought the chopper      down safely.       ``I believe that God has a plan of a mission of all of us      here on Earth. On that day, our mission wasn't finished. On      June 6th, Eddy's mission was complete, and he was called      home,'' he pointed out.       There was another side to Sizemore. A lighter side that      permeated the workplace, and gave Johnson and his co-workers      a wealth of what he affectionately called ``Eddy Stories.''       ``He loved to sit and laugh and loved to cut up with us.      Eddy loved to keep people entertained. He also liked to cheat      at playing Rook during our times we worked the night shift      years ago with the Sheriff's Office . . . Eddy always had our      back. All of us who worked with him will continue to mourn.      There was only one Eddy Sizemore,'' Johnson said.       Kathy Guyn spoke next. She remembered when Jesse Jones was      in her nursing classes at the Pineville campus of Southeast      Community and Technical College.       ``He was the type of student everyone liked. Fun-loving,      and had a good time. Jesse was very intelligent. He wanted to      be a nurse. He made his patients feel very important, and      that they were the most important person in the hospital. He      loved to hunt. On more than one occasion he would remind me      and the other teachers that it was the beginning of deer      season. And he loved his family, especially his grandparents.      When he graduated, he told me he wanted to be a flight nurse.      He was meant to be in the skies. If I needed a flight nurse,      I would want Jesse Jones, because I know he was the best,''      she stated.       Eliza Brooks started her nursing career with Jones at      Pineville Community Hospital. She also spoke on behalf of      Jesse's family.       ``He had an eagerness to learn more. My husband also worked      at the hospital, and he and Jesse became friends . . . We      would serve lasagna for Jesse every deer season, and on      Christmas, our family had a camouflage stocking for Jesse. To      the family, we want to thank you for sharing Jesse with us.      He loved all of you. He lived life every day to the fullest.      He was always loving, kind and compassionate. He knew what to      do, and never looked back. The sky was not the limit for      Jesse,'' she said, holding back tears.       Letch Day, of Air Methods Corporation, gave the first of      two eulogies for Lee Dobbs, the last of the crew of three      that Day called ``Our fallen heroes, our fallen brothers.''       ``To know Lee was an honor. He was a strong-willed person.      EMS was his job. It was his life. It was his passion. The one      letter to describe Lee was `C' character, caring, compassion,      commitment, companion, and childhood hero. His character was      what propelled him to excellence. He loved and cared for his      family. And he cared for his family and others with      compassion and commitment. He was to others a companion, and      to his children, a childhood hero to them,'' he said.       Day then looked at Dobbs's three sons and told them, ``Your      Dad. He is a hero. Don't ever forget that.''       Lee's own father, Herman Dobbs, took the stage next. His      voice cracked as he began to weep, while talking about the      son he lost almost two weeks ago.       ``Knowing Lee as my son, he would have said, Dad, did you      tell the Jones family, and the Sizemore family, I'm sorry for      their loss? They were my partners.' That's what he'd want me      to say. He was my son. We tried to bring him up that way. I'm      just so thankful the Lord gave me a son like that,'' Dobbs      said, his voice choked with emotion.       In the place where the North Laurel High Jaguars held      court, there were three wreaths on the stage--one each for      the three fallen crew members. In the middle of each wreath      was a picture of each of them. On each side of the stage was      a large video screen, which showed pictures and moments of      the lives of Lee, Eddy and Jesse. The seats on the gym floor      were reserved for family members and Air Evac employees. When      the doors opened at 10 a.m. for the service, the seats      quickly filled, with other Air Evac crews and first      responders joining the general public on the home side of the      bleacher seats.       Two Air Methods Corporation employees from Missouri--Ray      Haven and his wife, Veronica--sang the inspirational song ``I      Will Rise.'' Ray played acoustic guitar, while he and      Veronica sang the duet.       Towards the end of the service, three recorded songs were      played over the speakers while the audience watched the      visual montage of the three men they called ``their family.''       One was the song ``You Never Let Go,'' followed by ``Shine      Your Light,'' a tribute to first responders by Robbie      Robertson, a former member of The Band. The set ended with an      encore of ``You Never Let Go.''       When that ended, Brian Jackson, the program director of Air      Evac 109 in Manchester, came to the stage, accompanied by      nine crew members. Some of the crew shared stories and      lighthearted moments about their work with Lee, Jesse and      Eddy.       Several in the audience got some good laughs from the      stories, which a nearby person in the bleacher seats said      they needed.       Jackson told the crews and first responders, ``Thank you      for your prayers and your support during this time. It really      means a lot. We agree. They were brothers to us. They would      want me to tell you, Crawl back on that ambulance. Crawl back      on that truck. Crawl back on that airplane. Do what you do      best.'''       When the Manchester crew finished their final thoughts,      they pinned the wings on the wreaths of Dobbs, Sizemore and      Jones.       Letch Day returned, and presented a framed print in memory      of the three crewmen to the Air Evac 109 base in Manchester.       ``We're asking them to be our `Guardian Angels' in memory      of the job they did so well,'' he said.       Jackson and the base crew proudly accepted the print.       Kentucky state flags were presented to the families of the      three crewmen by Mike Poynter, the state EMS director. Air      Evac Lifeteam flags were also given to the three families, as      were three fire helmets brought to them in memory of their      fathers, by the Manchester Fire Department.       The tones were heard over the speakers, and the Last Call      was given by a dispatcher. When that ended, a piper played      ``Amazing Grace'' on the bagpipes as the color guard left the      gymnasium. And the service ended.       Nearly everyone who attended went outside to wait for an      aircraft flyover. Six helicopters and one airplane hovered      overhead for the next five minutes, each one's pilot and crew      showing in their own way their own respect and honor for      their fallen comrades.       For those up in the air, and on the ground, this past      Saturday was their time to remember.       It's a good bet that many of them will forever remember      those final words when they heard the crew's last call inside      the gymnasium.       ``November One-One-Nine Alpha Echo is out of service. God      speed and blue skies.''                          ____________________
