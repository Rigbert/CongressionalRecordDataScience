 President, I rise today to submit a Resolution congratulating Bosnia and Herzegovina on the tenth anniversary of its recognition by the United States.  During the decade since its recognition, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in overcoming the legacy of the bloody conflict of 1992-95, which was instigated by ultra-nationalist forces and claimed more than two hundred thousand lives and made millions more homeless.  The NATO-led peacekeeping force, known originally as IFOR, now as SFOR, has provided the security umbrella that has allowed the slow, difficult process of reconciliation and democracy-building to take place.  The international community under the direction of a resident High Representative, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, and many individual countries have joined the United States in providing and delivering economic and technical assistance to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Last year for the first time democratic, non-nationalist parties gained control of the national and Federation governments, and the government of the Republika Srpska is considerably more democratic than it was under the infamous Radovan Karadzic.  Elections will be held this coming October, which will determine whether the country will continue on a democratic, multi-ethnic, and free market path. Obviously, it is in the interest of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, and others, that it do so. Equally obviously, it is in the interest of the United States that Bosnia and Herzegovina become a normal, peaceful, democratic country.  My Resolution commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the progress it has made and urges it to take several steps to continue the process. They include: further strengthening of respect for human rights, of the rule of law, and of its free market economy; as rapidly as possible making fully operational all national institutions and state-level governmental bodies mandated by the Dayton Peace Agreement; creating a joint military command as soon as possible; accelerating the return of refugees and displaced persons; and intensifying its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, in particular surrendering to the Court individuals indicted for war crimes.  The stability of the Balkans is essential for European stability. And stability in Europe is of fundamental importance to the United States of America. A peaceful, democratic, multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina can be an important element in the new Balkans.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this Resolution, which makes clear our support for just such a Bosnia and Herzegovina.                          ____________________
