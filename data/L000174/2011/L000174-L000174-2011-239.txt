The vacancy rate--which we reduced from 10 percent to 6 percent by this date in President Bush's third year, and ultimately to less than 4 percent in 2008--is back above 10 percent. Federal judicial vacancies now stand at 93.  Time and time again over the last 2\1/2\ years, I have urged the Senate to come together and work to address this crisis. At the beginning of this year, I called for a return to regular order in the consideration of nominations. We have seen that approach work on the Judiciary Committee. I have thanked the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator Grassley, many times for his cooperation with me to make sure that the committee continues to make progress in the consideration of nominations. His approach has been the right approach. Regrettably, it has not been matched on the floor, where the refusal by Republican leadership to come to regular time agreements to consider nominations has put our progress--our positive action--at risk.  I expect the committee in the weeks ahead to continue to make progress and favorably report superbly qualified, consensus judicial nominations to fill vacancies in States throughout the country, in States with Democratic and Republican Senators. Most of these nominations will, I expect, join the 15 on the calendar after tonight's vote that were reported unanimously. I hope that the Americans in those districts will not have to wait for months for the Senate to act to fill the vacancies and ensure that the Federal courts in their States have the judges they need.  Republican obstruction has led to a backlog of dozens of judicial nominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. Half of the judicial nominations on the calendar would fill judicial emergency vacancies. Many were ready for final consideration and confirmation in May and June.  Republican leadership should explain to the people and Senators from South Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Maine, New York, Texas, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Florida why there continue to be vacancies on the Federal courts in their States that could easily be filled if the Senate would vote on the President's qualified, consensus nominees. Yet those nominees still wait for months on the Senate's calendar. These damaging delays leave the people of these States to bear the brunt of having too few judges available to do the work of the Federal courts.  All 20 of the judicial nominations on the calendar today have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee after a fair but thorough process. We review extensive background material on each nominee. All Senators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, have the opportunity to ask the nominees questions at a live hearing. Senators also have the opportunity to ask questions in writing following the hearing and to meet with the nominees. All of these nominees have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. They should not be delayed for weeks and months needlessly after being so thoroughly and fairly considered by the Judiciary Committee.  I continue to urge the Senate to join together to end the judicial vacancies crisis that concerns Chief Justice Roberts, the President, the Attorney General, bar associations, and chief judges around the country. I hope that this month Senators will finally join together to begin to bring down the excessive number of vacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. We can and must do better. Vacancies are being kept high, consensus nominees are being delayed, and it is the American people and the Federal courts that are being made to suffer.                               Exhibit 1                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 5, 2011]                      Remiss in Confirming Judges                          (By Wade Henderson)       In Ben Pershing's close-to-complete Aug. 2 Fed Page roundup      of the most important stories overshadowed by the debt-     ceiling debate [``Debt debate isn't only story on Capitol      Hill,'' In Session], one story that failed to make the cut      was how the Senate's refusal to vote on 20 judicial nominees      before recess has led to almost as many vacancies on the      federal bench--111--as there were in January.       During the past two months, the Senate Judiciary Committee      has steadily processed nominations, yet the Senate has voted      on a mere nine judges. There is no reason to delay confirming      every one of the nominees pending before the full Senate. All      but one enjoyed strong bipartisan support in committee. In      fact, 17 of the 20 were approved without recorded opposition.       Many of these seats have been designated as ``judicial      emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S.      Courts, meaning there are simply not enough judges to get the      work done. More and more people seeking to protect their      rights in a court of law are forced to wait, and justice      delayed is all too often justice denied.                                  ____                     [From Politico, Aug. 3, 2011]                  It's Senate's Duty To Confirm Judges                  (By Andrew Blotky and Doug Kendall)       While Washington has been consumed by the debt ceiling      crisis, another serious crisis demands the attention of      President Barack Obama and the Senate: the threat to justice      by our overworked federal judiciary.       There aren't enough judges to hear the cases piling up in      federal courtrooms across the country--which for countless      Americans means justice significantly delayed and denied.       Our federal courts, which hear cases brought by ordinary      Americans to vindicate rights guaranteed by the Constitution,      are overworked and understaffed. Today's federal judiciary      resembles our armed forces--     stretched thin and deployed on multiple tours of duty.       There are now almost 90 empty seats on the federal bench,      with 22 more retirements on the way.       Make no mistake, judges now on the bench are doing their      part--and then some. Last month, federal Judge Malcolm Muir      died in his chambers at age 96, while working on Social      Security appeals. Muir had continued to work literally until      his last breath, to reduce the case backlog caused by a judge      shortage. He was the fourth oldest judge on the federal bench      when he died. Last December, U.S. District Judge James F.      McClure Jr. died at age 79--also while working at the      courthouse.       With fewer new judges being confirmed, the third branch of      government is increasingly run by judges working well into      their 80s, 90s and even 100s.       ``The way we are going,'' 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals      Judge Richard Cudahy, age 84, said, ``it looks to me as if      most of the judicial work is going to be done by 80- and 90-     year-olds like me . . . since they will be the only ones left      to do anything.''       There have been at least 80 vacancies on the federal courts      for the past 760 straight days and counting, according to a      recent Constitutional Accountability Center study. At the      same time, only 35 new permanent judgeships have been      authorized by Congress in the past 20 years--even as the      overall federal caseload has expanded by fully a third.       The third branch is deteriorating largely because of      unprecedented Republican obstruction. Senate Republicans      refuse to agree to votes for well-qualified nominees, who      enjoy the unanimous support of their Republican and      Democratic colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee.      Today, 16 such nominees are waiting for a vote by the Senate,      with four more qualified nominees approved by the Judiciary      Committee, and new nominations being added regularly to the      Senate calendar.       Some Republican senators are blocking--or placing holds--on      judicial nominations for reasons unrelated to justice, to      serve their own political interests. Republican senators are      also delaying or blocking nominees who would fill seats in      courtrooms so overwhelmed with cases that they are deemed by      the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to be      ``judicial emergencies.'' It is a level of obstruction not      seen under any previous president in U.S. history.       Again, numbers tell the story. The glacial pace of judicial      confirmations has seen the number of judicial vacancies      explode from 55, when Obama took office, to 88 today. By this      time in the Bush administration, the Senate had confirmed 40      percent more judges than it has during the Obama      administration.       Astonishingly, in the past two months, the Senate has voted      on just 11 nominations. The chamber could have easily      confirmed judges while awaiting a final debt ceiling deal.      Instead Republicans blocked, stalled and delayed.       The Senate has now recessed for a month, yet the work of      the courts continues.       When judicial vacancies remain at such record levels,      needless delays create a crisis that has drawn concern from      all corners--including Chief Justice John Roberts, Attorney      General Eric Holder, federal judges around the country and      bar associations.       The Senate is failing in one of its key constitutional      duties. It is preventing the third branch of government from      doing its job--and making it impossible for Americans to have      their cases heard in a timely fashion.       The solution is simple. With no Supreme Court nomination      battle consuming Washington this fall, there are no excuses.      The Senate should vote on these waiting nominees at the      earliest possible moment when it returns from its August      recess.       It is time for the Senate to do what the Constitution      commands--advise and consent to the nomination of qualified      judges. The long-term health of the third branch of      government depends on it--and so do the American people.
