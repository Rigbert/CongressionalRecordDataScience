 From day one of this season, the 49'ers were picked by many as the team to beat. Assembled from a corps of seasoned veterans and prime talent developed within, the 49'ers had but one goal: beat Dallas and win the Super Bowl. After overcoming a number of early season injuries, the team finished with the best record in the league. they moved past the Chicago Bears in the first round of the playoffs, and realized part one of their goal with a hard-earned victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Now, they go into Miami as a heavy favorite, hoping to win an unprecedented fifth Super Bowl. I would like to know if my colleague also feels that this is a wonderful matchup?
