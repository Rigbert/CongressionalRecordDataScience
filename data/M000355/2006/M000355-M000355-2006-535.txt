 President, today we will have a period of morning business until 11 a.m. At 11, we will resume consideration of the flag antidesecration resolution, which we began debate on yesterday. The time until 2:15 will be for debate only on the flag resolution.  Under the order from last night, we have controlled time, and Senators who would like to speak should consult with the managers and get in the queue.  Also, today we will recess for the weekly policy luncheons from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. We will announce the voting schedule later today. However, we will not have any votes scheduled prior to the recess for the policy luncheons.                          ____________________[Page S6499]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
