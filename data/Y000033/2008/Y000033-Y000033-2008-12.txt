Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This legislation, H.R. 5335, has been explained by the good manager of the bill, and we support the legislation.  I would like to, at this time, acknowledge the bill's author, Congressman Zach Wamp, and of course Congressman Shuler. Both of them have asked me and asked the leadership of the Resources Committee to move this legislation.  I support the legislation because it does recognize the angst of those that marched on this trail. I strongly compliment both of those gentlemen for their hard work.
