 President, on another matter, yesterday the President named Larry Kudlow as the next head of the National Economic Council.  Larry is well known as a happy warrior for pro-growth economics and widely respected for his expertise in fiscal policy. The country will be lucky to have Larry serving in this role. I look forward to continued engagement with the White House team that will now benefit from his insight.  Speaking of highly qualified personnel, here in the Senate yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance Kevin McAleenan's nomination to serve as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This is an essential post, and Mr. McAleenan is an excellent nominee.  I urge everyone to join me in voting for his confirmation when we return on Monday.                          ____________________
