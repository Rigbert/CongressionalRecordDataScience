Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate Congresswoman Musgrave on this bill. H.R. 3299 provides a legislative solution for a number of homeowners in Larimer County, Colorado, who own real property adjacent to the Roosevelt National Forest and have occupied or improved their property in good faith and in reliance on 1975 land surveys.  A recent forest resurvey now claims that a small portion of the Roosevelt National Forest is occupied by these adjacent land owners. This bill conveys approximately seven acres occupied by the affected landowners to those landowners and is long overdue.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
