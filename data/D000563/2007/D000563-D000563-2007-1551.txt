It was an interesting debate, and Senator DeMint and Senator Coburn of Oklahoma offered an amendment.  I felt that amendment had several flaws in it. The purpose of my second-degree amendment is to address those flaws. It does not go to the heart of their argument about expanding the number of earmarks that would be subject to disclosure. In fact, if anything, it expands the number of earmarks subject to disclosure.  My amendment would strengthen the DeMint amendment in three ways: It retains the Reid-McConnell bipartisan language in the underlying bill. The DeMint amendment No. 11 now pending does not go far enough in terms of covering so-called targeted tax benefits. A lot of attention has been given to Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman from California, who was steering Department of Defense funds to certain contractors and benefiting from it personally. He paid dearly for this transgression and is currently in prison. That is an example of an egregious abuse of the appropriations process.  We understand, as well, there are decisions made by Congress outside of the appropriations process which can be just as beneficial, if not more profitable, to individuals and businesses. One of the categories would be in the area of targeted tax credits. However, it could be others, as well.  Even though my amendment does not go to this issue, consider the fact that the asbestos legislation pending before Congress 2 years ago would have benefited one of the corporations from Illinois to the tune of $1 billion had it passed. That figure was arrived at not by myself or anyone in Congress but, rather, by those who filed the annual report for that corporation. So you can understand that decisions made in the Senate and the House of Representatives can have a direct positive financial impact on businesses and individuals.  As we go after earmarks and try to change those because of the Duke Cunningham scandal and others, we should also be mindful of the fact that other decisions made by Congress can be just as beneficial, if not more so. They cry for transparency, too. Unfortunately, the underlying DeMint amendment has a restrictive view of targeted tax credits.  The Senator from South Carolina has said he has agreed to language considered by the House. In all honesty, as good as they are in the House of Representatives, what I am offering may be an improvement. Senator DeMint's amendment covers revenue-losing provisions only that provide tax benefits to 10 or fewer beneficiaries or contain eligibility criteria that are not the same for other potential beneficiaries. This unnecessarily limits the definition of revenue-losing provisions instead of all revenue provisions. My amendment corrects this.  The DeMint amendment also allows for a loophole. Someone could easily write a provision that affects 11, 15, or 50 beneficiaries and be exempt from the disclosure requirements of the DeMint amendment. The Reid-McConnell definition, which I include in my second-degree amendment, says a tax earmark is anything which has the practical effect of providing more favorable tax treatment to a ``limited group'' of taxpayers when compared with similarly situated taxpayers. We do not come up with a number--10 beneficiaries, 20 beneficiaries--but, rather, keep it in the category of a tax benefit that is clearly designed to help a limited group of taxpayers of a certain number compared with others. This is a more flexible and more realistic standard to be applied than the language currently in the DeMint bill.  Moreover, the Reid-McConnell language is for the language that they, in fact, created. It is language that Senator Judd Gregg, former chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, included in his line-item veto bill. Senator Gregg has found what I think is a sensible definition we ought to use and adopt as part of our reform and ethics changes we are currently debating. My amendment retains the concept of Reid-McConnell language, amends the DeMint provision to remove the limitation of ``10 or fewer beneficiaries'' and would cover ``any revenue provision that provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference, to a particular beneficiary or a limited group of beneficiaries.''  Finally, under the DeMint amendment, information about earmarks must be posted 48 hours after it is received by the committee. In the case of a fast-moving bill, it is possible that the information would be made public only after a vote on the relevant bill containing the earmarks. So there is a weakness in the DeMint language when it comes to this public disclosure. On the other hand, in the interest of full disclosure, the Reid-McConnell language requires the earmark disclosure information be placed on the Internet, available to the public 48 hours beforeconsideration of the bills or reports that contain the earmarks. Senator DeMint's amendment does not have a similar provision. My amendment retains the stronger Reid-McConnell earmark disclosure language.  These are three important changes necessary to improve the DeMint amendment. As I noted yesterday, there are some positive elements of the DeMint amendment. In some instances it does not go far enough. I question the whole notion that committee report language should be treated the same as bill language. Those who have gone through the basics of legislation understand that bill language can be a law. Committee report language is never going to be a law. It is only a recommendation. Having said that, though, I don't address that issue in any way at all.  I urge my colleagues to support my secondary amendment to the underlying DeMint amendment. I believe it strengthens the DeMint amendment. I urge the DeMint amendment, with these changes, be agreed to, as well.                  Amendment No. 36 to amendment No. 3  At this point I ask unanimous consent to set aside this pending amendment and call up amendment No. 36 which is at the desk.
