Chairman, as my mother, an immigrant from Lithuania, learned as a young girl in East St. Louis, IL, learning English was crucial to success. She became a bilingual translator in court as a young girl, and of course today I have the honor to serve in the House of Representatives as a first-generation American and the son of that Lithuanian immigrant. Every immigrant American that I have met in my life understands one basic fact in this country. Proficiency in English is crucial to success. But this amendment is less about helping Americans, this bill is less about helping Americans to succeed, than it is about pointing out our differences in color and culture and language.                              {time}  1530  This bill is unnecessary and divisive. America is a nation of immigrants. We will not be stronger because of this divisive bill. Support the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Serrano]. Celebrate our diversity. Welcome to those who come to our country to join in our culture, learn our language, and help them succeed.
