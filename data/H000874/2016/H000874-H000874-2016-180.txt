Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of the Hon. Thomas A. Rymer, who passed away on April 15. He was ninety-one years old and had dedicated his career to public service on behalf of the State of Maryland and Calvert County.  I was privileged to be Tom's friend for decades, and I was deeply saddened by his passing. He served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1971-1987 and was Majority Whip for a good portion of that time. During part of that period, I served as President of the Maryland State Senate, and we worked together on a number of occasions. During his tenure, Tom fought for school funding that invested in education for students in Calvert County. He spearheaded efforts to build roads and infrastructure and encourage development in what was then a very rural part of our state. Tom was also a tireless advocate for justice and equal opportunity.  Judge Rymer was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and he moved with his family to Washington, D.C., in 1939. A student at the University of Maryland when World War II broke out, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was commissioned as an Ensign. After serving our nation honorably, he returned stateside and finished his degree at Cornell University in New York in 1948. He then went on to earn his law degree from the George Washington University in 1955.  During the 1950's, Tom worked as an engineer with the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and served in a number of civilian roles with the Navy, Air Force, and Secretary of Defense's office. When he left the Pentagon in 1964, he was serving as chief of the Air Force Military Construction Program.  From 1966-1970, Tom served the people of Calvert County as State's Attorney before running for the House of Delegates. In Annapolis, he chaired the Calvert County delegation and served as Chair of the Tri-County Council for Southern Maryland from 1979-1982. He also Chaired the Joint Ethics Committee. Tom was well respected in the Assembly, lauded for his integrity and honesty and for his mentorship of younger lawmakers. After leaving office, Tom was appointed to sit on the Calvert County Circuit Court. He served until his retirement in 1995.  Mr. Speaker, I extend my condolences to his beloved wife of four decades, Grace Mead Rymer. My thoughts and prayers are also with his sons Gary Rymer, Ronald Rymer, and Thomas Rymer Jr.; his stepchildren, Grace Mary Brady, Robert Manual Garrett, John Michael Garrett, Nell-Marie Chaney, William Francis Garrett, and Allan Garrett; his fifteen grandchildren and step-grandchildren; and his ten great-grandchildren. Sadly, his stepson Thomas Garrett passed away last year. Many of the Rymers and Garretts continue to live in Calvert County, on which their father and stepfather leaves a lasting impact that will surely benefit generations to come. I join in thanking Judge Thomas A. Rymer for his service to Calvert County, to the Fifth District, to the State of Maryland, and to our nation, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.                          ____________________
