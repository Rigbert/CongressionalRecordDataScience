President, while it is true that there was no mention of the 100 arrests in the record of the case, this fact was well known because the Milwaukee Journal ran a story about this the day the defendants were convicted.  As to her claim there was no evidence in the record of the defendant's arrest history, that is just wrong. I reviewed the record of the case and it tells a totally different story than what Justice Sykes told the Senate. There are at least four different references in the record to the defendant's arrest history.  For example, the defendant's sentencing statement said:       I have been in jail before for similar activities to the      one in question before you today.  Another example, a statement by the assistant district attorney at the sentencing hearing. The prosecutor said:       Here there is no evidence that these defendants have made      any effort to conform their conduct to the requirements of      law. Instead, both have been charged since this case has been      pending with additional criminal violations.  The prosecutor noted that:       [defendant Michael] Skott has also engaged in conduct which      has precipitated his arrest and subsequent criminal hearing.  Now, when I asked Justice Sykes in her follow-up written questions to explain the discrepancies between her earlier statements and the actual record in court, she dissembled. She said her definition of ``history of arrests'' did not include arrests that stem from civil violations nor arrests that occurred during the pendency of the case.  These distinctions by Justice Sykes are completely artificial. An arrest is an arrest. But rather than admit she made a mistake in her initial answer, she persisted in her contradictory and confusing portrayal of the case.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my follow-up written questions to Justice Sykes and her written answers.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Additional Questions of Senator Richard J. Durbin to Justice Diane  Sykes, Nominee for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals--April 5, 2004       1. You were the presiding judge in a 1993 abortion case      involving the conviction of two anti-abortion activists,      Michael Skott and Jack Lightner, who were convicted of      disorderly conduct for cementing their legs to a car in order      to block the door to a Milwaukee abortion clinic.       In a previous question I posed to you, I asked why you      called the defendants convicted in this case ``fine      characters'' and ``exemplary citizens'' at their February 9,      1993 sentencing in light of the fact that one defendant had      been arrested 80 times in abortion protests and the other 20      times. Although a January 22, 1993 Milwaukee Journal article      about the defendants' conviction reported that Mr. Skott had      been arrested 80 times in abortion protests and his co-     defendant Jack Lightner had been arrested 20 times, you have      stated that you were unaware of the press reports. You also      stated that, in any event, ``there was no evidence in the      record of a history of arrests in connection with their      protest activity.''       However, a sentencing statement filed with the Court on      February 4, 1993 by one of the defendants, Michael Skott,      indicates otherwise. Mr. Skott wrote: ``Now it is your job as      en elected representative of this county to sentence me,      Judge Skyes. I have been in jail before for similar      activities to the one in question before you today.'' At the      sentencing hearing, held on February 9, 1993, you stated: ``I      have reviewed carefully the sentencing statement by Mr.      Skott.''       Additionally, the Assistant District Attorney stated at the      sentencing hearing: ``Here there is no evidence that these      defendants have made any effort to conform their conduct to      the requirements of law. Instead, both have been charged      since this case has been pending with additional criminal      violations.'' The prosecutor also stated that ``Mr. Skott has      also engaged in conduct which has precipitated his arrest and      subsequent criminal charging under the same--purview of the      same issue,'' and ``I understand and I know that he [Skott]      has been many times found guilty in municipal court and has      on occasion served time in the House of Correction for his      failure to pay fines on commitments.''       A. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no      evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection      with their protest activity'' with Mr. Skott's statement that      ``I have been in jail before for similar activities to the      one in question before you today''?       See below.       B. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no      evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection      with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District      Attorney's statement that ``Here there is no evidence that      these defendants have made any effort to conform their      conduct to the requirements of law. Instead, both have been      charged since this case has been pending with additional      criminal violations''?       See below.       C. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no      evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection      with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District      Attorney's statement that ``Mr. Skott has also engaged in      conduct which has precipitated his arrest and subsequent      criminal charging under the same--purview of the same      issue''?       See below.       D. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no      evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection      with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District      Attorney's statement that ``I understand and I know that he      [Skott] has been many times found guilty in municipal court      and has on occasion served time in the House of Correction      for his failure to pay fines on commitments''?                                 answer       In misdemeanor sentencing hearings in Milwaukee County      Circuit Court during this time period, the prosecutor would      typically advise the court of a defendant's prior criminal      history as a part of the State's sentencing argument and      recommendation. Unlike today, there were no computers on the      bench and judges relied upon the prosecutor to present      evidence of a defendant's prior criminal record at      sentencing. Newspaper articles are outside the record and      therefore not a proper source of sentencing information. A      prior criminal record is an aggravating factor for sentencing      purposes, and the lack of a prior criminal record is      generally considered to be a mitigating factor. As I      indicated in my earlier responses, the prosecutor in this      case took the unusual step of standing silent at sentencing,      making no record of the defendants' history in this regard      and making no sentencing recommendation on behalf of the      State.       After the defense attorneys made their sentencing      arguments, the prosecutor belatedly requested an opportunity      to address the court, which was granted. She stated, ``I can      inform the court I have no knowledge of Mr. Skott having any      prior criminal conviction. I may be incorrect. I understand      and know that he has been many times found guilty in      municipal court and has on occasion served time in the House      of Correction for his failure to pay fines on commitments.      However, I am not aware of any criminal convictions. I see      he's shaking his head no, so that's a correct statement.''      The prosecutor then noted that the other defendant, Mr.      Lightner, had been convicted of two offenses nearly twenty      years before (which, as I indicated in my earlier      responses, was too remote and insignificant to the conduct      before the court to have much bearing upon sentencing),      and had more recently been fined for disorderly conduct      (circumstances unspecified.) The prosecutor did not      mention any history of municipal citations for protest      activity on the part of Mr. Lightner. In his written      sentencing statement Mr. Skott indicated only very      generally that he had been in jail for his protest      activities; as indicated above, he confirmed that the case      before the court constituted his first criminal      conviction.       I concluded from this very generalized record information      that Mr. Skott's prior protest activity had generated only      municipal citations rather than criminal arrests and charges.      Municipal court in Milwaukee handles only local ordinance      matters--traffic tickets and citations for ordinance      violations punishable by civil forfeiture--not state crimes.      Municipal violations are non-criminal and do not ordinarily      involve arrests. Rather, they usually involve the issuance of      a ticket or citation, which requires the defendant's      appearance in municipal court or payment of a forfeiture in      lieu of appearing in court. Occasionally, when a municipal      forfeiture is imposed and remains unpaid, the defaulting      defendant may be ordered to serve a few days in jail on a      ``commitment'' for nonpayment of the forfeiture. The matter      remains civil in nature. Accordingly, having been found      guilty in municipal court and having served time in jail on      municipal ``commitments'' does not equate in our system to      having a history of arrests or criminal convictions. As I      have previously noted, the arrest histories mentioned in the      newspaper article were not part of the sentencing record      before the court.       The prosecutor in this case also made a generalized      statement about a new charge that apparently had been issued      against the defendants for protest-related conduct that      occurred after the case then before the court had been      charged. I did not construe this as a constituting a history      of arrests, although the record reflects that I certainly      took it into consideration for sentencing purposes, together      with the information about the municipal court matters and      the other relevant facts in the record. In my sentencing      remarks I noted that the defendants ``obviously have a      history of this kind of behavior . . . and I need to take      that into consideration.'' I also stated that      ``rehabilitation in the conventional sense in this case is      unlikely to occur. I suppose it is possible that you would      learn a lesson from this case and not continue in these      activities if you view the trial as I do, and that is as      a rejection by the community of these kinds of tactics.''      I concluded that ``[b]ased on the record, however, and      based on what I've heard of your intentions, I don't have      a great deal of confidence that you will take that message      to heart, and my sentence has to reflect that fact.'' As I      indicated in my earlier responses, I imposed a sentence of      60 days in jail, two-thirds of the available maximum. In      light of the record evidence regarding the seriousness of      the offense, the defendants' character and backgrounds,      and the interests of the community, this sentence was      neither too harsh nor unduly lenient.       The trial and sentencing hearing in this case took place      more than 11 years ago. My responses to these and your      earlier questions are based primarily on my review of the      pertinent parts of the case file, most notably the transcript      of the sentencing hearing, a copy of which is enclosed. I      have a generalized independent recollection of this case, but      have relied on the enclosed transcript for the details, and      have attempted to place those details in the context of the      law and general sentencing practices in Wisconsin.       2. In his sentencing statement, Mr. Skott equated abortion      with the Holocaust and slavery, and he called abortion      clinics ``death camps'' where ``a hired killer contracts out      to end what has been labeled a problem.'' At the sentencing      hearing, you told Mr. Skott and his co-defendant that      ``obviously you possess fine characters,'' ``you have      otherwise been exemplary citizens,'' ``your motivations were      pure,'' and ``I do respect you a great deal for having the      courage of your convictions and for the ultimate goals that      you sought to achieve by this conduct.'' Can you understand      why some people would view your favorable comments about the      defendants as a validation of their beliefs?                                 answer       I do not believe that my sentencing remarks, when read in      their entirety and not out of context, could be considered a      ``validation'' of the defendants' beliefs or rhetoric. My      more favorable remarks about the defendants' ``motivations,''      ``courage of conviction'' and ``character'' were not directed      at the validity of their beliefs, but, rather, represented      the legally-required evaluation of the defendants' character      and motivations to determine whether any of the usual      aggravating criminal motivations or background     factors were present in the case. Also, my favorable comment      about the goal the defendants sought to achieve was a      reference to their underlying goal of reducing the number of      abortions, as is clear from the following statement from my      sentencing remarks: ``I think that people on both sides of      the abortion issue would probably agree with you that      reducing the number of abortions in this country is a      desirable goal.'' My sentencing remarks also reflect      extensive consideration of the seriousness of the offense and      criticism of the defendants' conduct and tactics, as I have      previously discussed. My sentencing remarks were fair and      even-handed, and the 60-day jail sentence I imposed, at two-     thirds of the maximum, could not be characterized as unduly      lenient or a ``validation'' of the defendants' beliefs.
