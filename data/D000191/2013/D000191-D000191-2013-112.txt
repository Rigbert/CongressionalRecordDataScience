  Mr. DeFAZIO. Sequester. Well, that's inside-the-Beltway jargon. It means stupid, indiscriminate, across-the-board budget cuts. Cut things that are valuable--Coast Guard Rescue--and cut things that are obsolete and unneeded--registration for a draft that doesn't exist--the same percent.  Now, the Republicans are pointing fingers, but I think the finger's going to get pointed right back at them. They're calling it the ``Obamaquester''? Come on now, you've got to be kidding.  Don't they remember their tax pledge to Grover Norquist that has ever forever bound them to starving the Federal Government of revenue? Now look where that got us, when they threatened to default on the debt. It got us the sequester. They refused to compromise and forced us into another self-made arbitrary crisis.  No, it's not an ``Obamaquester''; it's a ``GroverNorquester.''                          ____________________
