  Now, we both know that we cannot alter--the Senator said it more eloquently than anyone thus far--we cannot alter the Constitution other than by the rules the Constitution sets out.  We will assume for just a moment the distinguished Senator from Kansas, if that is what he decides to do, comes along and says we will pass a resolution promising we will not do that. Is it the understanding of my friend from South Carolina that means, for calculation purposes of what constitutes the deficit, that between now and the year 2000, we will not count the $60 billion surplus this year and the $100 billion surplus in the year 2000, toward reducing the deficit?  Is that what he is going to do?
