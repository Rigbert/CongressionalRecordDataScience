 Coverdell, and Mr. D'Amato):  S. 422. A bill to authorize the appropriations for international economic and security assistance; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.                     foreign aid reform legislation Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it seems to me there are two good reasons for a complete overhaul of foreign aid the world has changed and Congress has changed. The cold war is over replaced by a new, ambitious Russia, a host of violent smaller regimes, ethnic tensions, nuclear concerns, and massive refugee movements affecting even our own borders.  On the bright side, there are former communist nations actively seeking U.S. support, the flourishing of free enterprise and democracy, giant leaps in free trade and real prospects for peace in some of the most war-torn parts of the world.  Since the world has changed so dramatically, our tools of foreign policy must change with it--and one of the key tools is foreign aid.  That is the impetus for the proposal I am introducing today.  Our ability to effectively target foreign aid is crippled in large part by the outmoded and unduly complicated Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  The 300-plus pages of this document contain 33 conflicting goals, 75 questionable priorities, which effectively tyrannize the 10,000 AID employees who carry out 1,700 projects in 89 countries.  There is no real sense of coherence, strategy, or focus to the law or our aid program. It may seem reasonable to direct the President to support a rural development program, but should we be [[Page S2758]] requiring him to protect ``community woodlots''? Maybe the law should define an ``increase in foreign crop productivity'' as an American national priority, but should we go so far as requiring the President to ``strengthen foreign systems to deliver fertilizer to farmers?'' Creating national standards for nutrition is one thing, but should the law direct U.S. assistance support a ``strategy for breast-feeding''?  While many of the goals enshrined in law may be admirable, I question whether they are American national priorities. My bill presents three clear, supportable goals: first, foreign aid must protect American security; second, foreign aid must promote American economic interests and finally, foreign aid must preserve political and regional stability.  Together with these broad goals, I want to adopt specific conditions and performance criteria. If the conditions can't be met, the program should not be funded. Throughout my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I can't think of a single country that has graduated from U.S. assistance.  This is partly due to the fact that we send money to countries where government policies actually defeat the prospects for real economic growth. It's in our interests to facilitate the transition to free markets, not subsidize failures.  So, as a beginning point, this bill radically changes our approach to bilateral economic aid. In the past development assistance has focused on relieving the symptoms of poverty and despair. No doubt there are people and communities where the quality of life has improved somewhat. But by any standard, the fact is most poor countries are still poor and that is largely because of government practices and policies.  This bill starts from scratch. Development assistance, economic support funds and related programs are eliminated and instead I have established a new, smaller bilateral economic aid account. Funds can only be spent in countries committed to the road to free-market reform.  Aid will flow if a government encourages free trade and investment, protects private property, ownership and interests, limits state control of financial institutions, production and manufacturing and restricts interference in establishing wages and prices.  Several weeks ago at the Miami summit we heard 33 nations extol the merits of trade not aid. Chile's impressive record may have had a great deal to do with this hemispheric shift in emphasis.  In 1970, it had the twin distinction of being the world's largest recipient of U.S. aid per capita and being an economic basket case. Setting aside wrenching internal political events, once cut loose from aid dependency, Chile implemented a comprehensive free-market system, turned an economic corner and the rest, as they say, is history. The success of these reforms is evident in the fact that Chile's economic strength has opened the door to early membership in NAFTA.  Chile offers a good lesson in why foreign aid fails. If countries resist market reforms no amount of aid will improve economic or political conditions.  Absent meaningful reforms, foreign aid, like crack for an addict, only fuels failure.  The only way to break the devastating cycle of dependency is to end foreign aid entitlement programs, to change our economic aid agenda.  We should be contributing to a cure, supporting and energizing economic growth and opportunity, not just offering temporary relief from symptoms.  Why? Well setting aside altruistic motives, it is in our economic interests to encourage countries to embrace free-market principles. As we turn the corner on this century, it is clear our own economic health and progress, improving and expanding American job opportunities are closely tied to export opportunities in developing countries.  This mutually enriching scenario depends upon changing how we administer foreign aid--aid must become performance based.  Beyond defining broad goals and performance based economic aid strategy, the bill also funds specific national priorities. As drafted, the bill creates two separate titles--one for Europe and the NIS and the other for the Middle East.  There is little question in my mind that the security interests of our Nation are directly affected by stability in the Middle East and Europe. In the former, the administration has actively pursued a comprehensive peace agreement. Whether or not negotiations produce sound, durable agreements, the United States has ongoing interests driven by a number of issues including our close alliance with Israel, the important relationship with Egypt, as well as concerns about political extremism, energy security and terrorism.  I believe our assistance supports vital American interests in the region and should be sustained.  Turning to the second region where I think we have vital interest, the bill provides $350 million for Eastern Europe and the Baltics and $750 million for assistance to the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Within the NIS account, the bill earmarks funds for Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia.  I also toughen conditions on Russian aid. No funds can be provided if there is any evidence the government is directing or supporting the violation of another nation's territory or sovereignty.  Beyond the NIS, many of my colleagues share a concern about expanding the sphere of NATO's stabilizing influence. This bill builds on this interest and targets excess defense articles and IMET for the Baltic nations and the Visegrad group.  In addition, as an alternative to Russia's ambition to exercise a unilateral security role in the region, I earmark money for a training and support of a joint peacekeeping battalion for the Baltics. This was a program the President announced in Riga this summer and then immediately told Congress, he was diverting the funding to Haiti. This reversal was a serious mistake which the bill corrects.  This bill not only spells out what needs to be done, but which agency should do it.  There are two major structural changes: first, trade and export promotion efforts are consolidated. The Trade Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation are merged and the funding level is boosted.  One clear way to strengthen popular support for foreign aid is to make it more effectively serve American business interests--as I mentioned, American jobs, exports, and income depend on it.  Second, the bill abolishes AID and consolidates the agency's functions under the Secretary of State. This recommendation reflects my view that U.S. foreign aid must better serve U.S. foreign policy interests. The connection between U.S. aid and U.S. interests has been lost with agencies acting wholly independent of our collective interests and common good.  And, there is no more compelling illustration of the problem than the difficulties which plague the NIS program. Here you have the first major initiative since the Marshall plan. It enjoys the President's personal attention and bipartisan support in Congress--if anything was designed to work it should have been our NIS effort.  Instead, bureaucratic redundancy has allowed AID to blame the State Department, State to blame AID--and when all else fails, both blame the host government for not asking for a program in the first place.  But for a combination of these excuses, we could have had an aggressive effort underway 2 years ago--helping lay a foundation for a legal and commercial code protecting citizens and property throughout the NIS.  Instead, Judge Freeh has been put in the unfortunate position of playing catch-up with an international Mafia capable of undermining the successful transition to free markets throughout the region, not to mention engaging in nuclear terrorism against the United States.  Let me add one more point on the need to reorganize the foreign policy bureaucracy.  I have only addressed issues that fall directly within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Given the opportunity, I would also recommend consolidating USIA activities under the State Department and abolish ACDA altogether.  [[Page S2759]] It makes no sense not to have the agency responsible for communicating U.S. interests separate and apart from the agency it serves. The State Department and USIA are integrated overseas and should be here at home. As for ACDA, it is completely unclear what they do that couldn't be done by the Undersecretary for International Security Affairs. Since these agencies are beyond the jurisdiction of my subcommittee, I will leave their reorganization and funding to the good judgment of Senator Helms and Senator Gramm.  This bill is a new lease on life for American assistance programs. Although drafted here in Congress, I should point out that I worked hard to assure that we do not micromanage the process.  Presidential flexibility is clearly preserved in general, by broadening goals and specifically by maintaining various waiver and transfer authorities, although I have restructured them somewhat to address a number of problems which have developed in the past several years.  Recently, the administration has increased its use of waivers to move forward with programs which I think everyone would agree are controversial. The fact that waivers have been so frequently invoked at the last possible minute, suggest one of two things: either the administration is incapable of even short-term planning or they are intentionally undermining the congressional notification and consultation process.  I am not prepared to pass judgment at this stage, but let me point out that waiver authorities included in this bill in sections 208, 701, and 703 must now either meet a national security interests test or Congress must be notified in advance of the use of the waiver.  Let me conclude by summing up where my bill takes foreign aid: First, I clearly define American interests; second, I set standards for performance; third, I fund American priorities in the Middle East and Europe and, fourth, I reorganize the bureaucracy so that foreign aid better serves our foreign interests.  If we don't produce real changes in how we administer foreign aid--soon--we will end up with no foreign aid at all.  In 1961, when he transmitted the Foreign Assistance Act to the Hill, President John Kennedy said:       No objective supporter of foreign aid can be satisfied with      the existing program--actually a multiplicity of programs.      Bureaucratically fragmented, awkward and slow, its      administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational      structure covering at least four departments and several      agencies. The program is based on a series of legislative      measures and administrative procedures conceived at different      times for different purposes, many of them obsolete,      inconsistent and unduly rigid and thus unsuited for our      present needs and purposes. Its weaknesses have begun to      undermine our confidence in our effort both here and abroad.  Forty-four years later, President Kennedy's words couldn't be more accurate.  Let me conclude by expressing my appreciation to Senator Coverdell and Senator D'Amato who have joined in cosponsoring this measure. When I released this bill in December, Senator Coverdell was quick to point out many features which he supported and one which caused him serious concern. It is in deference to his considerable expertise and strong views that I revised my original draft and removed the Peace Corps from my reorganization plan.  I look forward to working with Senator Coverdell and his colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee to reform the foreign aid and policy process. Let me pay special recognition to the committee chairman, Senator Helms, whose leadership is crucial to changing the way this country carries out both its foreign policy and foreign aid agenda. It is my hope that working together in the authorization and appropriations process we can take advantage of a unique moment in history and complete a comprehensive reorganization of the foreign policy bureaucracy.
