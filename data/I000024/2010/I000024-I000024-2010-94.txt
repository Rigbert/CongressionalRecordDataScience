We ought to be concerned. I am concerned about the deficit. What is interesting about this debate, I am ranked by the National Journal as the most conservative Member of the Senate. I suggest my proud liberal friend from Vermont is probably on the other end of the spectrum.  If we look at who is responsible for deficit spending, I think Members will find he would be more responsible thanI would. I thank the Senator for the additional 30 seconds.
