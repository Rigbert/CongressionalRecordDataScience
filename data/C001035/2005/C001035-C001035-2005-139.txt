President, I would accept the comments of the distinguished chairman of the committee. This is a very important issue to many of us. I understand the chairman and the ranking member did debate this issue at some length last week. I am sure the chairman is correct in saying we would all benefit from reading that colloquy as we prepare to debate these issues further and ultimately cast our votes.
