 President, I rise in strong opposition to the fast-track bill the Finance Committee approved last night, and that I think will be on the floor next week or the following week, on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  I think the most important aspect of this debate is that what we are discussing with the TPP is not a new concept. It is not as though somebody came and said, I have a great idea; let's try this trade agreement, and it is going to be really good for the American worker and the American middle class and the American people. The truth is that we have seen this movie time and time and time again. Let me tell my colleagues that the ending of this movie is not very good. It is a pretty bad ending. I think most Americans understand that our past trade agreements have failed our American workers and have led to the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs.  What I simply don't understand--if we were going forward in the first place, with a new idea, maybe we should give it a shot. But when we went forward with NAFTA, when we went forward with CAFTA, when we went forward with Normal Permanent Trade Relations and there were all of these folks telling us how great these agreements were going to be and it turned out that virtually everything they said was inaccurate--not true--why in God's Name would we go forward with another trade agreement which is, in fact, larger than previous trade agreements?  Let me give an example of what I mean. On September 19, 1993, President Bill Clinton said the following:       I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in      the first two years of its effect. . . . I believe that NAFTA      will create a million jobs in the first five years of its      effect.  So President Clinton was pushing the NAFTA agreement very hard, and that is what he said.  In 1993, the same year, the Heritage Foundation, which is one of the most conservative think tanks in the country--so here we have a liberal President, Bill Clinton, and we have a conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation--this is what they said: ``Virtually all economists agree that NAFTA will produce a net increase of U.S. jobs over the next decade.''  In 1993, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, who is now our majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said: ``American firms will not move to Mexico just for lower wages.'' Mitch McConnell: ``American firms will not move to Mexico just for lower wages.''  Well, was President Clinton right? Was the Heritage Foundation right? Was Senator McConnell right? No. I think the evidence is pretty clear they were all wrong.  According to a well-respected economist at the Economic Policy Institute--and their facts usually hold up pretty well--NAFTA has led to the loss of more than 680,000 American jobs. What President Clinton said was wrong, what the Heritage Foundation said was wrong. We lost substantial numbers of jobs.  In 1993, the year before NAFTA was implemented, the United States had a trade surplus with Mexico of more than $1.6 billion. Last year, the trade deficit with Mexico was $53 billion. We had a trade surplus of $1.6 billion; last year we had a deficit of $53 billion. Now, how is that a success? I don't know.  In other words, NAFTA has been a disaster for American workers.  What about the Chinese trade agreement? I remember hearing all of the discussions about how great it would be if we had a trade agreement with a huge country such as China; thinking about all of the American products they would be buying, manufactured here in the United States. Here is what President Bill Clinton said about PNTR with China back in 1999. It is important to remember what people said because they are saying the same thing about this trade agreement. But this is back in 1999, Bill Clinton, President, PNTR with China:       In opening the economy of China, the agreement will create      unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and      companies to compete successfully in China's market. . . .      This is a hundred-to-nothing deal for America when it comes      to the economic consequences.  Once again, that is a liberal President.  Now, we have the conservative think tanks that love unfettered free trade. In 1999, discussing PNTR with China, the conservative economists at the Cato Institute--these are really conservative guys and this is what they said:       The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports      would overwhelm U.S. industry. In fact, American workers are      far more productive than their Chinese counterparts. . . .      PNTR would create far more export opportunities for America      than the Chinese.  Well, what can we say about that? The Cato Institute wrote in 1999: ``The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports would overwhelm U.S. industry.''  Sure. Right.  If we go out to any department store in America and we buy products, whereare those products made? Guess what. They are made in China. It appears that, in fact, Chinese imports did overwhelm U.S. industry. The Cato Institute was dead wrong.  Again, nobody is really surprised at this. There is no more debate about this. Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, that trade agreement, was a disaster.  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that trade agreement with China has led to the loss of 2.7 million American jobs. The trade deficit with China has increased from $83 billion in 2001 to $342 billion in 2014.  Now, in terms of China, I don't know that the American people have any doubt about it. Every time we go shopping, the products overwhelmingly are made in China. People look in their own towns and in their own States--my State--and see losses of more and more manufacturing jobs. Since 2001, we have lost 60,000 manufacturing facilities in America. Not all of it is attributable to trade; there are other reasons, but a lot of it is attributable to trade. Millions of decent-paying jobs are gone; people thrown out on the street as companies move to China, Vietnam, and other low-wage countries. There is not a debate about it. That is exactly what has happened. Corporation after corporation has said, Why do I want to pay an American worker $15, $20 an hour? Why do I want to deal with the union? Why do I have to obey environmental regulations? I can move to China, I can move to Vietnam, I can move to Malaysia or Mexico and I can pay people pennies an hour and bring the product back into the United States. That is what they said, and that is what they have done.  Major corporation after major corporation has reduced employment in America at the same time as they have increased employment in other countries.  Not only is it the loss of jobs, it is the race to the bottom. It is employers saying to workers, Look, I am cutting your health care, I am not giving you a raise, and if you don't like it, I am moving to China because there are people all over the world who are prepared to work for wages a lot lower than you are receiving. You can take it or leave it. That is one of the reasons why today the typical American worker is working longer hours for lower wages than he or she used to and why wages have gone down in America. That is what the global economy has done. That is what these horrendous unfettered free-trade agreements have pushed on American workers. That is the Chinese trade agreement: an estimated 2.7 million American jobs lost.  Then we have the Korea Free Trade Agreement, which has led to a loss of some 60,000 jobs. Our trade deficit with that country has gone up from $16.6 billion in 2012 to $25 billion in 2014.  So we have a history of failed trade agreement after failed trade agreement after failed trade agreement and people say, Hey, we failed, we failed, we failed; let's do the same thing again and this time we are really, really, really going to succeed. I don't think anybody really believes that.  I do understand that Wall Street loves this trade agreement and they are staying up nights worrying about ordinary Americans; and I understand that the major corporations in this country love this agreement and the truck companies love this agreement, which gives us enough reason to hold this agreement in doubt.  Now, the Obama administration says, Well, trust us. Forget about the other trade agreements. This TPP is something different. It is a better agreement. This time will be different. This time it will support about 650,000 American jobs. Well, supporters of unfettered free trade were wrong about NAFTA, they were wrong about CAFTA, they were wrong about PNTR with China, and they were wrong about the Korea Free Trade Agreement and--surprise of all surprises--they are wrong again.  If the fast-track is approved, it would pave the way for the passage of the TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--trade agreement. As my colleagues know, this trade agreement is poised to be the largest free-trade agreement in history, encompassing 12 nations that account for roughly 40 percent of the global economy. This is a very big deal.  Let me speak about two of those countries that are involved in the TPP; those are Vietnam and Malaysia. We are fighting here--and I understand there are differences of opinion--we are fighting here in the U.S. Congress to raise the minimum wage. I happen to believe a $7.25 minimum wage, which is what it is federally, is a starvation wage. I would like to see it go up over a period of years to $15 an hour. The Presiding Officer may disagree, and there are others who disagree.  Let me tell my colleagues what the minimum wage is in Vietnam. The minimum wage in Vietnam is 56 cents an hour--56 cents an hour. So we have American workers being forced to compete against people who make 56 cents an hour. And we have a situation, just as one example of many, where the Nike company--a company which produces over 365 million pairs of athletic shoes each year--goes all over the world. Do you know how many of those athletic shoes are manufactured in the United States of America? Fifty million? Twenty million? Ten million? One million? Zero. On the other hand, they employ 330,000 workers in Vietnam--mostly young women--and while they refuse to tell us, give us the detailed information, our supposition is that most of those women make very low wages.  Let's be clear about what is going on. According to a November 11, 2014, article in the Vietnamese newspaper Thanh Nien News: ``Analysts acknowledge that Vietnam's abundance of cheap labor has played an increasingly pivotal role in wooing foreign firms looking to set up overseas manufacturing operations in a country with a population of 90 million.''  In other words, that is what this is all about. Wages are very low in Vietnam. Companies from the United States and all over the world will go to that country. Allowing the TPP to pass will make it easier for multinational companies to shut down in America and move to Vietnam. That is wrong.  When we talk about free trade, it is important to understand what is involved. Whom are we competing against? Are we competing against Canadian workers whose standard of living is as high or higher than ours? Are we competing against workers in Germany whose standard of living may be higher than ours? No. We are competing against people who are struggling to stay alive, earning the lowest possible wages that keep a human being alive.  Last year, the Human Rights Watch published a report on Vietnam. Here are some of the quotes from that report:       The human rights situation in Vietnam deteriorated      significantly in 2013, worsening a trend evident for several      years. The year was marked by a severe and intensifying      crackdown on critics, including long prison terms for many      peaceful activists whose ``crime'' was calling for political      change.  In other words, in Vietnam, if you speak up, you want political change, there is a likelihood you will end up in jail.       Vietnam bans all political parties, labor unions and human      rights organizations independent of the government. . . . The      authorities require official approval for public gatherings      and refuse to grant permission for meetings, marches, or      protests they deem politically or otherwise unacceptable.  It is not my point to beat up on Vietnam. They are a struggling country--a poor country that went through a terrible war with the United States that caused them incredible harm. But when we look at a trade agreement, when we say to American workers: This is your competition, people who are making 56 cents an hour in some cases, people who can't form an independent trade union, people who politically can't stand up and speak up for their rights, is that really appropriate and fair to the American worker? I don't think it is. I don't think it is.  Let me say a word not just on Vietnam but another country in that consortium of partners in the TPP; that is, the country of Malaysia.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New York Times article, dated September 17, 2014.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Times, Sept. 17, 2014]      Report Cites Forced Labor in Malaysia's Electronics Industry                         (By Steven Greenhouse)       Nearly one in three migrant workers in Malaysia's thriving      electronics industry     toils under forced labor conditions, essentially trapped in      the job, a factory monitoring group found in a report issued      on Wednesday.       The monitoring group, Verite--which conducted a two-year      investigation commissioned by the United States Department of      Labor--found that 32 percent of the industry's nearly 200,000      migrant workers were employed in forced situations because      their passports had been taken away or because they were      straining to pay back illegally high recruitment fees.       The report said those practices were prevalent among the      migrants from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Vietnam and      other countries who work in Malaysia's nearly 200 electronics      factories. Those factories, which produce consumer      electronics, motherboards, computer peripherals and other      electronic goods, account for a third of Malaysia's exports      and produce for many well-known companies, including Apple,      Flextronics, Samsung and Sony.       The Verite report said that 92 percent of the migrant      workers in Malaysia's electronics industry had paid      recruitment fees and that 92 percent of that group had paid      fees that exceeded legal or industry standards, defined as      more than one month's wages.       The report said about half of the migrant workers who      borrowed for their recruitment fees spent more than a year      paying off those fees. According to the report, 94 percent of      the migrants did not have their passports when Verite's      investigators interviewed them, and 71 percent said it would      be impossible or difficult to get their passports back when      needed.       ``This most modern of industrial sectors is characterized      by a form of exploitation that long ago should have been      relegated to the past,'' said Daniel Viederman, chief      executive of Verite. ``The problem is not one of a few      isolated cases. It is indeed widespread.''       Labor Department officials commissioned the study because      the federal government frowns on the importation of goods      made by forced labor. They sought an investigation after      seeing evidence that the problem was serious in Malaysia.       Twelve investigators working for Verite interviewed a total      of 501 workers from nearly 200 Malaysian factories. According      to the study, ``92 percent reported feeling compelled to work      overtime hours to pay off their debt, and 85 percent felt it      was impossible to leave their job before paying off their      debt.'' Seventy-seven percent had to borrow money to pay      their recruitment fees.       ``Workers are paying too much to get their jobs,'' Mr.      Viederman said. ``That leaves them vulnerable to being      trapped in their jobs.''       He told of a migrant worker from Nepal who spoke good      English and was the only one of five children with a college      degree. His family paid a recruitment agent $1,500 for his      job, which was more than twice the annual income in Nepal,      and they borrowed much of that at a 36 percent annual      interest rate.       When the Nepali arrived in Malaysia, his passport was taken      from him at the airport, and he has not seen it since, he      told the Verite interviewer. ``He has now completed 14 months      of a three-year contract, and he has not been able to save      any money'' because he is still paying back the recruitment      fees, Mr. Viederman said. The Nepali works 12 hours a day,      often seven days a week, and said it would take two years to      finish repaying the loan.       ``He doesn't want to be in Malaysia anymore,'' Mr.      Viederman said. ``He wants to quit and return home, but then      he would have to pay a hefty fine and purchase his own plane      ticket and still have the loan payment hanging over his head.      He wasn't sure if he could get his passport back.''       The report found that 30 percent of foreign workers said      they slept in a room with more than eight people, and 43      percent said there was no place where they could safely store      their belongings. Twenty-two percent of the workers said they      had been deceived about their wages, hours or overtime      requirements during the recruitment process.       Mr. Viederman said many workers faced a ``one-two punch''--     being charged high recruitment fees and then being paid less      than they had been promised. He said many workers were told      that their wages would be withheld or they would be reported      to authorities if they complained or protested.       The Malaysian Embassy in Washington did not respond to      inquiries--Tuesday was a national holiday.       Officials from Samsung and Sony did not respond to      questions about Malaysia.       Asked about the reports of forced labor, Chris Gaither, a      spokesman for Apple, said: ``This is an issue we have paid a      lot of attention to and done a lot of work on. We were the      first electronics company to mandate reimbursement to workers      who were charged excessive recruitment fees.''       Mr. Gaither said Apple's supply chain, which employs 1.5      million workers worldwide, employs 18,000 in Malaysia,      including 4,000 migrant contract workers. He said that since      2008, Apple had helped migrant workers in Malaysia and      elsewhere to reclaim $19.8 million in excessive recruitment      fees, which he defined as more than one month's wages. Apple      uses about 30 factories in Malaysia, and Apple had audits      done at 18 of them in the last year to investigate forced      labor and other problems.       Mr. Viederman said companies should strengthen their codes      of conduct to bar payment of recruitment fees for workers at      any factories they use and to prohibit supplier factories      from taking migrant workers' passports. He said companies      should make sure their factory monitors engaged in aggressive      investigations to unearth such practices. In addition, he      called for a grievance procedure for workers that would hold      the companies, suppliers and labor brokers accountable.       The Verite report found 62 percent of migrant workers said      they were unable to move around freely without their      passports. Fifty-seven percent said they could not leave      their job before their contract was finished because they      would be charged an illegally high fine, lose their passport      or be denounced to the authorities.       Forty-six percent reported having encounters with police,      immigration officials or a volunteer citizens security corps.      Most of the 46 percent said they had to pay a bribe, were      detained or were threatened with detention or physical harm.      Twenty-seven percent of the foreign workers said they could      not come and go freely from their housing.
