I want to thank my chairman, Chairman Levin, for yielding.  Madam Speaker, this week on the news we heard economists declare that the recession ended sometime last year. But while Wall Street may celebrate, in Atlanta and many other cities there is a different story. Small businesses from Peachtree to Cascade and from Moreland Avenue to Clairmont Road continue to struggle. People are still suffering. With this bill, we give them the support they badly need.  Enough with politics and enough with the posturing. Small businesses need access to capital, and they need it now. They need it right now. They need tax relief, and they need it now.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass this bill. It is the right thing to do, and we must do it and do it now.
