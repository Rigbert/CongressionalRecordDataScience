 We Senators need to pass a package that is agreeable to the President and to the House. What do we all agree on? We agree the patch needs to get done right now. So that is the base of what should pass the Senate, if we are to get a law enacted. House and Senate Democrats insist on offsets for a patch.  The old joke is that you better make certain the light at the end of the tunnel isn't a train coming toward you. Unfortunately, the joke is on the American people when it comes to the upcoming tax-filing season. Because of the failure of the Congress to act, the taxpayers are going to feel as if they have been hit by a freight train come April 15. The sad part is this was not necessary. Congress could have done the right thing. Congress could have acted. We have never in this century gone this late without passing the AMT patch and having it in place. The IRS and the Treasury have made it clear that the failure to act would cause very real problems in the filing season, in terms of confusion and in terms, especially, of a delay in providing taxpayers their refunds.  I am astonished when I hear that some in the Democratic leadership are telling reporters these claims of a filing fiasco are all somehow a bluff. The Democratic leadership certainly didn't think the problems of the filing season were a bluff when we were delayed in passing an extenders package last year. That is when the Republicans were in control. I strongly advocated then that we needed to pass the extenders package and warned of its negative impact on the filing season, and I was not listened to by my Republican leadership. But Democrats, now in the majority but back then in the minority, joined me in those statements. Now the clamor is much smaller with the alternative minimum tax which will affect 25 million taxpayers and will be, in many ways, significantly more disruptive to the filing season than the extenders delay last year.  As you can see from a chart I have here--I am going to ask my staff to hold that chart up. We all know the story of Chicken Little. But every once in a while, Chicken Little is right. When it comes to the filing season, the sky is falling.  It is important that my colleagues understand that by failing before Thanksgiving, we have already gummed up the works. As my colleagues can see from this next chart, the deadline of October 15 for finalizing forms and instructions has already passed. We have passed the November 7 deadline for printing the tax forms--as you can also see in the chart--and the absolute drop dead date for printing was November 16.  Every week that we don't act, this problem will get worse and worse.  I should make it clear that we are not only hearing from the IRS that the delays have created a filing fiasco; the tax preparer community is making it clear that the problems are real and they are big.  We recently received a letter from the independent IRS Oversight Board that voiced ``grave concerns about the serious risks to the 2008 filing season if legislation to change the AMT is delayed.''  The IRS Oversight Board makes it clear that there is a big, big difference from Congress passing AMT relief this week as opposed to the third week of December. The board specifically says that another 2 or 3 week delay by Congress could mean that another 31 million taxpayers will face a delay in filing returns and that another approximately $70 billion in refunds could be delayed.  These numbers would be on top of the 6.7 million taxpayers who already face a delay in filing returns and the $17 billion in refunds that are going to be delayed because we have not acted to pass the AMT ``patch.''  So if we continue to dilly-dally and delay on AMT relief until Christmas, it will be a total of 37.7 million return filings delayed and $86.9 billion in refunds delayed. These delayed refunds are not just paper; they represent real money that many working families are counting on to help them to pay the bills, make an important purchase or even have an important medical procedure done.  To be blunt, we are already in the soup and it is a question of how bad it is going to get.  I recently joined the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee in writing to Ms. Stiff, the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, asking that the IRS do the following:  No. 1, take steps to educate taxpayers about the possible changes in the law and tax forms;  No. 2, work closely with the tax preparation community to keep them aware of the IRS to update programming and minimize delays and to encourage the tax preparation community to inform their clients and consumers about likely delays in processing returns and distributing refunds;  No. 3, ensure that all IRS call center employees are fully informed about the status of the tax filing season and can provide accurate and timely information to callers;  No. 4, within available resources, increase staffing of IRS call centers to accommodate the increased call volume that will likely result from taxpayer confusion.  I think these steps will allow us to do the best we can with a very bad hand. But there should be no doubt, the real answer is to pass AMT relief and pass it now.  For many years now, and certainly many times this year, I have tried to shed light on the monstrosity that is the alternative minimum tax and how the failure to index the AMT for inflation threatens middle-class taxpayers. While I have consistently fought for full repeal of the alternative minimum tax, I have had to be content with enacting a series of provisions, since 2001, to increase the exemption amounts pertaining to the AMT to prevent new taxpayers from being caught by it. However, similar action has not yet been taken for tax year 2007. Despite plenty of advanced warning, congressional leadership's failure to act means that time for proactive action has already passed.  The IRS is printing tax forms and making other arrangements to process tax returns submitted for the upcoming filing season. Any legislative fix undertaken now to check the advance of the AMT will not eliminate a problem, but will only manage it. Despite being deeply disappointed that congressional leadership has not seen fit to act faster, I was hopeful that the magnitude of around 19 million additional tax filers paying the AMT for tax year 2007 was finally beginning to hit home. The AMT finally seemed to be getting the attention it deserved, but recent rhetoric has again put me into a negative frame of mind.  Rather than offer new ideas and insights into how to solve the AMT problem, which in the case of many would be to offer any ideas at all, some of my colleagues are merely recycling the same old and tired talking points of years past. More specifically, I'm referring to the accusation, made by left-leaning think tanks and also by the House Committee on Ways and Means majority, that advocates of tax relief in 2001 and 2003 deliberately--I want to emphasize they are accusing use of deliberately using the AMT as a trick to minimize the revenue cost to the Federal treasury as a result of those policies. While it is true that some families benefit less from 2001 and 2003 tax relief than they otherwise would have, to say this is by design, as is indeed done in a Committee on Ways and Means press release issued on November 14, is absolutely ridiculous.  Republicans have consistently fought, even before the 2001 tax relief bill, to curtail and eradicate the alternative minimum tax. In 1999, congressional Republicans passed the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, which completely repealed the AMT, and this bill was vetoed by President Clinton.  Getting back to the Ways and Means press release of November 14, in it I myself am cited as critiquing President Bush for not doing more in his 2001 and 2003 tax packages to counteract AMT effects. I do absolutely want to make clear that despite my belief that the AMT was also a pressing problem at that time, I wholeheartedly supported tax relief in 2001 and 2003 and still think it was absolutely the right thing to do. In fact, I think the provisions in both bills should be made permanent.  In order to counteract the effect of the AMT, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a series of provisions to increase AMT exemption amounts to keep inflation from pushing new tax filers into the clutches of the AMT. If Ways and Means Democrats were serious in their implied concern for the effectiveness of 2001 and 2003 tax relief, they could do two very simple things: First, House Democrats could make 2001 and 2003 tax relief permanent; second, they could fully repeal the AMT. Of course they have shown no sign of doing either of these two things. In fact, opposition to the 2003 tax relief package was so intense among Democrats that the Vice President was called upon to break a tie during a vote in the Senate.  The provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief bills were not made permanent because doing so might have made it impossible for the bills to overcome Democratic opposition. I believe that including AMT repeal in those bills would have had the same effect.  Aside from being quoted in the November 14 Ways and Means press release, I found it unintentionally humorous in that it reveals that House Democrats are doing exactly what they accuse Republicans of having done since 2001. While they accuse Republicans of using the AMT as a budgetinggimmick, they are using the AMT as a gimmick to make it appear they are easing the tax burden when they are not.  In the release, Ways and Means Chairman Rangel is quoted saying ``The house passed a bill to prevent the AMT from hitting 23 million families this year without hurting the economy by adding to the national debt.''  What this means is that the House is protecting some people from the AMT by subjecting other filers to additional taxes. This is the same as if your community's animal control officer caught a rabid dog on your street and let it go someplace else across town. Your problem appears to have been immediately solved, but in the longer-term, the fundamental problem still exists. The fundamental problem with the AMT is the massive amount of unintended revenue it is forecast to collect, and the unwillingness of many of my colleagues to forego that revenue.  If Ways and Means Democrats are serious in their appeal to the administration regarding the AMT to ``work with Congress to do the right thing and kill it,'' they will abandon any notion that revenues not collected because of AMT relief or repeal ought to be offset.  Finally, I want to address the baseless claim that the Bush administration's tax priorities were responsible for the AMT problem on a technical level.  This exact point was raised in 2005 by Democratic Ways and Means staffers in a letter to ``Tax Note,'' a prominent publication for tax professionals. At the time I requested that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation look into this matter. Their analysis showed that, as I have long maintained, the biggest problem with the alternative minimum tax was it was never indexed for inflation.  In response, I received from the Joint Committee on Taxation a letter dated October 3, 2005. I have requested an update of that document and will discuss the updated numbers as soon as they are available. That estimate could be interpreted to indicate that if the Bush tax cuts were repealed, alternative minimum tax revenues could be expected to drop by $302 billion, or 27 percent.  At the time, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate also found that extending and indexing the hold-harmless provision in effect at the time would reduce alternative minimum tax revenues by around $667 billion, or 59 percent. Of course, the analysis of this question is complicated by the fact that the variables we are examining overlap and interact with each other. But responsible analysis of available information certainly does not support the allegation that the tax relief packages signed by the President in 2001 and 2003 are responsible for the explosion of the alternative minimum tax. If anything, House Democrats and their pet think tanks have illustrated the fallacy of using projected revenue reductions as a proxy for percentage causation.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 2005 Joint Committee on Taxation revenue estimate I referred to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                     Washington, DC, Oct. 3, 2005.                               memorandum     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr     From: George Yin     Subject: AMT Effects       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29,      2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT      liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be      attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount      to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and      JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently      extended or repealed. We also explain how this information      compares to information previously provided to you on August      31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.       For the purposes of this analysis, we have first assumed      that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in      Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if,      alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless      provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is      extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended      permanently and indexed after 2005. The second set of figures      presents the same comparison under the assumption that the      tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information      provided in this table was previously provided to you in our      September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.

(10) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure            59%     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((6)-     (9))/(6))............................................------------------------------------------------------------------------       In the information provided to you on August 31, 2005 and      September 16, 2005, we analyzed the portion of the AMT effect      attributable to the tax cuts. In the analysis described      above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable      to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation.      There is, however, interaction between these two contributing      factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting      of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The      apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will      vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total      effect remains constant.       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The      first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT      effect attributed to the tax cuts, consistent with the      information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16,      2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of      the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and      index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the      information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two      contributing factors were completely independent of one      another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the      two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of      the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors      together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect.      Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.
