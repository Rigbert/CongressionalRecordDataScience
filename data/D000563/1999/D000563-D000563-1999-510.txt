President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a story about a most remarkable woman who is celebrating her ninetieth birthday. Her heroic existence embodies every element of a true American.  Katherine Dunham is a studied anthropologist, a brilliant social worker, an inspiring dancer and a historic activist. She started her first dance school in Chicago in 1931, and later became dance director for the Works Progress Administration's Chicago theater project. In 1967 she founded a performing arts center for inner-city youths in East St. Louis, Ill.  One of her many accomplishments came on the night of January 15, 1979, when she was presented with the Albert Schweitzer Music Award at New York's Carnegie Hall. The significance of this award was underscored as three generations of Katherine Dunham dancers and musicians offered spectacular renditions of her marvelous work. The dance and music roared, peppered with the rich flavor of American dance mixed with the anthropological roots of African American heritage.  This kind and brave woman forged a path for less fortunate children, offering the arts as an outlet to their misfortunes. She gave of herself everything and asked little in return. Katherine Dunham was and remains a stellar addition to our rich American heritage.  I hope you will join me in wishing Ms. Dunham a very happy birthday.                          ____________________
