Speaker, I rise to give reassurance and hope to Sandy Collins and the family of the mayor of Toledo, Mike Collins, who, yesterday, was involved in a very serious automotive accident. He apparently had a heart attack while he was driving after trying to prepare the city crews for the level 3 snowfall that was about to come.  Then there was the heroic act that has saved his life, though he is in critical condition at the University of Toledo Medical Center. A woman named Evelyn Johnson--mother of eight children and grandmother of five--saw his SUV that had crashed into this telephone pole. She stopped her car on her way to work, and she and another man, a good Samaritan who came along, had to pry him out of the car. It was still running. He still had his foot on the gas, but he was completely unconscious. She and the other gentleman administered CPR at the direction of the 911 crew in the city of Toledo.  I am so proud of my hometown and the love and the care and the preparedness that they demonstrated to care for our mayor. We pray to God that he will fully recover and that his injuries will be healed. We give comfort to his wife, Sandy. We know she is at his side. Our entire community reaches out to them. And we congratulate Mrs. Johnson for her incredible heroism in helping our mayor.                          ____________________
