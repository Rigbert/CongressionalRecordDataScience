 We hear it all of the time. And yet built within the Contract With America are major cutbacks which will make it increasingly difficult for millions of young Americans to afford to go to college.  I am sure the situation is the same in Ohio, Louisiana or California. Certainly it is in Vermont. I am getting letters every day where people say, Congressman Sanders, do not let them cut back on the Pell grants. That is what keeps me in college. Do not have them force me to pay interest while I am in college on my loans. It means I am going to drop out of college. Do not let them cut back the work study program.  When everybody understands that it is extremely difficult today to earn a good living without a college degree, the shortsightedness and the selfishness of saying to working-class Americans, sorry, we are giving tax breaks to the rich or maybe we are going to put $50 billion in star wars, but for young Americans, I got a letter today, Congressman Sanders, I am working two jobs, taking a full-time load in my college in Vermont. Do not let them cut back. Yet some people think star wars, tax breaks for the rich, are a greater priority.  I do not understand that at all.
