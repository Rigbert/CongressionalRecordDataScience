  Mr. President, we in the Senate have a constitutional responsibility to nurture topnotch leadership in the Armed Forces.  Officers who meet those standards should be praised and promoted.  Those who fail to meet those high standards should be weeded out.  Based on what I know right now today, I do not think Captain Cook meets the highest standards nor should have been promoted to admiral.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Alaska.
