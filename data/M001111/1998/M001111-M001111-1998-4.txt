 President, I rise today to remember a young man who was wrongly, viciously struck down in the prime of his life. Matthew Shepard was an innocent, kind, young man pursuing his education and enjoying the life of a college student. Tragically, he is now a reminder of what happens when we do not stand up to hate and bigotry.  On Monday night in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, hundreds of people from all walks of life came together to remember Matthew and to call for action to end hate crimes. Many people in Washington were outraged and shared in our nation's sorrow. I was touched by this response and join with so many others in expressing my own deep sense of hopelessness. I know that this was not just an isolated incident. Hate crimes are a real threat. We cannot be silent any longer.  A week ago today, I joined many of my Colleagues down at the White House in celebration of the signing of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. I was proud to be there to call attention to the importance of this Act. I was proud that the legislation increased opportunities for young students and improved access to quality education for all students. I thought about how important it was for us to be focused on the needs of young Americans and their families striving to achieve a higher education.  I thought of the many college students and high school students I have met who would benefit from these opportunities. I thought about my own college age children and the opportunities they would have. I knew this was a big accomplishment.  Today, my thoughts are with another young college student who will never experience the opportunities and improvements we worked so hard to achieve. My thoughts have gone from improving opportunities to how to prevent the terrible heartache that Matthew Shepard's family and friends are now experiencing.  When I first heard of this horrible crime I immediately felt deep sympathy for Matthew's parents. How frightening it must have been for them to fly half way around the world to be with their child who was almost unrecognizable because of the violent attack he suffered. I can't imagine the pain they must be experiencing. There are simply no words that I could offer in comfort.  I then felt deep sorrow for the community and the University. To know that those who committed this violent and hateful crime are part of their community must be unbearable. This community will never be the same.  I now feel sorry for our nation. What we have lost? A young man with so much potential. What might Matthew Shepard have become? We know that he was interested in political science and very interested in this field of study. Could Matthew have become a U.S. Senator?  I think now that maybe Matthew can teach us all. We need to use this tragic and despicable crime to attack hate as we attack any other disease that kills. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat that they are and do more to prevent them. Hate is nothing more than a cancer that needs to be stopped.  S. 1529, Hate Crimes Prevent Act, offers us that opportunity. I am pleased to have joined with many of my Colleagues in cosponsoring this important legislation. The bill would expand the definition of a hate crime and improve prosecution of those who act out their hate with violence. No one beats a person to death and leaves them to die without being motivated by a deep sense of hate. This was no robbery. The motive was hate.  The immediate response of local law enforcement officials illustrates why we need to strengthen federal Hate Crimes laws and why the Federal Government must take a greater role in ending this violence.  I urge all of my Colleagues to think about the many Matthew Shepard, we have all met. Kind and hard working young adults. Let us act now to prevent any more senseless violence and deaths.  It is often said that from tragedy we can learn. Let us learn from this tragic event and make a commitment that we will act on Hate Crimes Prevention legislation. Let our actions serve as a comfort to Matthew's parents and the hundreds of other parents who fear for their children.  There are so many tragedies that we cannot prevent. Another senseless, brutal attack like the one experienced by Matthew is a tragedy that we cannot prevent. We spend millions of dollars a year seeking cures for deadly diseases that strike the young and old. We simply cannot accept a disease that strikes without warning and takes the life of a percious vulnerable child. We need to treat hate the same. It cannot and will not be tolerated.                          ____________________
