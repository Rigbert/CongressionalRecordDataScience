 That is more than 1 year away. The President has included permanent extension of R in his fiscal year 2004 budget. I want the people to know I am committed to extending the credit in subsequent legislation.  However, we have before us the amendment by Senator Cantwell proposing striking the dividend exclusion in order to pay for the R extension. The exclusion for dividend income is a very significant piece of any jobs and growth plan--the President has it in his, obviously--even though in our bill it is scaled back some.  Finally, extension of this R credit is not germane to the jobs and growth bill. I therefore raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
