 President, it doesn't take 10 days to get on a bill. And what the majority leader has repeated now is that he is going to break the rules to change the rules, which is a wonderful way to start off the new Congress.  At a time when the American people would like for us to work together and to solve the huge issues that lie before us, the majority leader has chosen instead to break the rules to change the rules because he has had difficulty getting on bills. It is a sad commentary about where the Senate stands these days. I had hoped that going into the lameduck session, we would have an entirely different view of how to bring this place together and begin to solve the problems. So it is a sad day for the Senate. We will go forward as best we can under this extraordinary set of circumstances.
