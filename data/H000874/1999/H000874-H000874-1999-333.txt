Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2116, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act. On September 21, the bill passed the House on suspension and I inadvertently voted ``no.''  Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act is an important step forward toward addressing the health care needs of our Nation's veterans. For far too long the call for long-term care has gone unanswered. The bill establishes a long-term care benefit for any veteran with a 50-percent or greater disability.  It allows the Veterans Administration (VA) greater flexibility to adjust copayments for services like eyeglasses and pharmaceuticals. The legislation enables the VA to cover the emergency care of uninsured veterans and directs them to realign inefficient facilities provided the savings are reinvested locally in the community to improve veterans' care.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2116 has the strong support of the veterans community and I am proud to support it.                          ____________________
