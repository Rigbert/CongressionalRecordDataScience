Yesterday, we said we were unwilling to provide the funds that we promised to make No Child Left Behind work--unwilling to provide the title I funds. We are going to undercut that funding by some $6 billion so money will not be available to help tutor children who are not doing well on tests.  In the previous amendment, I said if we are not going to provide the funds, we should not mandate the school districts to comply with No Child Left Behind, and that was defeated. So the Members of the Senate said, despite the fact we have not funded No Child Left Behind, we are going to enforce mandates on the school districts in America.  Now I give colleagues another chance. This says that when it comes to teacher quality and mandates in No Child Left Behind, we will provide the money we promised so that the teacher in the classroom is qualified to teach. It is a $450 million amendment. I commend it to my colleagues.
