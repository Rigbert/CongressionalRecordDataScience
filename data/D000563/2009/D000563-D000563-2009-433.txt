President, I wish to ask the Senator from Ohio if he has missed the latest criticism of health care reform. The Senator from Tennessee comes to the floor every day and the focus of his attention is the length of the bill, how many pages are in the health care reform bill. I am not making this up. He has come to the floor, even though the Senate health care reform bill is still in process--it has not been written; it will be written, posted on the Internet, as promised--the Senator from Tennessee comes to the floor and each day the number of pages gets inflated. Today he is claiming 2,000 pages in health care reform. Then he puts his alternative up and says: I can do it in 200 pages. It reminds me of the old show ``Name That Tune.'' How many notes do you need to hear to name that tune. The Senator from Tennessee says he can name that tune for health care reform in 200 pages. Therefore, he has a better proposal.  I wish to ask the Senator from Ohio, how much importance should we attach to the number of pages in a bill,and ask the Senator if he remembers when the previous President, President Bush, under a Republican administration, brought to Congress a 3-page bill to create the Troubled Assets Relief Program that cost $800 billion and did it in 3 pages. Does that tell us there was wisdom in this idea of spending billions of dollars to bail out the banks? In Ohio, as you travel around, how many people have stopped you and said: Wait a minute. I will not support any health care reform bill that goes over 200 pages? If it is 201 pages, I want you to vote against it. If it is 2,000, I hope you will filibuster it. Has the Senator run into that?
