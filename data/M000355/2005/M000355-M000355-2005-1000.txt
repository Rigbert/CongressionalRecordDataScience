 President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July 11, the Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 129, H.R. 2360, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. I further ask that the committee-reported amendment be agreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, and that all first-degree amendments be filed at the desk by 4 p.m. on Monday, July 11, with the exception of amendments to be proposed by the leaders. I further ask that first-degree amendments be subject to relevant second degrees and no points of order be waived by this agreement.
