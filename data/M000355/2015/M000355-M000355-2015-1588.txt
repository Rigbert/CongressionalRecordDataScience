 President, I rise to recognize a great Kentuckian who has recently received a great honor. Dr. Michael Colegrove, who has been employed with the University of the Cumberlands in various capacities over the last 40 years and is currently the vice president for student services and the director of leadership studies, recently received the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award from the Leadership Tri-County organization in Kentucky.  Leadership Tri-County focuses on civic, business, and community leadership in Laurel, Knox, and Whitley Counties in southeastern Kentucky. A nonprofit organization founded in 1987, it identifies potential, emerging, and current leaders from the three counties and nurtures their continued development.  Dr. Colegrove graduated from Cumberland College, currently known as the University of the Cumberlands, in 1971. In addition to working for the school for 40 years, he spent 30 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and retired with the rank of colonel in 2003. Dr. Colegrove earned a master of arts from Eastern Kentucky University and a doctor of philosophy from Vanderbilt University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. War College.  Dr. Colegrove is the author of six books. His first book, ``Climbing the Pyramid: The How To's of Leadership,'' was published in 2004. It came about because of the need for a textbook for a leadership seminar conducted by the University of the Cumberlands. He has also volunteered with the American Red Cross and the Kiwanis Club.  Dr. Colegrove and his wife Donna live in Williamsburg, KY, and have a daughter Kimberly who resides in Indiana with her husband Matthew and their two sons Jackson and William. I am sure Dr. Colegrove's family members are very proud of him and all that he has accomplished. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Michael Colegrove on his receipt of the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award.  An area newspaper, the Times Tribune, published an article about Dr. Colegrove receiving his award. I ask unanimous consent that a portion of said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Feb. 25, 2015]                   U of C's Colegrove honored at LTC                           (By Nita Johnson)       The influence he has made on his colleagues was evident--     first with the University of the Cumberlands' marching band's      Honor Guard presenting the flags, and then by the two tables      of students and co-workers seated at the Corbin Technology      Center on Monday evening.       His dedication is the quality that earned University of the      Cumberlands' Dr. Michael Colegrove the 2015 Leader of the      Year award from the Leadership Tri-County organization during      their yearly awards banquet.       Colegrove can be described with many words: author, Sunday      School teacher, deacon, military veteran, and long-time      employee at the Williamsburg college that focuses on helping      students achieve success through faith and discipline.       Hon. Eugene Siler Jr., a Williamsburg native who serves as      the Sixth Judicial Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of      Appeals, introduced Colegrove and described him as ``as      organized as anybody you'll ever see.''       As a personal friend and member of the Sunday School class      that Colegrove teaches, Siler said Colegrove had achieved      success through his faith and dedication to family, his job,      and his role as a Christian.       ``He's a great person,'' Siler said.       Colegrove's record speaks for itself. He earned a      bachelor's degree from then-Cumberland College, his master of      arts degree from Eastern Kentucky University and his doctor      of philosophy from Vanderbilt University. He also graduated      from the United States Army War College and served in the      Army Reserves for 30 years, retiring with the rank of      colonel.       He has been involved with a number of civic organizations      ranging from the American Red Cross to serving as lieutenant      governor for the Kiwanis Club for the Kentucky-Tennessee      Region 6.       But Colegrove's humility has remained intact throughout his      many achievements.       ``I am a man most blessed,'' he told the crowd. ``I had the      opportunity at the University of the Cumberlands to teach      faith with discipline with my colleagues and co-workers. I      had the opportunity to serve the students, and I have two      mentors.''       His mentors were the past two presidents of the      Williamsburg institution--Drs. Jim Taylor and Jim Boswell.      Both men saw extensive growth of the college over their      tenure as president, which Colegrove credited to their vision      for the future.       His involvement with Leadership Tri-County, he said, has      also taught him lessons--one being a book about leadership      and the other being one of life's simplest but sometimes most      difficult qualities--the art of listening.       The book, Colegrove said, had five major areas to consider.       ``Challenge the process,'' he said, ``then inspire and      share the vision. You have to have a vision. Enable others to      act, and model the way you want.''       The last aspect of that, he added, was to ``encourage the      heart.''       Listening, he said, came not from his years of experience      in the military or the collegiate arena, but more so from his      own family.       ``I don't know if Kimberly (Colegrove's only child)      remembers this or not, but she was talking to me and I guess      I drifted off in my own thoughts,'' he said. ``She squared me      up--which in the Army is when you take someone's face in your      hands. She turned my head so I was looking her straight in      the eyes and she kept on talking. She showed me that I needed      to listen to her.''       Oddly enough, Colegrove's second lesson came from      Kimberly's son, William.       ``William Joyce made this in a Sunday School class,''      Colegrove explained while he took out a handmade set of ears.      ``It's a paper plate cut in two with a piece of pipe cleaner      connecting it. The paper plate has two ears drawn on it and I      guess the pipe cleaner is to do this.''       Putting the piece across his head, Colegrove demonstrated      how the ``listening ears'' worked. Amid the laughter of the      crowd, he reminded everyone that ``listening is an empowering      ability.''                          ____________________
