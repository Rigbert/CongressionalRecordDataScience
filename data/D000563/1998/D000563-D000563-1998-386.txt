President, no Senator from the State of Illinois could rise on February 12 without noting the birth date of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln never served in the Senate, although he did serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of his most famous political experiences was in 1858 when he ran against Stephen Douglas for the Senate seat which I am honored to occupy. Lincoln lost that election. Of course, following the course of the lengthy debates with Douglas, which became part of the legend of American politics and an important part of our history, by 1860 Lincoln was elected President. And we all know his leadership was so critical in one of our Nation's greatest hours.  We in Illinois dote on Abraham Lincoln. We have his name on license plates. In my hometown, we are consumed with the Lincoln legend and with all that he has given to the State and to the Nation. I hope that those who are witnessing the events in this Chamber today will reflect for a moment on this great man and the great legacy he left to the United States. Lincoln was known very well for his leadership at the time the Nation was in great peril with the Civil War. He did so many things with vision, and I think it is a perfect lead in to my reason for standing before the Senate today. I hope those of us who are in successor generations to Abraham Lincoln can rise to the challenges and can show the same type of vision and leadership on the challenges now facing Americans across the country.                          ____________________
