Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.  What the gentleman from Michigan is saying is this is a good amendment but not good enough. I think if it is a good amendment, it ought to be supported; and I know my cosponsor, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), will tell us it is a very good amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher).
