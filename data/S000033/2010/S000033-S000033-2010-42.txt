 President, I am going to be talking about a very serious crisis of offshoring, but before I do, I want to say a word about the budget. I am glad to hear my Republican colleagues being so very concerned about our budget deficit. My question is, where were they during the Bush administration when the budget debt of this country nearly doubled? We went to a war in Iraq, which some of us voted against, which will end up costing this country $3 trillion--unpaid for. I did not hear a concern at that point.  They gave many hundreds of billions of dollars to the top 1 percent in tax breaks, unpaid for. We didn't hear about the national debt concern there.  They brought forth legislation to bail out Wall Street, unpaid for; they passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug program, unpaid for.  I am very glad today our Republican friends are concerned about the deficit and the national debt. It would have been helpful to this country if they had been concerned about that issue 5 or 6 years ago, while they were in the process of doubling our national debt.  But the issue I did want to talk about this evening is, as I think most people understand, the middle class of this country----
