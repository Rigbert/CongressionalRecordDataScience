 While I agree with the goals of NASA consolidation to save taxpayers money, I have strong concerns that this aircraft consolidation plan could cost more than it would save. The current aircraft consolidation plan drafted by NASA considers the costs of moving the aircraft to Dryden Flight Research Center, but does not include the costs to operate these aircraft from their consolidated location.
