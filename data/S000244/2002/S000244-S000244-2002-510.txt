Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment, which effectively excludes private attorney general claims from the provisions of H.R. 2341.  Allowing citizens to use private rights of actions as a class is an enormous loophole in this law that can be easily accessed and lead to continued abuses in local courts, even in California.  Now, let me say when we are talking about diversity jurisdiction as established in the Constitution, we are talking about claims between plaintiffs in different States and defendants in different States, so if all the plaintiffs lived in California and the defendant was living in California, there would be no Federal diversity jurisdiction whatsoever and the case would be tried in the California court.  However, the Federal courts were intended by the Framers in diversity jurisdiction to get away from having a State court be the hometown umpire and thus favoring litigants from the State where the court sat. So if I had a claim and were potentially a member of a class as a citizen of the State of Wisconsin, I really would not appreciate very much one of these private attorney general actions litigating my claim in a California court which is 1,500 miles away from my State. I would end up having my rights litigated and my remedies extinguished as a citizen of Wisconsin in a court that I might not think I would get a fair trial in.  Now, under H.R. 2341, I, as a citizen of Wisconsin, if I were a defendant in this action, would have the right to remove the case into a Federal court and even the playing field.  Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to realize that every case that arises under diversity jurisdiction arises under State law. Cases that arise under Federal law jurisdiction, the jurisdiction is in the Federal courts, and they can automatically be removed simply because a Federal question is posed. So diversity jurisdiction applies where no Federal question is posed, but you have plaintiffs and defendants who live in different States and are citizens of different States.  Now, I think that in order to protect the nonresident litigants, there ought to be a procedure to remove those types of private attorney general class action claims into Federal court. The bill provides that procedure. The gentlewoman from California wants to eliminate that procedure, and that means that those of us who happen to be either plaintiffs in a class action or a defendant in one of these private attorney general actions in a State like mine that does not allow them will end up having the case litigated in a court that might be thousands of miles away from where we live and would have the hometown bias.                              {time}  1430  That is not what this bill should be about, and that is why I hope this amendment will be defeated.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
