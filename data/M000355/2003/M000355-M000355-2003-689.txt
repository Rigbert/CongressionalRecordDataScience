 President, I want to make sure my friend from Mississippi is aware that, in fact, there was a joint hearing on February 11 between the Judiciary Committee and the Labor Committee on this subject. There has been a recent hearing. Of course, in previous Congresses, there have been numerous hearings on this subject for as long as the Senator from Mississippi and I have been Members of the Senate.
