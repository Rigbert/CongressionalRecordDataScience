Speaker, I rise to speak about an outstanding public servant who willsoon be retiring after nearly forty-eight years of service to our nation.  Robert G. Mahony was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and attended the University of Notre Dame. When he graduated, in 1961, Bob was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army. He attended law school at Loyola University Chicago and earned his J.D. in 1965. For the following two years, Bob served on active duty, including a combat tour in Vietnam. After returning home, he became a member of the Army Reserves and transferred to the Judge Advocate General Corps.  Service in the military was only the beginning for Bob. In 1967, he began work as a trial attorney for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice here in Washington. After nine years there, he spent a year in private practice and was subsequently appointed as an Administrative Law Judge at the Department of Labor, serving in that capacity for twenty years. Since 1997, Bob has been an Administrative Law Judge at the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Throughout his civilian career, Bob remained in the Army Reserves, serving with distinction as the Commander of the 10th Military Law Center and later as Staff Judge Advocate for the 97th Army Reserve Command at Fort Meade. He retired as a Colonel in 1991 and received the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements. Bob is also a holder of the Vietnam Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal from the former South Vietnamese government.  Bob's commitment to public service extends as well to involvement in the community. He has served for over three decades as an official of the Northern Virginia Swimming League and for over twenty-five years as a basketball coach with the Braddock Road Youth Club, Saint Mary's Academy in Alexandria, the Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Annandale, and the Holy Trinity School in Washington.  Bob and his wife, Margaret, have been married for forty-four years and instilled in their four children a love of public service. I have borne witness to this, since their daughter, Gina, used to work on my staff.  Bob Mahony will retire from government service on January 3 after forty-seven years, eleven months, and twelve days. I join in thanking him for his dedicated service to our country and wishing him all the best in his retirement. Like all of our public servants, he can look back on his career and know he made a real difference in the lives of many Americans and the life of our nation.                          ____________________
