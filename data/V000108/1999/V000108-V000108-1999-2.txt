Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity and would point out, as was stated in the resolution, we have a responsibility under Article I, Section 8, as far as the conduct of trade policy. In the 103rd Congress, the United States Congress did act and the President signed into law what the agenda of the WTO Seattle round of negotiations should be.  It is clear that our trading partners now want to usurp the position we have taken in statutory language in the United States of America by debating whether or not we are to eliminate or weaken our anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. That is contrary to the announced policy and statutory policy of the United States of America.  This is not a trivial matter. In 1947, under the Bretton Woods negotiations, the GATT condemned anti-dumping and anti-subsidy activities.  I am very concerned that if a resolution is not brought forth to a vote on this floor, our constitutional prerogatives will be usurped, and I would ask that the Chair rule in my favor.
