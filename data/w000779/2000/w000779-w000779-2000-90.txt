President, today I am introducing legislation which was actually authored by Senators Nickles and Hatch, and which they have entitled the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' Their bill which I am now introducing is identical to H.R. 2260 as reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 27, 2000, as amended. Today, it has been referred by the Senate Parliamentarian to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP).  While I remain steadfastly opposed to the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000,'' I am introducing this bill for one reason: to call the Senate's attention to the fact that a far-reaching health policy bill--which many experts believe has the potential to sentence millions of sick and dying patients across the nation to needless pain and suffering--was mistakenly referred to a committee with insufficient health policy resources and no health policy jurisdiction. It is that bill which the Judiciary Committee reported and which, without consideration by the committee with health expertise, the Republican leadership wants to bring to the floor. The unintended consequence of this could be the tragic decline of the quality of pain care across our nation.  Some historical context might help my colleagues and their staff better understand how the Senate finds itself in this unfortunate situation, and the important issues that are at stake. On two separate occasions, the State of Oregon passed a ballot measure that would allow terminally ill persons, with less than six months left to live, to obtain a physician-assisted suicide if they met a variety of safeguard requirements. As a private citizen, I voted twice with the minority of my state in opposition to that measure.  In response to Oregon's vote, several of our congressional colleagues, including Senator Nickles, Senator Lieberman, and Congressman Henry Hyde, promptly undertook legislative and other efforts to overturn Oregon's law. I do not, for the purposes of today, debate the merits of the Oregon law, or the merits of physician-assisted suicide, generally.  The original ``Pain Relief Promotion Act,'' S. 1272, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Nickles, and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) on June 23, 1999. That committee held one inconclusive hearing on October 13, 1999, at which time it was reported that Senators on both sides of the aisle wished to investigate the matter more thoroughly before acting on the legislation.  Then, on November 19, 1999, Bob Dove, the Senate Parliamentarian, made what he termed ``a mistake'' when he referred H.R. 2260-- the virtually identical House-passed version of the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act''--to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Over the course of my service in the Senate, I have come to know Mr. Dove to be a man of integrity and fairness, and one of the most dedicated and enduring public servants in Washington, D.C. When he discovered his mistake, to his great credit, Mr. Dove did something all-too-rare in this town; he simply acknowledged his error. According to an article by the Associated Press on December 7, 1999, Mr. Dove stated plainly that he had mistakenly referred the bill to the Judiciary Committee, instead of the HELP Committee.  Lord knows I've made a few mistakes in my day, so I want to make clear that I harbor nothing but respect for Mr. Dove, and that I do not for one second question Mr. Dove's motives. But the mistake made on November 19, 1999, if left uncorrected, threatens unspeakably negative and long-lasting consequences for the future of health care in this nation.  The jurisdiction of the HELP Committee over the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' is clear. The Senate Manual describes the jurisdiction of this committee as including ``measures relating to education, labor, health, and public welfare''. The Senate Manual also describes the HELP Committee as having jurisdiction over aging, biomedical research and development, handicapped individuals, occupational safety and health, and public health.  According to the Senate Manual, the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee includes bankruptcy, mutiny, espionage, counterfeiting, civil liberties, constitutional amendments, federal courts and judges, government information, holidays and celebrations, immigration and naturalization, interstate compacts generally, judicial proceedings, local courts in territories and possessions, measures relating to claims against the United States, national penitentiaries, patent office, patents, copyrights trademarks, protection of trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies, revision and codification of the statutes of the United States, and state and territorial boundary lines.  The committee jurisdiction is not a close call, in this case. As the Senate's leading expert on jurisdiction has now demonstrated, this bill is fundamentally an issue of medical practice, which clearly is within the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee.  Congress has heard conflicting messages from respected medical experts on both sides of this debate about whether the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' may, in fact, have a chilling effect on physicians' pain management, thus actually increasing suffering at the end of life. Under the legislation, federal, state, and local law enforcement could receive training to begin scrutinizing physicians' end-of-life care. Many believe that the legislation sends the wrong signal to physicians and others caring for those who are dying, noting the disparity between the $5 million allotted for training in palliative care and the $80 million potentially available for law enforcement activities.  In addition, there is considerable concern that this legislation puts into statute perceptions about pain medication that the scientific world has been trying to change. Physicians often believe that the aggressive use of certain pain medications, such as morphine, will hasten death. Recent scientific studies show this is not the case. Dr. Kathleen M. Foley, Attending Neurologist in the Pain and Palliative Care Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology at the Cornell University, had this to say about the Nickles-Hatch legislation, ``In short, the underpinnings of this legislation are not based on scientific evidence. It would be unwise to institutionalize the myth into law that pain medications hasten death.''  Renowned medical ethicist, and Director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, Arthur L. Caplan, Ph.D., also appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25, 2000. He testified that: ``Doctors and nurses may not always fully understand what the law permits or does not, but when the issue requires an assessment of intent in an area as fraught with nuances and pitfalls as end of life care then I believe that this legislation will scare many doctors and nurses and administrators into inaction in the face of pain.''  Dr. Scott Fishman, the Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine and Associate Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of California Davis School of Medicine wrote of the Hatch substitute: ``It is ironic that the `Hatch substitute', which seeks to prevent physician assisted suicide, will ultimately impair one of the truly effective counters to physician assisted suicide, which is swift and effective pain medicine.''  Dr. Foley, who also assisted the Institute of Medicine committee that wrote the report ``Approaching Death,'' further testified that, ``The Pain Relief Promotion Act, by expanding the authority of the Controlled Substances Act, will disturb the balance that we have worked so hard to create. Physician surveys by the New York State Department of Health have shown that a strict regulatory environment negatively impacts physician prescribing practices and leads them to intentionally undertreat patients with painbecause of concern of regulatory oversight.''  The New England Journal of Medicine editorialized against these legislative approaches to overturning Oregon's law out of concern for its impacts on pain management nationwide, saying: ``Many doctors are concerned about the scrutiny they invite when they prescribe or administer controlled substances and they are hypersensitive to `drug-seeking behavior' in patients. Patients, as well as doctors, often have exaggerated fears of addiction and the side effects of narcotics. Congress could make this bad situation worse.''  It is worth noting that many people and organizations with expertise in pain management and palliative care are both opposed to physician assisted suicide and opposed to the Nickles-Hatch bill. There are over thirty organizations representing doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and patients who oppose the legislation, including: American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, American Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians; American Geriatrics Society; American Nurses Association; American Pain Foundation; American Pharmaceutical Association; American Society for Action on Pain; American Society of Health-System Pharmacists; American Society of Pain Management Nurses; College on Problems of Drug Dependence; Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association; National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain; Oncology Nursing Society; Society of General Internal Medicine; Triumph over Pain Foundation; California Medical Association; Massachusetts Medical Society; North Carolina Medical Society; Oregon Medical Association; Rhode Island Medical Association; San Francisco Medical Society; Indiana State Hospice and Palliative Care Association; Hospice Federation of Massachusetts; Kansas Association of Hospices; Maine Hospice Council; Maine Consortium of Palliative Care and Hospice; Missouri Hospice and Palliative Care Association; New Hampshire State Hospice Organization; New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization; New York State Hospice Organization; and, Oregon Hospice Association.  Physician-assisted suicide is not a cry for help from people experiencing the failure of patents, copyrights and trademarks. Physician-assisted suicide is a cry for help from people who, in many cases, are experiencing a failure in the health system. And those failures occur across our nation; not just in Oregon. In one study reported in the August 12, 1998, issue of JAMA, over 15 percent of oncologists admitted to participating in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. The February 1997 New England Journal of Medicine published a report finding that 53 percent of physicians in a large, San Francisco-based AIDS treatment consortium admitted assisting in a suicide at least once. Personally, I am troubled and saddened that so many of our loved ones are so dissatisfied with their end-of-life options that they seek physician-assisted suicide, instead.  Whether or not this Congress decides to overturn Oregon's law, I believe it is critical that whatever we do must result in a reduced demand for physician-assisted suicide, not only in Oregon, but across our nation. Many reputable experts believe the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' will cause physicians--far beyond Oregon's borders--to provide less aggressive pain care to their suffering and dying patients. If this occurs, not only will millions of our elderly and dying constituents suffer needlessly, we may unwittingly increase the demand for suicide at the end of life.  I urge my colleagues, regardless of where they stand on the issue of Oregon's law, to join with me in supporting the restoration of the HELP Committee's jurisdiction. It would be unconscionable for the Senate to fail to correct an honest mistake that could contribute to a devastatingly significant change in health policy. With so much at stake, shouldn't we follow the regular order of the Senate? Shouldn't we insist that the Senate's best qualified health policy experts fully consider the complex policy implications before taking such an extraordinary risk for our constituents, our friends, and our families?  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2607       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
