 Mr. Speaker, in 1 minute I cannot possibly do justice to our dear colleague and friend, Patsy Mink. But the other day in Ohio I had an experience; and I said, Patsy, if your amendment had passed, we would not be in this situation where we have hundreds, indeed thousands, of students lined up in our community awaiting admission to nursing school and they cannot be admitted because the Workforce Investment Act does not allow the funds to be used for education for career training, only for storage of people at bottom feeder jobs in this economy. I thought, Patsy, if your amendment had passed, thousands and thousands and thousands of people across this country who are in the unemployment lines, who are unable to advance their careers, would already be in the workforce. I thought, I miss you so much. You tried so hard.  What a great woman. She accomplished so much--Title IX, her leadership here on education issues, the first woman of color ever elected to the Congress of the United States. What an incisive intellect, what an intelligent and persevering woman and someone who made a difference in the lives of people across this country. It is my deepest, deepest privilege to say I support the proposal to name the post office in Hawaii in her name. She is missed every day here. We thank her, and we thank her family for her devoted service to our country.
