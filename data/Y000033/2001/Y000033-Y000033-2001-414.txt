Mr. Chairman, first, let me remind my colleagues that FEMA, which is also under my committee's jurisdiction, currently has $1.3 billion available in its emergency fund even after the recision goes into effect. I want my colleagues to remember that.  I would like to also say, Mr. Chairman, that we have to understand one thing, I was not here for the Toomey-Flake-Tancredo amendment; but it violates the guaranteed funding levels established in T21 and Air 21 by requiring an across-the-board cut for Federal spending programs.  Every State and every Member's highway transit project and urgently needed airport projects would be subject to reduced fundings. T21 and Air 21 have brought much-needed honesty and protections to those dedicated-user financed trust fund programs. This amendment attempts to thwart the will of Congress.  America's modus and airplane passengers have already paid for these programs in the form of dedicated-user taxes which are established to pay for transportation improvements.  Again, let me restate, FEMA has $1.3 billion available in its emergency fund right today. That amount should be sufficient to cut FEMA's emergency costs for the balance of the fiscal year.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a no vote on both of these amendments.
