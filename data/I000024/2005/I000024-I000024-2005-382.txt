President, first of all, let me say I was listening intently while the senior Senator from Utah talked about the F/A-22. I would like to add one thing that perhaps he assumes everyone is aware of, but I keep finding people are not aware of it, and that is the Chief of the Air Force now, General Jumper, not too long ago, I think 1997, made a very courageous observation. He called to the attention of the American people that the Russians were making--at that time he was referring to the Su-30, a strike vehicle, that it was actually better than anything we had in our inventory, our F-15 or F-16.  I think a lot of people assumed automatically that when we go onto the battlefield America has the very best of equipment. That is not true. It is kind of scary when you think about a strike vehicle that is out there that has greater capability than our very best and the fact that the American people expect the United States to have the best of everything.  I have talked on this floor many times about the fact that our artillery piece is not as good as one that is made in five different countries.
