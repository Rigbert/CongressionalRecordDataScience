 President, we were all saddened by the news that Tim Mitchell, a longtime member of the Democratic floor staff, passed away this past weekend after his heartbreaking battle with brain cancer. I know the Democratic leader will have more to say in just a moment, but I wanted to take a moment myself to reflect on Tim's Senate service and express our condolences to his family.  Last September, the former Democratic leader and I had the opportunity to recognize Tim for a remarkable 25 years of Senate service. As we noted then, Tim has long been a critical member of the Senate team who worked tirelessly with his colleagues on both sides to ensure that the floor operated smoothly and efficiently.  Despite his passion for this institution, however, we know that Tim's family always remained his top priority. I know his wife Alicia and his young son Ben know this as well. Our prayers are with them at this immensely difficult time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
