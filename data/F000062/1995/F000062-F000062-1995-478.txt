 President, I heard about 2:15 this afternoon that Senator Johnston was going to take the floor, so I picked up the phone and tried to reach him and missed him. I wanted to just say a few words.  I listened, back in my office, to what he had to say. I was thinking, back when this mayor from San Francisco in the mid-1980's came back to see the head of the Energy Committee. I had an opportunity and I walked into his office. I saw the pelicans. I did not even know if he would really listen to me. I found a human being who was open, who was gentle, who was kind, who was listening, and who was interested. Then, of course, in 1992 I came to this Senate and I found a man who was a leader of the U.S. Senate--certainly a leader on the Democratic side and I believe a leader in the Senate--who had worked for 22 years, who had established a reputation in this body.  I might say, many of the Members on our side, when we were discussing the California Desert Protection Act, said toward the close of the session, ``Don't worry. Watch Bennett. He is a master of the close.''  And as the months went on, the debate and the discussion on this bill, I saw indeed that Bennett Johnston was not only a master of the close, but was a master of strategy. I saw he is a man who is bright. He is a man who is articulate. But he is also somebody who is always a gentleman, always receptive, always able to say what he thinks in a way that brings the best from everyone around him.  So, Bennett Johnston, I want to say to you: In the few days we have been back, this is the worst news I have heard. Even worse than the Contract With America, in many respects. I am just so sorry that this is going to happen. But there is one thing I do know: Even if you have made up your mind there are still 2 years, so we will be hearing much more from Bennett Johnston, the master of the close.  I yield the floor.
