President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, Robert Hawkes Gray. Bob, as he is known to family and friends, grew up in Putney where his parents worked at the Putney School. His father, Edward, was in charge of buildings and grounds, and his mother, Mabel, ran the kitchen. Ed's ability to fix anything and Mabel's cooking and way of keeping order are remembered vividly and fondly to this day by thousands of Putney graduates.  Bob attended Putney where he learned to ski cross-country thanks to Olympian skier John Caldwell, the father of cross-country skiing in America who taught at the school. Bob went on to run the outdoor work program at Putney and coached cross-country skiing and running. He became an Olympian himself, competing in the 1968 and 1972 winter games, and was inducted into Vermont's Ski and Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame.  After skiing, Bob's lifetime passion has been farming. He and his wife, Kim, own and manage Four Corners Farm, one of the most successful vegetable and dairy farms in Vermont. Located on a beautiful hillside that levels off along the Connecticut River in South Newbury, the sprawling acreage of the farm is a model of order and astonishing productivity. Just about anything that will grow in Vermont, either in fields or in greenhouses heated by wood stoves, can be found there in abundance.  Everyone knows that farm work is hard by any standard. It means rising before sunrise and long hours of strenuous physical labor that continues into the night. Anyone who visits Four Corners Farm can't help but wonder how they do it all. It is a testament to the benefits of regular physical exercise, as Bob, now 76, looks closer to 60 and has the strength of someone half his age. It wasn't all due to farming though. It is said that, when Jack Dempsey was the world heavyweight champion, Ed Gray's biceps measured the same diameter. Of course, Ed was an accomplished gardener himself.  I could go on about Bob's talents as a farmer. A teacher by instinct, anyone who visits the farm may find themselves treated to a lesson in pruning tomato plants, planting and mulching strawberry seedlings, or the peculiar habits of honey bees. Kim, a former alpine ski racer herself, is also a gifted farmer whose stamp on the business can be seen everywhere. Neither could have made Four Corners Farm what it is today without the other.  Bob never stopped skiing for fun, but he didn't take up racing again until the 1990s. This past winter he showed that, if you love something enough and give it everything you have got, just about anything is possible.  At the World Masters cross-country ski races in Voukatti, Finland, and at the National Masters at Royal Gorge, CA, Bob won a gold medal, two silvers, and a bronze. Some might think that, by the time you get to be 76, you are probably skiing pretty slowly and there isn't that much competition in your age group anyway. Let's just say that at the Masters no one skis slowly--no one skis anything remotely like slowly. These are the best skiers in the world, and to the rest of us mere mortals, there isn't that much difference between them and today's Olympians.  A March 31, 2016, article in the Valley News, entitled ``Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins'' tells the story. I congratulate Bob Gray. He exemplifies the very best of Vermont for his inspiring work ethic, his ski racing accomplishments, and the example he has set for future generations of Vermont skiers and farmers. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Valley News, Mar. 31, 2016]               Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins              (By Jared Pendak, Valley News Staff Writer)       Newbury, VT.--Bob Gray returned to cross country skiing      several years ago, primarily as a way to keep his heart      pumping. As it turned out, he's more than capable of breaking      the hearts of opponents.       Gray, 76, recently swept a pair of races at the National      Masters Championships in Soda Springs, Calif., winning the      Masters 5B (ages 75-79) 10K classic race on March 19 in 33      minutes, 58.6 seconds, more than nine minutes faster than      runner up Hans Muehlegger, of Idaho, and good for 20th      overall in a field of 53.       The next day, Gray placed fifth overall while winning his      70-79 age group in the season-ending U.S. Marathon National      Championship, finishing the 14K bronze race in 48:12.1--again      more than nine minutes ahead of Muehlegger.       A two-time Olympian who competed on the U.S. Nordic Ski      Team from 1960-74, Gray had also swept both events in the      2015 National Masters Championships, held closer to home at      the Craftsbury (Vt.) Nordic Center.       ``There isn't much competition for my age group in that      event,'' said Gray, who co-owns the Four Corners produce and      dairy farm in Newbury, Vt. ``I'd like to think part of it is      that I'm in pretty good shape.''       Gray's competition was stiffer last month at the Masters      World Cup in Vuokatti, Finland, where he left with two silver      medals and a bronze. On Feb. 6, he bettered 75-year-old      Frenchman Daniel Chopard by two seconds for second place in      the 10K skate in 33:40, then beat Chopard by 35 seconds with      a time of 47:34.1 in the 15K skate Feb. 12.       Norwegian Finn Magnar Hagen decidedly won both skate races,      finishing the 10K a good 2:40 ahead of Gray and besting him      in the 15K by nearly four minutes.       ``There was just no catching Finn; he was just gone,'' said      Gray. ``On the other hand, me and Chopard had a great time      going back and forth. We'd pass each other and say, `All      right, I'll see you up ahead on the hill.' ''       Neither Hagen nor Chopard competed in the 5K classic on      Feb. 8, a race in which the top four were separated by just      17 seconds. Russia's Gennady Ushakov won in 18:10.9, followed      by Austrian Josef Schniagl, Gray (18:19.7) and Finland's      Taplo Wallenkus (18:27.9).       ``I think I had a chance to win that race, but my skis just      weren't up to par with some of the skis these other guys      had,'' Gray said. ``I made one tactical error, started      kicking too lightly and it got me off-track. I was still able      to make up most of the places I lost and close the gap. It      was a close race, a fun race.''       Gray, a Vermont Ski & Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame      inductee whose wife, Kim, is a former U.S. Alpine skier,      competed in the 1968 and '72 Olympic Games. His best finish      was 12th place in the 4x1OK relay in the '68 Games in      Grenoble, France, complementing three combined top-50s in      individual events at Grenoble and the '72 Games in Sapporo,      Japan.       The Putney, Vt., native also skied four seasons in the FIS      Cup (now known as the FIS World Cup), winning national titles      in the 15K and 50K and earning the top U.S. ranking in 1973.       The Grays opened the Green Mountain Touring Center in      Randolph in 1977 while running their first farm in Hartland      Four Corners, inspiring the moniker they kept even after      moving operations to their plot in Newbury.       Bob Gray later had about a 12-year hiatus from the sport      while devoted to raising the couple's three children and      farming, not strapping on skis again until the early 1990s.       He competed off and on in various national and      international competitions, capturing bronze at an event in      Quebec City in 2001 and two silvers and a bronze five years      later in British Columbia. He began refocusing on training      and competing in earnest several years ago, motivated equally      by the desire to keep his heart rate up as much as keeping      his competitive juices going.       ``When you get older, if you don't keep moving, you get      sick and die,'' Gray said plainly. ``So much of your health      is about staying active and exercising. I get some of that on      the farm, but I'm much more of a manager type now than I used      to be. So (returning to skiing) is a way to keep my heart      beating.''       Like any snow sports athlete based in the area, Gray faced      challenges finding suitable surfaces to train on this winter.      He ventured to Craftsbury Nordic Center at times to practice      on their manmade trails, but most often settled for dry-land      exercises.       ``I'd go up (North Haverhill's) Black Mountain, Mount      Moosilauke, sometimes Mount Ascutney, always with ski poles      to help practice balance,'' Gray said. ``I'd go uphill on     paved roads on rollerblades--I like rollerblades better than      roller skis. I can go from here up Snake Road to West      Newbury, which is about three miles, so that's perfect. The      only problem with that is that I'm too tired to skate home      after that so I have to have someone come get me.''       Gray, who was trained in his youth by former Dartmouth      skier and Olympian John Caldwell, would like to see more kids      today on Nordic skis. He's given lessons in recent years at      Strafford Nordic Center and elsewhere.       ``It's a great sport, a great way to get kids off of the      couch or away from the computer,'' Gray said. ``Plus, you can      do it until you're my age.''                          ____________________
