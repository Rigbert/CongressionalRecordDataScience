President, Senator McConnell has proposed an amendment to the immigration bill to modify the Help America Vote Act of 2002, ``HAVA'', by mandating that all States require government-issued photo identification from voters at polling places. Senator McConnell's amendment raises serious concerns by putting the policy ahead of the groundwork necessary to determine how and whether such a step should be taken.  I do not see his justification for attaching that proposal to this measure or to get ahead of the implementation of the REAL ID Act or recommendations by the Carter-Baker commission.
