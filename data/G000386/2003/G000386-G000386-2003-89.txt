 President, I rise today in honor of a fellow Iowan and a true American hero PVT Kurt R. Frosheiser. Private Frosheiser was killed while serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom on November 8, 2003, when his humvee was struck by an improvised explosive device in Baghdad. Private Frosheiser was only 22 years old at the time of his death.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate, my fellow Iowans, and all Americans to join me today in paying tribute to Private Frosheiser for his bravery and for his dedication to the cause of freedom. Private Frosheiser had a deep desire to serve his country, and we are all indebted to him for his service and for his sacrifice.  In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Private Frosheiser's mother, Jeanie Hudson, said the following about her son: ``He loved this land and its principles. He loved Iowa. It's an honor to give my son to preserve our way of life.''  Throughout our history, we have found extraordinary men and women who are willing to give their lives to defend our country and families willing sacrifice those who they love most to the cause of freedom. It is with great sadness, but also great pride, that I honor one such patriot today on the floor of the Senate, PVT Kurt Frosheiser.  Today we honor a fallen patriot, but we must also remember to pay tribute to the loved ones whose grief we share. My deepest sympathy goes out to the members of Private Frosheiser's family, to his friends, and to all those who have been touched by his untimely passing. May his mother, Jeanie, his father, Chris, his step-father, Daniel, his sister, Erin, and his twin brother, Joel, be comforted with the knowledge that they are in the thoughts and prayers of many Americans, and that they have the eternal gratitude of an entire nation.  Kurt Frosheiser did not die in vain. He died defending the country he loved. May he always be remembered as a true American hero.                          Sgt Ross A. Pennanen
