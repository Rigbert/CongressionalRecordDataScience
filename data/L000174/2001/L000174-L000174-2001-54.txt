President, this week the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling interpreting a provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that will make it harder for Americans to protect their private financial data from identity theft. I rise today with the senior senator from Iowa to introduce the ``Protect Victims of Identity Theft Act'' to provide consumers in Vermont and across America with the protections that they need and deserve. I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership and look forward to working with him on this legislation.  Unfortunately, identity theft victimizes thousands of Americans every year. Once a skilled scam artist gets his hands on a consumer's Social Security or bank account number, he can wreak unimaginable havoc on a family's finances.  With society conducting more and more of its business electronically, the incidence of identity theft in America is on the rise. As of June of this year, the Federal Trade Commission reported that its identity theft hotline was answering over 1,800 calls per week, up from the 445 calls per week the hotline received in November 1999. These calls are mostly from people who have been hurt by identity theft, but thousands of others come from consumers worried about becoming an identity thief's next victim.  When Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act, FCRA, more than thirty years ago, it gave consumers important tools to ensure the accuracy and privacy of their credit information. The FCRA imposed affirmative obligations on the consumer reporting agencies that maintain these reports in order to protect consumers' private information from unauthorized disclosures. The FCRA says that consumer reporting agencies must maintain ``reasonable procedures'' to avoid improper use of a consumer's private information.  These safeguards are essential to protect each American's confidential financial information. The FCRA demands that consumer reporting agencies require that prospective users of credit information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which they are seeking the information, and verify that they will not use the information for any other purpose, to name just a few examples. Consumer reporting agencies that fail to live up to these obligations or that are careless with consumers' private information can be held liable to consumers harmed by their security lapses.  Current law provides consumers 2 years from the ``date on which the liability arises'' to bring suit against a non-compliant consumer reporting agency. This week, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the term ``the date on which liability arises,'' means the day that a consumer reporting agency fails to comply with FCRA's requirements. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 2001 WL 1401902 (Nov. 13, 2001). As a result, the statute of limitations clock starts ticking whether or not a consumer is aware that information about his finances has been illegally handled or disclosed. That means that the 2-year limitations period can expire before a consumer ever even suspects that her credit information has fallen into the wrong hands.  The 750,000 Americans who annually have their identity stolen and their credit put at risk deserve better. It is unfair for the law to only protect consumers if they discover the identity theft within 2 years of the crime, even if the consumer had no reason to know about it. That stands the normal rule of discovery for fraud on its head.  Our bipartisan legislation would clarify that the statute of limitations for identity theft does not start until the consumer discovers the problem or should have discovered the problem through the exercise of reasonable diligence. The exercise of reasonable diligence is the traditional common law duty under fraud discovery rules and does not impose any new mandate or requirement on a consumer under the FCRA. This change in the law ensures that consumers have a fair opportunity to vindicate their rights.  This bipartisan legislative fix is needed to put a stop to identity theft. It will encourage consumer reporting agencies to establish proper security measures needed to deny identity thieves access to Americans' most personal financial information. It ensures that the Fair Credit Reporting Act has real teeth to fulfill its mission of protecting the accuracy and privacy of consumer credit information. And it will give consumers in Vermont and across America a fair shot at vindicating their right to keep private information away from unscrupulous con artists.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1723       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Victims of Identity      Theft Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.       Section 618 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.      1681p) is amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 618. JURISDICTION OF COURTS; LIMITATIONS OF ACTIONS.       ``(a) In General.--An action to enforce any liability      created under this title may be brought in any appropriate      United States district court, without regard to the amount in      controversy, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction,      not later than 2 years after the date on which the violation      is discovered or should have been discovered by the exercise      of reasonable diligence.       ``(b) Willful Misrepresentation.--The limitations period      prescribed in subsection (a) shall be tolled during any      period during which a defendant has materially and willfully      misrepresented any information required under this title to      be disclosed to an individual, and the information so      misrepresented is material to the establishment of the      liability of the defendant to that individual under this      title.''.
