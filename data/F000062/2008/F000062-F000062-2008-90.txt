 President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to establish the third annual Endangered Species Day on May 16, 2008. I am introducing this resolution with Senators Collins, Cantwell, Lieberman, Clinton, Kerry, Brown, Snowe, Levin, Boxer, and Feingold whose co-sponsorship I appreciate.  I want to commend my constituent, Mr. David Robinson, who first suggested the establishment of an Endangered Species Day. Mr. Robinson is an example of people who really do make a difference.  The designation of Endangered Species Day will provide many wonderful opportunities for the public to familiarize themselves with the status and recovery efforts of endangered species in our country and around the world.  Last year, more than 50 events were held across the country to highlight endangered species success stories. The Governor of Maine, and the cities and counties of Santa Barbara, San Diego, and San Francisco also declared state and local Endangered Species Days. Zoos and aquariums across the country, such as the Roger Williams Zoo and the San Diego Wild Animal Park, also held educational events.  Based on the success of last year, I am confident that the events of this year's Endangered Species Day will continue to foster increased communication and awareness about many of the most endangered species by encouraging such activities as school field trips to the zoo or attending a lecture at the local library. In my city of San Francisco, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Farralones National Marine Sanctuary plan to hold special tours and viewings of endangered species to commemorate this special day.  Endangered Species recovery programs in California are examples of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore populations of California condor, the least Bell's vireo songbird, and the California gray whale. Over 300 species classified as either endangered or threatened currently call California home, and efforts to protect them will ensure that they continue to do so.  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more can be done. At this time, we have more than 5,000 threatened species in the U.S. and abroad, which receive protection. One small step is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the circumstances facing many of these endangered species and educating the public about them.  I am introducing this bill with the hope that Endangered Species Day can spark the wonder and interest in our youth to continue the conservation efforts we have begun, but still are far from finishing.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.                          ____________________
