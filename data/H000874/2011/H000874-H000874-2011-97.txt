                             {time}  1420  That's what the American people deserve. That's the difference between posturing on our fiscal future, as this vote today does, and leading on our fiscal future. I urge my colleagues, let's vote down this empty resolution which is a pretense, a pretend, a statement that we don't like debt. Nobody likes the debt we've incurred, and everybody ought to join together in paying it down.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue of responsibility. It's not easy. It's not always politically popular. We've incurred a debt. It is our responsibility collectively, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans to come together and pay down this debt and not pretend that simply by defeating a resolution, or passing a resolution of so-called disapproval--which is already a dead letter, and everybody on your side of the aisle knows it's a dead letter because the Senate has already voted.  This is just a statement that I don't like debt. None of us like debt. Let's join together and reduce it as we did in the nineties.
