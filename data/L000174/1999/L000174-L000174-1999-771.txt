President, I have worked for many years to try to keep the costs of prescription drugs down. Too many Americans are unable to afford the costly medications they need to stay healthy. Seniors in Vermont living on fixed incomes should not be forced to choose between buying food or fuel for heat, and paying for prescription drugs.  As part of this continuing effort, I am pleased to cosponsor the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999, which is being introduced today. This bill is an important step toward increasing the access of older Americans to the prescription drugs they need for their health and well-being. The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act will allow pharmacies to purchase prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries at the same discounted rates available to the federal government and large insurance companies. Seniors should no longer foot the bill for generous discounts to the favored customers of pharmaceutical companies. Under this legislation, seniors could see their medication costs decrease by more than 40 percent.  This is only the first step. We must begin to address the greater problem that the costs of most prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare. As drug costs skyrocketed 17 percent in the last year alone, paying for prescription drugs has become a tremendous out-of-pocket burden for seniors, who fill 18 prescriptions a year on average. I am encouraged by the debate on the Senate floor on the Budget Resolution which has focused on addressing the lack of a drug benefit. I will support efforts to include coverage of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. This is the right thing to do for seniors, and this is the right time to do it.
