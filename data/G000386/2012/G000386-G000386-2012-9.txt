 President, I will not use my entire time. If anybody else wants to speak, there will be time between now and 5:30 to speak. I think both these nominees will be approved overwhelmingly; obviously, the one with the voice vote probably will be, and I think the other one will be as well.  Today, the Senate turns to the confirmation of these two U.S. district judges.                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy  Before I address that issue, I express my condolences to the victims and families in Newtown, CT. As a nation, we join to express our grief and to offer support and comfort to this community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have suffered from this senseless act.  From time to time I have given my colleagues an update regarding the facts of judicial confirmations. Despite our steady progress on confirmations, we continue to hear complaints from bar associations, interest groups, editorial boards, and even some fellow Senators. Of course, these are the same groups that remained silent or at the time cheered on the efforts to block judicial nominees of the previous President. Multiple filibusters, failure to hold hearings, pocket filibusters of one sort or another, and other tactics of delay and obstruction were routinely used against President Bush's nominees. By the end of his Presidency, President Bush had 53 nominees who were not confirmed. That is nearly one out of every seven who were blocked. Somehow that history seems to have faded.  Today we continue to confirm this President's nominees, even in a lameduck Presidential election year. As I have stated before, the Senate rarely confirms judicial nominees during lameduck sessions in a Presidential election year. It did so in a very limited fashion in 1944, 1980, and the year 2004.  The last time a President was reelected--President Bush in 2004--only three judicial nominees were confirmed following the election.  That year, following President Bush's reelection, 23 judicial nominations that were pending either on the Senate executive calendar or in the Judiciary Committee were returned to the President when the Congress adjourned in December. Today President Obama will have 10 confirmations in this lameduck session, and obviously a lameduck session in a Presidential election year.  This is a new record. No other President can claim that success. So for those who say this President is being treated differently, I must agree. President Obama will have the most postelection judicial confirmations of any President.  This year has been a productive year for judicial confirmations. We have already confirmed 39 district judges and 5 circuit judges. Today's vote meets or exceeds the confirmations for Presidential election years in recent memory. During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate confirmed a total of 28 judges, 24 district and 4 circuit. This Presidential election year we have exceeded those numbers. We have confirmed 5 circuit nominees, and these confirmations will bring the district confirmations to 41. That is a total of 46 judges this year versus 28 in the last Presidential election year. In fact, going back to 1984, there has been only one Presidential election year in which more district judges were confirmed.  Let me emphasize that point. In only one of the past Presidential elections have more district nominees been confirmed. During this Congress, the 112th, we have confirmed 106 judges. That is the third highest total for any Congress going back to 1989 or, in other words, the past 12 Congresses. In total, the Senate has confirmed 168 district and circuit nominees during this President's first term. So I think by any objective measure one would have to conclude we are treating this President and his nominees quite fairly.  I stated at the beginning of my remarks, I expect these nominees to be fairly noncontroversial or totally noncontroversial. I intend to support them.  Today we vote on the nomination of Fernando M. Olguin, to be United States District Judge for the Central District of California and Thomas M. Durkin, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.  After graduating from University of California Berkeley School of Law in 1989, Judge Olguin clerked for the Honorable C.A. Muecke, U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Arizona. In 1991, Judge Olguin began working as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. There he prosecuted violations of the Fair Housing Act and the Public Accommodations Act.  From 1995 to 2001, Judge Olguin was a partner at Traber, Voorhees & Olguin, where he litigated housing and employment cases on behalf of underprivileged clients. Since 2001 he has served as a United States Magistrate Judge for the Central District of California.  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a rating of Substantial Majority Qualified, Minority Not Qualified.  Mr. Durkin received his B.S. with honors from University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 1975 and his J.D. with honors from DePaul University College of Law in 1978. Upon graduation, he clerked for Stanley J. Roszkowski, United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois. After his clerkship, Mr. Durkin joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois. There, he handled a variety of cases, including bank robbery, postal theft, narcotics, immigration cases, firearms cases, commodities, securities and tax fraud, and political corruption. Mr. Durkin also held a number of supervisory roles in the office, including Deputy Chief of Special Prosecutions, Chief of the Criminal Receiving and Appellate Division, Chief of the SpecialProsecutions Division, and First Assistant United States Attorney.  In 1993, Mr. Durkin joined Mayer Brown and focused on white collar criminal defense, internal investigations, patent litigation, securities litigation, civil rights litigation, consumer class action litigation, and product liability litigation. According to his questionnaire, Mr. Durkin has exclusively been a litigator and has frequently been in court his entire career. He estimates that he has tried approximately 95 cases to verdict.  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a Unanimous Well Qualified rating.  I support these nominees and congratulate them on their votes for confirmation.
