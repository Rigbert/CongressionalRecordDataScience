President, last month's dire economic news is a call to urgent action to get America working again. In August, our Nation produced no net new jobs. Productivity fell. Home sales fell. Construction spending fell. The manufacturing index declined. Unemployment is stagnant at 9.1 percent, and consumer confidence is plummeting.  Businesses, our Nation's job creators and the engine of any lasting economic growth, have been saying for some time that the lack of jobs is largely due to a climate of uncertainty, most notably the uncertainty and cost created by new Federal regulations.  The Regulatory Time-Out Act, which I am introducing today with 16 of my colleagues, provides job creators with a sensible breather from these burdensome new regulations. This would give businesses time to get back on their feet, create the jobs that Americans so desperately need, and enhance the global competitiveness of American workers.  Let me make clear that we also need to reform the process for issuing regulations. Earlier this year I proposed the CURB Act, which stands for Clearing Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens. The CURB Act would require agencies to examine the costs and benefits of proposed rules, prohibit them from attempting to set rules through unofficial guidance documents--thus circumventing the public notice and comment period--and provide businesses with relief from first-time paperwork violations when no harm comes from the violation. Senators Barrasso and Roberts joined me in introducing this bill.  Indeed, as I am sure you are aware, many of our colleagues have recognized the need to reform the regulatory process and have introduced their own proposals. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has already held three hearings on regulatory reform this year, and I expect this issue will be a priority for our committee this fall.  But the fact is, our economy cannot wait for Congress to complete an overhaul of the regulatory process. If we want to create more jobs, we must act now. We must send a clear signal to the job creators that we have heard them. That is why I believe we must have a timeout from any significant new regulation that would have an adverse impact on jobs, the economy, or our international competitiveness.  Under my bill, no significant final rule that would have an adverse impact could go into effect during a 1-year moratorium. This timeout would cover major rules costing more than $100 million per year, and other rules that have been considered ``significant'' under Executive orders going back to President Clinton and followed by President George W. Bush and President Obama.  Let me give an example of a rule that would be covered by the 1-year moratorium I am proposing. A rule that would be covered by this definition is EPA's Boiler MACT rule. I am sure the Presiding Officer is familiar with this rule. This one regulation, if it were fully implemented, could cost Maine's employers alone hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, as the Wall Street Journal has recently reported, a jobs study just released shows that Boiler MACT, along with other pending air regulations, could cause 36 pulp and paper mills around the country to close, putting more than 20,000 Americans out of work. That is 18 percent of that industry's workforce. That shows you the potent and terrible impact excessive regulation can have on job preservation and job creation.  And that is just for starters. Once these mills close, the businesses that supply them would also be forced to lay off workers. Estimates are that nearly 90,000 Americans would lose their jobs, wages would drop by $4 billion, and government at all levels would see revenues decline by a staggering $1.3 billion.  That is why, along with Senator Ron Wyden, I have introduced a Boiler MACT bill that 24 of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have already cosponsored. Our bill has been endorsed by 292 employer organizations and individual businesses--292 businesses and organizations representing employers. That shows you how worried our job creators are about the impact of just this one set of rules. Their letter sums up the impact of the Boiler MACT rule very plainly. It says:       These rules place at risk tens of thousands of high-paying      manufacturing jobs that our Nation cannot afford to lose.  The Boiler MACT regulations are exactly the kind of significant rules that my Regulatory Time-Out Act is intended to reach. The moratorium applies to rules issued by independent regulatory agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board as well as executive branch departments.  The impact of the regulatory burden under President Obama can be seen in the pages of the Federal Register. As my colleagues know, the Federal Register is the publication for all Federal regulations. Last year alone, the Federal Register expanded by nearly 82,600 pages, a level higher than any year under President Bush. Worse yet, the Obama administration has 144 rules in the pipeline that would each cost the economy at least $100 million. This isnearly twice as high as the number of such rules that were in the pipeline each year of the Bush administration.  Let me clarify that the legislation I am proposing exempts those rules that are needed in emergencies such as imminent threats to public health or safety, as well as rules that are necessary to enforce our criminal laws, and with respect to military or foreign affairs. I think it is important that I put that on the record.  It also exempts rules that would reduce the regulatory burden, in order to help the private sector create jobs and boost the ability of American workers to compete. Unfortunately, those rules that actually reduce regulatory burdens and promote jobs are few and far between.  Finally, my bill requires that within 10 days of passage, agencies and departments must submit to Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget the list of rules they believe are exempt from the 1-year moratorium. That is important to make sure the intent of the law is followed and that Congress and the administration can exercise appropriate oversight.  The intent of my bill is to lift the cloud of uncertainty that is causing employers to be cautious and to refrain from creating jobs--jobs our economy desperately needs.  During the August recess, I asked employers throughout the great State of Maine what it would take to encourage them to add jobs. To a person, no matter what line of business these employers were in, no matter what the size of their workforce, each one of them replied that Washington needed to stop imposing crushing new regulations; that these job creators needed stable progrowth economic policies; that they needed an end to the uncertainty that was hampering their decisionmaking.  I am pleased that the Regulatory Time-Out Act has been endorsed by the NFIB, our Nation's largest small business advocacy group, and by the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. My bill has also been welcomed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has stated:       American businesses need immediate relief. A ``time out''      would allow both the regulators and the regulated to take a      deep breath and ensure that regulations are not destroying      jobs and economic growth.  I agree completely. I will ask that the letters from the NFIB, the SBEC, and the statement by the Chamber of Commerce, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I am honored to have the following colleagues as cosponsors of this 1-year regulatory moratorium: Senators Alexander, Barrasso, Blunt, Boozman, Chambliss, Coats, Coburn, Cornyn, Hoeven, Hutchison, Isakson, Kirk, Kyl, Moran, Roberts and Thune.  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Regulatory Time-Out Act, which is a critical step toward easing the regulatory uncertainty and costs that are keeping our job creators from getting Americans back to work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that materials of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                September 6, 2011.     Hon. John A. Boehner,     House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry M. Reid,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner; Minority Leader Pelosi; Majority      Leader Reid; Minority Leader McConnell: We are writing to      express our united and strong support for H.R. 2250 and S.      1392, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011,'' bipartisan      legislation to address the serious concerns that remain with      EPA's Boiler MACT rules. As they exist today, the final      Boiler MACT rules will have serious economic impacts on a      vast array of facilities across the industrial, commercial      and institutional sectors. These rules place at risk tens of      thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs that our nation      cannot afford to lose.       As finalized, the Boiler MACT rules are unaffordable, just      as the proposed rules were. The rules are not achievable for      real-world boilers across the range of fuels and operating      conditions. EPA also has created a presumption that materials      commonly used as fuels are wastes subject to the extremely      costly and stigmatizing incinerator standards. This would not      only impose billions of dollars in unreasonable costs, but it      also would cause millions of tons of valuable materials to be      diverted to landfills and replaced with fossil fuel--a bad      result for the environment.       As EPA has acknowledged, the rules were finalized with      serious flaws because EPA was forced to meet a strict court-     ordered deadline. The final Boiler MACT rule alone would cost      over $14 billion in capital for the manufacturing sector,      plus billions more in annual operating costs. Complying with      the incinerator standards could cost several billion dollars      more in capital.       Legislation is needed to resolve serious uncertainties and      vulnerabilities, including to:       Ensure the rules are stayed for an adequate and certain      period, as EPA's current administrative stay is being      challenged in court;       Allow EPA adequate time to re-propose the rules and get      them right, including time for stakeholders to conduct more      emissions testing and to avoid mistakes that occur when      rulemakings of this scope and importance are rushed and      become vulnerable to legal challenge;       Provide direction and support for EPA to use the discretion      it already has under the Clean Air Act and Executive Order      13563 to add flexibility and make the rules achievable;       Clarify that using non-hazardous materials as fuels does      not result in boilers being treated as incinerators; and       Give facilities more time to comply with the complex and      capital-intensive requirements of the rules.       If enacted, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act'' will provide      the much-needed certainty and time for EPA to get the rules      right and for businesses that will be investing billions of      dollars to rationally plan for the capital expenses. This      legislation will preserve jobs and the competitiveness of the      U.S. manufacturing sector while protecting the environment.       We urge you to pass this important legislation as soon as      possible and send it to the President for his signature.

In a study to be released Wednesday, the group is taking      aim at an Environmental Protection Agency rule to cut      pollution from factory boilers, saying the regulation will      cause 36 U.S. paper and pulp mills to close. The study comes      on the heels of a decision by Mr. Obama to jettison another      EPA air quality rule related to ozone that industry      complained would kill millions of jobs.       The so-called boiler rule has come under sharp attack from      both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as      industry, which say the regulations would be too costly and      difficult to implement. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor      included the rule in his list of 10 ``job-destroying      regulations'' that he has vowed to fight.       The boiler rule would affect paper mills, refineries,      chemical factories and other facilities that use boilers,      such as universities, hospitals and apartment buildings.      Boilers are on-site generators that can provide energy for      facilities and factories. Bipartisan legislation is now      pending in the House and Senate to delay implementation of      the rule, with the aim of having EPA reconsider the      regulation.       The AF&PA study, conducted by Fisher International, looked      at how many mills would be in danger of closing if they had      to comply with the new air quality regulations and install      new pollution controls. The study found 36 mills would have      to close, impacting 18% of the industry's workforce.       Supporters of the rule say the benefits far outweigh the      costs and counter job loss claims by saying the new controls      being required could provide an economic boost.       ``Industry is trying to leverage fears about the economic      impact and jobs and ignoring that pollution controls are made      and installed here in the U.S.,'' said Paul G. Billings, vice      president of national policy and advocacy for the American      Lung Association.       Gina McCarthy, a top EPA official, is expected to testify      Thursday before a U.S. House subcommittee about the rule. The      agency, which has touted the health benefits of the rule, has      delayed issuing final regulations, saying it needs more time      for public input. That's frustrated environmental and public-     health groups, which say the rules would save lives and help      avoid thousands of heart and asthma attacks.       John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources      Defense Council, said the boiler rule is critical because it      will cut mercury and other toxic air emissions from      incinerators and boilers at industrial facilities. ``The the      reason it's important is those sectors are one of only a      handful that still have not had lawful toxic emission      standards adopted for them under the 1990 clean air act      amendments,'' he said.       Donna Harman, president and CEO of AF&PA, said the rule      will hurt an already hard-hit sector and said lawmakers and      regulators should give the industry more time and impose a      less stringent standard.       ``We're not asking to not be regulated. We're asking to      have a regulation that can be achieved based on the      technology that's currently available,'' she said.                                  ____                                        The National Foundation of                                         Independent Business,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The National Federation of      Independent Business is pleased to support the Regulatory      Time-Out Act. This legislation provides small business      owners--who create roughly two-thirds of the net new jobs in      America--with relief from burdensome regulations for a period      of one year.       The bill would impose a one-year moratorium on      ``significant'' new rules--those with a cost of $100 million      or more--from going into effect if those rules would have an      adverse impact on jobs, the economy, or America's      international competitiveness. These particular rules      generally come with considerable uncertainty, which inhibits      small businesses from making decisions that would help the      economy grow.       A recent study released by the U.S. Small Business      Administration showed that the cost of regulatory compliance      for the smallest businesses is 36 percent more than their      larger counterparts. The study estimates the cost of      compliance for small businesses to be $10,585 per employee      per year. Small businesses desperately need the help of      Congress to cut red tape.       Importantly, the Regulatory Time-Out Act would not prevent      important rules that address imminent threats to human health      or     safety or other emergencies, or that apply to the criminal      justice system, military or foreign affairs. Nor would the      legislation prevent rules which foster private sector job      creation and the enhancement of the competitiveness of the      American worker, or which otherwise reduce the regulatory      burden.       The Regulatory Time-Out Act that you have introduced is a      prudent step toward providing small business owners with the      certainty they need to create jobs for Americans. NFIB looks      forward to working with you to help ensure that this      important legislation becomes law.           Sincerely,                                                    Susan Eckerly,     Senior Vice President, Public Policy.                                  ____                                                  Small Business &                                     Entrepreneurship Council,                                    Oakton, VA, September 8, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 100,000 members of      the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council),      I offer our strong support for ``The Regulatory `Time-Out'      Act.'' Given the severe fragility of the economy and dismal      job growth, placing a one-year moratorium on ``economically      significant'' rules is a commonsense strategy. Even in better      economic times, our economy and its competitiveness would      suffer under a regulatory onslaught of the current order.      Something must be done to counter the untamed and intrusive      rulemaking coming out of Washington. The ``Time-Out Act'' is      an approach that should warrant bipartisan support.       The torrent of new regulations being proposed by federal      agencies is generating significant uncertainty among our      nation's small business owners. Furthermore, once finalized,      these regulations will impose a substantial burden on      entrepreneurs, exacerbating existing financial pressures that      are a result of weak sales and higher business costs.       The number of ``major'' regulations issued last year is      unprecedented. Those costing the economy $100 million or more      number 224--an increase of 22 percent over 2009 and the      highest number on record. Many of these directly and      indirectly impact small business. Quite simply, our economy      and small businesses cannot absorb any more costs. As you      well know, the disproportionate cost of regulation places a      heavy burden on small firms. The ``Regulatory `Time-Out'      Act'' will help steady the rough economic and policy      environment that has so badly shaken entrepreneurs.       The ``Time-Out'' act provides consideration for rules that      address emergencies and imminent threats to human health and      safety, as well as those that would enhance the environment      for job creation, worker competitiveness or those that reduce      the regulatory burden. No one can label this legislation as      anything but smart, practical and essential.       Senator Collins, SBE Council appreciates your leadership.      Please let us know what we can do to help advance the      ``Regulatory `Time-Out' Act'' into law.           Sincerely,                                                   Karen Kerrigan,     President & CEO.                                  ____                   [From CHAMBERPOST, Sept. 8, 2011] U.S. Chamber Welcomes Sen. Collins' Proposed Regulatory Time-Out Bill                           (By Tom Collamore)       The U.S. Chamber welcomes Senator Susan Collins' proposed      legislation requiring a regulatory ``time-out.'' American      businesses have been overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of      burdensome and job-killing regulations. With another 4,257      regulations in the pipeline, American businesses need      immediate relief. A time-out would allow both the regulators      and the regulated to take a deep breath and ensure that      regulations are not destroying jobs and economic growth.       A regulatory ``time-out'' is one important step in stemming      the tidal wave of new regulations. Reforming the regulatory      process itself is another. Congress must bring fundamental      reform to the rulemaking process, some elements of which have      not been modernized in 65 years. We need permanent reforms to      the administrative process to ensure regulations are narrowly      tailored and impose the least amount of regulatory burden      needed to achieve congressional intent, are based on quality      data, and will not impede job creation and growth. Reforms      must also encourage Congress to exercise its essential      oversight over federal agencies to ensure they are carrying      out its intent.       We applaud Senator Collins for focusing on one of the most      important economic issues facing our economy--     overregulation--and look forward to working with her on her      regulatory time-out legislation.                                 ______                                       By
