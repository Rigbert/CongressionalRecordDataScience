President, one of the myths in this debate is that unless the Federal Government preempts State insurance laws, somehow millions of Americans will be unprotected in their disputes with HMOs. That is simply untrue. Ironically, my friend from Connecticut makes the point on emergency room care. Forty-four States have enacted legislation guaranteeing access to the nearest emergency room. But they have crafted their laws in different ways depending on the needs of those States. Why should the Federal Government second-guess those laws, substitute its judgment for the judgment of State legislators and Governors' offices all over this country? It does not make sense.
