 DOMENICI. As a matter of fact, I understand from conversations this morning, the conversations that preceded this letter, that they are in the process of rewriting rules and regulations for all of them, not just ISTEA, and I said, ``You better hurry up.''  We all know that they have to be rewritten. The minority community knows they have to be rewritten. This debate may have been avoidable. Had they written these both generic and specific rules, we might not have had this argument.  The answer I received, so the Senator will know, is that it is very difficult when you look at the whole array of programs. The Senator says there may be more than 160?  Mr. McCONNELL. Close to. Between 150 and 160.
