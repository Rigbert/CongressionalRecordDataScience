We are preparedto turn very shortly to consideration of the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations appropriation bill. I believe that would be the best vehicle for consideration of this issue, in the regular order, when we can consider all the policy ramifications for the entire, upcoming year. I can assure the Senator of our continued attention to this matter, and of thoughtful, thorough consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the Senator of Idaho's concerns, and give him my assurances that we will work together on this issue. Coming from a farming State myself, I fully understand his interests in the purchase of American grain by Israel. Senator Leahy and I anticipate that within the next few weeks the Subcommittee will mark up the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations bill, and we look forward to working with the Senator toward an acceptable resolution of this matter.
