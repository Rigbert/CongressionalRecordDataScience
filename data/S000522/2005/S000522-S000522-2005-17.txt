Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 238) honoring the victims of the Cambodian genocide that took place from April 1975 to January 1979, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 238       Whereas beginning in April 1975, Pol Pot led the Communist      guerilla group, the Khmer Rouge, in a large-scale insurgency      in Cambodia that forcibly removed Cambodians from their homes      and into labor camps in an attempt to restructure Khmer      society;       Whereas traditional Khmer culture and society were      systematically destroyed, including the destruction of      temples, schools, hospitals, homes, and historic buildings;       Whereas the Khmer Rouge separated and destroyed families      and punished and killed innocent civilians, including women,      children, doctors, nurses, clergy, teachers, business owners,      intellectuals and artisans;       Whereas more than 1.7 million Cambodians, or approximately      21 percent of the population, were killed in one of the worst      atrocities of the last century;       Whereas many people were executed simply for being      educated, wealthy, or even for wearing glasses as they were      seen as bourgeois or contaminated with Western influence;       Whereas after the Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown in      1979, thousands of Cambodians fled on foot to refugee camps      in Thailand and many refugees were processed again in other      camps in the Philippines and Indonesia;       Whereas from these refugee camps approximately 145,149      Cambodians made their way to the United States, with the      majority arriving in the early 1980s and settling in      communities across the United States;       Whereas despite the tremendous loss of family members,      homes, and even parts of their heritage during the Khmer      Rouge regime, Cambodians have shown courage and enormous      resiliency;       Whereas, according to United States Census Bureau figures,      there are approximately 206,053 Cambodians currently living      in the United States;       Whereas the new generation of Cambodian-Americans continues      to contribute to all aspects of American society as writers,      doctors, professors, and community leaders; and       Whereas the United Nations has taken affirmative steps to      establish an international criminal tribunal to bring to      justice the perpetrators of the Cambodian genocide: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) honors the victims of the genocide in Cambodia that      took place beginning in April 1975 and ending in January      1979; and       (2) welcomes the establishment of an international criminal      tribunal to bring to justice the perpetrators of the      Cambodian genocide, with the hope that proceedings of the      tribunal will meet international standards of justice.
