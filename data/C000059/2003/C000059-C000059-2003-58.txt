Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Mira Loma were exceptional. Mira Loma has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Bob was one of these individuals. On August 13, 2003, Bob passed away and the community of Mira Loma had to say good-bye to a man who forever changed their way of life.  Bob was a pillar of his community, having served as the President of the Mira Loma Chamber of Commerce for 8 years. As President, he worked relentlessly to promote small business and enrich the business environment of Mira Loma. Bob was also extremely supportive of Riverside County veterans and actively participated in Jurupa VFW events such as the annual golf tournament. The owner of a concrete placement and finishing company, he donated his time and materials to paving the driveway of the VFW at Glen Avon. His compassion and ability to give saw no bounds.  Bob was also passionate about 4-H and the Future Farmers of America. He worked to ensure that the kids were successful and enjoyed their experiences while participating in the organizations. He often organized pancake breakfasts for charity and founded the Community Citizens on Patrol. The citizens' group patrols Mira Loma and supports law enforcement and code enforcement agencies in Riverside County. His commitment to various groups throughout the community immeasurably improved the quality of life of the residents of Mira Loma.  As dedicated as Bob was to the community, Bob was also a devoted husband and father. His wife Gina and two daughters, Mary and Michelle, were the joy of his life. My thoughts are with them during this difficult time.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Bob Brison's life, we see a man dedicated to his family, community, and country. Bob's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Mira Loma, California. Bob has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I was proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. For all he has done and given over his lifetime, honoring his memory is our duty and privilege.                          ____________________
