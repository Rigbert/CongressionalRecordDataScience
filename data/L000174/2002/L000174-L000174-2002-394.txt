President, I understand under the unanimous consent request I am to be recognized, but the distinguished Senator from Illinois and the distinguished Senator from Oregon are here, and I ask unanimous consent it be in order first to recognize the distinguished Senator from Illinois for 2 minutes, then the distinguished Senator from Oregon for 1 minute, and the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, the Republican assistant leader, for 30 seconds, and then we revert back to my original time.
