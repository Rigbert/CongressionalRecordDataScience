Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members may have until publication of the last edition of the Congressional Record authorized for the first session by the Joint Committee on Printing to revise and extend their remarks and to include brief, related extraneous material on any matter occurring before the adjournment of the first session sine die.
