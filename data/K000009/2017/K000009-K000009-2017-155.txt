Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her stellar leadership on the trade task force and the work that it has done. The hours and hours of effort on defeating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the great assemblage that she gathered and the persistence with which she approached that, seeking to defeat that trade model, which has now been done, and to go back to the drawing board and to fix what is wrong with these, Representative DeLauro has been extraordinary.  I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it has been a remarkable coalition, and it is standing strong. It stands strong.  I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for being a central and integral part of this effort. I appreciate that.
