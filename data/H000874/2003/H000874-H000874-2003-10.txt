Speaker, reserving the right to object, and I am not going to object, I am not going to put people to the purpose of voting; but I will again say the democratic process is that we come to this floor. I will remind you that you said we had 17 minutes to vote. You made it very clear. You sent us a notice, and you said come with 15 minutes; we will give you 2 more minutes.  This vote has now been held open longer than any vote that I can remember. I have been here 23 years. Perhaps some of you have been here longer. The outrage that was discussed when Speaker Wright held the vote open for far less time than this was palpable on your side of the aisle. Democracy is about voting. But just as you cannot say on Tuesday of Election Day, we will keep the polls open for 15 more hours until we get the result we want, you ought not to be able to do it here, Mr. Speaker. We have prevailed on this vote. Arms have been twisted and votes changed. And I will continue to reserve.
