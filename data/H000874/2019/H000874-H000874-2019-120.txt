 The same rules that they imposed upon us they are now complaining about because they don't think they were fair. Apparently, they thought they were fair when they were applied to the Democratic minority.

What is fair to the goose is fair to the gander.  They are your rules, Mr. Scalise. You ask your counsel. We adopted your rules on the issuing of subpoenas--your rules.
