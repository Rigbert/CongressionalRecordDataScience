Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take this time to honor one of America's great leaders, retiring president of the United Auto Workers Union, Ron Gettelfinger. Mr. Gettelfinger served as president of the UAW from 2002 until 2010.  Mr. Gettelfinger became a member of the UAW in 1964 when he became a chassis line repairman in Ford's Louisville factory. In 1984 Mr. Gettelfinger was elected by the membership of the UAW Local 862 chapter in Louisville to represent them as their committee person, bargaining chair, and president, and in 1992 Mr. Gettelfinger was elected to be the director of UAW's Region 3, which represents the UAW membership of Indiana and Kentucky. Then in 1998 Mr. Gettelfinger was elected vice president of the UAW, and he served in that position until June 5, 2002, when at the UAW's 33rd constitutional convention Mr. Gettelfinger was elected president.  Throughout Mr. Gettelfinger's rise to the top within the UAW he was driven by the sole purpose of fighting for the rights of the American worker. He fought for fair trade agreements that would protect the rights and health of American workers and the environment. He steadfastly worked to prevent a race to the bottom environment in countries around the world, and was an outspoken advocate for a national single-payer health care system. He fought for all of these ideals while having to lead the UAW through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and I wish there were more exemplary fighters out there like Ron Gettlefinger.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Ron Gettelfinger for his 46 years of service as both a member and leader of the United Auto Workers Union, and in wishing him all the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
