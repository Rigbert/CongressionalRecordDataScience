President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senators Snowe and Lincoln to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for our nation's small businesses and self-employed individuals. This bipartisan legislation is known as the Small Business Health Options Program Act, or the SHOP Act, and I am working with the Finance and HELP Committees to incorporate it into the broader healthcare reform bill the Senate is developing.  Health reform is a priority of the American people and a central element of this Congress's agenda. While more must be done, we have taken some small but important steps already.  We expanded the CHIP program to provide healthcare to an additional 4 million children who are uninsured today.  We provided assistance to laid-off workers to help them pay for health insurance under the COBRA continuation program, so that families receiving an average monthly unemployment check of $1,300 aren't expected to pay $1,100 in insurance premiums.  We included in the Recovery Act $87 billion for the Medicaid program over the next 2 years.  We provided $2 billion for community health centers, which serve more than 18 million patients.  But we have more to do. Overall, 46 million Americans are uninsured. At the beginning of this decade, fewer than 40 million people were uninsured. Over the same period, health insurance premiums have risen 4 times faster than wages.  This is the year to enact reforms to reduce healthcare costs, expand coverage, and improve the quality of the healthcare we receive.  It is not easy for small businesses and the self-employed to afford health insurance. Without the benefits of large group purchasing, double-digit rate increases are not uncommon.  The recession has made it worse. The Main Street Alliance recently polled nearly 500 small businesses in a dozen states and found that 35 percent have reduced coverage and 12 percent have dropped it altogether in the past 2 years.  More than 50 percent of the uninsured in America are in households led by someone who is either self-employed or works for a business with fewer than 100 employees.  Workers in the smallest businesses are almost three times likely to be uninsured as those who work for the largest businesses. That is not because small businesses don't want to offer health insurance; it is because insurance is more expensive for them than for large companies.  Administrative costs for health insurance are higher for small businesses than larger businesses. About 20-25 percent of a small business's premium goes to administrative expenses, compared to about 10 percent for large employers.  Small businesses are less able than large employers to spread the risk that someone will get sick. Even a single employee with a serious medical condition can cause a dramatic increase in a small business's health insurance premium.  Small businesses are also more likely to have lower wages and narrower profit margins than large businesses, making it more difficult for these employers and employees to cover the cost of health coverage.  Small business owners like Doug Mayol of Springfield, IL, and David Borris, of Northbrook, IL, know all too well the difficulty of maintaining health insurance in this struggling economy.  Since 1988, Doug Mayol has owned and operated a small business in downtown Springfield that sells cards, gifts, and other knick-knacks. He has found that his profits are at the mercy of the rising costs of healthcare. He is fortunate that his only employee is over 65 and qualifies for Medicare and also receives spousal benefits from her late husband. If this were not the case, Doug does not think he would be able to provide her with coverage.  In terms of his own insurance, Doug has a preexisting condition and fears the real possibility of becoming uninsured. Almost 30 years ago, Doug was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve defect. He has no symptoms, but without regular healthcare he is at risk of developing serious problems.  Like most Americans, his healthcare premiums have risen over the years, but recently the increases have beendramatic. In 2001, he paid $200 a month. By 2005, he was paying $400 a month. The next year, after he turned 50, his rate shot up to $750 a month.  Trying to work within the system, he chose a smaller network of providers and a higher deductible to bring his premium back down to $650. Unfortunately, last year it jumped to $1037 a month. Only by taking the highest deductible allowed, $2500, was he able to bring it down to $888. And these rates will continue to rise.  Ironically, Doug is not even a costly patient. With his high deductible, his insurance rarely kicks in, as he has never made a claim for illness or injury and has received only routine primary care. Yet more affordable insurance carriers reject him due to his preexisting condition.  Meanwhile, Doug avoids seeing a cardiologist, even though periodic visits would be a good idea, because he fears it would add another red flag to his already imperfect health record.  What kind of healthcare system is it that causes even those with coverage to avoid care? Americans need the peace-of-mind that comes with knowing that health insurance companies will not be able to reject you, or keep raising your rates, because you have a preexisting condition.  David Borris faces another dilemma. David is the owner of Hel's Kitchen Catering, an off-premise catering company located along suburban Chicago's north shore in Northbrook, IL. Over 2 decades ago, David and his wife opened their business in a 900 square foot storefront with a handful of recipes from his mother and his wife. Both David and his wife left good-paying jobs in the hospitality industry to take their shot at the American dream of owning their own business.  David now employs 25 full-time employees and has offered health insurance to them since 1992. At first, David offered to contribute 50 percent of the premium in an employee's first year and 100 percent thereafter. The company had 8 full-time employees and David felt a moral obligation to offer insurance to the people who were helping to grow his business.  Around 2002, the company started to see staggering premium increases. In 2004, the premium jumped 21 percent. In 2005, it increased by 10 percent. In 2006, the increase was 16 percent. In 2007, he was quoted a 26 percent rate hike, and only a change of carriers allowed him to hold the increase to 17 percent. In total, his premiums have doubled since 2002, forcing him to ask longtime employees to contribute toward the cost of the premiums.  Today, David insures only 13 of his 25 full-time employees--the other 12 cannot afford their 50 percent share of the premium in the first year, and the company cannot afford to pay more.  David spent almost 13 percent of his covered employees' payroll on health insurance premiums last year, and he expects he will have to ask employees to contribute more again next year.  He knows that one employee's wife has a kidney problem and another employee's son receives an expensive treatment for a health condition. Trying to maintain health coverage for his loyal workers has become a major complication as he tries to grow his business.  Both Doug and David are living the American dream as small business owners. Providing health insurance for their employees should not destroy that dream.  As Congress works to reform the healthcare system, we need to keep in mind the struggle of small business owners like Doug and David. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They need to be able to count on health insurance premiums that are reasonable and predictable. They need something better than our current system offers.  That is why I am reintroducing the SHOP Act with Senators Snowe and Lincoln. Our legislation offers new hope for entrepreneurs who struggle to afford health insurance. It will make health insurance more accessible and more affordable for small businesses and the self-employed.  Our bill has three core elements: purchasing pools for small businesses and the self-employed; health insurance rating reforms; and tax credits.  Our bill would create incentives for States to establish purchasing pools and would create a national pool that we call SHOP, the Small Business Health Options Program, for small businesses with up to 100 employees and for the self-employed.  Purchasing pools will lower administrative costs, give employers and employees more private health insurance plans to choose from, and enhance competition by making it easier to compare plans.  Our bill would prohibit insurers from setting premiums based on health status in both the national SHOP pool and in States' small group markets, and would gradually reduce other sources of premium variation. These rating changes will make premiums more stable from year to year and make coverage more affordable for those who need it most.  To lower the cost of providing health coverage, our bill would provide a tax credit to small businesses with up to 50 workers who pay at least 60 percent of their employees' premiums.  The size of the tax credit would be targeted to the size of the business. A full tax credit of $1,000 for self-only coverage and $2,000 for family coverage would be available to the smallest businesses, with the value of the tax credit phased down as the size of the employer increases.  Employers who cover more than 60 percent of the premium would be rewarded with a bonus credit.  In addition, we would move to a system where individual employees can choose their own health plan instead of having their employer choose it for them. Where rating rules permit it, each worker would be able to enroll in the health plan in SHOP that best meets his or her needs.  The bill we have introduced reflects our commitment to find reasonable compromises and address the challenges faced by small employers and the self-employed. This bipartisan legislation has the support of a range of business, labor, and consumer groups.  We have worked closely with the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of Realtors, and SEIU in the development of the bill, and we also have the support of Families USA, the National Restaurant Association, and the Partnership for Women and Families.  We have received valuable input from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and have taken the hard steps they have recommended to address rating issues and ensure that the approach is viable over the long haul.  Although each group that supports SHOP has its own priorities for broader health reform, this diverse coalition of stakeholders from across the political spectrum came together to address the needs of small businesses as one important component of reform.  Everyone understands that this bill is not comprehensive health reform, and none of us would stop with SHOP. However, the renewed focus on broader reform has given us an opportunity to offer SHOP as a carefully-crafted component of broader reform that addresses the specific needs of the small business community. We believe our approach is consistent with the broader conversation and can help the greater reform effort move forward on a bipartisan basis, and we look forward to including the features of SHOP in the broader bill.  In a town hall meeting in March this year, the President spoke to a crowd about the new mindset of this Administration. He talked about ``understanding that we're all in this together and that if the middle class is working well, if working people are doing well, then everybody does well.''  This bill is consistent with that thinking. Its seemingly disparate supporters may disagree on many things, but they have worked together to develop this legislation because they agree on a greater principle: that our current system is hurting everyone--families, businesses, and our economy.  We must keep working together on a bipartisan basis to try to enact legislation that will give all Americans access to affordable health insurance, and solving the healthcare challenges faced by small businesses is an important part of that process.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact such legislation and ensure that the healthcare needs of small businesses and all Americans are met.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 979       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

In entering into      such contracts, the Administrator shall ensure that health      benefits coverage is provided for an individual only, 2      adults in a household, 1 adult and 1 or more children, and a      family.       ``(b) Eligibility.--A health insurance issuer shall be      eligible to enter into a contract under subsection (a) if      such issuer--       ``(1) is licensed to offer health benefits plan coverage in      each State in which the plan is offered; and       ``(2) meets such other reasonable requirements as      determined appropriate by the Administrator, after an      opportunity for public comment and publication in the Federal      Register.       ``(c) Cost-sharing and Networks.--The Administrator shall      ensure that health benefits plans with a range of cost-     sharing and network arrangements are available under this      title.       ``(d) Revocation.--Approval of a health benefits plan      participating in the program under this title may be      withdrawn or revoked by the Administrator only after notice      to the health insurance issuer involved and an opportunity      for a hearing without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5      and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.       ``(e) Conversion.--       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a      contract may not be made or a plan approved under this      section if the health insurance issuer under such contract or      plan does not provide to each enrollee whose coverage under      the plan is terminated, including a termination due to      discontinuance of the contract or plan, the option to have      issued to that individual a nongroup policy without evidence      of insurability. A health insurance issuer shall provide a      notice of such option to individuals who enroll in the plan.      An enrollee who exercises such conversion option shall pay      the full periodic charges for the nongroup policy.       ``(2) Exceptions.--A health insurance issuer shall not be      required to offer a nongroup policy under paragraph (1) if      the termination under the plan occurred because--       ``(A) the enrollee failed to pay any required monthly      premiums under the plan;       ``(B) the enrollee performed an act or practice that      constitutes fraud in connection with the coverage under the      plan;       ``(C) the enrollee made an intentional misrepresentation of      a material fact under the terms of coverage of the plan; or       ``(D) the terminated coverage under the plan was replaced      by similar coverage within 31 days after the effective date      of such termination.       ``(f) Payment of Premiums.--       ``(1) In general.--Employers shall collect premium payments      from their employees through payroll deductions or other      payments from employees and shall forward such payments and      the contribution of the employer (if any) to the      Administrator. The Administrator shall develop procedures      through which such payments shall be received and forwarded      to the health insurance issuer involved.       ``(2) Failure to pay.--The Administrator shall establish--       ``(A) procedures for the termination of employers that fail      for a consecutive 2-month period (or such other time period      as determined appropriate by the Administrator) to make      premium payments in a timely manner; and       ``(B) other procedures regarding unpaid and uncollected      premiums.     ``SEC. 3105. EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION.       ``(a) Participation Procedure.--The Administrator shall      develop a procedure for employers and self-employed      individuals to participate in the program under this title,      including procedures relating to the offering of health      benefits plans to employees and the payment of premiums for      health insurance coverage under this title. For the purpose      of premium payments, a self-employed individual shall be      considered an employer that is making a 100 percent      contribution toward the premium amount.       ``(b) Enrollment and Offering of Other Coverage.--       ``(1) Enrollment.--A participating employer shall ensure      that each eligible employee has an opportunity to enroll in a      plan of the employer's choice or a plan of the employee's      choice in accordance with section 3107(d)(7).       ``(2) Prohibition on offering other comprehensive health      benefit coverage.--A participating employer may not offer a      health insurance plan providing comprehensive health benefit      coverage to employees other than a health benefits plan      offered under this title.       ``(3) Prohibition on coercion.--An employer shall not      pressure, coerce, or offer inducements to an employee to      elect not to enroll in coverage under the program under this      title or to select a particular health benefits plan.       ``(4) Offer of supplemental coverage options.--       ``(A) In general.--A participating employer may offer      supplementary coverage options to employees.       ``(B) Definition.--In subparagraph (A), the term      `supplementary coverage' means benefits described as      `excepted benefits' under section 2791(c).       ``(c) Regulatory Flexibility.--In developing the procedure      under subsection (a), the Administrator shall comply with the      requirements specified under the Regulatory Flexibility Act      under chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, consider the      economic impacts that the regulation will have on small      businesses, and consider regulatory alternatives that would      mitigate such impact. The Administrator shall publish and      publicly disseminate a small business compliance guide,      pursuant to section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory      Enforcement Fairness Act, that explains the compliance      requirements for employer participation. Such compliance      guide shall be published not later than the date of the      publication of the final rule under this title, or the      effective date of such rules, whichever is later.       ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Except as provided in section      3104(f), nothing in this title shall be construed to require      that an employer make premium contributions on behalf of      employees.     ``SEC. 3106. ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT.       ``(a) In General.--An individual shall be eligible to      enroll in health insurance coverage under this title for      coverage beginning in 2012 if such individual is an employee      of a participating employer described in section 3101(a)(4)      or is a self-employed individual as defined in section      401(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and meets      the definition of a participating employer in section      3101(a)(8). An employer may allow employees who average fewer      than 35 hours per week to enroll.       ``(b) Limitation.--A health insurance issuer may not refuse      to provide coverage to any eligible individual under      subsection (a) who selects a health benefits plan offered by      such issuer under this title.       ``(c) Type of Enrollment.--An eligible individual may      enroll as an individual or as an adult with 1 or more      children regardless of whether another adult is present in      the enrollee's household or family.       ``(d) Open Enrollment.--       ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall establish an      annual open enrollment period during which an employer may      elect to become a participating employer and an employee may      enroll in a health benefits plan under this title for the      following calendar year.       ``(2) Open enrollment period.--For purposes of this title,      the term `open enrollment period' means, with respect to      calendar year 2012 and each succeeding calendar year, the      period beginning on October 1, 2011, and ending December 1,      2011, and each succeeding period beginning October 1 and      ending December 1. Coverage in a health benefits plan      selected during such an open enrollment period shall begin on      January 1 of the calendar year following the selection.       ``(3) Newly eligible employers and employees.--     Notwithstanding the open enrollment period provided for under      paragraph (2), the Administrator shall establish an      enrollment process to enable a newly eligible employer or an      employer with an existing health benefits plan whose term is      ending to become a participating employer and for an employee      of such employer, or a new employee of a participating      employer, to enroll in a health benefits plan under this      title outside of an open enrollment period subject to      2701(f). The Administrator may establish a process for      setting the renewal date for the participation of an employer      that initially becomes a participating employer outside of      the open enrollment period to coincide with a subsequent open      enrollment period.       ``(4) Limitation of changing enrollment.--An employer or      employee (as the case may be) may elect to change the health      benefits plan that the employee is enrolled in only during an      open enrollment period.       ``(5) Effectiveness of election and change of election.--An      election to change a health benefits plan that is made during      the open enrollment period under paragraph (2) shall take      effect as of the first day of the following calendar year.       ``(6) Continuation of enrollment.--An employee who has      enrolled in a health benefits plan under this title is      considered to have been continuously enrolled in that health      benefits plan until such time as--       ``(A) the employer or employee (as the case may be) elects      to change health benefits plans; or       ``(B) the health benefits plan is terminated.       ``(e) Providing Information To Promote Informed Choice.--     The Administrator shall compile, produce, and disseminate      information to employers, employees, and navigators under      section 3102(c)(8) to promote informed choice that shall be      made available at least 30 days prior to the beginning of      each open enrollment period.       ``(f) Termination of Employment.--       ``(1) In general.--With respect to an employee who is      enrolled in a health plan through the program under this      title and who is terminated or separated from employment,      such employee may remain enrolled in such health plan for the      period described in paragraph (2) if the employee pays 102      percent of the monthly premium for such plan for such period      as provided for under paragraph (3).       ``(2) Period described.--The period described in this      paragraph is the longer of--       ``(A) the period provided for in the COBRA continuation      provisions (as such term is defined in section 3001(a)(10)(B)      of division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act      of 2009) beginning on the date of the termination or      separation involved; or       ``(B) the period permitted under any applicable      continuation of coverage provisions of the State in which the      employee resides.       ``(3) Administration.--The Administrator shall develop      guidelines for administering the provision of health plan      coverage for employees under this subsection. Such guidelines      shall address the rating rules for such continuation coverage      in the calendar years prior to 2014 and shall provide for the      administration of this section in a manner similar to the      manner in which the COBRA continuation provisions (as such      term is defined in section 3001(a)(10)(B) of division B of      the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) are      administered, including the collection of premiums by the      Administrator.       ``(4) Nonapplication of provisions.--The COBRA continuation      provisions (as such term is defined in section 3001(a)(10)(B)      of division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act      of 2009) shall not apply to an employee to which this      subsection applies.       ``(g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this title shall be      construed to prohibit a health insurance issuer providing      coverage through the program under this title from using the      services of a licensed agent or broker.     ``SEC. 3107. HEALTH COVERAGE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SMALL                    BUSINESS POOL.       ``(a) Preexisting Condition Exclusions.--Section 2701 shall      apply to coverage under this title, except that with respect      to such coverage, the reference to `12 months (or 18 months      in the case of a late enrollee)' in subsection (a)(2) of each      such section shall be deemed to be `6 months'.
