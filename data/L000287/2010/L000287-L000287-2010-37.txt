Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this jobs bill. We are making progress, but there are still far too many people who want to work but cannot find a job. We must not stop and we will not stop until each and every person has a good job. But until that time comes, we must help and take care of our brothers and sisters who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  This bill extends emergency assistance to unemployed Americans. It also provides TANF emergency jobs to help States create jobs and assist struggling families.  Every day, individuals call my office. They want to work. Many have years of experience. They never in a million years thought that they would have to rely on these programs to get by and make ends meet.  We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to help our friends and neighbors during these hard times. This is our duty. If we are honest with ourselves, we all know this bill is not enough. But we must take this step. We cannot wait a moment longer.  I urge all of my colleagues to put politics aside and do what is right and support this necessary legislation.
