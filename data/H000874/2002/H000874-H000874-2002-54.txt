Speaker, if the gentleman is so proud of that which he has done in his budget and his bill, why does he not bring the appropriations bill to the floor? Why does it languish for the last 8 months in committee? Why do they say to me we do not have the votes for the bill on our side of the aisle if what he says is so true?
