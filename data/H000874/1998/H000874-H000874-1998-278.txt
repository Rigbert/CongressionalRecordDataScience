Speaker, I do not want to interrupt the gentleman's statement, but I want to ask him a question to clarify what he just said.  When the gentleman indicated that reduced the margin by 124, am I correct that in order to do that, we would have to assume that all of those votes were cast for the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Sanchez)?
