President, while the distinguished majority leader is still on the floor, I note I, too, do not want to see the Senate go down a path where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on votes of 41. In fact, the distinguished majority leader is perhaps aware of the fact that during the Republican administrations I rarely ever voted against a nomination by either President Reagan or President Bush. There were a couple I did.  I also took the floor on occasion to oppose filibusters to hold them up and believe that we should have a vote up or down. Actually, I was one of those who made sure, on a couple controversial Republican judges, that we did. That meant 100 Senators voted on them, 100.  In this case, unfortunately, we have at least one judge who has been held for 3 years by one or two or three or four Senators, not 41 but less than a handful. All I am asking is that we give them the fairness of having the whole Senate vote on them.  Unfortunately, in the last couple years, women and minorities have been held up longer than anybody else on these Federal judgeships. They ought to be allowed a vote up or down. If Senators want to vote against them, then vote against them. If they want to vote for them, vote for them. But to have two or three people, quietly, in the back room, never be identified as being the ones holding them up, I think that is unfair to the judiciary, it is unfair to the nominees, and, frankly, it demeans the Senate.
