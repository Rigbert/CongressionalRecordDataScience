President, first let me associate myself with the comments of Senator Durbin about Lady Bird Johnson. I had the privilege and pleasure for many years of knowing a dear friend of their family, my dear friend, Warrie  Price and her family. She was there in Austin for the services.  Also, I had the privilege of serving with Senator Chuck Robb and knowing Lynda. I thank the Senator for recognizing those comments by Bill Moyers. When I spoke to my friend, Warrie Price, she said she had never heard anything as moving and as evocative and as fitting as the tribute by Bill Moyers.  I thank the Senator for including that in the Record for the American people to consider.                          ____________________
