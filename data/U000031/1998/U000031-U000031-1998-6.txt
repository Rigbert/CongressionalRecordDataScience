 I would just note to the previous speaker that these programs are not eliminated. They continue. They will continue in Hawaii, they will continue in Michigan, they will continue in Ohio. We just changed from Father Knows Best in terms of the Federal Government to the local schools are going to decide what is best for those students, and that is where those dollars are going to be utilized.  I would note to the gentlewoman from Hawaii that under this bill, the authorization bill that Hawaii is going to get $1.8 million more under this program which accounts for about $9,300 per school and $425 per classroom.  Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), whose district will benefit from this program.
