 The term ``checks and balances'' has actually nothing to do with what happened to circuit court appointments during the previous Congress. The term ``checks and balances'' means institutional checks against each other, the Congress versus the President, the judiciary versus both--the balance of power among the branches of Government. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the process to which the Senate has been subjected in the last few years. It is simply a term that is inapplicable to the dilemma in which we find ourselves now.
