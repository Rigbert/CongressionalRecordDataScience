 Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. As more and more states deregulate their own energy industries, environmentally preferable electric power is one of the markets developing first. One sector that has garnered specific questions about its impact on the environment is hydropower. Consumers need a credible means to determine which hydropower facilities are environmentally preferable. Mr. Chairman, you have partially addressed this situation alreadyby including funding within the Department of Energy's hydropower account to develop ``fish friendly'' turbines. I believe facilities that use this and other new technology should receive recognition for their efforts. Hydropower facilities that are operated to avoid and reduce their environmental impact should also receive recognition.
