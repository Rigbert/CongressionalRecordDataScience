 Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Mexico?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh] will be recognized for 6 minutes, and 6 minutes will be equally divided between the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Durbin].  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh].                              {time}  0000  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with the employment in the front office at FDA. The FTE levels at FDA's nonoperational managerial offices have increased by over 25 percent from fiscal year 1989 levels. This growth in overhead expenditures represents an inefficient use of resources that must be reversed.  The savings that will be achieved in overhead reductions can be used to redirect their efforts toward hiring additional employees to provide additional approval for much-needed drugs, devices and other medical products. Such a reinvestment will increase the ability of the agency to timely review product applications.  The amendment I am offering would prevent an increase from the fiscal year 1995 levels in the level of full-time employees in the following offices: the Office of the Commissioner, the Office of Policy, the Office of External Affairs, and the Office of Management Systems.  Mr. Chairman, this is one of several amendments that I was planning to offer tonight. The other amendments I am not going to offer. I have spoken with the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], the chairman of the authorizing committee, and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], the chairman of the subcommittee. They share my concerns.  I wanted to address some of the issues and the problems that have been caused by the failure of FDA to have sufficient employees in some of the agencies that are operational, that do approve the drugs, the devices and the other medical products.  First of all, we have discovered that there is an increasing amount of surveillance and oversight that the agency does of the industry. This oversight effort has increasingly led them to slow down the approval of new drugs and new therapies and in many ways harass the manufacturers of products who may disagree with the FDA's chosen method of operation.  I hear time and time again from people who we have suggested could come and testify before my Subcommittee on National Economic Growth, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs that they are afraid to do so because the agency has such an overwhelming enforcement authority. My amendment would have simply directed them to limit expenditures on enforcement to 10 percent so that they can turn their efforts to seeking new product approvals.  I plan to work with the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis] in making sure that that redirection of priorities occurs in their reauthorization bill later this fall.  Finally, another issue is off-label uses. I was going to offer an amendment that would have said the FDA had to discontinue efforts to prevent the distribution of medical literature and other means of promoting off-label uses in drugs.  Let me give the body a little background in this, and I have to tell you that working with FDA in this areas is a little bit like entering into Alice in Wonderland.  The FDA has an unwritten policy that prevents manufacturers from disseminating enduring materials such as medical journals, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and other highly reputable journals and textbooks if they contain information about nonapproved, that is, the FDA has not yet sanctioned, uses of a manufactured product, even through the agency has determined the product is safe for use for other purposes.  They do not allow this until the agency has either examined the journal article or the material or approved the product for the off-label use.  This is where Alice meets the Mad Hatter. It takes years and years to get that type of approval for additional uses and costs the companies millions of dollars. Meanwhile, patients suffers because they are not able to have their doctors learn about this treatment and be able to get the most recent medical information.  Let me tell you, off-label uses are critical for treating children and others such cancer. Virtually all of the new treatments developed in this country come about when doctors start using labeled existing drugs in new ways, off-label uses.  The FDA has also a draft policy that prohibits virtually all support, financial or otherwise, by drug and medical device manufacturers of any educational activities designed to disseminate truthful, accurate information and designed to provide training with respect to off-label uses.  This is just nuts. You have got big, powerful,   wealthy drug companies and device manufacturers willing to spend their money to train doctors on how to use these newest techniques, and the FDA has a new draft policy saying they cannot do it. The Mad Hatter strikes again.  FDA's actions raise serious first amendment concerns. Are we to say that manufacturers of these devices cannot disseminate truthful and accurate information? FDA's policies already have and continue to significantly inhibit the free flow of peer reviewed, scientific information about drug uses.  Ironically, while the agency does not prevent physicians from prescribing uses of therapeutic products, in other words, the doctor can use the off-label use, the devices and the drugs have, even though they have not been approved by FDA for that use, the agency policies have significantly curtailed the ability of doctors to receive information about that, to receive the understanding in journals, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, about what they think these off-label uses are.  Of course, in the world of Alice in Wonderland, as the Queen said, execute first, trial later. I urge the body to adopt my amendment and send a message to the agency that this is no longer going to be the practice.
