 Mr. Leader, there has been a lot of discussion about the partial-birth abortion bill. It is not on the schedule for next week, as I understand it. Do you have any idea when this might come up? In particular, do you expect it to come up before the Memorial Day break? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the distinguished minority whip is probably aware, the Senate passed this very important legislation before the Easter break. The Committee on the Judiciary has marked up the bill. But the calendar being as full as it is before the Memorial Day break, I really cannot see where we can get it to the floor before early summer, sometime probably in June.
