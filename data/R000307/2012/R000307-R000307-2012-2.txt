We are already seeing costs to States, to communities, and to businesses that total up millions of dollars. Regulations now in effect are duplicative--a Senate word, a 35-cent word. That means we do not need it. We already have a bill in place. We already have regulation in place. This regulation requires businesses to undertake what amounts to a paperwork exercise. These requirements can slow responses to real public health crises such as West Nile virus.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report over 5,000 cases of West Nile virus this year and sadly over 230 deaths. That is not right. Pesticide applications are currently and should continue to be regulated under FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. This bill does what all of our constituents are telling us to do and that is to protect human health and eliminate duplicative, unnecessary regulatory actions.  The additional paperwork and permitting processes that States and pesticide applicators must undertake provide no additional environmental protection, zip, zero. It is just additional environmental review. The EPA estimates that approximately 365,000 pesticide applicators will need permits to cover about 5.6 million applications per year. Public health officials, farmers, other pesticide applicators under this regulatory impact would not be facing these requirements if the administration had chosen to vigorously defend its longstanding policy that the protections under the Federal pesticide law were sufficient to protect the environment.  Again, estimates suggest this duplicative regulation will require 365,000 individuals--a requirement that will cost $50 million and require 1 million hours per year to implement--just to fill out the paperwork. Bottom line, it will not add any environmental protection. This layer of redtape will place a huge financial burden on the shoulders of cities, of counties, farm families all across the country as well as State governments responsible for enforcement while at the same time facing dire budget situations.  Beyond agency enforcement, they will also now be exposed to the threat of litigation under the clean water law's citizen suit provisions. I think you have the real key as to where this bill was headed. Some of you might say there are special exemptions for public health emergencies, but environmental groups are challenging emergency actions taken this summer to address the mosquito-borne illnesses such as eastern equine encephalitis--not something to take an action against if you are faced with one of these kinds of threats. Yet we have not been able to move H.R. 872, to come up for a vote despite clear bipartisan support.  It seems to me Congress must act to end this regulatory duplication and clarify that they do not need this additional burden when they are trying to prioritize staffing and resources.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to protect human health and put an end to this very costly regulation. With regard to the bill again, it is 872, passed the House by over 300 votes, bipartisan support in the Agriculture Committee, didn't even have to have a hearing. Let's move this bill. It is something we can do. It makes sense.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Minority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We request your      leadership in helping to resolve the following issue at the      earliest possible opportunity.       As you are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)      recently finalized its Pesticide General Permit (PGP) under      the Clean Water Act (CWA), pursuant to a ruling by the Court      of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in National Cotton Council v.      EPA. Under this new permitting system, certain pesticide      applicators will be required to meet PGP or other permitting      requirements in addition to regulation under the Federal      Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.       On March 31, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 872,      the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2011, which would      address National Cotton Council v. EPA. This legislation then      passed the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and      Forestry on June 21 by voice vote.       We are aware that efforts had been made to come to a      bipartisan resolution before these new permitting      requirements went into effect. However, we believe there is      still an opportunity to resolve this matter in a way that      will protect the environment while avoiding undue costs on      rural communities and municipalities nationwide. Thus, it is      our sincere hope that you will allot floor time for the      Senate to have a full, open debate on this matter.       While we recognize that many important legislative items      vie for limited floor time, this is a rare opportunity to      demonstrate to the American public that Democrats and      Republicans are capable of working together to address      important issues.           Sincerely,         Mike Crapo, Kay Hagan, Richard Burr, Marco Rubio, David            Vitter, James Risch, John Boozman, Mike Johanns, Roy            Blunt, Rob Portman, Richard Lugar, Mary Landrieu, Kent            Conrad, Tom Carper, Chris Coons, Ben Nelson, Max            Baucus, Claire McCaskill, Tim Johnson, Amy Klobuchar,            John Hoeven, John Thune, Orrin Hatch, Lamar Alexander,            Joe Manchin.
