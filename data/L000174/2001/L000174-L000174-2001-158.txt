He has been a partner in writing the bill, in resolving the amendments, and I value his friendship and his advice.  I also commend the staff, for all their work. In particular, I recognize Paul Grove, who took over as the Republican clerk for the Foreign Operations Subcommittee earlier this year. Paul has quickly learned the appropriations process and has been a pleasure to work with.  In addition, Mark Lippert, the new deputy clerk on the Democratic side, has done an outstanding job.  Jennifer Chartrand, who has been a professional staff member for the Appropriations Committee for several years, provided essential advice and support to my staff. She was indispensable.  I thank Tara Magner of my Judiciary Committee staff, and J.P. Dowd, my legislative director, for their help during floor consideration of this bill.  I recognize Tim Rieser, the Democratic clerk for the subcommittee, for all his help.  And I thank Dakota Rudesill, staff member for the Budget Committee, who provided excellent and very helpful advice during floor consideration of this bill.  Finally, as always, we owe a debt to Billy Piper, on Senator McConnell's staff. Billy came in at crucial times to resolve a number of important issues.  That completes action on the Foreign Operations bill for fiscal year 2002.
