Speaker, these Republican Medicare cuts are not just number-crunching, they mean real medical service reductions affecting real people.  Let me introduce you to Toni Podojil from Cleveland. Toni is 83 years old. She worked in the textile industry before her first retirement, but with minimum pension benefits and Social Security benefits, which is true with many women she had to get a job with the united labor agency. She will have to retire again soon and they will then live on a combined pension of about $600 a month.  Toni is a survivor of uterine cancer, she has had a heart attack, and she suffers from a hearing loss. Uncovered medical expenses now equal almost half her retirement income. When she retires a second time at age 83, what can she expect under this unfair budget? A doubled Medicare part B premium; over $553 more a year? An increased part A deductible over $1,200 more a year?  Let us balance the budget, not give away tax breaks to the wealthiest in this country.                          ____________________
