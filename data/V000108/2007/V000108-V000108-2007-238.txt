Roosevelt Democratic Club as they celebrate the organization's 75th anniversary. To commemorate this special occasion, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club will be having an anniversary banquet on March 24, 2007, at Dynasty Banquets in Hammond.  The Franklin D. Roosevelt Club of Hammond was founded on December 3, 1932, by 42 members of Polish ancestry. The mission of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club is to ``maintain high standards and secure the best possible candidate for the Democratic Party.'' The Franklin D. Roosevelt Club has selflessly given its support to the northwest Indiana community. In addition, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club has had many members who have served or are currently serving as elected or appointed officials in our government.  Throughout the past 75 years, the members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club have offered their dedication and support to their noble cause of serving their local community, while striving for a democratic government in their cities for years to come. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Club has had 19 presidents over its 75 year history. At this time, I would like to acknowledge the 2007 Franklin D. Roosevelt Club officers. They are: President Kay Pucalik, First Vice President Wally Skibinski, Second Vice President Mary Fabian, Secretary Shirley Ridenour, Treasurer Mary J. Hildebranski, Sergeant of Arms John Stevens, Chaplain Bobbi Costa, Membership Chairman Diana Beyer, and Trustees Tom Hildebranski, Brian Kupinski, and Bertha McCoy.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the members of the Hammond Franklin D. Roosevelt Democratic Club on the 75th anniversary of their noble organization. These dedicated individuals continue to give their time and unrelenting efforts to serve their local community, as well as all of northwest Indiana. It is their commitment to the democratic process that makes their organization and efforts such a motivating force in the First Congressional District, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
