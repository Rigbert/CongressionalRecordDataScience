3325, I am especially interested in ensuring that these programs are effectively and efficiently managed. My interest does not end with the enactment of this bill; in fact, this is just the beginning. I am committing myself and the Judiciary Committee to oversight of these programs; soon after the filing date of the reports required of the Justice Department and the FBI, we will hold hearings to ensure that the information we need to evaluate these programs and the use of the funds that have been appropriated.
