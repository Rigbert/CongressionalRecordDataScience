 President, on any given day in the United States 80 people are killed by gun violence, 12 of them children. Seeking to bring an end to this senseless violence, supporters of sensible gun laws are coming together this Mothers' Day from all over the country to participate in the Million Mom March and say to Congress: ``Enough is Enough.''  We share a common purpose: The passage of sensible gun laws that will hopefully help save lives.  This common goal includes moving forward with the four, common-sense gun measures passed by this body almost a full year ago--trigger locks, closing the gun show loophole, banning the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines, and banning juvenile possession of assault weapons.  And beyond those four common sense measures, the mothers flooding into Washington are calling for legislation to license gun owners and keep track of guns.  Earlier today, I stood with some of those moms, with Donna Dees-Thomases, the head of the Million Mom March, with Chief Ramsey of the District of Columbia Police Department, with representatives of Handgun Control and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and with several of my colleagues to announce the introduction of a bill to take the next step in the fight to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and juveniles.  And so I now rise to introduce the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2000,'' which I believe represents a common-sense approach to guns and gun violence in America.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Frank Lautenberg, Barbara Boxer and Charles Schumer. And I am pleased that Representative Marty Meehan from Massachusetts will soon be introducing this legislation in the House. I know that this will be an uphill battle, and I don't expect this bill to pass overnight. But it is myhope that in the coming months, more of our colleagues in both Houses will join us and help us to move this bill forward until we succeed.  Mr. President, in this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But when you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary. That makes no sense.  We register cars and license drivers. We register pesticides and license exterminators. We register animal carriers and researchers, we register gambling devices. And we register a whole host of other goods and activities--even ``international expositions,'' believe it or not, must be registered with the Bureau of International Expositions!  But when it comes to guns and gun owners--no license and no registration, despite the loss of more than 32,000 lives a year from gun violence.  To this end, I have worked with law enforcement officials and other experts in drafting the bill we are introducing today.  Upon enactment of this legislation, anyone purchasing a handgun or semi-automatic weapon that takes detachable ammunition magazines will be required to have a license. Shotguns and a large number of common hunting guns are not covered by the requirements of this bill.  Current owners of these weapons will have up to 10 years to obtain a license.  The bill sets up a federal system, but allows states to opt out if they adopt a system at least as effective as the federal program.  Under this bill, anyone wishing to obtain a firearm license will need to go to a federally licensed firearms dealer. There are currently more than 100,000 such dealers across the country--to put that in some perspective, there are four times more gun dealers in America than there are McDonald's restaurants in the entire world. Operating the federal licensing system through these licensed dealers will minimize the burden on those wishing to obtain a license.  If a state opts-out of the federal program, an individual will go to a State-designated entity, like a local sheriff, local police department, or even Department of Motor Vehicles. It will all depend on where the state feels is best.  Either way, the purchaser will then need to:  Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and address;  Submit a thumb print;  Submit a current photograph;  Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information is true and that the applicant is qualified under federal law to possess a firearm; Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring knowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal responsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined by the state or federal authority;  Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands of juveniles (this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties of up to three years in jail for anyone failing to do so);  Undergo state and federal background checks.  Licenses will be renewable every five years, and can be revoked at any time if the licensee becomes disqualified under federal law from owning or possessing a gun.  And the fee for a license cannot exceed $25.  Once the bill takes effect, all future sales and transfers of firearms falling within the scope of the bill will have to be recorded through a federally licensed firearms dealer, with an accompanying NICS background check. That way, law enforcement agencies will have easier access to information leading to the arrest of persons who use guns in crime.  The bill covers both handguns and other guns that are semi-automatic and can accept detachable magazines.  The legislation covers handguns because statistically, these guns are used in more crimes than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all firearm homicides involve a handgun.  And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can accept detachable magazines, because these are the kind of assault weapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives in the shortest period of time.  A gun that can take a detachable magazine can also take a large capacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and you have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent years.  Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent the greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children in this nation.  Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept detachable magazines will remain exempt.  This represents a compromise between those who would rather not have this bill at all, and those of us who believe that universal coverage of all firearms would be appropriate.  Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation. But in no case will gun owners face jail time simply because they forgot to get a license:  Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 (for a first offense) and $5,000 for subsequent offenses.  Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will also result in penalties between $500 and $5,000, because this system works best for law enforcement when the perpetrators of gun crime can be quickly traced and arrested;  Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years in prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law enforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the straw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy access to a continuing flow of guns;  And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a firearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to kill or seriously injure another person. In this way, the bill truly puts a new sense of responsibility onto gun owners in America.  Mr. President, law enforcement in California tells me that a licensing and record of sale system like the one I am introducing today will help law enforcement, upon recovery of a firearm used in crime, to track the gun down to the person who sold it, and then to the person who bought it.  And this legislation also sets in place a method through which we can better attempt to ensure that gun owners are responsible and trained in the use and care of their dangerous possessions.  We have tried to minimize the burden of this bill at every turn:       The licensing process will take place through federally      licensed firearms dealers--as I mentioned earlier, there are      currently more than 100,000 in this country;       The fee for a license will be only $25;       Current gun owners will have ten years to get a license,      and guns now in homes will not have to be registered.       Future gun transfers will simply be recorded by licensed      dealers--as they are now--and a system will be put in place      to allow the quick tracing of guns used in crime. Gun owners      themselves will not have to register their old guns or send      any paperwork to the government.  Mr. President, this nation is awash in guns--there are more than 200 million of them in the United States. The problem of gun violence is not going away, and accidental deaths from firearms rob us of countless innocents each year.  Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not know how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. In fact, according to a study released early last year, in 1996 alone there were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than 18,000 firearm suicides--many of which might have been prevented if the person intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by somebody else. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill, particularly with regard to child access prevention, will begin the process of making it harder for children and others to gain easy access to firearms.  I know that this bill will not pass overnight. We have a long process of education ahead of us. But the American people are with us. The facts are with us. And common sense is with us.  I thank the Senate for its consideration of this measure, and I look forward to working with each of my colleagues to move this bill forward in the coming months.                                 ______                                       By
