 President, the Senate is about to vote on the Murray amendment which is the only amendment before this Senate that will restore actual dollars to the $1 billion cut to the Community Development Block Grant Program. We will see another amendment that is paid for by a 920 account that is now $10.5 billion in the hole--not real money.  When our Committee on Appropriations gets that next fall, all of the Senators will be asking: Why are we cutting CDBG? We did not put real money in to restore that cut, unless we pass the Murray amendment that is paid for by closing tax loopholes.  Real dollars are the difference between this and next fall when our Senators are asking us about CDBG money and why it is being cut. We will relate it directly back to this vote on this amendment.  Let everyone know where the real vote is. If no one believes me, read the Wall Street Journal article, ``Republican Budget Plan Advances as Challenges By Democrats Fail,'' outlining that Republicans in tighter reelection races are offering amendments that are not paid for.  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 15, 2006]    Republican Budget Plan Advances as Challenges by Democrats Fail                           (By David Rogers)       Washington--A Republican budget plan advanced in the      Senate, after Democrats narrowly failed to lift proposed      spending caps and impose tighter antideficit rules that would      make it harder to extend expiring tax cuts.       Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R., N.H.)      predicted passage of the resolution this week. But a      succession of 50-50 roll-call votes underscored the fragile      support for the plan, which projects higher deficits than the      White House's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.       Adding to the tension is that senators must temporarily set      aside the resolution today to address a companion bill that      would raise the nation's debt ceiling by $781 billion. The      new $8.965 trillion ceiling represents an estimated 50%      increase since Mr. Bush took office, and Sen. Kent Conrad      (D., N.D.) complained that the nation's debt is rising like a      ``scalded cat.''       Meanwhile, top House Republicans reached agreement last      evening on a set of lobbying and ethics-rules changes in      response to recent scandals. Elements include a moratorium on      privately funded trips for the remainder of this Congress, a      ban on lobbyists accompanying lawmakers on corporate      aircraft, and improved audits of disclosure reports filed by      lobbyists.       ``I think we have a good package here,'' said House Rules      Committee Chairman David Dreier (R., Cal.). Majority Leader      John Boehner (R., Ohio) hopes to begin moving major pieces--     such as the travel moratorium--through the House early next      month.       In the budget debate, Republicans admit they are more      cautious this election year in trying to use the budget      process to effect change in spending or tax policy. Mr. Gregg      has largely abandoned any attempt to use his power to order      Senate committees to come up with savings to slow the growth      of government benefits like Medicare. And the five-year      savings from such programs in his resolution is a fraction of      the $39 billion deficit-reduction bill signed by the      president last month.       This leaves the proposed $872.5 billion cap on      discretionary appropriations as a last symbol of fiscal      discipline, and Republicans have clung to the provisions for      fear of opening the door to unchecked spending.       Mr. Gregg would transfer more money to health and education      programs to win support from moderate Republicans. But      domestic cuts would be required, and by the chairman's      account, his adjustments are largely ``illusory.''       Republicans in tight re-election races are offering      amendments endorsing more spending for causes such as      veterans health care and education for the disabled, but      these are for show since no money has been added above the      cap. For example, $3 billion was restored for defense by Sen.      James Talent (R., Mo.) who said the ``highly skilled people''      in today's military result in higher personnel costs.       ``There's no such thing as a grunt anymore in America's      military.'' Mr. Talent said. The most serious challenge came      from Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) who proposed to raise      the cap by $6.3 billion to make room for education      priorities. But he failed 50-50 for lack of support from Sen.      Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), who is pursuing a less-direct      challenge to his leadership.       Mr. Specter is proposing that lawmakers get around the      $872.5 billion ceiling by allowing an extra $7 billion in      ``advanced appropriations,'' a category of spending often      used to fund education programs ahead of a school year. Mr.      Conrad appeared cool to this approach, but if Mr. Specter      could win over supporters of Mr. Kennedy's amendment, he      could prevail in a roll-call vote today.     * * * crucial to the nation's competitiveness. They are also      vital to U.S. defense industries, with many of the most-     advanced components and electronics made at newer facilities.       Economists point to growing import competition and an      exodus of U.S. production work to low-cost countries as      reasons for the birthrate slump. One indication is the      ballooning U.S. trade deficit, which hit another record in      January.       La-Z-Boy Inc., Monroe, Mich., a maker of recliners and      other furniture, felt the imports' bite in 2001, when      inexpensive wooden furniture from China began pouring into      the U.S. market. In response, the company closed 20 U.S.      factories and outsourced most of its own wood-furniture      production to China.       To be sure, some manufacturers are adding bricks and      mortar. Last year, computer maker Dell Inc. of Round Rock,      Texas, opened a $100 million assembly plant in North      Carolina, while Owens-Illinois Inc. of     Toledo, Ohio, poured $120 million into a Colorado factory      that now churns out one billion beer bottles a year.       But most of this growth is concentrated in a relatively      narrow array of sectors, such as food, rail equipment and      building materials, according to Commerce Department data.      The cement industry, for instance, is planning to add 18 new      plants at a total cost of $3.6 billion over the next four      years.       One measure of new factory construction--investment in      industrial structures--rose last year to $18.7 billion, up      more than 15% from 2004. ``But this spending is still just a      shadow of what it used to be,'' says Tom Runiewicz, an      industrial economist at Global Insight, a Lexington, Mass.,      economic consulting firm. In 1998, this type of investment      was about $43.7 billion, he said. It has become far more      common for companies to pour money into upgrading existing      plants to make them more productive. This helps explain how,      although U.S. industrial production has recovered, the urge      to build big new factories remains relatively weak, he says.      ``Our existing plants are just far more efficient.''       USG Corp., for instance, is rebuilding one plant in      Virginia and putting up a new one in Pennsylvania. The      Chicago maker of wallboard says the new plants will use      machinery that allows them to make wallboard far faster.      ``What we make is big, heavy, and relatively inexpensive,''      says Robert Williams, a USG spokesman, ``so usually, you make      it close to where you want to sell it.'' Indeed, USG has 40      plants scattered around the U.S. and has no plans to reduce      its manufacturing footprint.       One factor that gets lost is the size of individual plants.      Mr. Meckstroth believes many of the operations that are dying      off are smaller companies that have had trouble adapting to      the rise of import competition and other competitive forces.      ``But the bigger companies are surviving, because they have      the size and scale,'' he says. ``They can afford to put in      the new lines or move operations overseas themselves if      necessary.''
