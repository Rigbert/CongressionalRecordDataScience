 Let me again express the fact that I believe this bill has received the most extensive consideration of any bill since I have been in Congress, and that hasn't always happened.  The gentleman has been here for a number of years, and he was here, I believe, on June 25, 2003. He recalls that that was a bill which was the most massive change in Medicare in over a quarter of a century. The gentleman probably recalls that bill; the prescription drug bill, referred to affectionately. I know the gentleman must clearly remember how we considered that bill. But just on the off chance he doesn't, let me remind him.  On June 25, 2003, a new version was introduced and referred to committee. Hear me. New bill, introduced, referred to committee on June 25. On June 26, at 6:20 a.m. in the morning, a rule for martial law was considered by the Rules Committee, with 3 hours of debate and a Rangel substitute permitted with 1 hour of debate. On June 26 at 6:55 p.m., debate began pursuant to House Resolution 299. Then the House proceeded with 3 hours of general debate. On 6/27--6/27--at 2:32 a.m., there was a 50-minute vote, and the bill passed 216-215 after all of about 36 hours of exposure from introduction to passage.  Now, that bill, of course, went to conference, and it came back from conference. Let me remind my friend about the timing on the conference report.  On 11/21/2003 at 1:17 a.m., the conference report was filed. At 11/21/2003 at 3:41 a.m., 2 hours and approximately 20 minutes later, martial-law consideration of conference report by the Rules Committee. At 11/21, the same day, 2003, at 11:26 p.m.--now this started at 1:17 a.m. in the morning--at 11:26 p.m., it passed the House, the rule. Now, at 11:36 p.m., 10 minutes later--10 minutes later--Mr. Thomas brought up the conference report for consideration. At 11/22, at 2:39 a.m., we began to vote. I am sure you remember that vote. It took 3 hours.  Now, of course, we had had this under consideration from the day before at 1:17 a.m. when the conference report was reported back. This side of the aisle won for 2 hours and 45 minutes while you spent time changing votes on your side of the aisle. You were ultimately successful.  About 2 hours and 55 minutes into that particular vote, the longest vote which I have considered, and, frankly, the longest time this was considered as a piece of legislation, you changed the votes. And it won, 211-222, at 11/22 at 5:50 a.m.  In other words, consideration of the conference report was laid on the table at 11/21/2003 for the Rules Committee consideration, and by 11/22 at 5:50 a.m., about 30 hours later, it was passed.  I tell my friend in reviewing this, this was an 800-page bill, by the way, no extensive hearings on that bill. By the way, when you had press conferences regarding that bill, none of us were invited. You know that and I know that.  I would tell me friend with all due respect, this saying that the Democrats have rolled out a bill, we rolled out a bill 4 months ago. We rolled out a bill 6 months ago. We rolled out hearings 8, 9 and 10 months ago.  Your major piece of legislation, in 25 years the most significant amendment to the Medicare Act that had passed to that period of time, you passed with less than 48 hours' notice from the Rules Committee consideration to the passage. We have said we have had months of consideration, months of debate, months of transparency on the Web. Now on the Web we are going to give you, as I promised we would, at least 72 hours notice to read that bill and to have it considered on this floor.
