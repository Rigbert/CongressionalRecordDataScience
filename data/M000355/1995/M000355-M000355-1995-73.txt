 President, I want to take one moment to thank Tim Rieser and Luke Albee of Senator Leahy's staff; and from the Appropriations Committee staff Jim Bond, and Juanita Rilling; and, particularly, Mr. President, I want to extend my great appreciation to my personal staff members, Billy Piper, and my long-time foreign policy adviser, Robin Cleveland, for their determined work in helping us to produce this bill.  I am extremely grateful to Billy, particularly to Robin, for good advice not only on this occasion but over the years.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
