And if he thinks the press will be dispositive of that issue, I will take that to heart.  Mr. Leader, could you also tell me the status of the Partial Birth Abortion Bill that we had understood would be considered early, perhaps as early as next week? And there was some discussion about it this week, but now we hear there may be an intent to wait on the other body's acting on this and sending it to the House. Can you bring us up to date on what the plans are on this?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. At this time I do not believe the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) has scheduled any action on this legislation, the partial birth abortion ban. Having said that, I do believe that this is really important legislation. This is something that the Senate has indicated they will move early this year, and it is certainly something that I would expect the House to vote on at least by the beginning of the summer.
