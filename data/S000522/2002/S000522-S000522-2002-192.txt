Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the gentlewoman from California, the amendment that she offers, if enacted, will result in babies being brutally killed by abortion and will force pro-life Americans to facilitate the slaughter of innocent children. This is an abortion facilitation amendment. It will turn our military hospitals into abortion mills.  Mr. Chairman, it is time we ended our collective denial. Abortion is violence against children. Some abortion methods dismember and rip apart the fragile, precious bodies of children. Abortion methods also chemically poison children. There is nothing benign, there is nothing curing or nurturing about abortion. It is violence against children.  We worry a lot about chemical weapons, especially in the post-anthrax scare that we had, which actually affected my own district. What do my colleagues think these abortion chemicals do to children when they are injected into the amniotic sac? A high-concentrated saline badly burns the baby. It is violence against children.  Let us be about nurturing, promoting prenatal care and maternal health care, not the killing of babies.
