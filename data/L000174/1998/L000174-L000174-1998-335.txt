President, April 10, 1998 was not only Good Friday andPassover for millions of people around the world. It was a day that marked a beginning for the people of Northern Ireland. A beginning on a path toward peace after thirty long years of civil conflict that claimed over 3000 lives. Although a great deal of work lies ahead to ensure that the peace agreement signed in Belfast is adopted by all parties and faithfully implemented, the agreement is an achievement of immense historic significance.  Over the years, like so many Americans who are proud of their Irish heritage, I have wondered if I would live to see this day. Some years ago, not long after the first cease-fire began, I traveled to Northern Ireland and met with both Catholics and Protestants. Both longed for peace. Both asked me to urge President Clinton, who had taken a chance for peace when he granted a visa to Gerry Adams, to stay the course. We all knew there would be setbacks. We knew more innocent blood would be lost. But while some longed for a past that was gone and others for a future that could never be, most knew that violence could not bring peace and that the only way to a better life was through compromise.  The April 10th agreement represents the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort, and a great deal of courage, by many people. As party leaders, John Hume, whom I consider it a great privilege to call a friend, Gerry Adams, and David Trimble brought their constituents' longing for peace to the negotiating table and understood the responsibility history had thrust upon them and the need to find the middle ground. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, deserve enormous praise for putting the full weight of their offices and their personal reputations behind the negotiations.  Several other people I want to pay tribute to are former Irish Prime Ministers Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, and former Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who put the peace process in motion and labored day and night to keep it moving forward despite setbacks. Throughout this period Former Irish Ambassador Dermot Gallagher and his successor Sean O'Huiginn played a critical role keeping us informed here in Washington as they worked to further the peace process.  But I want to make particular mention of our former Senate colleague, George Mitchell, whose wisdom, steady perseverance and total dedication to the cause of peace enabled the parties to find a way to put the years of hatred behind them and look to a new day.  Senator Mitchell came from humble beginnings. Born to Lebanese and Irish immigrants in rural Maine, he worked his way through Bowdoin College and Georgetown Law School. As a federal judge and from the time he joined the Senate in 1982, he demonstrated patience, even-handedness and commitment to the public good. As Majority Leader, he served as an articulate national spokesman, a trusted colleague and a good friend.  As the first serving U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, President Clinton made a commitment to the peace process early on, courageously put his prestige on the line by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, and showed great foresight in his appointment of Senator Mitchell as chairman of the negotiations. As I said at that time, I could not have imagined a person better suited to bring the sides together and forge a common path to the future. George Mitchell managed to do what many in the foreign policy establishment said was impossible. As the crafter of the agreement, he has given hope to millions of Irish citizens, and in doing so he has shown the world that even the most seemingly intractable conflicts, even the most bitter hatred, can be overcome.  Mr. President, an April 18, 1998 article by Mark Shields in the Washington Post gives a good description of Senator George Mitchell and his latest achievement. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 18, 1998]                         The Politics of Peace                           (By Mark Shields)       After hearing the happy news from Ireland that peace could      actually break out there, I found my notes from a campaign      speech given in 1993 by an American politician. This is what      he said then about his earlier career as a federal judge:       ``In that position, I had great power. The one I enjoyed      exercising most was when I presided over what are called      naturalization ceremonies.       ``They're citizenship ceremonies. People who come from all      over the world who had gone through the required procedures      now gathered before me in a federal courtroom, and in that      final act I administered to them the oath of allegiance to      the United States. And then, by the power invested in me      under the Constitution, I made them Americans.       ``It was always a very emotional and moving ceremony for me      because my mother was a Lebanese immigrant and my father was      the orphan son of Irish immigrants.       ``My parents had no education. My mother could not read or      write English. And they worked--my mother in a textile mill,      and my father as a janitor--all of their lives, to see that      their children had the education and the opportunity they did      not have. . . .       ``And after every one of those ceremonies, I spoke      personally with each of the new citizens. I asked them where      they came from, how they came, why they came. Their answers      were as different as their countries of origin. But through      those answers ran a common theme best summarized by a young      Asian man who, when I asked him why he came here, responded      in slow and halting English.       `` `I came here,' he said, `because here in America      everybody has a chance.' A young man who had been an American      for five minutes summed up the meaning of our country in a      single sentence.       ``Many of us, most of us in this room, derive great      benefits from our citizenship. And most of us are citizens by      an accident of birth, not by an act of free will.       ``With those benefits come responsibility, and foremost      among those responsibilities is our obligation to see to it      that those who follow us, the generations yet unborn, have      opportunity, have hope, have the right to a good, decent      life, a good job, a good-paying job, the opportunity to feed,      clothe, house and educate one's children in the best way      possible.''       Much, too much, has been written in recent years about the      politics of values. That 1993 speech expressed      straightforwardly the values of an American politician--     George Mitchell, Democrat from Maine, former Senate majority      leader--who, over the past 22 months, through a combination      of heroic patience, consummate prudence and a near-unique      ability to publicly submerge his own ego, has crafted the      peace plan for Northern Ireland.       Politics is the peaceable resolution of conflict among      legitimate competing interests. That is what Mitchell brought      to Belfast from Waterville, Maine, after working his way      through Bowdoin College and night law school at Georgetown      University. A committed partisan, he helped run the two      losing national campaigns of his mentor, Sen. Edmund Muskie      of Maine.       Neither a plaster saint nor politically invincible,      Mitchell himself ran in 1972 for the chairmanship of the      Democratic National Committee and lost to Robert Strauss of      Texas. In the Watergate election of 1974, when Democrats      swept nearly everything, Mitchell still lost the governorship      of Maine to an independent. When Muskie left the Senate in      1980 to become secretary of state, Mitchell was chosen to      succeed him.       At the 1987 Iran-contra hearings, Mitchell gave a civics      lesson to the nation, as he bluntly advised the grandstanding      Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North to ``recognize that it is      possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the      contras and still love God and still love this country as      much as you do.       ``Although He is regularly asked to do so, God does not      take sides in American politics. And in America, disagreement      with the policies of the government is not evidence of lack      of patriotism.''       British Prime Minister Tony Blair was indispensable to the      peace agreement. So, too, was Irish Prime Minister Bertie      Ahern. And the courageous Protestant and Catholic leaders in      the North. President Clinton, against the jaded opposition of      the foreign policy establishment and over the objections of      his own State and Justice Departments, took the bold risks      for peace. He has been a leader.       But it was the son of George and Mary Saad Mitchell of      Waterville who was to grow up and remind us in Easter week      1998 that politicians can also be peacemakers.                          ____________________
