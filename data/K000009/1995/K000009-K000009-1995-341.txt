. Treasury Department and the Federal reserve. If you have ever been over to the Federal Reserve, they have the largest board room meeting table you have ever seen in your life. I do not know where they [[Page H216]] got lumber for it. It is absolutely gigantic. On one side of the table we would have all the claimants who want our taxpayers' money, right? Would that not be great? And then on the other side we would have the representatives of every single company that has shut down in this country, and the workers that worked in those plants on the other side of the table; would that not be a great meeting over there? They would have more fun.  We would finally get the American people inside that board room and take them up to the Treasury Department, with the big room that they have over there with all the chandeliers. Would it not be an interesting meeting of all the bankers, Wall Street investors, the multinationals, the big banks who want loans and money from our taxpayers, putting our taxpayers at risk, and then the very people they put out of work in the same room? I think it would be one of the most exciting meetings in Washington.
