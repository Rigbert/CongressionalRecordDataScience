 President, I wish to honor Zev Yaroslavsky, who is retiring at the end of this year, after a distinguished and illustrious career spanning 40 years as a public servant in the State of California. We wish to extend to Mr. Yaroslavsky our sincerecongratulations for the decades of dedicated service that he has given to his Nation, his State, his city, and his county.  Mr. Yaroslavsky was first elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1994 and is in the final year of his fifth term on the Board. He has served as chair of the Board, which is rotated annually among the supervisors, four times. For the past 20 years, he has represented the Third Supervisorial District, where he will be remembered as a devoted public servant who amassed numerous accomplishments and innumerable awards.  Mr. Yaroslavsky represents nearly 2 million residents in his district. His efforts primarily have focused on fiscal, health care, transportation, the environment, veterans affairs, homelessness, and the arts. Prior to representing the Third Supervisorial District, he served on the Los Angeles City Council from 1975 to 1994 to which he was elected and re-elected six times.  As a Los Angeles City councilman, Mr. Yaroslavsky honed his fiscal skills as the respected chair of the Council's Finance Committee, and he also earned a reputation as a politician who was willing to take on issues that others would not, including the highly controversial excessive use of force and intelligence gathering policies of the Los Angeles Police Department. As councilman, he also co-authored two landmark initiatives with his colleague, the late Councilman Marvin Braude: Proposition U (1986) which cut by half the commercial development rights adjacent to residential neighborhoods, and Proposition O (1988) which repealed a drilling permit previously issued to the Occidental Petroleum Company.  Most notably, a few of his major accomplishments as supervisor include authoring the 1996 Proposition `A' park bond that resulted in the preservation of rural open space and the development of urban parks throughout the county. He also authored the 2002 Proposition `B' trauma tax, approved by over 73 percent of county voters, which is largely credited with stabilizing the county's health care finances.  Mr. Yaroslavsky was the driving force behind the Orange Line busway across the San Fernando Valley which opened in 2005 to record ridership (22,000 daily boardings). He led the effort to rebuild and modernize the world famous Hollywood Bowl amphitheater which re-opened in 2004, and he was instrumental in the development of Walt Disney Concert Hall, the home of the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra, which opened in 2003. He has also helped fund major investments in the L.A. County Museum of Art and the County's Museum of Natural History. He is regarded as the county's fiscal watchdog, insisting that it live within its means.  Since 1991, Mr. Yaroslavsky has also been associated with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, NDI, a non-governmental organization headquartered in Washington, DC, that promotes the development of democratic institutions in burgeoning democracies. He has monitored three international elections for NDI: Romania (1990), Mexico (2000), and Ukraine (2004). He also has conducted seminars on democratic institution-building in Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  While these are just some of Zev Yaroslavsky's significant accomplishments, on behalf of the U.S. Senate and the State of California, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his inestimable contributions throughout his renowned career. With sincere best wishes, we congratulate Mr. Yaroslavsky upon his retirement from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. We are pleased to join his many co-workers, family, friends, and associates in wishing him health, happiness, and continued good fortune in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
