 President, yesterday's TPA vote was a long-overdue victory for the American worker and the American middle class. It was not easy. Many thought it would never happen. We even saw corks pop in the facts-optional lobby a few weeks ago. But that proved to be premature because here is what we have always known about the legislation we will vote to send to the President today. It is underpinned by a simple but powerful idea: For American workers to have a fair shot in the 21st-century economy, it makes sense to remove the unfair barriers that discriminate against them and the products they make.  Some may disagree. They certainly were not quiet in voicing their opinions. It is OK if they do not share our passion for ending this unfair discrimination against American workers. It is OK if they would rather rail against them tomorrow. But a bipartisan coalition in the House and the Senate thought it was time for forward progress instead.  We were very pleased to see President Obama pursue an idea we have long believed in. We thank him for his efforts to help us advance this measure. We thank all of our friends across the aisle for their efforts, too, Senator Wyden most of all. Over in the House, I commend Speaker Boehner and Chairman Ryan for everything they have done. It hasn't been easy, and without them it would not have been possible. Of course, let me thank Chairman Orrin Hatch for demonstrating such patience, persistence, and determination throughout this process. He never lost sight of the goal. He never gave up. The people of Utah are lucky to have him.  The Senate's work on trade does not end today. I said the Senate would finish pursuing the rest of the full trade package, and it will. We will take another cloture vote today to that end. That process continues. But the key victory for American workers and products stamped ``Made in the U.S.A.'' comes today. The bill we are about to pass will assert Congress's authority throughout the trade negotiation process. It will ensure that we have the tools we need to properly scrutinize whatever trade agreements are ultimately negotiated. It will make clear that the final say rests with us.  We had plenty of bumps along the road--frankly, a few big potholes, too--but we worked across the aisle to get through all of them. That is an example of how a new Congress is back to work for the American people. I thank everyone who helped us get where we are. Now let's vote again to support the American worker and the American middle class by approving the bipartisan TPA bill.                          ____________________
