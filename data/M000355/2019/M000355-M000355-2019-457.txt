 In this case, I am proud to say this new lifetime judge will be another fine Kentuckian.  For those of us who know Justin Walker and have seen his work up close, it is clear that President Trump made an outstanding choice to be a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky.  Mr. Walker has sharpened his legal skills at the highest levels, including premier clerkships to then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC circuit and former Justice Anthony Kennedy.  As a prominent attorney and law professor, he has earned the respect of his peers in the legal world and of the community that he will serve on the bench.  For his students, Mr. Walker has been a mentor who helps push them to fulfill their potential in the classroom and throughout their legal careers.  His thoughtful and deliberate approach fit the mold of a Federal judge who--imagine this--will uphold the laws and the Constitution as they are actually written, not as he might wish them to be.  So I am confident Mr. Walker will serve our Commonwealth and the country extremely well as a district judge. I look forward to voting to confirm him, and I certainly urge my colleagues to join me.                          ____________________
