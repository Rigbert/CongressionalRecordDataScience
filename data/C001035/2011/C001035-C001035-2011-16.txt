President, I wish to thank the committee chairman for his extremely generous remarks. It has been a great pleasure to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee, and I very much appreciate his outstanding leadership.  Senator Levin and I actually go way back to when I was a staffer on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I was a staff director of a subcommittee on which he was the ranking member and chairman. It went back and forth with Senator Cohen. It has been a great honor and pleasure to serve as his colleague during these past 15 years. So I appreciate his comments.  I thank the Chair.
