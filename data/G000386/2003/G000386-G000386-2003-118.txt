 President, it is with great pride that I honor and congratulate the Drug Enforcement Agency on its 30th Anniversary. This is an important milestone for the DEA and for our country. Over the last thirty years the men and women of the DEA have worked in communities around the Nation to improve the quality of life for all Americans.  The Drug Enforcement Agency was established on October 4, 1973, soon after John R. Bartles, Jr., was confirmed by the Senate as the DEA's first Administrator. Since then, the men and women of the DEA have continued to serve our Nation with courage and dedication in the face of great odds.  In recognition of this thirty year milestone, it is fitting that we pay tribute to the work and sacrifices of the men and women of the DEA and also acknowledge the organizations many accomplishments.  Currently the DEA operates 173 domestic offices and 78 overseas offices with over 8,800 employees. The DEA continues to lead task forces throughout our Nation's communities in a cooperative effort to control both the consumption and flow of illegal drugs.  Between 1986 and 2002, DEA agents seized over 10,000 kilograms of heroin, 900,000 kilograms of cocaine, 4,600,000 kilograms of marijuana, 113,000,000 dosage units of hallucinogens, and 1,500,000,000 dosage unites of methamphetamine, and made over 443,000 arrests of drug traffickers.  Let me also express my deepest thanks to the DEA for their work and commitment to protecting the communities of Iowa. Although Interstates 80 and 35 cross Iowa providing a ready smuggling route for many drug trafficking organizations, their work has had a tremendous effect on our efforts to squeeze the flow of illegal narcotics through the state. During 2002 the DEA participated in 28 highway interdictions in Iowa, leading to the seizure of approximately 56 kilograms of cocaine, 40.5 pounds of methamphetamine, 2,075 pounds of marijuana, and nearly $1.9 million in cash. Additionally they assisted in the seizure of 871 clandestine laboratories.  Throughout its history, the DEA has proven steadfast in their commitment to bringing drug traffickers to justice. Their service to our country has indeed made a tremendous difference in our nation's communities. However, these accomplishments did not come without a price. Many men and women of the DEA have given their lives and many others wounded and injured in the defense of our Nation.  I am pleased to submit a resolution honoring the men and women of the DEA on their 30th anniversary for their efforts to defend the American people from illegal drugs. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in congratulating and honoring the men and women of the DEA for their many accomplishments and sacrifices throughout their first thirty years. I have every confidence that these men and women will continue in that same tradition of excellence. To those in the DEA both past and present, I offer my sincerest gratitude for your courage, dedication, and service.                          ____________________
