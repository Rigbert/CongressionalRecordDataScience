 On the appropriations conference reports, the gentleman mentioned a number of conference reports, Homeland Security and DOD and the DOD authorization. Is there a possibility that the legislative branch appropriation conference report could come to the floor next week as well or any other conference reports?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, the gentleman is correct. We are in conference on legislative branch, and we also are in conference on the military construction. Both of those could very well be ready for action next week. The appropriators are working hard, and it looks like they are doing their business once we get into conferences. So, yes, military construction and legislative branch could very well be up next week.
