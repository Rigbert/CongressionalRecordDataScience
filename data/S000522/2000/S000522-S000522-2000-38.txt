Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge Members to support the Coburn motion to instruct conferees, to accept the Senate-passed amendment to protect young girls from being given powerful abortion drugs at school.  I say again, we are talking about a school setting, and that is no place. It is bad enough that this kind of action takes place in abortion mills. To think that we would sanction in any way or shape or form the prescribing of this kind of death to an unborn child at school is outrageous.  It should be noted that these abortion drugs not only destroy a newly created life, but they do indeed carry significant risks for the young student.                              {time}  1730  As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said a moment ago, with Preven, if we look at the conditions, what the manufacturer itself says, and I quote, ``These conditions can cause serious disability or even death.'' We are talking about this being given out in a high school or junior high or elementary school setting. Our elementary and secondary schools should be the last place, Mr. Speaker, the last place where legitimate parental rights are trampled and usurped, especially when the health or the life of their daughter is at risk. Our elementary and secondary schools should be the place where life is affirmed and respect for life is affirmed; again, the last place where abortion drugs are used.  Years ago, many of us warned that school-based clinics would be misused to facilitate abortions for minors, especially by way of referrals to abortion mills. We know that is going on. Planned Parenthood alone does over 200,000 abortions in its own clinics each and every year, many of them by referrals from schools. But now we know that at least 180 schools across the country offer abortion drugs at their school-based clinics. That is outrageous for parents and for their daughters.  Mr. Speaker, we need to speak up loud and clear. Support the gentleman's very, very smart and wise motion.
