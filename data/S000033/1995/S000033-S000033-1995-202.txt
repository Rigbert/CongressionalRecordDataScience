 I did not bring any photographs of Vermonters with me, but I can tell you that I have attended many meetings at senior citizen centers throughout the State of Vermont, and I can tell you right now, and many people who are not senior citizens do not understand, oh, if somebody has Medicare, they have everything they need. No problem. They are fully covered. But you understand that with Medicare, people are paying sizeable premiums. Often they have to take out what is called Medigap insurance in addition to that. And despite that, Medicare does not cover prescription drugs.  So right now in the State of Vermont, many, many people say, ``I have to make a choice between heating my home in the wintertime, it gets very cold in Vermont in the wintertime, or coming up with the money to pay my prescription drugs.''  Now what will happen to those people if they are forced to pay larger premiums or more out-of-pocket expenses? God only knows, but it will certainly be a very terrible day for them.  I think the main point that I would like to make in this discussion, and you have already made the point, is that we all recognize that this country has a serious deficit and a serious national debt. Our Republican friends have not told us, however, how giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country is going to move us forward toward balancing the budget.  What we are talking about is a tax bill in which half of the tax breaks go to people making $100,000 a year or more. Further, 25 percent of the tax breaks go to people making $200,000 a year or more, and the wealthiest 1 percent get more in tax breaks than the bottom 60 percent.
