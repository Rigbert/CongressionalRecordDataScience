Chairman, it is a constructive ``Buy American'' amendment, and I would encourage everybody to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant).  The amendment was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there any further amendments to the bill?  If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Under the rule, the Committee rises.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Calvert) having assumed the chair, Mr. Quinn, Chairman pro tempore of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1551) to authorize the Federal Aviation Administration's civil aviation research and development programs for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 290, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.
