Mr. Speaker, President Bush has provided hope to oppressed women everywhere, especially in China, promising them that the United States will no longer subsidize those who engage in forced abortion and other coercive population control programs.  For over 20 years, Mr. Speaker, the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) has enabled facilitated, and shamelessly whitewashed terrible crimes against humanity, especially crimes against women, and the United States will now no longer have any part in subsidizing them. In refusing to fund the UNFPA, our President and our country have taken the side of the oppressed and have refused to cooperate with the oppressor. The United States will now no longer directly or indirectly fund the brutal, oppressive Chinese Government's violence against women.  Mr. Speaker, as Secretary of State Colin Powell said yesterday, UNFPA funds have provided crucial technical support that has made China's barbaric program more effective. That means that as a result of UNFPA's complicity with China's antilife program more women are targeted for forced abortions.  Mr. Speaker, tens of millions of children have been slaughtered and their mothers have been robbed by the state of their children. The UNFPA for over 20 years has aggressively defended the indefensible, this barbaric policy that makes brothers and sisters illegal and makes women the victims of population control cadres.  This whitewashing of crimes against humanity must end. My hope is that other parliaments around the world, will take a good long second look at the one child per couple policy in China and cease their enabling of this violence against women.  Thank you President Bush.                          ____________________
