 Chairman, I would respectfully suggest to my friend that there are provisions in this bill which provide grants through the Rural Outreach Grants Program, which include dental programs, although primarily it is not dental. But I would hope that at conference committee time an effort could be made to expand funding or add funding to that in order to make sure that low-income kids in this country do not continue to have teeth rotting in their mouths.
