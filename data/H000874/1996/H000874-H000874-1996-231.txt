Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3376. In particular, I am pleased that the bill authorizes $15.1 million for major renovations at the Perry Point Medical Center in Maryland.  The project will focus on renovating and reconfiguring the patient rooms in the psychiatric nursing units in order to improve patient privacy. Two of the buildings involved in the project were built in 1935 and this project will meet disability accessibility requirements and upgrade and modernize the facility's utilities. Additionally, this legislation will instruct the Veterans' Administration to meet space planning criteria and standards set by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.  The Perry Point VA Medical Center provides excellent extended and psychiatric care to veterans throughout the State of Maryland as well as the mid-Atlantic region who have served our Nation so ably in the name of freedom and democracy. Perry Point, along with the VA medical center at Baltimore and the other facilities included in the Chesapeake network, provide specialty services to tens of thousands of veterans each year.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise with my colleagues in support of this measure which embodies a bipartisan commitment to providing the best services for our Nation's veterans.  Veterans from throughout the Fifth Congressional District and the State of Maryland will be better served as a result of this legislation and the ensuing improvements at the Perry Point VA Medical Center and I am pleased to rise with my colleagues today in support of H.R. 3376.
