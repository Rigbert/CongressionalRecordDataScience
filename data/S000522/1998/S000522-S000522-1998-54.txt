Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 415, to promote independent radio broadcasting in Africa. I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors of this resolution introduced by my friend, Mr. Royce, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa.  Radio is probably the most important mass communications medium in Africa, a continent plagued by numerous conflicts and crises. Radio is the primary means of transmitting vital information between African populations. It has the potential to do much good--both as a source of independent, accurate news, and as a catalyst for humanitarian, democratic, and economic progress. Unfortunately, it also has been subject to abuse. As many here will recall, ethnic ``hate radio'' fanned the flames of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which claimed upwards of half a million lives.  The freedom, independence, and professionalism of African radio are becoming increasingly important to the future prospects of that continent. Thus, House Resolution 415 makes clear that this House supports surrogate broadcasting and the training of African journalists through the Voice of America's ``Radio Democracy for Africa'' project; urges the expansion of USIA's economic, political, and human rights programming in Africa to support indigenous programming in those areas; urges the Agency for International Development to adopt a comprehensive strategy to promote free and independent African media; and urges the United States Government to support freedom and independence for African radio journalists through several means, such as foreign investment and inter-governmental dialogue.  I encourage all my colleagues to support this important resolution.
