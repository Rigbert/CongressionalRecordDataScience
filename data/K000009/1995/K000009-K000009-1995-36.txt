Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the Gingrich budget reconciliation bill.  First, let me state at the outset that I support a balanced budget. I voted in favor of the balanced budget amendment that passed in January 1995. I am committed to putting our fiscal house in order by supporting further cuts in spending to reduce the deficit. However, I cannot in good conscience support this budget bill, which would unfairly place the burden of deficit reduction on the backs of our Nation's seniors, children, disabled citizens, students, veterans, and working families, in order to provide a tax cut to the privileged few.  Overall, middle-income working families earning less than $50,000 will lose $648 a year as a result of the tax provisions and cuts in programs under this bill, while wealthy families will receive an average tax cut of $14,050 per household. This bill imposes a $23.3 billion tax increase on 14.2 million working families with incomes under $28,553. Two-thirds of the $900 billion in program reductions in H.R. 2491 come from programs that are absolutely vital to the health, welfare, and safety of working men and women, their children and families--$270 billion from Medicare; $170 billion from Medicaid; and $200 billion in education, health and safety, and job training programs.                                medicare
