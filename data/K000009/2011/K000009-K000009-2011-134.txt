Chair, I just want to begin with a map of Arizona, showing all of the colored areas of Arizona that are actually Federal property, over half of the State. My amendment deals with PILT and Federal payments to places like Arizona, which is on a continuing welfare system of government spending and has been for many, many decades.  Let me now show you the State of Ohio, where there are proposals that the Community Development Block Grant funds in the base bill are being cut. This is Ohio. We don't have much Federal property. We hardly have anything at all related to federal government. Ohioans have to make it in the free market. And yet what's happening in the bill is that more money is going to pay out for PILT than for places like I represent in the Midwest, where unemployment is so high. The bill actually cuts Community Development Block Grant dollars for cities and towns across this country to the tune of $2.95 billion. And yet, the base bill continues these PILT payments, which are really welfare payments to the West.  If this Congress is serious about cutting spending, we need to address some of the fundamental challenges contained in what I call megamarks. These aren't earmarks; these are big megamarks that benefit certain regions of the country at the expense of others.  Just to give you a sense of this, these subsidies have existed for generations. It's time that the West stood on its own two feet. These subsidies cannot be afforded by the other parts of the country that don't have that kind of Federal largesse. If we're going to have sacrifice in this legislation, then it needs to be shared. We need to reduce the payments in lieu of taxes called PILT by 75 percent. That's just the administrative costs that we're reducing. What's good for the cities of Toledo and Detroit, Boise, Dallas, Charlotte, Salt Lake City, and Reno is really good for the Western subsidized communities as well.  PILT is mandatory spending just like farm subsidies, and outside our annual appropriation bill's spending recommendations. My amendment targets the administration of those funds. Let me just put a couple figures on the record, and then I would like to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to my dear friend, the ranking member, Mr. Moran.  For the PILT subsidy, the West has received over the last 10 years. Let's look at Arizona. Arizona has gotten an increase from $10.3 million in 1999 to $31.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Idaho has gone up three times, from $8.3 million to $26.4 million. Montana from $9.8 million to over $28 million. Nevada from $7.1 million to in excess of $23 million. New Mexico more than tripled from $11 million to over $37 million. And Texas has leapt from $1.3 million to $4.3 million. Utah from $9.7 million to over $33 million. And Wyoming, which has fewer people than the District of Columbia, which is going to lose funds under the Community Development Block Grant program, 10 years ago received $8 million annually, and now Wyoming will receive over $25 million. Come now. For empty property where the Federal resource is already located there and can serve as an economic engine?  To begin with, you can pivot so much development off of that federal presence. You can do economic development off of tourism. You can use those lands to attract investors who like to drill on those lands, and improve those lands. You can attract economic development around what I would call Federal encampments. My goodness, it's really amazing what can be accomplished with some creativity and vision.  You know how much my district gets for our thousands of acres of Federal wildlife refuges? Are you ready? $180. Yes. One hundred and eighty dollars compared to billions and billions and billions going out in these permanent PILT subsidies.  And you know what? PILT doesn't even begin to account for what the West gets for oil and gas leasing subsidies, livestock grazing, timber harvesting. I think one of the reasons our Midwestern taxpayers are feeling the tax load so heavily is some other parts of the country are really being lifted up by the federal government, and they don't even appreciate what they have.  For my colleagues, if you want to send the American people a message that you are serious about cutting spending, the place to begin is by cutting the administrative fees of PILT.
