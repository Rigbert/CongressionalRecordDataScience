President, I offer this amendment and urge the Senate to go on record opposing the George W. Bush tax cut. It is a risky proposal. It threatens our economy. It raids the Social Security trust fund. It provides no funding protection for Social Security or Medicare. It eliminates needed investments in education. Sadly, the tax cuts go primarily to the wealthiest people in America. The Bush tax cut is a $50,000 tax cut if you make over $300,000 a year. For 60 percent of American families, it is a tax cut of $249.  Some of my Republican colleagues who say they have endorsed George W. Bush and his plan have a chance to follow the admonition of that noted political philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said: ``Stand by your man.'' But for those who want this economy to continue to prosper, and America to continue to be strong, vote ``no'' on the George W. Bush tax cut.  (
