 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., Friday, January 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; and the Senate resume consideration of S. 1 as under the previous order.
