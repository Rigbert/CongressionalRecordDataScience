President, one of Vermont's premier businesses is celebrating its 80th anniversary this year. Ethan Allen Furniture has come to represent the very highest standards and quality that Vermont has to offer.  In 1932, two brothers-in-law from New York City established a wholesale company that sold small housewares. Four years later, they purchased a bankrupt furniture factory in Beecher Falls, VT, and began manufacturing early American furniture branded as the Ethan Allen line. They eventually renamed the company after Ethan Allen, a Revolutionary War hero who played an integral role in America's fight for independence and Vermont's admission to the Union as the 14th State.  Over the years, Ethan Allen Furniture has grown into one of the world's most prominent furniture makers and interior design specialists, with over 300 stores worldwide and manufacturing centers around the globe.  This world-renowned company has remained close to its Vermont roots and continues to employ many Vermonters because of their unique talent and experience in finely crafted furniture. It was great to see that the company's president, CEO, and chairman, Farooq Kathwari, recently visited with employees at the Orleans, VT, facility to celebrate the company's anniversary and its return to profitability.  I congratulate Ethan Allen Furniture on this monumental anniversary, and I wish them much success in the future.  I ask unanimous consent that the September 26, 2012, Caledonian Record article entitled ``Ethan Allen Celebrates 80 Years'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Caledonian Record, Sept. 26, 2012]                    Ethan Allen Celebrates 80 Years                            (By Robin Smith)       Ethan Allen CEO, President and Chairman Farooq Kathwari      praised his employees in Vermont Tuesday afternoon and      announced performance raises as part of the company's 80th      anniversary.       Ethan Allen plants in Orleans and Beecher Falls are      profitable now for the first time since the Great Recession,      Kathwari told employees who gathered in a plant storage      facility at the Orleans facility to eat cake and celebrate.       The company wanted to begin the big anniversary celebration      in Vermont where it began 80 years ago in Beecher Falls.       This morning, Kathwari and Ethan Allen officials will ring      the bell to open the New York Stock Exchange. And in the next      several weeks, the company will unveil a new line of American      furniture and launch a marketing campaign, Kathwari said.       The company converted its operation in Orleans and      elsewhere from mass production to custom-manufacturing over a      year and a half, he said. The profitability and efficiency in      Orleans is up 30 to 40 percent in the last two years, he      added.       And now, instead of buying products from China, Kathwari      said Ethan Allen is selling its furniture to China.       Ethan Allen received a fairly large order from China last      year and has retail stores there.       ``You folks will make orders for China. Think of that,'' he      said.       ``If someone had said . . . we would make lamps for China,      we would have said `That's crazy.' ''       Kathwari invited a select group of company retailers,      marketers, designers, board members and initial investors,      plus local legislators, to a tour of the Orleans plant before      he spoke to employees. Kathwari recognized long-time      employees at the plant, one of whom had been at the plant for      53 years and introduced company leaders who had longevity      with the company.       That's how Ethan Allen has survived 80 years and grown, he      said, because experience and longevity allows nimble      adaptability. ``To be around for 80 years, you have to by      plan or by accident reinvent it,'' he said.       Ethan Allen survived the Great Depression, he said, and now      the Great Recession.       The company kept 70 percent of its manufacturing in the      U.S., Kathwari said, ``which is remarkable.''       The company is committed to the Orleans plant, where 320      employees make tables, chairs and other furniture that has      the name of the customer on the bar code label. Each piece      being manufactured in Orleans is already sold ``and our      people know it,'' Kathwari said.       The Orleans staff have tremendous experience and knowledge,      the Orleans and Beecher     Falls plants have technological improvements from ongoing      investments over the years and the area has the best      sustainable hardwood resources in the world, he said.       Because of these things and the productivity and quality in      Orleans, Kathwari announced the reintroduction of performance      raises this year.       ``Those who have done a good job will get an increase,'' he      said.       He said the new plant in Honduras, like the Mexican plant,      turns raw resources into materials for the upholstery      manufacturing plant in North Carolina, he said.       Without that Mexican plant, Ethan Allen would not have been      profitable during the recession, he said.       The company's vertical integration, from bringing in raw      wood at Beecher Falls, to wood work in Orleans to the      company's own stores and interior designers, means it was      able to survive and change in reaction to globalization and      mass market changes.       The company is public but is fortunate in being able to      think long term, Kathwari said, noting that he has served as      CEO for 40 years.       Challenges remain for the company in Vermont, including the      high price of electricity, at two times that in North      Carolina and three to four times that of overseas where the      price is kept down by government, he said.       Also the increasing cost of health care is a concern, he      said.       The founders bought the Beecher Falls wood plant and      renamed it Ethan Allen, a mark of the colonial American      furniture the company made.       Kathwari said the company will unveil five new American      lifestyle lines of furniture, from modern to classic--     reflecting the global style of America today. Sneak peeks      were available from the classic-lined wood chairs and tables      and headboards, in Fiesta Ware type colors, and other      beautiful pieces in various stages of construction at the      plant Tuesday.       He hopes to see sales continue to increase, as they have      for the past two years, he said by about 15 percent each      year.                          ____________________
