 President, I rise today to express support for the Drug-Free Communities Act and I would like to commend its sponsors, Senators Grassley, Daschle, DeWine, and D'Amato for their efforts in developing this important legislation.  Unfortunately, a recent poll conducted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America indicated that younger and younger children are using drugs. This poll is only the latest evidence of a very disturbing trend of increasing drug use by young people. It is important that we act to stop drug use and to prevent the devastation that drug use will have on America's young people.  The Drug-Free Communities Act is an important step in this effort. This legislation provides local community groups, who have proven track records addressing teen drug use, with the funding they need to really combat drug usage. The Drug-Usage Communities Act creates an advisory commission, consisting of local community leaders, who will oversee the program and make sure that funds are directed to those groups that are successful in fighting drug use by America's children. The act provides funding only to those groups that can match the Federal dollars with non-Federal funds, ensuring that viable community groups will participate in the program and sustain anti-drug efforts as the fight continues. Lastly, the Drug-Free Communities Act requires no new funding. Funds will come from the $16 billion Federal drug control budget.  This legislation is extremely important to the war on drugs. With the latest news that our efforts are flagging, that children are giving in to the temptation of drugs, we must fight back. The drug dealers are not waiting to approach our children, they never hesitate to make a sale. We cannot delay in fighting for them. We must reinvigorate the effort to protect our children. We must pass the Drug-Free Communities Act.
