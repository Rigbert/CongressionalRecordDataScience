President, I rise today to remember my friend Rev. William Sloane Coffin who passed away in Vermont on April 12, 2006, at his home in Strafford.  Bill Coffin was an extraordinary man who leaves behind a legacy of inspired service for social justice that few Americans have matched. He dedicated his life to speaking out on behalf of those who would otherwise be forgotten, to improving the lives of the underprivileged, and to calling for justice for victims of discrimination in our society.  As chaplain of Yale University, Bill used that pulpit like none before him, to serve not only the Yale community but to inspire the entire Nation. While many Senators may remember him best for his moral leadership and courageous activism during the Vietnam War, Bill also established himself as a dedicated leader for racial and social justice. He was a member of the Freedom Riders who rode interstate buses in the South to challenge segregation laws. He was a visionary and powerful leader in pointing out the hypocrisy of religious and sexual discrimination  Mr. Gary Trudeau, creator of the cartoon ``Doonesbury'' and fellow Yale graduate, may have immortalized Bill Coffin in his Reverend Sloan character. But that was only one chapter of a lifetime of using his ministry to fight injustice. After his long service at Yale, Bill became pastor of Riverside Church in New York City where he continued to advocate for the downtrodden all over the world. Bill continued to be a forceful presence for good long after he left Riverside.  Mr. President, Vermonters were fortunate to have Bill Coffin as a resident of our unique State. Vermonters have a long history of independent thought, of standing up for what is right, and Bill Coffin set a standard for all of us. I was privileged to know him personally and to be able to call him a friend. I know his other friends and neighbors felt the same way. We were all made better, and felt better about ourselves, when we were in the company of Bill Coffin.  I ask unanimous consent that a column by William F. Buckley and an editorial in the Valley News be printed in the Congressional Record so that other Senators may have a further appreciation of this great and good man.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Valley News, April 14, 2006]                           William S. Coffin       The Upper Valley has its share of accomplished and      prominent residents, but we can think of few whose presence      seemed such a gift as did that of The Rev. William Sloane      Coffin, who lived here full time from the late 1980s until      his death Wednesday at his home in Strafford.       The Upper Valley phase of Coffin's life showcased the same      devotion to social justice as his earlier chapters as pastor      of Riverside Church in New York City and chaplain of Yale      University. His focus shifted somewhat--the Vietnam War and      black Americans' civil rights while he worked in New Haven,      Conn., and New York City; nuclear disarmament, gay Americans'      civil rights and the environment while in Vermont--but the      larger theme remained constant. He was committed to speaking      truth to power, and he did that by talking about the issues      of the day with striking clarity and wisdom.       One of the last op-eds he wrote for the Valley News      appeared just a few weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, and      reviewing it now, more than four years later, makes us wish      it had had more of an impact in guiding this nation's leaders      about the topic at hand--how to best respond to terrorism.       ``What Americans do realize now,'' Coffin wrote, ``is that      life can change on a dime. On Sept. 11, we lost, and lost      forever, our sense of invulnerability and invincibility. Hard      as that may be, let us not grieve their passing; they were      illusions.       ``Today it is the Devil's strategy to persuade Americans to      let go of the good to fight evil. I hope we will resist. I      hope that first we will present to the world conclusive      evidence of whom these hijackers were, from whence they came,      and who knowingly harbored them.       ``Then I hope we shall try to build international consensus      for appropriate measures, both to halt the violence and the      circumstances that gave rise to it.''       Here in the Upper Valley, though, we had the opportunity      not only to appreciate the power of Coffin's message but also      to witness the force of his personality. Whether at a dining      room table, behind a church pulpit, at a piano or on a stage      at a political rally, Coffin commanded, enjoyed and rewarded      attention. The message was difficult to separate from the      virtuoso performance of high-spiritedness, humor and insight.      Not even a failing body, including the slurred speech left in      the wake of a stroke, blunted the force of his personality.      Strafford Selectwoman Kay Campbell had it just right when she      noted that Coffin, despite his national stature, had a knack      for ``treating us like we were all special.''       Bill Coffin was an accomplished, amazing and fascinating      man, and many Upper Valley residents feel blessed not just to      have benefited from his wisdom but for the opportunity of      seeing him in action.                                  ____                 [From Yale Daily News, Apr. 14, 2006]                    Coffin's Passion Topped Ideology                      (By William F. Buckley, Jr.)       It was the routine, when Charles Seymour was president of      Yale, that the chairman (as we were then designated) of the      News should visit with President Seymour for a half hour      every week, mutual conduits for information in both      directions. We became friends and he told me at one meeting      with some enthusiasm that the student speaker at the annual      Alumni Day lunch at the Freshman Commons the day before      ``gave the single most eloquent talk I have ever heard from      an undergraduate.'' I thought hard about that comment one      year later when I was selected to give the annual talk to the      alumni, which speech moved nobody at all because the day      before, the text having been examined by public relations      director Richard Lee, I was asked to be so kind as to      withdraw; and I did. (What I did with the speech was stick it      into the appendix of ``God and Man at Yale'').       I didn't meet William Sloane Coffin '49 DIV '56 until some      while later, when of course I congratulated him on electing      the correct political extremity in the controversies of the      day. He was never slow to catch an irony, and his wink      brought on a trans-ideological friendship that induced great      pleasure.       The friendship was publicly confirmed by Coffin with an      extraordinary gesture. Garry Trudeau '70 ART '73 was lining      up speakers for an event celebrating the reunion of his      class. His reunion coincided with a reunion of my own class,      and he came to me and asked if I would consent to debate with      Bill Coffin as I had done for Trudeau's class in freshman      year.       Well, I said, okay, though I knew that Charles Seymour's      estimate of successful speakers would certainly prevail yet      again. But there was a remarkable feature of that afternoon.      I climbed the steps at the Yale Law School Auditorium to      extend a hand to Bill Coffin--who brushed it aside and      embraced me with both arms. This was a dramatic act. It was      testimony not only to Coffin's wide Christian gateway to the      unfaithful, but also to his extraordinary histrionic skills.      I'd have lost the argument anyway. I have defended my      political faith as often as Coffin did his own, but you      cannot, in the end, win an argument against someone who is      offering free health care and an end to nuclear bombs. But      there was never any hope for survival after his public      embrace.       We were always, however lightly, in touch. ``Sweet      William,'' he addressed me in June 2003, enclosing a copy of      a speech he had delivered at Yale the week before. ``The      enclosed speech to the Class of '68, you will be sorry to      hear, was received with tumultuous applause. Don't worry,      however, you, alas, represent the ruling view. I hope you      feel with Saint Paul, `Though our outer nature is wasted away      our inner nature is being renewed each day.' Affectionately      as always, Bill.''       I replied ``Wm, I am not surprised your speech was greeted      by tumultuous applause. That is what demagogy is designed to      do, dear William.'' He replied some months later, enclosing a      copy of a page from the Boston Globe in which both of us were      quoted. ``Dear Wm, Could it be that in this time and our old      age that we might be on the same page? Do let me know,      affectionately, Bill.''       I replied that I had seen his new book Letters to a Young      Doubter. ``... I think of you     often, and did so most directly when I published, a fortnight      ago, the obituary I did on William F. Rickenbacker. He is the      only other fleeted spirit I ever addressed as Dear Wm, which      he always reciprocated with letters address to me as Dear      Wm--both of us signing off as . . . Wm. As I am now, anxious      to get a note off to you, especially since you have taken to      writing books again, instead of reproachful letters to, your      pal--`Wm.' ''       Our disagreements were heated, and it is through the      exercise of much restraint that I forebear doing more than      merely to record that they were heated; on my way, heatedly,      to record that Bill Coffin was a bird of paradise, and to      extend my sympathy to all who, however thoughtlessly, lament      his failure to bring the world around to his views.
