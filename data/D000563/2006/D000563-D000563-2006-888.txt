President, I seek recognition, then, in reference to the bill before the Senate.  In the 200-plus year history of the Senate, there have been few moments when Senators were called to reflect on an issue of this gravity. This issue of immigration goes to the heart and soul of this Nation in which we live. It is an issue which has called forth from each side of the aisle the very best in debate, the very best in consideration, to tackle one of the most complicated issues that has ever faced our Nation.  But it is not a new debate. It is not a new issue. Almost from its outset, America has grappled with this issue of immigration. We are a nation of immigrants. We are a diverse nation. Look around your own neighborhood, at your church, at the gallery, look around at your place of business, and you will see people from all over the world who at one time or another came to this great Nation to call it home. With the exception of those Native Americans who were here when Christopher Columbus arrived, we are all newcomers to America. We are all strangers to this land. God has blessed us with this great opportunity to live in this land of opportunity.  That immigrant spirit has meant so much to what we are today and why we are different in this world, the courage of individual immigrants to leave behind everything--their home, their church, their relatives, their language, their culture, their friends--and to strike out for America, to find that opportunity which meant so much to them.  I am a product of that immigrant spirit. My mother was an immigrant to this country. She came to the United States 95 years ago as a 2-year-old infant, brought by her mother with her brother and sister.
