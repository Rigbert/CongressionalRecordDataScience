 But I think if we are honest--obviously, if people want to bring up 30 amendments, that would kill the Indian health bill, but if that is not the desire, if there are very few amendments and leadership can agree on a time limit on them, we can move forward on some serious amendments, have votes, and pass--at least vote on--the Indian health bill.  Again, I ask my friend from Arizona if that is something he would entertain. It does mean that not everybody can offer every amendment they want. There would have to be a limitation and a time limitation.
