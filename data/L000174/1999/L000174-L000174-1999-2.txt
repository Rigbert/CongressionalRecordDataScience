President, I am pleased that the Senate has approved the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act, which Senator DeWine and I recently introduced in the Senate. Our bipartisan legislation builds on the successful passage into law of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, which Senator DeWine and I sponsored in the last Congress. Our bill also complements S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, which Senator Hatch and I worked together to steer to final passage just last month.  Unfortunately, the number of abused or neglected children in this country nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. Each day there are 9,000 reports of child abuse in America and more than three million cases annually of abused or neglected children. In my home state of Vermont, 2,309 children were reported to child protective services for child abuse or neglect investigations in 1997, the last year data is available. After investigation, 1,041 of these reports found substantiated cases of child maltreatment in Vermont.  Each child behind these statistics is an American tragedy.  But we can help. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act provides these abused or neglected children with the Federal assistance that they deserve. And our legislation can make a real difference in the lives of our nation's children without any additional cost to taxpayers.  Our bipartisan legislation will make a difference by giving State and local officials the flexibility to use existing Department of Justice grant programs to prevent child abuse and neglect, investigate child abuse and neglect crimes and protect children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. The bill does this by making three changes to current law.  First, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to make grant dollars available specifically to enhance the capability of criminal history information to agencies and workers for child welfare, child abuse and adoption purposes. Congress has authorized $250 million annually for grants under the Crime Identification Technology Act.  Second, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Byrne Grant Program to permit funds to be used for enforcing child abuse and neglect laws, including laws protecting against child sexual abuse, and promoting programs designed to prevent child abuse and neglect. Congress has traditionally funded the Byrne Grant Program at about $500 million a year.  Third, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act doubles the available funds, from $10 million to $20 million, for grants to each State for child abuse treatment and prevention from the Crime Victims Fund. This fund is financed through the collection of criminal fines, penalties and other assessments against persons convicted of crimes against the United States. In the 1998 fiscal year, the Crime Victims Fund held $363 million. To ensure that other crime victim programs support by the Fund are not reduced, the expansion of the child abuse treatment and prevention earmark applies only when the Fund exceeds $363 million in a fiscal year. This year, the Crime Victims Fund is expected to collect more than $1 billion due in part to large anti-trust penalties.  Despite the tireless efforts of concerned Vermonters, including the many dedicated workers and volunteers at Prevent Child Abuse in Vermont and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, Vermont is below the national average for its ability to provide services to abused or neglected children. In 1997, 411 children found to be abused or neglected received no services, about 40 percent of investigated cases. Nationally, about 25 percent of all abused or neglected children received no services. Our legislation provides more resources to help Vermonters and other Americans provide services to all abused or neglected children.  I want to thank the many advocates who support our bill and the companion legislation introduced by Representatives Pryce and Tubbs Jones, H.R. 764, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-2 on October 5, 1999. These advocates include the diverse National Child Abuse Coalition: ACTION for Child Protection; Alliance for Children and Families; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Bar Association; American Dental Association; American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children; American Prosecutors Research Institute; American Psychological Association; Association of Junior Leagues International; Boy Scouts of America; Child Welfare League of America; Childhelp USA; Children's Defense Fund; General Federation of Women's Club; National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds; National Association of Child Advocates; National Association of Counsel for Children; National Association of Social Workers; National Children's Alliance; National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse; National Council of Jewish Women; National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association; National Education Association; National Exchange Club Foundation for Prevention of Child Abuse; National Network for Youth; National PTA; Parents Anonymous; and Parents United. In addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Prevent Child Abuse America have endorsed our bill and its House counterpart.  I look forward to the House of Representatives passing the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act for the sake of our nation's children.                          ____________________
