Speaker, at this time last year I estimated, along with the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], with the progress we were making as we were calling forth the incremental reforms--and it was a slow call--that by the year 2010 we would reach our long-held committee funding goals. Well, we did it in 1995. That is 15 years ahead of time. As I have indicated, it is the Chairman Thomas 15-year Great Leap Forward.  The resolution we are considering today has really been created in an open public process. It includes all funding. It takes into account every dollar that will be spent by the committees. It is more fair than any funding resolution ever considered on this floor. It represents a savings of $67 million to the American taxpayer.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to rise in strong support of this resolution. I truly appreciate having had the opportunity to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan resolution. Hey, it is progress. Vote for it. It is time.
