Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to improve the quality of research on pervasive developmental disorders like autism. My legislation--The Autism Statistics, Surveillance, Research, and Epidemiology Act of 1998 (ASSURE)--will provide critical support for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) ongoing efforts to better quantify the incidence and prevalence rates of autism and its related developmental disorders.  This legislation was crafted in close cooperation with the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR), the developmental disabilities experts at CDC, as well as with service providers from my district. It is an important health care and medical research bill which I urge all members to support.  According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ``autism is a serious life-long developmental disability characterized by impaired social interactions, an inability to communicate with others, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors.'' It is estimated that autism affects one out of every 500 children, although precise rates are unknown. There is also a general consensus that autism rates seem to be increasing, although it is not known whether these increases represent a better understanding the developmental disability (i.e., better diagnosis), or an actual increase in developed cases of autism.  The story behind the creation of this legislation is in many ways illustrative of why we need to pass and enact the ASSURE act when Congress reconvenes next year. For it was only after I had a meeting with a pair of courageous parents of autistic children in Brick Township that I realized the pressing need for better autism research. Mr. and Mrs. William and Bobby Gallagher, the parents of two beautiful children with autism, met with me in the summer of last year to share their concerns that Brick Township seemed to have an abnormally high number of children diagnosed with autism. After presenting me with preliminary data suggesting that as many as 27 children may have been diagnosed with autism in Brick over the last decade, I relayed their concerns personally to Len Fishman, Commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Health and Senior Services. I asked him to initiate a preliminary inquiry to determine if an autism ``cluster'' investigation was warranted.  Commissioner Fishman was very receptive to the concerns of the Brick parents, particularly since the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) and the Ocean County Department of Health, in conjunction wit the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and disease Registry (ATSDR), have been conducting a very comprehensive investigation of a cancer cluster in Toms River, New Jersey.  However, after a few weeks of preliminary research by state officials, it became apparent that the current level of scientific knowledge in the United States about autism was inadequate and no one knew for certain what the national rate of autism was. Although there were rough estimates of autism rates from studies in foreign countries, CDC and the NJDHSS did not have enough information that an epidemiologist could use to determine if the alleged autism ``cluster'' in Brick was a real public health problem or an illusion of chance.  As a result, an intensive effort by CDC and ATSDR is underway to try to derive national autism rates and try to determine if an autism ``cluster'' exists in Brick. The study is one of the first of its kind ever undertaken in the United States, and the results of the investigation will prove invaluable for other communities that may be affected by similarly high numbers of autism cases.  That is where the ASSURE act comes in. Under my ASSURE legislation, CDC will uncover and monitor the prevalence of autism as a national level by establishing between three and five ``Centers for Research in Autism Epidemiology'' across the country. These Centers would conduct population-based surveillance and epidemiologic studies of autism. Periodic screenings of the population (5 to 7-year old children) would be undertaken to examine prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors that contribute to autism development.  These Centers would combine data from multiple sites to gain a better understanding of how autism differs from other, related, developmental disabilities and disorder. Because autism is suspected to be caused by a combination of both genetic and environmental factors, the ASSURE legislation would help CDC track the trends of autism and determine which factors are responsible for the apparent rise in autism cases nationwide.  More importantly, the collaborative efforts by CDC and State health departments will help public health officials to possibly prevent autism once scientists better understand which environmental exposures are most likely to cause children to develop autism in the womb. The idea is that each Center established under this legislation would develop a certain niche of autism expertise. Such areas could include: specific genetic markers, early prenatal maternal drug and other exposures; and investigating other autism spectrum disorders.  Mr. Speaker, CDC has already established a pilot program--an autism epidemiology center--near Atlanta, Georgia. The limited but promising results from this initiative points to the fact that current understanding of autism is woefully inadequate and that better surveillance and monitoring of developmental disabilities like autism are critical to providing answers and hope to the parents of nearly 500,000 autistic persons in America.                          ____________________
