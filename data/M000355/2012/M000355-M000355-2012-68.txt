 Since the founding of the Republic, only 2,000 men and women have served in the Senate. Only 23 have cast more votes than Chuck Grassley. No other current Senator has gone as long as he has without missing a single vote. He has not missed a vote in 19 years.  This year, Senator Grassley marks 54 years of public service to the people of the Hawkeye State. While some Members of Congress have a tendency to lose touch with their constituents, Chuck Grassley has always worked hard to make sure he never did that. He has made it his business to stay connected to the folks back home by holding at least one townhall meeting a year in all of Iowa's 99 counties, and by responding to every letter, postcard, e-mail, or phone call. Of course, we are all familiar with his tweets. Much like the Senator himself, they are truly one of a kind.  Senator Grassley also stays close to the land by working his family farm. He does that even while keeping up his duties here in Washington. He may be a U.S. Senator, but he has always preferred to be known as ``a farmer from Butler County.'' Visitors to the Grassley farm say it is not uncommon to see Senator Grassley pulling a cell phone out from under his baseball cap while riding on his tractor.  Over the years, Chuck Grassley has distinguished himself by his tenacity and his commitment to the public interest. His first major legislative achievement was the passage of the Federal False Claims Act, which over the years has saved taxpayers more than $17 billion. As chairman of the Finance Committee, he led bipartisan bills through Congress that cut taxes by $2 trillion, leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans.  Senator Grassley has a lot to be proud of in his career. He and Barbara are also rightly proud of their 58 years of marriage.
