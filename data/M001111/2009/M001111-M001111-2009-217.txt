 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize a very special member of my staff who has recently been confirmed by the Senate to take on a critical role in the Obama administration.  Peter Rogoff has served on the Appropriations Committee staff for the last 22 years and he has been the committee's senior transportation adviser for the majority of those years. For the past 9 years, as I have served as either chairman or ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Peter.  Peter has been a trusted adviser to me and a dedicated public servant to the constituents of both my home State of Washington and the constituents of every member of the subcommittee. I know that Peter's drive, knowledge, and experience will be an outstanding asset to President Obama and Transportation Secretary LaHood's team.  Peter and I have worked together through many challenges over the years, none greater than the events of September 11 and the transportation security issues that we were confronted with after. Peter's efforts weren't just limited to aviation security but also included initiatives to strengthen security in passenger rail, transit systems, our ports and all the systems that connect them. During those difficult times, Peter's understanding of our transportation safety systems was fully evident.  It is a knowledge that comes with experience. And not just the kind of experience you gain from studying policy at your desk, although I can attest that Peter has done a lot of that. It is the kind of experience you get from traveling out to accident sites, talking with inspectors, meeting with families, and working hands-on to ensure that we are taking steps to ensure that accidents are not repeated.  In the time that I have worked with Peter, he has regularly traveled across the country to participate in aviation, rail and ship inspections, and he has voluntarily gone to many accident sites. The expertise gained from these experiences has served this Congress and our country well in some very critical situations.  In fact, I still remember clearly the evening 2 years ago when we all watched in horror as the 1-35 bridge collapsed in Minneapolis. Immediately after that tragedy, I dispatched Peter to accompany Senator Klobuchar to the scene, because I knew that he could help her identify the core issues and how the Federal Government could help.  Now I know that as FTA Administrator, Peter will face a set of wide-ranging challenges. But I also know that he has the transit know-how to hit the ground running. Peter will bring over two decades of working knowledge on financing, building, and safeguarding our country's transit systems.  I thank Peter for the guidance, enthusiasm, and expertise he has shown in the years he has led my efforts on addressing our country's transportation, housing and urban development needs. I also wish him luck as he takes on this tremendous responsibility and opportunity.  While his departure represents a big loss for our Appropriations Committee and my appropriations subcommittee, I respect and commend President Obama's decision to put Peter's expertise to work on addressing our country's transit future.                          ____________________
