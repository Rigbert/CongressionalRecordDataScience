President, I wish to acknowledge the important work of my Oregon colleagues--Representatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer, and Wu--who are coming through today for an Oregon icon, our special Mount Hood. Last year, Senator Smith and I introduced the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act to create an additional 128,000 acres of wilderness around the mountain. Our Mount Hood legislation has passed committee, and I am confident that now, with the House of Representatives, the other body, going forward with a companion measure, it is going to be possible to get this measure enacted and move on to a host of additional important land issues for my home State.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
