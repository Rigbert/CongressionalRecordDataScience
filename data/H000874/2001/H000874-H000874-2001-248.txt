Speaker, on an additional subject, today together with the gentleman from California (Mr. Horn) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), my colleagues, and 60 additional cosponsors, I am introducing the Voting Improvement Act. This bill provides a short-term anda long-term solution to a crisis we face in the wake of the 2000 elections.  Mr. Speaker, today together with my colleagues Mr. Horn and Mr. Price,  and with 60 additional cosponsors, I am introducing the Voting Improvement Act. This bill provides a short term and a long term solution to crisis we face in the wake of the 2000 election.  One of the reactions that I have heard repeatedly from my constituents in the months since the election, was shock at the sheer number of votes that were cast but were not counted--19,000 discarded ballots in Palm Beach County alone. Those numbers are shocking--and they have the potential to drive voters away from the polls permanently unless we can act quickly to repair our voting system and repair the voters' confidence in that system.  In 615 days we will be having a federal election. That election will be subjected to the greatest amount of media scrutiny that has ever befallen an election in this country. And that is why I believe that it is imperative that we devise a way to bring about the most dramatic reduction possible in the number of votes that are cast but not counted.  The quickest way to get more votes counted is to target the system with the highest rate of error and the lowest rate of public confidence. That system is, without a doubt, the punch card. A joint MIT Caltech analysis recently estimated that the nationwide error rate for punch cards is 2.5 percent. This translates to as many as 986,000 votes cast but not counted on punch card systems alone. Almost a third of voters used punch card systems in 2000, making it the most commonly used voting method.  Yet, in some jurisdictions punch cards have had error rates as high as 6.25 percent or one in every 16 ballots. These disturbingly high rates of spoiled ballots also have a troubling tendency of occurring in jurisdictions with high populations of minority voters. For example, in Chicago rates of uncounted ballots increased from 1 in 20 in precincts that were less than 30 percent African American, to 1 in 12 ballots in precincts more heavily populated with minorities. Fifty one precincts in Chicago had ballots that were ruined at a rate of 1 in 6 ballots. These 51 precincts were 90 percent African American and Hispanic.  Punch card technology has not changed significantly since its introduction in 1964. This is true even though there is virtually no other technology that has not undergone revolutionary improvements since 1964. We no longer use rotary dial 1964 telephones, or portable 78 rpm record players. Desktop computers have completely displaced typewriters, and even the venerable rolodex is being quickly replaced by the Palm Pilot. Yet the punch card counter remains virtually unchanged. In fact, punch cards themselves, a standard IBM product used in any number of computer systems in 1964--today are produced only for the purpose of voting! There is no excuse for keeping a punch card voting system in place. Particularly as this bill will provide $6,000 a precinct to any jurisdiction that replaces punch cards by Election Day 2002.  While punch card voting systems are the number one offender, they are not the only problem. One estimate from a Bryn Mawr computer scientist is that nationwide, and across voting equipment, about two percent of the votes cast nationwide in 2000 were not counted. That means that over 2 million voters were unintentionally disenfranchised. Spoiled ballots occurred on lever machines, on punch cards, on optical scanners and on modern electronic touch screens. The number of ballots not counted far exceeds any measure of the margin of victory in the Presidential election.  We have neglected our election system as a whole--trusting in outmoded equipment because it is familiar--and trusting in wide margins of victory because they often occur. I believe that with focus and funding we can develop voting technology that is cost effective, that is accurate, and that is accessible to all voters including the blind and the disabled. While it is not possible to eliminate spoiled ballots, there is no reason that we should not be able to reduce the nationwide error rate to .5 percent.  I know that it is possible as a nation to drastically reduce the numbers of uncounted votes and do it quickly. It is possible because my own state of Maryland did it. They went from a statewide error rate of 1.5 percent in 1988 to a statewide error rate of less than .5 percent in 2000. They accomplished this remarkable achievement in part by getting rid of punch cards. Maryland stands as an example and a challenge to the rest of the states. If we can reduce the number of uncounted ballots to .5 percent nationwide, one and a half million more voters would have their votes counted.  Whatever the means by which we seek to reduce the number of uncounted votes--through this bill--through some other Congressional proposal--or by State action--we must work hard to get these votes counted. I also want to say to the States and to the counties--this is an urgent problem. Do not wait. Do not trust that federal resources are coming. Act now to make improvements including buying new equipment for 2002. I fear that one of the unintentional effects of the discussion about this issue on Capitol Hill, is that we are unintentionally producing a disincentive for states and counties. The Voting Improvement Act would provide reimbursements to any punch card jurisdiction that acts now and gets new equipment in place for Election Day 2002. I challenge those state and counties to do so.  Nonetheless, money and equipment alone cannot solve the problems with our voting system. New technology must be accompanied by voter education, and by polling place resources including helpful and well trained workers and officials. That is why the punch card buyout is simply step one of the Voting Improvement Act.  The Voting Improvement Act would also create a new four member bipartisan Election Administration Commission. The primary function of the new agency would be to administer an annual grant program to aid states in the administration of elections. In 2003, the punch card buyout would be replaced by a grant program to provide $140 million annually to states and to counties.  Unlike the buyout which requires no commitments from the States, the grant program would require States or local jurisdictions to provide 25 percent in matching funds. States will also be required to install equipment that can be used by blind and disabled voters to vote privately, and States must also provide assurances that they are in full compliance with existing laws.  Ten million dollars of the grant money would also be reserved for research and development by manufacturers. one of the problems that election officials have faced in buying new equipment is that the available technology is simply not as good as it could be. In part, that is because the market for voting equipment is not that large. Thus, the grant money would help to stimulate the production of equipment that better accommodates all types of disabilities, is more cost effective, and is more accurate and easy to use.  A minimum of 20 percent of grant funds for States and local jurisdictions would be required to be used for voter education and for training. Voter education plays a critical role in getting more votes counted. The implementation of new voting systems cannot be successful unless the voters are amply educated in how to properly use it. Polls must also be staffed with people trained to aid voters in getting their votes cast and counted, not at discouraging them from voting at all. To that end, the bill would provide leave to any federal employee who worked in a polling place on a federal election day. Making federal worker resources available is an attempt to aid election officials in the tremendous task of recruiting and training the huge work force that play a key role in making federal elections work.  The new Commission would also be responsible for creation of a Model Election Code. Like the Uniform Commercial Code or other Model Codes, it would serve as a resource to States that are seeking to protect themselves from legal challenges. The Model Code would cover statutory provisions including what constitutes a vote, when and how a recount should be held, and how an election contest should be handled. I hope that an organization with experience in producing model laws, such as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, will agree to draft the Model Code, as I believe that a product will that imprimatur of expertise and credibility could prove a valuable resource in improving election statutes nationwide.  Finally, the new Commission would serve as a national clearinghouse for information and study on what elections practices work best. It would develop voluntary ``best practice standards'' to study issues including how a ballot should best be designed, how voter registration list should best be maintained, and how many votes continue to go uncounted across the country.  This bipartisan legislation is supported by a broad and diverse group of Members. I am very hopeful that we will continue to add more co-sponsors and move this legislation forward.  A few weeks ago, President Bush met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and remarked: ``This is America. Everyone deserves the right to vote.'' However, as we all know now, the right to vote is not enough. Every vote also must be counted. The Voting Improvement Act will help us do just that, and will go a long way in restoring public confidence in our election system and our democracy itself.*****-*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: -Date: -Subformat:                          ____________________
