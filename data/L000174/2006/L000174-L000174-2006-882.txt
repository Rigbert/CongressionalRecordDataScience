President, I began the hearing on this nomination by putting forward what for me was the ultimate question during the consideration of a successor to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Would Judge Alito, if confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court, protect the rights and liberties of all Americans and serve as an effective check on government overreaching?  Since this debate began last Wednesday, I have posed the fundamental question that this nomination raises for this body: whether the Senate will serve its constitutional role as a check on Executive power by preserving the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion of Presidential power.  This is a nomination that I fear threatens the fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans now and for generations to come. As astonishing as the facts may seem, it does not overstate them to point out that the President is in the midst of a radical realignment of the powers of the government and of its intrusiveness into the private lives of Americans. This nomination is part and parcel of that plan. I am concerned that if confirmed, this nominee will further erode the checks and balances that have protected our constitutional rights for more than 200 years. This is a critical nomination, one that can tip the balance on the Supreme Court radically away from constitutional checks and balances and the protection of Americans' fundamental rights.  The procedural vote just taken was in large measure symbolic. Its result was foreseen by Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the question. The next vote the Senate takes on this critical nomination is not symbolic. It has real consequences in the lives of the 295 million Americans alive today, and it will influence the lives of generations of Americans to come. It will affect not only our rights but the fundamental rights and liberties of our children and our children's children. In short, it matters, and it matters greatly. The vote the Senate will take tomorrow will determine whether Samuel A. Alito, Jr., replaces Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court of the United States.  I appreciate why Senators who voted against cloture believe this matter deserves more searching attention by Senators and the American people. Among Democratic Senators, each is voting his or her conscience and best judgment. There will be many Democratic Senators who, like the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee who have closely studied the record of this nominee, will be voting against the nomination. There will be some Democratic Senators who will vote to confirm the nominee. Among those voting against, there are some who believe that it is not appropriate to withhold the Senate's consent by extending debate. The Senate debated Chief Justice Roberts' nomination during 8 days and over a 10-day calendar period. Although much more divisive and controversial, the Alito nomination will be debated for just 5 days over a 7-day calendar period by the time the vote is called tomorrow.  It is true that Democratic Senators do not all vote in lockstep. Each Democratic Senator individually gives these questions serious consideration. They honor their constitutional duty. I amproud of the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for the statements they made last week when the committee considered this nomination and during the course of the last few days. Their hard work in preparing for three Supreme Court nominations over the last few months is to be commended. I thank and commend the many Democratic Senators who came to the floor, who spoke, who set forth their concerns and their views. That includes Democratic Senators opposing the nomination and those in favor. It is quite a roster: Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Mikulski, Clinton, Kerry, Nelson of Florida, Reed, Murray, Feinstein, Inouye, Harkin, Bingaman, Lincoln, Lieberman, Salazar, Carper, Levin, Obama, Dayton, Feingold, Johnson, Sarbanes, Stabenow, Lautenberg, Menendez, and, in addition, Senator Jeffords. These Senators approached the matter seriously, in contrast to those partisan cheerleaders who rallied behind this White House's pick long before the first day of hearings.  I respect those Senators who are giving this critical nomination serious consideration but come to a different conclusion than I, just as I continue to respect the 22 Senators who voted against the Roberts nomination. I have candidly acknowledged that over the course of history, their judgment and vote may prove right. I took Judge Roberts at his word in the belief that his words and the impressions he understood them to be creating had meaning. I continue to hope that as Chief Justice he will fulfill his promise and steer the Court to serve as an appropriate check on abuses of Presidential power and protect the fundamental liberties and rights of all Americans.  Filibusters of judicial nominees--and, in particular, of Supreme Court nominees--are hardly something new. When Justice Fortas was nominated by President Johnson to be the Chief Justice, a filibuster led by Strom Thurmond and the Republican leader resulted in an unsuccessful cloture vote and in that nomination being withdrawn. That was the most recent successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. But that was not the first or last Supreme Court nomination to be defeated. President George Washington, the Nation's first and most popular President, saw the Senate reject his nomination of John Rutledge to the Supreme Court at the outset of our history. Over time approximately one-fifth of Presidents' Supreme Court nominees have not been confirmed.  The last time the country was faced with the retirement of the pivotal vote on the Supreme Court was when Justice Lewis Powell resigned in 1987. A Republican President sought to use that opportunity to reshape the U.S. Supreme Court with his nomination of Judge Robert Bork. Judge Bork had been a law professor, a partner in one of the Nation's leading law firms, a judge on the DC Circuit for 5 years, and he had served as Solicitor General of the United States and even as the Acting Attorney General at a critical juncture of our history.  Many myths have arisen about why the Senate rejected that nomination. I was here and, along with the other Senators, both Republican and Democratic, who voted to defeat that nomination, I know that the nominee's views were the decisive factor in his failure. His rejection of the constitutional right to privacy was a large part of his own undoing. Soon thereafter, President Reagan announced and withdrew the nomination of Judge Ginsburg and then turned to a conservative Federal appellate court judge from California named Anthony Kennedy. Justice Kennedy, though conservative, was confirmed overwhelmingly and in bipartisan fashion. He continues to serve as a respected Justice who has authored key decisions protecting Americans from unfair discrimination because of their sexual orientation.  When the Senate was considering a successor to Justice Powell almost 20 years ago, I said that I believed a Supreme Court nominee's judicial philosophy should play a central role in our consideration. I noted:       There is no question that the nominee who is confirmed to      succeed Justice Lewis Powell will be uniquely influential in      determining the direction of the Supreme Court's      interpretation of the Constitution for years to come. There      can hardly be an issue closer to the heart of the Senate's      role than a full and public exposition of the nominee's      approach to the Constitution and to the rule of the courts in      discerning and enforcing its commands. That is what I mean by      judicial philosophy.  The same remains true today as we consider a successor to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. I strongly believe that Judge Alito's judicial philosophy is too deferential to the government and too unprotective of the fundamental liberties and rights of ordinary Americans for his nomination by President Bush to be confirmed by the Senate as the replacement for Justice O'Connor.  Judicial philosophy comes into play time and again as Supreme Court justices wrestle with serious questions about which they do not all agree. These include fundamental questions about how far the government may intrude into our personal lives. Senators need to assess whether a nominee will protect fundamental rights if confirmed to be on the Supreme Court.  Several Republican Senators said that judicial philosophy and personal views do not matter because judges should just apply the rule of law as if it were some mechanical calculation. Senator Feinstein made this point exceptionally well during the debate. Personal views and judicial philosophy often come into play on close and controversial cases. We all know this to be true. Why else did Republican supporters force President Bush to withdraw his previous nominee for this vacancy, Harriet Miers, before she even had a hearing? She failed their judicial philosophy litmus test.  Indeed, Harriet Miers is the most recent Supreme Court nominee not to have been confirmed. It was last October that President Bush nominated his White House Counsel Harriet Miers to succeed Justice O'Connor. He did so after the death of the Chief Justice and withdrawing his earlier nomination of Judge Roberts to succeed Justice O'Connor. The democratic leader of the Senate quickly endorsed the selection of Ms. Miers as the kind of person, with the kind of background, he found appealing. Democratic Senators went about the serious business of preparing for hearings on the Miers nomination. But there were those from among the President's supporters who castigated Ms. Miers and the President for the nomination. The President succumbed to the partisan pressure from the extreme rightwing of his own party by withdrawing his nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court after repeatedly saying that he would never do so. In essence, he allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his party, before hearings or a vote. As Chairman Specter has often said, they ran her out of town on a rail. In fact, of course, she has remained in town as the President's counsel, but his point is correct. Like the more than 60 moderate and qualified judicial nominees of President Clinton on whom Republicans would neither hold hearings or votes, the Miers nomination was killed by Republicans without a vote--by what was in essence a pocket filibuster. That eye-opening experience for the country demonstrated what a vocal faction of the Republican Party really wants. Their rightwing litmus test demands justice and judges who will guarantee the results that they want. They do not want an independent federal judiciary. They want certain results.  Instead of uniting the country through his third choice to succeed Justice O'Connor, the President has chosen to reward one faction of his party, at the risk of dividing the country. Those so critical of his choice of Harriet Miers as a nominee were the very people who rushed to endorse the nomination of Judge Alito. Instead of rewarding his most virulent supporters, the President should have rewarded the American people with a unifying choice that would have broad support. America could have done better through consultation to select one of the many consensus conservative Republican candidates who could have been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate. Instead, without consultation, the President withdrew the Miers nomination and the next day announced that his third choice to succeed Justice O'Connor was Judge Alito.  At his hearing, Judge Alito began by asking how he got this critical nomination. Over the course of the hearings, I think we began to understand the real answer to that question. It has little to do with Judge Alito's family story and a great deal to do with the pressuresthat forced the President to withdraw the nomination of Harriet Miers and this President's efforts to avoid any check on his expansive claims to power.  This is a President who has been conducting secret and warrantless eavesdropping on Americans for more than 4 years. This President has made the most expansive claims of power since American patriots fought the war of independence to rid themselves of the overbearing power of King George III. He has done so to justify illegal spying on Americans, to justify actions that violate our values and laws against torture and protecting human rights, and in order to detain U.S. citizens and others on his say so without judicial review or due process. This is a time in our history when the protections of Americans' liberties are at risk as are the checks and balances that have served to constrain abuses of power for more than 200 years.  Judge Alito's opening statement skipped over the reasons he was chosen. He ignored his seeking political appointment within the Meese Justice Department by proclaiming his commitment to an extreme and activist rightwing legal philosophy. His testimony sought to minimize the Federalist Society and his seeking to use membership in Concerned Alumni of Princeton for advancement. He attempted to revise and redefine the theory of the ``unitary executive.'' That is a legal underpinning being used by this President and his supporters to attempt to justify his assertions of virtually unlimited power. The President wanted a reliable Justice who would uphold his assertions of power, his most extreme supporters want someone who will revisit the constitutional protection of privacy rights, and the business supporters wanted someone favorable to powerful special interests.  Supreme Court nominations should not be conducted through a series of winks and nods designed to reassure the most extreme Republican factions while leaving the American people in the dark. No President should be allowed to pack the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, with nominees selected to enshrine Presidential claims of government power. The checks and balances that should be provided by the courts, Congress, and the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow, partisan agenda. The Senate stood up to President Roosevelt when he proposed a court-packing scheme and should not be a rubberstamp to this President's effort to move the law dramatically to the right. I do not intend to lend my support to an effort by this President to undermine checks and balances or to move the Supreme Court and the law radically to the right.  So what do we know about the Samuel Alito who graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School and obtained a plum job in the office of the Solicitor General of the United States? We know that he wanted political advancement and was committed to the radical legal theories of the Meese Justice Department. The job application that was the subject of some question at the hearing is most revealing. I will ask that a copy of that job application be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement so that the American people can see it.  This confirmation process is the opportunity for the American people to learn what Samuel Alito thinks about their fundamental constitutional rights and whether he will serve to protect their liberty, their privacy and their autonomy from Government intrusion. The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just the person occupying the White House, and not just to a narrow faction of a political party.  We have heard from Judge Alito's supporters that those opposing this nomination were ``smearing'' him by asking substantive and probing questions at the hearing and by addressing concerns about his record during this debate. The Republican leader opened the debate with that attack. He said this before a single minute of debate or opening statement by any Democratic Senator. These Republican talking points ring hollow and are particularly inappropriate after President Bush was forced by an extreme faction in his own party to withdraw his nomination of Harriet Miers.  Democratic Senators should not be criticized for taking seriously their constitutional role in trying to assess whether Judge Alito is suitable for a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Democrats also asked tough questions of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer during their confirmation hearings, which is in stark contrast to the free pass given to Judge Alito by Republican Senators during his hearing.  Those critical of the Democrats have a short and selective historical memory. Republican Senators engaged in a party-line vote in committee against the nomination of Louis Brandeis to the Supreme Court. Republican Senators, in an unprecedented party-line vote, blocked the nomination in 1999 of Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White, an extremely qualified nominee for a Federal district court judgeship. In fact, Republicans pocket-filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees by holding them up in the Judiciary Committee.  This President continues to choose confrontation over consensus and to be a divider rather than being the uniter that he promised to be. This is in stark contrast to President Clinton's selection of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer after real consultation. In his book, ``Square Peg,'' Senator Hatch described how in 1993, as the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he advised President Clinton about possible Supreme Court nominees. Senator Hatch recounted that he warned President Clinton away from a nominee whose confirmation he believed ``would not be easy.'' He wrote that he then suggested the names of Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were eventually nominated and confirmed ``with relative ease.'' President Bush, who had promised to be a uniter, not a divider, failed to live up to his promise or to the example of his predecessor, as described by Senator Hatch. The result is that, rather than sending us a nominee for all Americans, the President chose a divisive nominee who raises grave concerns about whether he will be a check on Presidential power and whether he understands the role of the courts in protecting fundamental rights.  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check and balance in our system. Independence of the courts and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of life. The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubberstamp, and neither should the Supreme Court.  This is a nomination to a lifetime seat on the Nation's highest Court that has often represented the decisive vote on constitutional issues. The Senate needs to make an informed decision about this nomination. This process is the only opportunity that the American people and their representatives have to consider the suitability of the nominee to serve as a final arbiter of the meaning of Constitution and the law. Has he demonstrated a commitment to the fundamental rights of all Americans? Will he allow the government to intrude on Americans' personal privacy and freedoms?  In a time when this administration seems intent on accumulating unchecked power, Judge Alito's views on government power are especially important. It is important to know whether he would serve with judicial independence or as a surrogate for the President who nominated him. Based on a thorough review of his record and that from his hearing, I have no confidence that he will act as an effective check on government overreaching and abuses of power.  As we began the hearings, I recalled the photograph that hangs in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, PA. It shows the first woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States taking the oath of office in 1981. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor served as a model Supreme Court Justice.  She is widely recognized as a jurist with practical values and a sense of the consequences of the legal decisions being made by the Supreme Court. I regret that some on the extreme right have been so critical of Justice O'Connor and have adamantly opposed the naming of a successor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities. Their criticism reflects poorly upon them. It does nothing to tarnish the record of the first woman to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She is a Justice whose graciousness and sense of dutyfuels her continued service nearly 7 months after she announced her intention to retire.  As the Senate prepares to vote on President Bush's current nomination--his third--for a successor to Justice O'Connor, we should be mindful of her critical role on the Supreme Court. Her legacy is one of fairness that I want to see preserved. Justice O'Connor has been a guardian of the protections the Constitution provides the American people.  Of fundamental importance, she has come to provide balance and a check on government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms. In the Hamdi decision, she rejected the Bush administration's claim that it could indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen. She upheld the fundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise of government power and wrote that even war ``is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' She held that even this President is not above the law.  Her judgment has also been crucial in protecting our environmental rights. She joined in 5-to-4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom, religious freedom, and the Voting Rights Act. Each of these cases makes clear how important a single Supreme Court Justice is.  It is as the elected representatives of the American people--all of the people--that we in the Senate are charged with the responsibility to examine whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to this nominee. The Constitution is their document. It guarantees their rights from the heavy hand of government intrusion and their individual liberties to freedom of speech and religion, to equal treatment, to due process and to privacy.  The Federal judiciary is unlike the other branches of Government. Once confirmed, Federal judges serve for life. There is no court above the Supreme Court of the United States. The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who inspires confidence that he, or she, will not be beholden to the President but will be immune to pressures from the government or from partisan interests.  The stakes for the American people could not be higher. At this critical moment, Democratic Senators are performing our constitutional advice and consent responsibility with heightened vigilance. I urge all Senators--Republicans, Democrats and Independents--to join with us. The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the liberties of all Americans. The appointment of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the people's interest and in the Nation's interest, not to serve the special interests of a partisan faction.  I have voted for the vast majority of President Reagan's, President Bush's, and President Bush's judicial nominees. I recommended a Republican to President Clinton to fill Vermont's seat on the Second Circuit, Judge Fred Parker, and recommended another Republican to President Bush to fill that seat after Judger Parker's death, Judge Peter Hall. I voted for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy, for President Bush's nomination of Justice Souter, and for this President's recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts. In fact, I have voted for eight of the nine current Justices of the Supreme Court.  I want all Americans to know that the Supreme Court will protect their rights and will respect the authority of Congress to act in their interest. I want a Supreme Court that acts in its finest tradition as a source of justice. The Supreme Court must be an institution where the Bill or Rights and human dignity are honored. In good conscience, based on the record, I cannot vote for this nomination. I urge all Senators to use this last night of debate to consult their consciences and their best judgment before casting their votes tomorrow. That vote will matter.  In my 30 years in the Senate, I have cast almost 12,000 votes here in the Senate. Few will be as important as the vote we cast tomorrow.  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the application to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    PPO Non-Career Appointment Form       From: Mark R. Levin.       To: Mark Sullivan.

Please provide any information that you regard as pertinent      to your philosophical commitment to the policies of this      administration, or would show that you are qualified to      effectively fill a position involved in the development,      advocacy and vigorous implementation of those policies.       Have you ever served on a political committee or been      identified in a public way with a particular political      organization, candidate or issue?       (Please be specific and include contacts with telephone      numbers.)       I am and always have been a conservative and an adherent to      the same philosophical views that I believe are central to      this Administration. It is obviously very difficult to      summarize a set of political views in a sentence but, in      capsule form, I believe very strongly in limited government,      federalism, free enterprise, the supremacy of the elected      branches of government, the need for a strong defense and      effective law enforcement, and the legitimacy of a government      role in protecting traditional values. In the field of law, I      disagree strenuously with the usurpation by the judiciary      decisionmaking authority that should be exercised by the      branches of government responsible to the electorate. The      Administration has already made major strides toward      reversing this trend through its judicial appointments,      litigation, and public debate, and it is my hope that even      greater advances can be achieved during the second term,      especially with Attorney Meese's leadership at the Department      of Justice.       When I first became interested in government and politics      during the 1960s, the greatest influences on my views were      the writings of William F. Buckley, Jr., the National Review,      and Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign. In college, I developed      a deep interest in constitutional law, motivated in large      part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions particularly      in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause,      and reapportionment. I discovered the writings of Alexander      Bickel advocating judicial restraint, and it was largely for      this reason that I decided to go to Yale Law School.       After graduation from law school, completion of my ROTC      military commitment, and a judicial clerkship, I joined the      U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey, principally because of      my strong views regarding law enforcement.       Most recently, it has been an honor and source of personal      satisfaction for me to serve in the office of the Solicitor      General during President Reagan's administration and to help      to advance legal positions in which I personally believe very      strongly. I am particularly proud of my contributions in      recent cases in which the government has argued in the      Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be      allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to      an abortion.       As a federal employee subject to the Hatch Act for nearly a      decade, I have been unable to take a role in partisan      politics. However, I am a life-long registered Republican and      have made the sort of modest political contributions that a      federal employee can afford to Republican candidates and      conservative causes, including the National Republican      Congressional Committee, the National Conservative Political      Action Committee, Rep. Christopher Smith (4th Dist. N.J.),      Rep. James Courter (12th Dist. N.J.), Governor Thomas Kean of      N.J., and Jeff Bell's 1982 Senate primary campaign in N.J. I      am a member of the Federalist Society for Law and Public      Policy and a regular participant at its luncheon meetings and      a member of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, a      conservative alumni group. During the past year, I have      submitted articles for publication in the National Review and      the American Spectator.       Applicant Signature: Samuel A. Alito, Jr.       Date: Nov. 15, 1985       Associate Director Recommendation: Approved, Mark Sullivan.
