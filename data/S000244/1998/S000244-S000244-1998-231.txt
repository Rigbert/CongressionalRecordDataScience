Speaker, I rise today in support of an important provision in H.R. 2691, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Reauthorization Act, which prohibits NHTSA from lobbying at the state or local level. The provision is consistent with current federal law which prohibits federal agencies from lobbying Congress. In legislation considered by the House Committee on Science last year, I included similar anti-lobbying language to prohibit the Department of Transportation from lobbying state and local elected officials. I am pleased H.R. 2691 includes the anti-lobbying provision.  In 1996, Congress voted to repeal a provision of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) that penalized states without mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. By repealing the helmet penalty provisions of ISTEA, Congress determined that the issue of motorcycle safety was best determined by each individual state without a one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government. Since that time, however, the U.S. General Accounting Office has determined that NHTSA has engaged in an active lobbying campaign to persuade states to enact laws mandating that motorcycle riders wear helmets. I strongly supported repealing the coercive and unfair helmet law penalties on states in 1996 and I further support the provisions of H.R. 2691 prohibiting the use of federal funds to lobby at the state and local level. I do not believe lobbying by any federal agency at the federal, state or local level is an appropriate use of tax-payer dollars.                          ____________________
