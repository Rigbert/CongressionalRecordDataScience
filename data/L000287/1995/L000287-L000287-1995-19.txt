Mr. Speaker, the cat is out of the bag. According to articles in papers across the country, Speaker Gingrich's personal political slush fund--GOPAC--was illegally providing funds and resources to Federal candidates in 1990. And lo and behold, who appears to have been the primary recipient of such funds, Speaker Gingrich himself.  All of this has come to light in a lawsuit brought against GOPAC by the Federal Election Commission. Among the documents filed yesterday were internal memos and minutes from GOPAC planning meetings. According to one, an unidentified GOPAC source said ``we're supplying, my guess would be a quarter of a million dollars in Newt support per year.'' A quarter of a million dollars in an election he won by just 974 votes.  Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee has now been stonewalling the appointment of an independent counsel for more than 14 months. The committee must act, they must act. We need an outside counsel to investigate Newt Gingrich. Stop the stonewalling.                          ____________________
