 President, I rise today to offer legislation that provides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio, 17 years old; Fauricio 15 years old; and Ana Lozano, 14 years old; who were granted immigrant visas to come to the United States with their mother earlier this year. Now they have lost their motherand could be deported because they were recently orphaned.  The children have lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until her death in February of this year due to complications from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the children have been living with their closest relative, their U.S.-citizen grandmother who lives in Los Angeles.  Without their mother, the children do not have the legal right to remain in the United States. The Lozano children can be deported because the immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children without their parents.  Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS despite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them in El Salvador except their estranged father who, INS reports show, was abusive to the mother and the children.  Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an orphanage in El Salvador. Here in the United States, the childern have their U.S.-citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving home.  I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano children by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they can do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way to protect the children from deportation.  I hope you will support this bill so that we can help the Lozano children begin to rebuild their lives in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news article and the bill be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1202       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Sergio Lozano, Fauricio Lozano and Ana Lozano, shall be held      and considered to have been lawfully admitted to the United      States for permanent residence as of the date of the      enactment of this Act upon payment of the required visa fees.                                  ____               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 29, 1997]              Youth's Visas in Doubt After Mother's Death                       (By Patrick J. McDonnell)       Three El Salvadoran teenagers who were granted U.S.      government permission to move to Los Angeles with their      mother earlier this year now face deportation because their      mother's death has left them without a legal right to be in      the United States.       Ana Ruth Lozano a single mother who worked in a garment      factory in El Salvador, had long dreamed that she and her      children would be able to join relatives in Los Angeles, a      glittering place with promise beyond the postwar tumult of      Central America.       She died in El Salvador in February at the age of 33,      apparently of complications from typhoid fever, three weeks      after her family received visas to emigrate to the United      States following an eight-year wait.       Ironically, relatives say; Lozano took ill on the day she      was informed by officials in the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador      that authorities were approving the family's long-delayed      application.       ``My mother always said we'd go to the United States and      have a real chance to succeed,'' said Sergio Lozano, 17, who      finally arrived here last month with his siblings, Fauricio,      15, and Ana, 14.       With the shock of her unexpected death still raw, the      family is facing another blow: The Immigration and      Naturalization Service says that Lozano's death means that      her children must go back to El Salvador. Because she was the      primary visa beneficiary, the INS says, the law calls for the      papers of her children--the ``derivative beneficiaries''--to      be revoked upon her death.       The incredulous Lozano family has fallen into one of the      many cracks in U.S. immigration law. Their case stands out      even amid the often dramatic consequences in a legal arena      replete with tales of separated families.       ``It's just not fair to send these children back now.''      Zoila Esperanza Lozano, 54, the children's maternal      grandmother, said as she fought back tears during an      interview at her Los Angeles apartment, where a photograph of      her late daughter and a Mother's Day poem from her are      displayed prominently.       Rosemary Melville, INS deputy district director in Los      Angeles, declined to discuss the Lozano case specifically,      citing privacy laws. But she confirmed that visas for family      members are considered ``null and void'' if the principal      beneficiary dies before the visa is used. In ``compelling''      cases, Melville added, the agency has discretion to grant      residency or block deportation based on humanitarian      concerns.       In another era, legal observers say, authorities may have      been inclined to stretch the letter of the law or issue a      waiver allowing the Lozano children to stay. But such      exceptions are more problematic amid today's national climate      generally hostile to immigration.       ``The unfortunate track record of immigration law is if you      make one exception you find it spinning out of control,''      said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration      Reform, a group that seeks to reduce immigration levels and      assails ``loopholes'' in the law.       Relatives of the Lozano children say they were assured by      officials at the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador that the      children's visas were still good, despite the mother's death.      They learned otherwise upon the youths' arrival at Los      Angeles International Airport last month, when, according to      the family, the three youngsters were held and questioned for      six hours and faced being sent back to El Salvador on the      spot--an expedited ``removal'' procedure that has been in the      INS arsenal since April 1, when a tough new immigration law      went into effect.       Finally, inspectors agreed to allow the three into the      country conditionally, pending the outcome of an agency      review. The three teenagers have another date with the INS in      Los Angeles on June 25.       The Lozano family has mobilized to do whatever necessary to      keep the children in Los Angeles. The three, now enrolled at      Belmont High School, are staying in their grandmother's one-     bedroom Westlake apartment.       ``For me, the children are a blessing from my beautiful      daughter, and I'll do whatever I can for them,'' their      grandmother said.       Tough of modest means, relatives here say they are willing      to sign legally binding accords to care for the three and      ensure that they do not become public charges.       Francisco Lozano, Ana Ruth's younger brother, is      spearheading a letter-writing campaign to officials in      Congress and elsewhere. ``If I have to go and see President      Clinton, I will,'' said Lozano, a hotel pastry chef.       In El Salvador, the family says, the three children have      nothing to go back to: no home, no close kin, no means of      support. Ana Ruth Lozano had been estranged from the      children's father for years, relatives say. Most close      relatives on their mother's side of the family are in the      United States and Canada, as are many other Salvadorans, who      left their homeland during the civil war that engulfed it in      the 1980s.       The children's grandmother has supported them in El      Salvador for years, sending back monthly checks of up to      $300, almost half her pay as a live-in housekeeper.       Seated in their grandmother's home on a recent afternoon,      all three Lozano youths spoke of their desire to remain in      the United States, study, and embark upon careers: Sergio      wants to be a graphic artist, Fauricio would like to be an      airline pilot, and Ana hopes to become a lawyer.       ``I don't think I'd have any chance to even dream about      such a thing back home,'' said Fauricio.       ``Here one has the chance to better oneself,'' said the      slender, reserved Ana. ``This place is what our mother always      wanted for us.''  By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Bryan):  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit consumer liability for the unauthorized use of a debit card, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.             the debit card consumer protection act of 1997  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will protect tens of millions of consumers who carry bank debit cards, as well as millions more who are being targeted by banks to use this relatively new and unfamiliar payment card. This bill extends to the users of debit cards the protections that now already apply to users of credit cards. And I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Bennett, Dodd, and Bryan, for cosponsoring this important legislation.  In the past few years, millions of Americans have opened envelopes from their banks to find these new payment cards. These cards look like credit cards. They have ``VISA'' or ``MasterCard'' logos on the front of them--I am holding one up now--but they are actually debit cards, or, in the language of the industry, they are ``off-line'' debit cards. They are called ``off-line'' cards because they can be used with just a signature, and no PIN No., in order to access the consumer's bank account directly.  These off-line cards combine the convenience of a credit card with the simplicity of an ATM card. In order to make a purchase, the consumer simply presents the debit card to a merchant and signs a sales slip. The money for the payment is then automaticallywithdrawn from the consumer's bank account and transferred to the merchant.  But if an off-line card is lost or stolen, it poses a little known and potentially unlimited danger to the consumer. Because it needs only a signature to authorize a purchase, a criminal who finds the card or who steals the card can easily use it to make purchases. He can go on a wild shopping spree and buy thousands of dollars worth of goods on that stolen card.  But unlike a stolen credit card, these fraudulent charges are immediately deducted from the victim's bank account. And unlike a stolen credit card, the law provides virtually no limit to the victim's liability.  And what happens to the consumer whose bank account is cleaned out by fraud? Soon her checks begin bouncing, bills go unpaid, late charges and overdraft fees pile up, suddenly the victim is facing financial disaster. Unraveling this mess can mean weeks of letters and phone calls, and nobody will compensate the victim for the lasting damage to his or her name or reputation.  Furthermore, the victim will be literally penniless until the bank investigates the theft and, hopefully, restores the account.  Under current law, the bank could take up to 20 days to complete this investigation. Imagine losing one's entire bank balance and then being unable to write a check for rent, car payment or groceries for 20 days.  Mr. President, I am concerned that consumers do not understand the off-line debit card. They may think it is just like an ordinary ATM card. But without the protection of a secret PIN number, the card is not secure. In reality, it is a direct line of access to the consumer's bank account. That line of access is open to anyone who possesses the card, including a thief. Just the number on the face of the card is all the thief needs to totally drain the consumer's bank account.  Financial institutions have sent out tens of millions of these cards unsolicited in the last few years. By 1994, there were 25 million off-line cards in circulation. By 1996, the number had jumped to more than 60 million. Millions more will be mailed out this year, because although banks cannot legally mail out an unsolicited credit card, a loophole in the law allows them to mail out these unsolicited off-line debit cards as replacements for consumer's ATM cards.  Mr. President, this is a ticking time bomb for millions of unwary consumers. Does the consumer understand how this new card differs from an ordinary ATM card? Does the consumer understand the risk that comes from carrying the new off-line card? Too often the answer is no. A recent survey by Mastercard found that 59 percent of the consumers who carry debit cards do not realize just how important it is to report a lost or stolen card immediately. At a minimum, consumers need to be warned before they start carrying these off-line cards, and they need protection in the event that anything goes wrong.  Mr. President, we need reform and we need it soon. The bill we have introduced today, the Debit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1997, provides a level of protection that is clearly needed.  First, it prohibits the banks from mailing out unsolicited debit cards. Only people who want these cards should be getting them in the mail.  Second, it requires a clear disclosure to the consumer that the card provides a direct line of access to the consumer's bank account.  Third, it prohibits the bank from sending out live debit cards. Cards must not be valid for use until the recipient identifies himself or herself as the rightful owner.  Fourth, it limits the consumer's liability to $50 in the event the card is lost or stolen.  Fifth, it expedites the restoration of funds to the consumer's account within 5 business days. Current law can make the consumer wait 20 business days.  Mr. President, this bill would bring the consumer protection laws up to date and into line with what the consumer is entitled to and expects. That is why consumer groups strongly support this bill, including the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. These organizations have all gone on record to say that this legislation provides essential protection for users of debit cards.  Now, Mr. President, some of the provisions of this bill were recently put forth in another bill, S. 1154, by my colleague, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who I see is on the floor. And some of these measures are now being implemented voluntarily by the industry. I want to commend Senator Reed for his work in this area. I think that a consensus exists that consumer protections are needed to improve a situation that presents a very real risk for millions of consumers.  In fact, MasterCard and VISA recently announced that they will voluntarily cap the consumer's liability at $50 in the event of an unauthorized use. One bank, Bank of America, has announced it will not hold consumers liable for any unauthorized charges. I commend the industry for responding to these concerns. Because of this responsiveness, I am hopeful the industry will vigorously support legislation to make these essential consumer protection laws permanent and universal.  Finally, I thank Senators Bennett, Dodd, and Bryan for cosponsoring this bill. Senator Bennett, as chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, is very aware of the enormous impact financial fraud is having on the industry and consumers. This legislation will help to protect both the industry and consumers from having to pay these high costs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1203       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
