Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), assistant Democratic leader, outspoken strong fighter for a citizen's right to vote, have that vote counted, an extraordinarily effective worker on behalf of the passage of this bill.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation and thank those who have made it possible.  Not long ago we took our right to vote for granted, but what occurred in Florida 2 years ago and again last month reminded all Americans how very sacred that right is. The right to vote is a cornerstone of our democracy, the most basic and most essential expression of citizenship. When that right is put into doubt, when citizens cannot know that a ballot cast is a ballot counted and that their unique voice has not been heard, it undermines confidence of our entire political system as well as the government formed on the foundation of our ballots.  People must simply have the confidence that their vote counts. That is what this legislation is about. It authorizes nearly $4 billion during the next 3 years to modernize our equipment, poll worker training, voter education, improved voter lists, improved voter access, provisions that would alert voters to improperly marked ballots like those we saw during the last presidential election. It goes a long way toward restoring the integrity of our electoral system.  Our work is not done. We must make sure that the funds for this bill are not merely authorized but appropriated so that this historic legislation does not become just another empty promise. At a time when American leadership in the world is critical, following through reforming on our election system is simply too important to address halfheartedly.  I am proud to support it.
