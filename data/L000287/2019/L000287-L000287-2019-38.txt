 Too many children dream of a stable, loving, family. Many adults want to open their homes and their hearts, but they face barriers because the system says that they practice the wrong religion, love the wrong person, or are not married.  My friends, this is discrimination. It is not right, not fair, and not just.  I am proud to sponsor the Every Child Deserves a Family Act to change that. This bill is the right thing to do, and quite frankly, it is long overdue.  It does not matter whether we are gay or straight, married or single, Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. It does not matter whether we practice all religions or no religion. It does not matter whether we are African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or white.  We are all one people, one country.  And we must each do our part to ensure that every young person and aspiring parent is able to enjoy the dream of a loving, stable family.  I look forward to reintroducing the Every Child Deserves a Family Act next week.                          ____________________
