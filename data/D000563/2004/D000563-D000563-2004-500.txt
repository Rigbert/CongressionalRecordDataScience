President, I recognize Paul Igasaki, a Chicago native, for his contributions to the important work of advancing our civil rights. Mr. Igasaki has dedicated his entire professional career to ensuring justice for the powerless in our society who are often neglected and ignored.  In his most recent years of public service as a commissioner, vice chair, and acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, Mr. Igasaki not only enforced laws that helped prevent employment discrimination practices, he himself broke the glass ceiling as the first Asian American appointed to the high office.  Mr. Igasaki was successful in reducing overwhelming case backlog that was impairing the effective functioning of the agency. His recommendations led to the development of the National Enforcement Plan and the Priority Charge Handling Program, which have reduced the EEOC case inventory by over 70 percent. These structural changes have allowed the agency to focus on more serious cases where the EEOC's involvement can make a difference to the lives of American workers.  Similarly, Mr. Igasaki cochaired an EEOC task force that recommended focused litigation strategy, placement of attorneys in area offices, and greater cooperation between attorneys and investigators in agency, which have led to increased law enforcement effectiveness of the agency.  One of his most notable accomplishments during his term on the EEOC was his role in guiding the settlement of the Mitsubishi Motors of America case--the largest case involving sexual harassment at the workplace. His success with this case was influential in moving the Japanese government to implement gender discrimination and sexual harassment enforcement laws for their own country.  In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, Mr. Igasaki brought valuable perspectives from his personal experiences as a Japanese American to the EEOC's efforts to combat unfair backlash and scapegoating of Arab Americans, South Asian Americans, Muslim or Sikh Americans and others who were wrongly targeted by hate and discrimination.  Mr. Igasaki mother's family owned a small truck farm near San Diego. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans, Mr. Igasaki's grandparents had been in the United States for almost a half century, and like most immigrantsthey were proud and loyal Americans. Yet, following the devastating attacks at Pearl Harbor, Mr. Igasaki's family was subject to harassment around town and at school. One day, the FBI showed up at their home, and without warning, warrant or explanation, they took his grandfather into custody. His family would not know where he was, what his condition was or why he had been taken for several months. They relied on community rumor, knowing that other Japanese Americans had been arrested for no apparent reason.  When our government issued the relocation orders for Japanese Americans, Mr. Igasaki's family had two weeks to give up the farm and nearly all of their property. Only in the horse stall that the family shared in the relocation center at Santa Anita Racetrack did they find out that Mr. Igasaki's grandfather was arrested because he was the secretary of the local Celery Growers Association and because he had taken some notes of their meetings in Japanese. Their family eventually reunited when they were sent to a more permanent camp in Arizona where they were held for the duration of World War II.  Having experienced the pain and injustice of such treatment based on no reason other than their ethnic ancestry, Mr. Igasaki's became a passionate voice of conscience in the months following the September 11th attacks. His voice comforted all Americans who faced discrimination at the workplace because of their ancestry or appearance, and the work of the EEOC was that much more important because of Mr. Igasaki's presence.  His voice has also been an important one in the development of the national Asian American civil rights movement. Mr. Igasaki has served as the Washington, DC, representative of the Japanese American Citizens League, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, and executive director of the City of Chicago's Commission on Asian American Affairs.  A more detailed list of Mr. Igasaki's accomplishments is described in a resolution that the national board of the Japanese American Citizens League recently adopted. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Resolution in Appreciation of and Commending Paul M.
