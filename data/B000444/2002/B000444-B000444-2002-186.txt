 Do we continue to underfund a national passenger rail system? Or do we finally stand behind the system, committing to it once and for all?  I agree with my good friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and that's why I joined him in introducing this important bill. For 30 years, I have witnessed Congress dangling a carrot in front of Amtrak's eyes, funding it just enough for it to limp along. And I'll tell you, this has to stop. Now is the time to commit politically and financially to a strong, safe, and efficient passenger rail system. And now is the time to determine once and for all, what exactly it is that we want out of passenger rail service in the country. Should this be a truly national system? And should we devote the resources necessary to maintain and expand this networks?  Senator Hollings and the rest of my colleagues know that I support funding the highway and aviation networks, our Nation has relied upon them for years, and they have served us well. But I look around today and I see crowded skies and congested roads. At the very same time, I see empty rails, with the potential to relieve this transportation burden and serve as a useful alternative for Americans.  As Senator Hollings discussed just now, the events of September 11 further demonstrated, in stark and rigid terms, the necessity of transportation choices. For years I have argued that we need to sit down together and begin an honest and frank discussion in order to create a blueprint for the future of passenger rail.  And, let me tell you this, this bill that I am introducing with Senator Hollings is a good, solid start. Instead of maintaining the status quo, the bill offers a vision and a set of priorities for the future of passenger rail in this country. It says: we need to make sure this system is safe, as September 11 demonstrated it must be. It says: we need to seriously invest in the future of this system, which is high-speed rail. And it says: the Federal Government will need to adequately fund a national passenger rail network, no matter how the system is structured.  And that is something that has always mystified me. When it comes to other forms of transportation, highways and airplanes, we have given them all they ask for, consistently providing full Federal backing. Since 1971, in fact, we have given $750 billion to highways and aviation. In the same period of time, since the birth of Amtrak, we have only given $25 billion to our national passenger rail system. That's only 3 percent of all transportation funding in that period. That is appalling.  If we want a national passenger rail system, and most Americans do, as all the polls indicate, then we are going to have to pay for it, and understand the long-term commitment it takes to get this kind of system up and running. Passenger rail in this country has never had a stable funding source instead, it has been subjected to the whims and follies of the political process, and it has lost this battle time and time again.  Every single industrialized country, France, Japan, Germany, subsidizes a national rail system. For years, we have been living in a fantasy - that somehow, we can have our cake and eat it too: that we could mandate Amtrak to be self-sufficient without giving it nearly enough money to do so. But Amtrak cannot run a national rail network, without adequate levels of Federal investment, and still be expected to be commercially self-sufficient. That is just not rational.  There are two steps, then, in ensuring the future of passenger rail. Short-term, we have got to make sure that we do not allow Amtrak to go bankrupt, or worse, mortgage off their future in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. That is why, alongside many of my colleagues, I have pushed for the full $1.2 billion appropriations amount that Amtrak has requested for next year. This bare-bones minimum will give them the ability to maintain the current state of passenger rail, nothing more, nothing less.  And in the long-term, we need a new vision for the future of national passenger rail so these one-time, bare-bones funding requests are no longer an issue. This bill represents just such a vision. It would invest seriously in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail corridors, which provides the most bang for the buck and which almost every State Governor, Democrat or Republican, has been clamoring for for years. It would provide money for debt payments, which Amtrak has incurred as a direct result of Federal underfunding. It would authorize capital investment funds, to begin to correct the $5.8 billion capital backlog Amtrak faces today. And it would fund operating costs for the long-distance trains that provide essential service to rural areas of the country.  Moreover, it would address the serious security concerns that plague our rail system today. I stood up here months ago, right after one of the worst events in our Nation's history. I stood up here in order to call attention to what I thought, and continue to think, is a dire situation. And that is this matter of rail security. The events of September 11 dramatically and starkly revealed how essential it is that the United States have a national, effective, and secure railroad passenger system. It also exposed how vulnerable that system is right now to terrorist attacks. I have traveled through the train tunnels that Amtrak uses, and let me tell you, these tunnels are just plain frightening, poor ventilation, poor lighting, inadequate evacuation routes.  This reauthorization bill would help the system deal with these tunnels and other gaps in our passenger rail security. A one-time investment of $1.4 billion would provide security fencing, closed circuit television, tunnel rehabilitation, increased security inspections, essential security-related improvements. The Department of Transportation itself has warned several times in the last few years about the necessity of quickly and fully funding Amtrak's security needs. $1.4 billion is a small price to pay to avoid a repeat of September 11.  Finally, this bill would bring a greater level of accountability to the whole structure. As Senator Hollings indicated, the $1.55 billion in funds for high-speed corridor planning and implementation would be run through the Department of Transportation, so that the Federal Government can work together with state and local agencies in promoting the future of our rail system.  This bill, together with the $1.2 billion appropriations for next year, will bring us closer to the type of passenger rail system that our Nation deserves and needs. As my good friend Senator Hollings alluded to, 50 years ago, our leaders had the vision and foresight to stand up and say, we need an interstate highway system, and we need to fund it appropriately. Let us today go forward with this blueprint in hand and create a similar network for passenger rail.                                 ______                                       By
