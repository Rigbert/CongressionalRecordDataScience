 President, I rise to pay tribute to a brave young Kentuckian who served our country in uniform and whose life has been tragically cut short. SSgt Dirk T. Shelton, of Corbin, KY, died in Washington, DC, from wounds received July 13, 2014 on a training mission. The U.S. airman was 29 years old.  Staff Sergeant Shelton enlisted in the Air Force in 2005, after graduating from Corbin High School in 2004. He served multiple overseas tours, including four to Afghanistan and one each to Somalia and Kuwait. He was a member of Joint Special Operations Command and was stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.  Staff Sergeant Shelton was the recipient of many medals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, and the Air Force Achievement Medal. He was honored to be a Bronze Star recipient at such a young age. He had recently completed training in HALO parachute jumps. HALO stands for high altitude, low opening.  Staff Sergeant Shelton had wanted to fly as a young child. He loved to make people laugh and his coworkers remember that Dirk made work fun. He leaves behind his wife, Maria. Together they would have celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on July 20, 2014.  He also leaves behind his parents, Tom and Jenny Shelton; his sister and her husband, Morgan and David Taylor; his niece, Reagan; his aunts and uncles, Mike and Vicki Moore, John and Penny Hammons, and Joe and Missy Shelton; his cousins, Jon Moore, Amy Hammack, Johnny Hammons, Julie Hendrickson, Whitney Pratt, Emily, Jamie and Joey Shelton, and Jake, Brett and Allie Pennington; his parents-in-law, Israel and Nimfa Ocasio; and his sisters-in-law, Melanie, Marissa, and Mia Ocasio.  The local Times-Tribune newspaper published an article detailing SSgt Dirk T. Shelton's funeral service. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Times-Tribune, July 25, 2014]       Hundreds Attend Military Funeral Service for Dirk Shelton                            (By Jeff Noble)       Whenever America needed him, Staff Sergeant Dirk Thomas      Shelton always answered the call.       Those calls took him to corners of the world where very few      people--even his own family at times--had any idea where he      was.       After serving honorably to fight for and preserve our      nation's freedom and way of life, Dirk returned to Corbin to      rest forever.       Hundreds of people paid homage to Dirk during a stirring      and poignant funeral service Thursday evening at Grace on the      Hill United Methodist Church. The full military funeral began      around 6:10 p.m., and followed the visitation that went on      from 2-6 p.m.       A Corbin native, Dirk was a Radio Frequency Transmission      Journeyman assigned to the Joint Communications Unit in Fort      Bragg, North Carolina. He was also a member of the Joint      Special Operations Command, a sub-unified command of the U.S.      Special Operations Command.       Sgt. Dirk Shelton passed away in Washington, D.C. last      Monday, July 14. He was on a training mission in Fairfax,      Virginia, and suffered a traumatic brain injury last Sunday,      July 13. At the time of his death, he was 29 years old.       The military plane carrying his body left Washington, D.C.,      Wednesday evening and landed at Lexington's Blue Grass      Airport later that night. A hearse brought the body south to      Corbin where it was taken to Hart Funeral Home, who handled      the arrangements.       Around 12:35 p.m. Thursday, the hearse left the funeral      home as part of a small procession that took Dirk's body to      the church for the visitation.       A long, steady line of people paying their respects to Dirk      lined outside and inside the chapel for much of the      afternoon. Inside, an open casket with an American flag      draped to the casket's side stood in the middle, just below      the stage.       Above the casket, on either side were pictures and mementos      of Dirk.       Looking down from the balcony to the right, a black and      white picture of him with his sister, Morgan Shelton Taylor,      stood out as a memory of earlier times. To the left was a      large picture of Dirk free falling from an airplane during      maneuvers--a favorite print of the Shelton family.       Overhead, above the choir loft, two large video screens on      the left and right displayed pictures and tape of Dirk, his      wife Maria, his parents Tom and Jenny, and moments capturing      the life of a man who lived it like there was no tomorrow.       Two poems and an essay written by Dirk were read at the      funeral. And, as people came inside for the service, there      was this comment, written on a small program card.       ``All my life I have been pushed towards different goals.      Not all of these goals were goals I had necessarily set for      myself, but they were goals all the same. The reason for this      `push' is because people who are for me want me to succeed in      life. I would like nothing better than to be a successful      person and that brings about my fear. My fear is that I might      not be successful in life. . . . The way I see it, the only      real way that I could get rid of my fear completely is to      actually become successful at something in my life, which      leads me to believe that my fear may be around for a long      time. If I could change my fear, I wouldn't. It's what gets      me by. If it were gone, there would be a void in my life and      I would inevitably turn out to be what I fear--     unsuccessful.''       Dirk Shelton wrote those words in an essay.       His friend Johnny B. Hammons read them at the service.       ``He was a hero to me, he was a hero to his family, and he      was a hero to his community,'' Hammons said.       According to his friends and comrades in the military, he      went beyond and above success at all times.       Lieutenant Colonel Jim Clifford, the commander of Dirk's      unit in Fort Bragg, North     Carolina, said of him, ``What many of you don't know is that      Dirk was a patriot in the truest sense of the word.''       He noted Dirk's six deployments--four to Afghanistan, and      one each to Somalia and Kuwait--and the numerous awards, such      as the Bronze Star.       Lt. Colonel Clifford told the audience, ``It takes just      plain guts. We wonder where you find such young men. Corbin,      Kentucky is that place.''       Along with giving thanks to Dirk's parents, the officer      singled out Dirk's widow, Maria Shelton--who also serves in      the military and is stationed at Fort Bragg.       ``Maria, thanks for standing by Dirk during those long      trips'' (that he made to serve his country during combat      tours and numerous overseas missions).       The military was there in a show of strength and support.                          ____________________
