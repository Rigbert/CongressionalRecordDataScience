 FEINSTEIN. I will right away, in just 1 second.  What the Senator from Utah is saying is the explosive company that makes the explosive does not intend--that is clear--that it be used for criminal purposes. I agree. The intention of this is not to get at the explosive company. The intention is to get at the person who misuses or mispackages, and who does it all for the purposes of committing a criminal act.
