 That seems to me to be a terrible thing not only for millions of families but a terrible thing for this country as well.  Let me shift for a moment. We have talked about the impact of the Contract With America on those families hoping to send their kids to college. What about veterans? I find it interesting and I just this morning actually met with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown, who I think is doing an excellent job in advocating for the rights of veterans, who is deeply concerned about the rescission, the cutback of money already appropriated, which took place just last week, of some $200 million for veterans already.                              {time}  2310  He and I think many of us share the concern that next year under the Republican proposals there will be major cutbacks in veterans programs, including programs and money needed by the VA hospitals. It seems to me that we can disagree about the wisdom of this or that war. But if you are going to ask a young man or woman to go to war, to put his or her life on the line, you are signing, talk about a contract, there is not a deeper contract than you can sign. When the government declares a war and says, go out, you have made a contract in perpetuity, I think, with that individual. They cannot do more than put their life on the line. And it seems to me in absolute disgrace that anyone would contemplate, when the elderly now in our VA hospitals who fought in World War II, who fought in Korea, who need the help, to say to those people, we have a real deficit problem here, guys, we are going to have to cut back on your needs. Thanks for putting your life on the line. But now you are somewhat disposable. That seems to me to be very wrong.
