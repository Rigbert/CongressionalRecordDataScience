Chairman, the administration proposed a punitive fee structure aimed at the heart of general aviation; and, ironically, they would have decreased the funding needed for an already congested and overburdened system.  This bill gets us the investment we need to deal with congestion, to deal with the Next Generation air traffic control. It would allow us to partner with the airports who need to deal with their problems through an increase in passenger facility charge. It has fair treatment for the most critical component of the people who keep us alive, the air traffic controllers of America who are being demeaned by petty work rules by this administration and having their pay cut.  It gives long overdue protection to cabin flight attendants and the passengers who fly in those cabins in terms of workplace health and cabin safety. It has critical consumer protection for the first time, something that's been ignored for years here on the Hill under the Republican leadership.  It will provide security for overseas repair. Most Americans would be shocked to know that people, we don't know who they are, overseas are doing the majority of heavy work on our airplanes. This bill would begin to turn that around. And this bill does much, much more. Congratulations to the committee on their great work.
