Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, merely to point out that the reviewers of this, the Congressional Research Service, all of the other groups, fundamentally said that the base bill and our bill, that amendment, were equally good on the submarining issue. The substance of our amendment, which is the small business provision, my colleague will not talk about doing this debate. My colleague is trying to obfuscate the most important part of this amendment. Very clever, Mr. Speaker.
