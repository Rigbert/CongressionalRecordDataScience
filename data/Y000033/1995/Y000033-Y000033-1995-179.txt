Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  I do so only because I am not exactly sure what the effect would be. We were just provided this amendment today. We are trying to determine what effect it would have on title 10 of the United States Code, Armed Forces, which deals with procurement and contracting and things of this type. I am not really sure what effect that would have, and I am just wondering if the gentlewoman would be willing to defer a decision on this amendment for maybe 15 or 20 minutes to give us a chance to try to finish our research on it.
