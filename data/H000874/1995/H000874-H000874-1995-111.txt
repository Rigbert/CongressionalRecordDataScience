Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I appreciate the kind comments. And I also want to express my congratulations for the agreement that GSA and the court were able to work out with the city of Fresno. The gentleman can be assured I will also do my part to see that this project receives very serious consideration in subcommittee deliberations next year.
