Speaker, I rise today to once again introduce a resolution for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby to hold its race along Constitution Avenue. This bill will permit the 59th running of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby, which is to take place on the Capitol Grounds on Saturday, June 24th, 2000.  This resolution authorizes the Architect of the Capitol, the Capitol Police Board, and the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to negotiate the necessary arrangements for carrying out running of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in complete compliance with rules and regulations governing the use of the Capitol Grounds.  In the past, the full House has supported this resolution once reported favorably by the full Transportation Committee. I ask for my colleagues to join with me, and Representatives Albert Wynn, Connie Morella, Jim Moran, and Tom Davis, in supporting this resolution.  From 1992 to 1999, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby welcomed over 40 contestants which made the Washington, DC race one of the largest in the country. Participants range from ages 9 to 16 and hail from communities in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia. The winners of this local event will represent the Washington Metropolitan Area in the National Race, which will be held in Akron, Ohio on July 22, 2000.  The Soap Box Derby provides our young people with an opportunity to gain valuable skills such as engineering and aerodynamics. Furthermore, the Derby promotes team work, a strong sense of accomplishment, sportsmanship, leadership, and responsibility. These are positive attributes that we should encourage children to carry into adulthood.  The young people involved spend months preparing for this race, and the day that they complete it makes it all the more worthwhile.                          ____________________
