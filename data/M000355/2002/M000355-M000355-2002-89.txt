 Up to 40 percent of unions required to file LM-2 reports filed late or not at all. The Department of Labor, under current law, can't even fine these organizations for noncompliance. My amendment would at least give them the ability to fine these organizations for noncompliance.  Let me summarize what this is about. We have decided in the Sarbanes bill and in the Leahy amendment that we want accountability in corporate America. We want to hold the CEOs and the CFOs responsible. We want the auditing done accurately. If it is not done accurately, somebody needs to be held responsible.  Why are we doing that? We are doing that because we want to reassure the shareholders that somebody is not cooking the books, that we don't have more WorldComs and Enrons and Global Crossings and the like.  The McConnell amendment seeks to provide those very same protections to rank-and-file citizens who may or may not be big enough to invest in the market. But they are investing their dues every week in the majority of our States where they do not have a choice to not pay their dues. And they have every right to expect independent audits of their funds to make sure they are not being stolen and not being misused. They have every right to expect the presidents of those unions and the secretary-treasurers of those unions to certify as to the accuracy of those audits.  That is what this amendment is about. It is about providing the same fairness to the union member as we provide to the shareholder. Simple justice. I urge that the McConnell amendment be adopted.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Who yields time?  The Senator from Texas.
