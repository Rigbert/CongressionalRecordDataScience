 Earlier today we cast our 15th rollcall vote on this bill. That is more votes than we had on all amendments on the floor--rollcall votes--throughout all of 2014. We have now voted on 19 rollcall amendments, and here is the situation in which we find ourselves at 10 o'clock on Thursday night. There are 12 amendments pending--6 Democratic amendments and 6 Republican amendments--but our good friends on the other side will not agree to vote on their own amendments.  So we find ourselves in a unique situation. We have opened up the Senate for amendments for both sides. Our colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, have had more rollcall votes on amendments than all of last year combined. Yet our Democratic friends don't even want to agree to vote on the amendments they have pending.  We are left with only one way to avoid having to invoke cloture on each amendment, which would tie up the Senate for weeks, in order to provide our colleagues on the other side an opportunity to vote on the amendments they said they wanted to vote on. So there is really only one way to go forward, and so what I am going to do is ask unanimous consent that starting at 10 o'clock the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments in the order listed: Sullivan No. 67, Cardin No. 75, Murkowski No. 98, Reed No. 74, Flake No. 103, Leahy No. 30; Cruz No. 15, Whitehouse No. 28, Moran No. 73, Carper No. 121, Daines No. 132, and Markey No. 25; further, that all amendments on this list be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and that no second-degrees be in order to the amendments. I ask consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between each vote and that all votes after the first in the series be 10-minute votes.
