Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) is dead wrong. This bill will not close the courthouse to anybody who has a legitimate claim. It does not restrict anybody's right to sue. What it does do is it puts some sense in the compensation. It puts some sense in the compensation in a manner that allows affordable and accessible health care to be available nationwide. We will not be pricing doctors out of their practice by high professional liability insurance premiums. We will not force maternity wards and trauma centers to close their doors for the same reason.  The time has come to put some sense in this system. California did that. They do not have a crisis there because their State legislature did that. We now have to step up to the plate and work for the patients, particularly in the States that are listed in red and in yellow on the map that was referred to by the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).  Pass the bill.
