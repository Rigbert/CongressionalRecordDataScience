Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper) and all of the Members for participating.  Mr. Chairman, I have no other speaker at that time, and therefore, I yield back my time to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), the ranking member.
