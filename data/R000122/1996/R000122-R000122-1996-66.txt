Speaker, I rise to recognize the contributions of women to the financial services industry and to honor an organization that makes this success possible: Financial Women International.  Women have made a major impact in the realm of financial services, leading to the industry's growth and flourishment. For 75 years, Financial Women International has advanced these goals by helping women in the financial services industry to expand their personal and professional capabilities.  When the group was founded in 1921, it claimed 59 members who held high positions in their banks. Today, Financial Women International counts more then 10,000 members from all 50 States and several foreign countries. These individuals come from all facets of the rapidly expanding world of financial services.  Financial Women International's impressive record stems from its emphasis on education. The group appreciates the importance of continual learning. For this reason, it offers seminars and many other programs that teach women in the financial services industry the skills they need to become and remain competitive.  In addition, Financial Women International advances the interests of working women by promoting pay equity and through its contributions to the efforts of the Glass Ceiling Commission.  I am pleased to honor Financial Women International. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this organization and the many hard-working women of the financial services industry.                          ____________________
