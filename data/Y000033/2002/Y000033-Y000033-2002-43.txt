Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin does not really work. I realize that he and I spend so much time together it is hard to create the separation, even for a weekend; but what this would do is a 1-day CR, a 1-day CR, a 1-day CR. And if all we do is a 1-day CR at a time, that is all we do. We would never get down to the real business.  So we cannot agree to this 1-day CR. And I hope that everybody will vote``no'' on the motion to recommit and then vote ``yes'' on the resolution, so that then we will get back about our business, the rest of our business, after we conclude the CR.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
