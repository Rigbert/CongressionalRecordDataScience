President, I appreciate the words of the Senator from Iowa. He and I have been here for a long time. We have worked on an awful lot of issues, from defense matters to agricultural matters. Over those years, I have always enjoyed working with him. We will continue on this. I realize there will not be votes today, but I think this would be a good time for Senators who are trying to reach areas of accommodation and agreement to do so. Either I or my staff will be here to work with the staff of the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Iowa in any way we can be helpful.  I yield the floor.
