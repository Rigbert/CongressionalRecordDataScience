Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Since the President and Speaker Gingrich shook hands, the American people have been expecting progress on campaign finance reform. The public will be bitterly disappointed if this bill passes, even with the improvements made by the rule, because it fails it fails, it fails to deliver true reform.  Mr. Chairman, I want to focus on an issue which the chairman speaks to, empowering the people of my district. I tell my friend from California, I presume, like me, 100 percent of those who will elect me live in my district. They are empowered. They have the right to make a decision. But I, like the gentleman from California, am very cognizant of the demographics of my district and every district in America and the spread between Republicans and Democrats.  We do not have to have a very expensive poll or focus group to find out that the wealthier folks in most districts in America tend to be Republicans. Not absolutely. And, in fact, from my perspective, I have raised to this point in time much more in district, both in terms of percentage of givers--over 50 percent of the givers--and in percentage of money, than my opponent has in my district. So this will not adversely affect me.  I say to my friend, if one wanted to be cynical, one would say, if we were going to devise a system that advantages the wealthy and the powerful in America, then limit fund raising in districts so that the wealthy and powerful in every district will have the advantage. I say to my friends, that this is not reform, this is elitism disguised as reform.
