 President, I would like to take a minute to recognize CPT Steve Rairdon of Leslie County, KY. Captain Rairdon is a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade and participated in commemorating the 70th anniversary of the D-day invasion in Normandy, France, last month.  As an airborne soldier, Captain Rairdon understands the indispensable role his predecessors--the first soldiers of their kind--played in the D-day invasion. In the earliest hours of June 6, 1944, Allied paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines in advance of the amphibious invasion to disrupt German lines of communication and to secure key roads and bridges. The success of their mission proved vital to the success of the invasion as a whole.  By participating in the 70th anniversary ceremonies, which included a jump into Normandy, Captain Rairdon and all those who joined him paid a wonderful tribute to our veterans who fought 70 years ago. It is these acts of remembrance that continue to illuminate the unimaginable sacrifices made by the members of the ``greatest generation''. Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Captain Steve Rairdon.  The Leslie County News recently published an article detailing Captain Rairdon's time spent in Normandy. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:              [From the Leslie County News, July 3, 2014] Telling the American Military Story . . . One Service Member at a Time       Normandy, France.--Army Captain Steven J. Rairdon stands on      hallowed ground, as he and hundreds of other American service      members are here commemorating the 70th anniversary of the      Normandy D-day invasion in 1944 that changed the course of      World War II and history. ``Honoring our history, securing      our future'' is the reason the American service members are      here today. Rairdon is a member of C Company, 173rd Brigade      Support Battalion from Vicenza, Italy, and spent      approximately a week in the Normandy region, participating in      ceremonies and representing the Americans who fought here 70      years ago.       ``I'm extremely honored to have been given the opportunity      to jump here. It's very humbling. I'm proud of our American      World War II veterans. They made great sacrifices for our      nation, and paved the way for today's airborne community.      Thank you to all of our veterans and their families for their      sacrifices they've made to keep our country and our NATO      allies free,'' Rairdon said.       Soldiers such as Rairdon remain indebted to the veterans      whose service demonstrated the selfless actions of the      ``greatest generation'' who not only served to protect and      defend our nation, but were part of a global force to defend      peace and strengthen our ties with an emerging Alliance. The      selfless actions by all allies on D-day continue to resonate      70 years later as U.S. forces in Europe remain steadfast in      our commitment to our European partners and NATO Allies.       Rairdon is the husband of Myra Sizemore Rairdon, a 1992      graduate of Leslie County High School and the son-in-law of      former Leslie County Superintendent Tommy Sizemore of Hyden,      KY. Rairdon is the son of Steve Rairdon of Dewitt, Iowa, and      Theresa Reeves of Tyler, Texas.                          ____________________
