I remember years ago when I was very young, I worked in the oilfields. I can remember there were small wells all over and, of course, at that time there wasn't an effort. Now they have cleaned things up, and nothing is greater in terms of the technology that has come along for the environment than what we have experienced.  When we think about what is happening all over the world--I am glad the Senator mentioned this--with ISIS and all of these problems we have right now, I believe we are facing a greater threat right now militarily than we have before. And that is where a lot of our energy is coming from, and it doesn't have to.  A good friend of the Senator and a good friend of mine named Harold Hamm--he is from Oklahoma, but he does a lot of work up there--I asked him a question in relation to the President repeatedly saying: Well, if we were to go ahead and develop this on Federal lands, it would take 10 years before that would reach the economy.  I was going to be on an unfriendly TV show, and I called up Harold Hamm and I said: Harold, I am going to ask you a question, and be careful in the way you answer it because I am going to use your name and your answer on nationwide TV. If you were set up someplace like New Mexico on Federal land that had not been touched before, how long would it take that first barrel of oil to reach the economy?  Without hesitating, he said: Seventy days.  I said: Seventy days? Well, that is 10 weeks, not 10 years.  Then he went on to say what would happen each week for those 10 weeks. I have never been refuted since we used that.  In addition to all the arguments we are using, just think about what our oil independence, our energy independence could be in this country. It is all there for the taking. This is the key element to make that a reality.
