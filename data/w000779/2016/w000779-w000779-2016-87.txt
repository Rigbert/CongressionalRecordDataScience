President, today I wish to congratulate Clackamas Community College, CCC, in Clackamas County, OR, on 50 years of continued growth and achievement in providing valuable education to Oregon's citizens. From Gladstone, to Oregon City, to Wilsonville, CCC has grown to include three campuses and two extension sites. Now with campuses educating 35,000 students, CCC still has a community-minded focus and provides its communities with affordable education and training opportunities which aid in creating family-wage jobs.  Since 1966, CCC has prided itself on being a welcoming place for students seeking transfer degrees, specialized career technical education, or returning to finish a high school diploma. The college has over 80 career and technical programs, from automotive technology and renewable energy, to the ever-growing field of medical and dental assistance.  CCC has also grown into one of the top community colleges in the Nationfor our veterans, earning a Best in the West award from the Military Times last year. The college has made service to veterans and military families a high priority and an integral part of its campus identity. The college has several full-time veterans advocates on staff and the only Army Strong Community Center in the western U.S., connecting military families to the resources they need.  For 50 years, educators, administrators, and board members have followed their vision that has led to CCC being a fixture of achievement in northwest Oregon. And to help continue that tradition of achievement, CCC has recently launched the ``Imagine Clackamas'' project, which is a 2-year outreach effort designed to help the college identify where to adapt and expand its strengths. I am excited to see what new heights this great community college will reach as it thrives for decades to come.  It is an honor to represent Clackamas Community College in the U.S. Senate, and congratulations again to the college on its 50th anniversary.                          ____________________
