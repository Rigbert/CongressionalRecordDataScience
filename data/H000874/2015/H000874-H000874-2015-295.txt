Speaker, I rise to recognize the Guillain-Barre/Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy Foundation International's thirty-fifth anniversary. For more than three decades, the GBS/CIDP Foundation has done more than advocate for effective treatment; it has provided hope and resources to those who suffer from these disorders. The Foundation's staff and volunteers help those with GBS and CIDP recognize that they are not alone--and that they have powerful allies in their corner.  Last night, I had the privilege of serving as master of ceremonies for the Foundation's anniversary gala, at which my friend and colleague, Representative John Garamendi of California was honored as ``Legislator of the Year.'' John's two daughters, Christina and Elizabeth, experienced GBS, and he is not only a great leader on this issue but also a steadfast advocate for access to quality, affordable health care for all who need it.  Many of those who suffer from GBS and CIDP find themselves experiencing a physical disability, which can have a profound effect on their quality of life and, potentially, their ability to work. One of the proudest moments of my career in public service was leading the effort in the House to pass the bipartisan Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, ensuring that every American with a differing ability can have his or her equal rights, equal access, and equal dignity recognized and respected.  This year we're celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of that landmark legislation, which did more than change the way we construct buildings or crosswalks--it changed attitudes. Changing attitudes about what GBS and CIDP means for those experiencing it and why we must work together to find new treatments and a cure has been the great work of this Foundation.  I am proud to have been a part of last night's event, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the GBS/CIDP Foundation International on this milestone anniversary. I want to thank organizers Ralph Neas and Katherine Beh Neas, both for their friendship over the years and for their untiring efforts to raise awareness, provide resources, and support research to benefit those suffering from GBS/CIDP. I look forward to continuing my support for their important and impactful work.                          ____________________
