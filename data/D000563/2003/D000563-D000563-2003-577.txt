President, it is my understanding a number of Senators have offered amendments. I assume they have been sending them to the desk and setting them aside. Is that correct?  That is what I would like to do before we adjourn this evening.                           Amendment No. 994  Mr. President, this is an amendment I have discussed with my colleagues and have spoken about on the Senate floor a few times. It is in the nature of a substitute to the underlying bill.  Let me say, though I have had many differences with my friend from Iowa about a variety of different matters we have worked on over the years, I congratulate both him and Senator Baucus for their leadership. I think what they have done is bring the Senate to this moment in our history where we are seriously considering a prescription drug program that will benefit the tens of millions of seniors across America. And this conversation is long overdue.  I think what they have proposed is a worthy start for a commitment that needs to be made. I think there isn't a Senator who comes to this floor who has not been back to his or her State to hear of the tales and stories of families and the struggles they are going through in paying for prescription drugs.  I was back in my hometown of Springfield, IL, over the weekend for a wedding, and out of nowhere people started coming up to me and talking about prescription drug costs: I know you are debating this in Washington.  I think this is a timely discussion. I hope, at the end of the discussion, we will have a bill that really does achieve what we hope to achieve. I think making a national commitment to a prescription drug program under Medicare is the right thing to do, but I think we need to do it with our eyes wide open.  There are several facts we should consider. Let me give you illustrations. One of them is the cost of prescription drugs is going to continue to rise dramatically unless we address it, and address it head on. They say the cost of prescription drugs goes up 10 to 20 percent a year. You can ask any senior or family and they can tell you that story.  What troubles me about the underlying bill is it does not have competitive forces that will bring these costs down. It provides for a percentage helping hand to seniors to pay for their prescription drug bills, but that percentage becomes less and less as the overall cost of prescription drugs continues to grow out of hand. The substitute amendment which I am offering is going to address this, I hope, in a meaningful way.  Just last Friday--I guess a surprise vote to some--we decided to allow America's seniors to import drugs from Canada. Why did we do that? Because everybody knows the story: The very same American drug companies that make these products in America, when they turn to sell them in Canada, give them a deep discount. Why? Because the Canadian Government says to them: If you want to sell drugs in Canada, then you have to discount the cost to Canadian citizens.  So here we are, in our States bordering Canada, just a few miles away from pharmacies in Canada selling identical drugs to those sold in America at a fraction of the cost. Now, of course, that is a benefit to Canadian citizens. And we decided last Friday we would make certain that benefit was there for American citizens.  We can reimport drugs--in other words, made in the United States, shipped to Canada for sale. We will now, under the amendment we adopted by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, allow Americans to repurchase the drugs from Canadian pharmacies to bring them back into the United States. Isn't that an awkward, clumsy,and convoluted way to provide a discount to America's seniors? It certainly is. But we voted for it on a pretty substantial rollcall. I think over 60 Senators supported it because we understand for many seniors that Canadian discount makes all the difference in the world.  Unfortunately, this reimportation from Canada is temporary, and it is not a permanent part of what we are debating here. In fact, there are few, if any, elements in this underlying legislation that give seniors in America a fighting chance to get anywhere near the discounted prices being offered to families in Canada for the prescription drugs they need. In other words, we are offering a helping hand from the Government to pay for your prescription drugs, but offering no force or no element--certainly very little--within this bill to try to reduce and control prices.  You may think: Is Canada that powerful that they can dictate to the American drug companies they have to discount their prices? Well, I can tell you, the Canadian market represents about 2 percent--2 percent--of the sales by American drug companies, whereas the United States market represents 53 percent. If we, as a nation, turned to these same drug companies that have bargained with Canada and said: ``We want the same thing for Americans,'' you can bet we would achieve it. But this bill does not do that. The Grassley-Baucus bill does not do this. It does not create this force for competition and this force for bringing down costs.  Some will come to the floor and say: Durbin, this amendment is nothing short of socialism. You are trying, with a radical idea, to change the market structure in America, take away the free market competition, and dictate prices, and that is just unfair. We should not do it. And that is not American.  Well, I would ask them to place a call to the Veterans' Administration because the Veterans' Administration already does the same thing. The Veterans' Administration bargains for our veterans so the prescription drugs they receive are at a reduced cost. Why, if our Government will stand up for our veterans to get reduced costs for prescription drugs, is that any different than saying, under this bill, we should also be bargaining to make certain we can bring down prescription drug costs across the board? It will mean the program is more affordable for seniors. It will also mean the money we dedicate to the program will be with us for a while, a lot longer than as proposed under this bill.  So we do several things in this substitute amendment. I am not going to take any further time other than to just say a few words about this amendment, who supports it, and what it stands to achieve.  It is being offered on my behalf, as well as Senators Corzine, Harkin, Boxer, Stabenow, Dayton, and Byrd. It has been endorsed, to this point--we think other endorsements will come--by the Alliance for Retired Americans as well as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.  Here is what it does. It defines the benefits in statute. The underlying bill does not. It eliminates the coverage gap. The underlying bill has a coverage gap, where, after a senior has spent a certain amount of money for prescription drugs, there is no coverage until it reaches a catastrophic level over $5,000. It eliminates the deductible of $275 proposed by this bill because we found with price competition we can bring down the overall cost. It increases cost sharing. It guarantees a stable fallback. In other words, if there is not a private prescription benefit pharmacy manager offering alternatives to seniors, we allow Medicare itself to offer a prescription drug plan. That is a fallback always available under our bill. You do not have to be eliminated from the one to offer the other. This is always a fallback. And it allows employer coverage to count toward out-of-pocket spending.  The average cost for prescription drugs for seniors in this year is expected to be approximately $2,300. Under this bill we are considering on the floor today, seniors could get back maybe one fourth of that, $600. Every dollar counts and I commend my leaders in the Finance Committee for bringing this to us, but it is $600. Under the MediSAVE plan, my substitute amendment, seniors will have no deductible, lower cost-sharing, and face no coverage gap. The average senior can save up to 50 percent of the cost of those $2,300 in drugs, almost double what is offered by the underlying bill.  There is no guaranteed benefit for seniors in the underlying bill, and premiums are left up to insurance companies to decide. Under the MediSAVE plan, which I will offer, the Medicare-delivered benefit is outlined in statute so all seniors who choose to receive their benefit through Medicare will be guaranteed the same package, the same premium, no matter where they live in America.  As I said before, we address skyrocketing drug prices whereas the underlying bill does not. Incidentally, the Veterans' Administration has saved about $943 million in the past 6 years because it has bargained with the drug companies on behalf of seniors.  We also maintain choice. I see some of my Republicans friends have sent a letter to the President saying: We have to allow for innovation. We have to allow for competition. Agreed. We say: Fine, private groups and insurance companies can offer the prescription drug benefit as an option, seniors get to choose. But they always have a Medicare fallback they can choose.  Some say: We don't want this Government agency running this. Why do we want a Government agency in charge of it? Well, because Medicare has no profit motive. Medicare has a low administrative cost. If the VA runs the program for veterans and we don't consider that socialism, what is wrong with the idea of having Medicare in here competing with these private insurance companies. Eighty-nine percent of seniors today stick with Medicare rather than going to some HMO choice plan and/or private plan under Medicare. That tells you they like Medicare better. Why should we deny them this chance under prescription drugs.  MediSAVE creates a reliable fallback that is Medicare, and I think that is good for seniors. And MediSAVE will incentivize employers to maintain benefits. This is a fear we have. We don't want to do anything that will hurt the employers currently helping retired seniors, and we want to make certain we encourage their continued participation.  Under S. 1, funds employers put toward retiree costs don't count toward the retiree's Medicare out-of-pocket cost. Under MediSAVE, they would count.  Mr. President, I know it is late. I know a number of amendments have been offered. But at this point I would like to send my amendment to the desk and ask that it be read and then held at the desk.
