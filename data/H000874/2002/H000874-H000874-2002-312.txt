 The reason, of course, it is important to remember is so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. We human beings are inclined to do that. Some 60 years have passed since the Holocaust almost, and it perhaps fades in our immediate memory. But ceremonies like this are critically important to remind us that we need to be vigilant.  The gentleman from Virginia correctly observed that the rotunda is an appropriate place to have this ceremony. There probably is no place in the world seen as a symbol of the defense of freedom more than the rotunda. So I am pleased, along with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the chairman of our committee, whose leadership on these types of issues has been always present and always effective, I am pleased to join them in support of this resolution.
