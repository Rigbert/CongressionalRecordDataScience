President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators Levin and Collins, today in introducing the Deceptive Games of Chance Mailing Elimination Act of 1999.  It's rare that any American household has escaped receipt of a flurry of envelopes boldly proclaiming ``You're our next million-dollar winner!'' or similar claim of impending good fortune. Most of us recognize these prominent lines as the special language of direct mail sweepstakes. While many companies have used sweepstakes responsibly, others have bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by falsely suggesting a purchase is necessary to qualify for the sweepstakes or to increase the odds of winning a prize. Some of these operators promise fame and fortune, but they deliver fraud and false promises.  As Senator Levin has outlined, this bill sharpens the teeth of the current postal statutes by directing the Postal Service to develop and issue rules that restrict the use of misleading language and symbols on direct mail games of chance such as sweepstakes that mislead the recipient into believing they've already won or will win a prize. This rulemaking authority will allow the Postal Service to respond more rapidly to emerging deceptive practices. The bill also requires that additional disclosures be given to recipients of mailed solicitations involving sweepstakes giveaways about their chances of winning and that no purchase is necessary to enter the contest. Furthermore, the bill gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power so it can react and respond more rapidly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. Under our bill, civil fines can be imposed upon the issuance of an enforcement order, or alternatively, in lieu of an enforcement order, rather than awaiting a violation of that order.  By giving the Postal Service these additional tools and authority, this legislation will help combat the growing problem of consumer fraud in the form of deceptive or misleading mailings that use games of chance or sweepstakes contests to solicit the purchase of a product. Other deceptions have included packaging sweepstakes solicitations to closely resemble government documents and promising recipients that they have already won, even though the fine print reveals minuscule odds of winning.  The elderly are particularly vulnerable to sweepstakes fraud. Some senior citizen sweepstakes recipients have traveled thousands of miles to claim prizes they thought they had been assured of winning. Others spend thousands of dollars on magazines and other merchandise because they are convinced it will boost their chances of winning.  Like Senators Levin and Collins, I have heard from numerous constituents about how some crafty purveyors prey on the public, often persons on fixed or limited incomes, through these deceptive envelopes and packaging techniques. Recently, one constituent related how her elderly mother has become ``hooked'' on sweepstakes. She shared with me a bulky stack of envelopes, representing just a sample of the mailings. She remarked how her mother is convinced that the company will think better of her if she orders lots of merchandise, and that buying more products will accord her special consideration and improve her chances to win a lucrative prize. She noted that some companies, by using clever typefaces, sophisticated and official-looking symbols, gimmicky labels, and personalization, lead people to believe the company is writing to them personally, and that the odds of winning are high. Her story is but one example of what we have heard, and why it is so important to ensure that strong laws are enacted to address deceptive practices.  I am pleased that the United States Postal Inspector, the National FraudInformation Center, the Direct Marketing Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, and a special committee of the Association of Attorneys General are among those who are actively seeking ways to ensure that consumers are informed and protected from dishonest marketing ploys.  I look forward to the hearings planned by Senator Collins in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to examine the problem of deceptive mailings and legislative solutions. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting enactment of legislation to promote more honesty by product marketers, clearer disclosure for consumers, tighter penalties for violators, and quicker and more effective enforcement tools for more rapid response to unscrupulous practices.                                 ______                                       By
