President, in view of our urging the conferees to not interfere with FERC going ahead with these commonsense and necessary regulations, you can imagine my disappointment to discover that this bill, in fact, delays these regulations by FERC for 3 years.  I am also very troubled by the subsidies for pollution control equipment for some of our Nation's dirtiest powerplants. Why should taxpayers pay for pollution control technologies for 40-year-old coal-fired powerplants that were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act? Recently, when three advanced natural gas plants were built in Maine, these plants installed state-of-the-art, advanced pollution control technologies without any subsidies, without being subsidized by the American taxpayers. The cost of this technology was borne by electricity consumers in the State of Maine and other States in the Northeast. The cost of electricity from the oldest coal-fired powerplants has long been subsidized through exemptions from the pollution controls mandated by the Clean Air Act. To further this subsidy by authorizing billions--billions--of taxpayer subsidies for the dirtiest plants makes no sense at all, and it will have the effect of continuing to ensure a disparity in the price of electricity between regions in which pollution and other costs are subsidized and regions such as ours, in New England, which are not the beneficiary of these subsidies. That is not fair. It is not fair to our taxpayers, and it is not fair to our electricity consumers.  I am further disappointed by the inclusion of language in the electricity title which will undercut the nationwide development of clean power generation. This language, which is known as the participant funding language, effectively negates the benefits of the combined heat and power provisions that Senator Carper and I worked sohard to include in this bill. The participant funding language actually creates a disincentive for clean energy generation by allowing monopoly utilities to shift the costs of transmission upgrades onto clean power generation, such as combined heat and power--the cogeneration plants.  This provision is particularly harmful to our manufacturers, many of whom use combined heat and power to generate products and jobs.  The last thing we need in this country is another disincentive for our manufacturers. In the Northeast in particular, manufacturers are already struggling to cope with high electric rates. The last thing we should be doing is shifting more of the costs on to them.  The legislation would also increase greenhouse gas emissions, waste natural gas and other already scarce fuels, and harm air quality.  The bill's failure to address climate change is yet another disappointment. It seems a near certainty that greenhouse gas emissions will increase by hundreds of millions of tons under this legislation. Yet the entire climate change title has been stripped from this bill. If we are going to spend billions of dollars on oil and gas and coal projects that will increase greenhouse gas emissions, then at least we should determine whether such an increase in emissions could cause an abrupt and potentially dangerous change in our climate.  Unfortunately, the abrupt climate change provisions that I authored were also omitted from the final version of the bill.  In summary, this bill does not offer the balanced energy policy that America needs. It does not do enough to increase energy efficiency or renewable energy. It does not promote conservation. It does not protect our environment. It does not give FERC adequate authority to provide reliable electricity markets. And it will not reduce our reliance on foreign oil.  I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of ending the debate on this legislation, and I call on my colleagues to take a close look at the provisions of this bill. I believe as they delve into this bill they will realize that it is fundamentally flawed and should be rejected.  In doing so, we would save the taxpayers some $80 billion, and we would signal our support for a more balanced energy policy for this Nation.  I yield the remainder of my time.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman: We are      writing to urge you to continue our nation's efforts to move      toward competitive wholesale electricity markets that will      benefit consumers and businesses. National competitive      markets, where multiple buyers and sellers can negotiate      bargains and pass cost savings along to consumers, are the      best approach to the challenges facing the electricity      industry.       We would like to bring to your attention a number of issues      addressed in the electricity title of the Senate Energy Bill      (S. 14) that have implications for residents and businesses      in the Northeast-Midwest region.       Delay of Standard Market Design--S. 14 and the proposed      substitute amendment delays the implementation of the Federal      Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) standard market design      until July 2005. Electricity markets have outgrown state      boundaries. We are writing to express our concern with the      proposed delay of standard market design and the provision to      make participation in regional transmission organizations      voluntary. The delay has serious implications for residents      and businesses in the Northeast-Midwest region and throughout      the nation.       A standard market design would streamline the wholesale      electricity industry, encourage transmission investments and      move the lower 48 states toward a more competitive      electricity market. Congested power lines, which are the      result of the current electricity system, cost customers and      businesses throughout the United States billions of dollars      each year, whereas competitive wholesale power markets could      deliver billions of dollars in economic benefits.       Schwab Capital Markets detailed the importance of      standardized markets to increasing investment in our nation's      transmission grid and electricity generation.       Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air      Quality, Christine Tezak with Schwab states: ``We believe      that capital will be less expensive for all market      participants if FERC continues (and is permitted to continue)      its efforts to provide reasonably clear and consistent rules      for this business . . . Schwab WRG continues to view      continued efforts to move forward with the restructuring of      the electricity industry to be the best investment      environment for the widest variety of participants in the      electricity marketplace--whether they provide generation,      transmission, distribution or a combination of these      services--and most importantly, the most likely to provide      sustained long-term benefits to consumers.'' Further, Ms.      Tezak stated: ``Congress needs to decide whether or not it      still believes in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Today, Congress      is becoming an increasing part of the reason capital is hard      to attract to this business. Congress is calling for FERC to      slow down, Wall Street is frustrated FERC won't move      faster.''       S. 14 makes participation of federal utilities in Regional      Transmission Organizations voluntary. Federal taxpayer      dollars were used to develop and maintain Federal power      marketing agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and      Bonneville Power. The energy generated by these facilities      should benefit all Americans. TVA and Bonneville should be      required to participate in RTOs so communities throughout the      United States have access to the power generated at these      Federal facilities.       The Energy Bill must put national interest above the      interest of a few vertically-integrated utilities that want      to maintain regional monopolies. We encourage you to support      standardizing electricity markets and prevent further delay      of these efforts.       Participant Funding--S. 14 and the proposed substitute      amendment directs FERC to establish rules to ``ensure that      the costs of any transmission expansion interconnection be      allocated in such a way that all users of the affected      transmission system bear the appropriate share of costs.''      The language requires FERC to fairly align the costs and      benefits of transmission upgrades, a judgment that can      include a consideration of relevant local factors. This is      not only the most equitable approach but also the one most      likely to ensure that transmission development will keep pace      with growing electricity demand.       Combined Heat and Power--S. 14 currently contains the      ``Carper-Collins'' language which keeps in place incentives      to operate combined heat and power facilities until true      competition exists in electricity markets. This language      retains, for a limited time, the provisions of the Public      Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) which require utilities      to provide back-up power and buy electricity from qualifying      combined heat and power facilities. As soon as competitive      electricity markets are established, these requirements are      repealed. Since combined heat and power saves energy, reduces      greenhouse gas emissions, increases energy independence, and      is good for the competitiveness of American manufacturing, we      urge you to retain such provisions.       We urge you to complete the work Congress started with the      Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide reliable, low-cost      electricity to customers. Please stand strong against      pressure to reverse court on Congress' efforts to establish      better working, competitive markets, and to continue working      towards competitive electricity markets.           Sincerely,         Jack Reed, Olympia J. Snowe, Edward M. Kennedy, Arlen            Specter, Susan M. Collins, Debbie Stabenow, Frank            Lautenberg, Carl Levin.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2003.     Hon. Pete Domenici,     Chairman, Senate Energy Committee,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Ranking Member, Senate Energy Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member: As the      Conference Committee on the Energy Policy Act of 2003      continues its deliberations, we would like to bring to your      attention an issue of great concern to us.       We believe the Energy Bill must set forth a policy that      will complete the work that Congress started with the Energy      Policy Act of 1992. The vision of Congress and President      George H.W. Bush in 1992 was to transition our nation's      electricity industry to competitive wholesale power markets.      The vision of today's Congress should be to complete the      transition to competitive markets by allowing the Wholesale      Power Market Platform (WMP) of the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission (FERC) to move forward.       Wholesale power markets remain the best approach to      optimizing our country's energy resources by increasing      generation efficiencies, stimulating investment in new      technologies and infrastructure, providing greater choice in      energy sources, especially in renewable power, and passing      cost savings onto consumers. Wholesale power markets have      naturally grown into regional bodies, spanning multiple state      boundaries. The recent blackouts that impacted many of our      states clearly illustrate the regional nature of our      electricity grid. Events that occur in one state have impacts      in other states.       Moreover, while we respect the need for certain regional      variations among power market structures, we firmly believe      that any Energy Bill should not harm those regions of the      country that want to move forward with efforts to bring the      benefits of     competitive power markets to consumers. Accordingly, we urge      the passing of an Energy bill that will appropriately reflect      the physical and business realities of the electricity      business by allowing the FERC to implement its WMP.       The FERC's Standard Market Design proposal and subsequent      Wholesale Power Market Platform are the logical and necessary      responses to the problems experienced by nascent regional      wholesale power markets. WMP seeks to standardize market      rules while adhering to regional variations and allows FERC      to oversee the process of Regional Transmission Organization      (RTO) formation and participation. The timely implementation      of WMP is critical in achieving the efficient, seamless, and      non-discriminatory wholesale power markets that will      optimize our nation's energy resources. Delay will only      serve to further injure much needed investment in      generation, transmission and demand response facilities      that are the foundation of our nation's economic well-     being.       The health of our state economies depends upon the free      flow of interstate commerce governed at the federal level to      ensure consistent, clear and fair laws over state lines.      Similarly, vibrant competitive power markets rely on the free      flow of electrons through state and regional boundaries. To      the extent there is a standard set of rules, states with      either competitive retail markets or vertically-integrated      utility service will benefit in terms of greater      efficiencies, greater reliability and reasonably priced      electricity that our homes and businesses need.       Furthermore, a delay in the implementation of the SMD      rulemaking will only serve to add uncertainty to potential      investments in our energy infrastructure and negate years of      progress made in the rulemaking process by the FERC, state      commissions and market participants alike. Consider the      testimony of Christine Tezak of Schwab Capital Markets before      the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality: ``Congress      needs to decide whether or not it still believes in the 1992      Energy Policy Act. Today, Congress is becoming an increasing      part of the reason capital is hard to attract to this      business. Congress is calling FERC to slow down, Wall Street      is frustrated FERC won't move faster.''       Specifically, we believe that an energy conference report      should:       Support FERC's Efforts to Promote Competitive Wholesale      Markets--Our states feel strongly that any delay of SMD hurts      efforts to provide reasonably priced and reliable electricity      to consumers and businesses. In fact, Ohio Governor Bob Taft      in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee      stated that he believes that any delay would ``impose an      intolerable risk on the nation''. We urge you to reject      proposals to further delay FERC's ability to address issues      which have a direct effect on the cost and reliability of      electricity for millions of our constituents.       Promote Regional Transmission Organization (RTOs)--     Effective, well-functioning regional transmission      organizations and independent system operators are necessary      for the creation of well-designed, competitive regional      markets. The Electricity Title should not disrupt existing      regional markets nor stall their development in regions that      want to develop them. RTOs and ISOs are a key to effectively      managing the increasingly interstate flow of electricity and      are critical to the success of electricity restructuring.      Increased participation in RTOs will help address the      structural problems in our grid that created conditions for      the recent blackout. RTOs will help our nation improve our      ability to respond to problems in the grid by having an      effective regional ``traffic cop'' with a reliability mission      to manage any future incidents. They will also help improve      the climate for investment in transmission infrastructure to      enhance the reliability of the grid in the first place.       We urge you to complete the work Congress started with the      Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide reliable, low-cost      electricity to consumers. Please stand strong to continue the      efforts of Congress to establish well-functioning, robustly      competitive wholesale power markets while creating a federal      policy that would bring much needed certainty to our nation's      energy sector.       Thank you for your consideration of these comments and we      look forward to working with you to ensure the Electricity      Title respects the difference among regions while moving      forward with efforts to bring the benefits of competitive      power markets to all American consumers.
