President, I would like to take a few moments in the Senate to pay tribute to a remarkable woman. Maggie Daley served with dignity and grace for 22 years as Chicago's first lady. She died on Thanksgiving evening after a nearly decade-long struggle with breast cancer. She was at home, surrounded by her loving family. There is a sad but fitting poignancy to the date. People in Chicago and far beyond have so many reasons to be thankful for the life of this exceptional woman. Maggie Daley was an adopted daughter of Chicago, but no native-born Chicagoan could have loved the city more or served it better.  Last May, as her husband Rich prepared to step down as Chicago's mayor, the Chicago Tribune wrote an article about what Maggie Daley meant to Chicago. The first paragraph put it well: ``There has never been and may never be a Chicago first lady of greater impact, influence and inspiration than Maggie Daley.''  Maggie was smart, funny, tireless, amazingly modest, and deeply compassionate. She was also a very private person. Yet she still managed to touch the lives of so many people. The love Chicagoans feel for Maggie Daley was reflected in the faces of the people who waited in a line over a block long, in the rain, this last Sunday, to attend her wake at the Chicago Cultural Center--incidentally, a building which she worked hard to restore.  I stood in that line and talked to many people. Some of them I knew from my public life and their public lives but many just private citizens, some of whom had met her briefly, some who had worked with her for years, but they all came to pay tribute to her. Among them was Hazel Holt, 74 years old. The Chicago Tribune described Mrs. Holt as a person who decided to drive:       . . . downtown in her church finery from the Gresham      neighborhood on the South Side, absorbed the cost of parking,      rode the bus and then walked on a damp, chilly November day      to the wake.  Mrs. Holt said Maggie Daley ``built connections to the city's people with her commitment to charities assisting children, as well as her public poise in the face of cancer that would claim her life.'' She went on to say to the reporter:       I just loved this lady. I wish I had one-quarter of her      grace. She was a role model for a lot of us.  That is a feeling shared by many of us in Chicago and beyond. Upon hearing of Maggie's death, Nancy Brinker, the founder and CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation for the Cure, said: ``We've lost a real general.''  Loretta and I were blessed to have known Maggie personally, and Rich has been my friend, colleague, and even boss for decades. Yesterday morning, I attended Maggie's funeral at the old St. Patrick's Church in the neighborhood parish in Chicago. I remember the last mass I attended there with Maggie and Rich Daley. It was St. Patrick's Day. It is a big day in Chicago on St. Patrick's Day and ground zero for the celebration of old St. Pat.  It was clear Maggie's health was flagging. She had to sit through most of the service. She came to the front pew in a wheelchair. But all those struggles were quickly forgotten as her children and grandkids were seated next to her, and we heard from the back of the church, after the mass, that sound we all waited for, the famous Shannon Rovers bagpipe band from the Bridgeport section of Chicago. They come marching up the center aisle with those bagpipes blasting. It is a moment I will never forget. Maggie's grandkids were nervously waiting, expectantly waiting for the sound of the bagpipes, scrambling all over the pew and all over Maggie and Rich to get to the point where they could peer out down the center aisle to watch the bagpipers come away.  I looked at Maggie and Rich at that moment and I saw them beaming with the kind of joy that loving parents and grandparents just live for. Maggie was a patron saint of social causes, but her deepest convictions were to God and family. Maggie and Rich Daley had been blessed with four children: Patrick, Nora, Kevin, and Lally. Yearsago, she made her husband keep a promise to reserve Sundays exclusively for private family time. So the bottom line was this: One could ask Mayor Daley 6 days of the week to go anywhere in Chicago or anywhere else but Sunday, no way. He made a promise to Maggie that that was family day. It is a promise he always kept, and we respect him for it.  Two weeks ago, the family announced that their youngest daughter Lally had moved the date of her wedding from New Year's Eve to late November so Maggie could attend. It was a signal that the end was near, but she was at that wedding. There she was in her wheelchair with that irrepressible smile, a beaming mother, celebrating her daughter's happiness. It is quintessential Maggie.  Part of the reason Maggie Daley found such joy in life is that she understood what a fragile gift life can be. In 1981, her third child, Kevin, died from spina bifida just shy of his third birthday. After Kevin's death, she found healing and meaning in reaching out to help others and especially in volunteering to work for kids with disabilities. Someone once called her the godmother of all Chicago's children. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on her passing that Mayor Rich Daley may have been the head of the city, but Maggie Daley was the heart of Chicago.  In 1991, Maggie and Lois Weisberg, Chicago's long-time Commissioner of Cultural Affairs and an icon in her own right, began something called Gallery 37. There was an abandoned piece of real estate in the middle of downtown Chicago that had been lost in legal and court battles for decades. So Maggie and Lois decided to set up a tent on this old plot of land that was sitting vacant and create Gallery 37, which was an art gallery for kids. All across Chicago they invited kids--grade school and high school--to submit their artwork. We all went down there for the joy of that moment, of seeing the kids and the pride they had, and some of the magnificent artwork they produced, all because Maggie and Lois decided here was an opportunity they couldn't miss.  That program later morphed or matured into an amazing program called After School Matters. Maggie thought: If I can occupy these kids with art and music and drama and theater and chorus during the school year, let's do it after school--a vulnerable time for many kids. So over two decades, Maggie Daley nurtured the artistic talents of thousands of Chicago high school students and became a model for programs in many cities across the country and as far away as London and Australia.  The last time Maggie was in this building was in my office. She came upstairs to visit and to lobby me for money for After School Matters. Needless to say, she won my vote and my support.  Maggie Daley believed that art could change lives. She believed that artistic talent could exist in children from the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago as surely as it could from children in better, more wealthy neighborhoods, and that all young people should have the opportunity to develop their talents together. That is why After School Matters has become such an amazing program.  Maggie Daley also served on the auxiliary board of the Art Institute and the Women's Board of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. She was a very busy person.  It was a happy accident that Maggie Daley came to Chicago. Margaret Ann Corbett Daley was born and grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh. She was the youngest of Patrick and Elizabeth Corbett's seven kids and their only girl. After graduating in 1965 from the University of Dayton, she entered a management training program for Xerox and her job took her to Chicago. She promised her dad she was going to stay in Chicago for 2 years and then come back to Pittsburgh. But in 1970 she met a young attorney named Rich Daley at a Christmas party. They decided to date, got engaged, and were married for nearly 40 years.  The average survival rate for Maggie's form of breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes is very brief. Maggie Daley lived with this incurable illness for 9 years. Her doctors called it a medical miracle. She endured years of painful treatments and faced her cancer with courage, dignity, grace, and good humor. As the cancer progressed, she relied on crutches, a walker, and eventually even a wheelchair, but the smile never quit.  She donated generously to help open the Maggie Daley Center for Women's Cancer Care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital last year. The center helps other women facing cancer by providing access to doctors and important support services.  Loretta and I obviously offer our deepest condolences to Rich Daley, his wonderful children and their families--all of the Daley children and grandchildren. We trust that time and treasured memories will ease the great sorrow they obviously feel. They can also take comfort in knowing that the legacy of Margaret Corbett Daley can be seen and felt all over her adopted city of Chicago.  Maggie Daley's dedication to the arts will continue in part through the work of her daughters, Nora Daley Conroy, who chairs Chicago's Cultural Affairs Advisory Committee, and, of course, Lally, who will continue in her mom's tradition. Her commitment to education will live on in the lives of the young people she has touched. Her courage will endure in women she inspired who can now find medical care at the center she helped establish.  Maggie Daley was a modest person. She didn't like to talk about herself; she preferred speaking of others. Two years after she was diagnosed with cancer, she gave an interview to the Chicago Sun Times in which she hinted about how she felt about the future. This is what she said:       I try not to waste any time. At the end of the day, what's      important is if you think that the people around you have      maybe had a better day because of some of the things you've      done.  By that standard and so many others, Maggie Daley lived a good and full life. She did much good, and she will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
