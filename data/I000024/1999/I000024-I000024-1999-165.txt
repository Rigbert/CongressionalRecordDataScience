I agree with everything the Senator said.  I would like to ask the Senator if he didn't leave out one very significant reason why we should not be involved in that war --or that civil war within a sovereign nation--is that in our state of readiness right now we cannot carry out the national military strategy in defending America's regional fronts. In fact, it is even questionable, according to our air combat commander, that we could defend America on one front, with all the allocations of our scarce assets that are going into Bosnia, Haiti, and Kosovo.  Right now my major concern, with 5,000 of our troops already over there in Albania, is that they are virtually naked; they have no force protection, no infrastructure.  I hope the Senator will add to his list of reasoning why we shouldn't be there is because it is draining our ability to defend America on such fronts as North Korea or the Middle East.
