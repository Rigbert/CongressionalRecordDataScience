 Mr. Speaker, every one of us has beautiful children like in this our districts. This bill is going to save lives, and it has been bipartisan from the get-go.  Again, I want to commend Republicans and Democrats on our committee--but certainly those on the House floor as well--when we passed this bill a number of months ago.  I was a speaker and a participant in an event just last week for FasterCures, a networking group from around the country. Dr. Francis Collins was there, who is the head of the NIH. I spoke to Dr. Collins just in the last hour or so, and he is delighted that this legislation is reaching the House floor tonight. Hopefully, it will pass. I know that we are going to continue to make a real difference in the lives of families, and that is what this is all about, so I would urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  I yield back the balance of my time.
