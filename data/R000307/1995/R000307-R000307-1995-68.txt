 The statement by the Secretary, I feel--I cannot speak for Secretary Glickman although I try a lot, in Kansas, we try to get him to go at least 65 in a 55-mile-an-hour zone--but I think in regards to his comment on meat inspection, that it is somewhat dated.  We have had a lengthy meeting, as I have said, a bipartisan one, with the members of the Committee on Agriculture, the leadership of the committee that will have to produce the legislation to follow up in regards to the rulemaking.  We are negotiating now with language that I think may have a chance to work. I would just urge the gentleman to maybe consider that. There will be ample time, I think, for the gentleman to raise his points of concern.
