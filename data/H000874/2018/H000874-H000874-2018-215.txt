Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues who are in the majority and control the legislative process: end this shutdown. Use the authority you are asking for under this rule to bring to the floor the items on which we agree.                              {time}  1730  Mr. Speaker, you have said you would do that, take the tough issues head-on one at a time. I admired that statement. I will tell my friend, the Speaker of the House, that I will admire even more the performance.  Speaker Ryan said, in 2012: ``We will not duck the tough issues. We will not kick the can down the road. We will lead. We will not blame others . . . .''  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to do just that. Stop ignoring your responsibility as the majority party to keep the government open and serve the American people.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution through Tuesday that would immediately reopen the government while negotiations continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity, reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program and other critical healthcare programs, addressing the issue of DREAMers as was requested by the President of the United States, and providing assistance to Americans impacted by natural disasters.
