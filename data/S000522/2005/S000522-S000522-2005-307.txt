Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, before yielding back, I just want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) again for his eloquent statement. He truly, he and his wife, Annette, are the personification of liberation. They are survivors of the Holocaust; and he just has been a great champion for human rights.  And so many Members of this body have served in World War II as well, including the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the distinguished chairman of the full Committee on International Relations, who served in the Pacific theatre and was very active in the liberation, obviously, against Imperial Japan.  But, again, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for his leadership and his very eloquent statement.
