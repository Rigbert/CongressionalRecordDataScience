 If records are found to contain information related to actions by the Japanese Imperial Government during the Second World War, those records would be reviewed for declassification by the IWG under the criteria provided in the title. However, in the interests of safeguarding legitimate national security interests, the Director of Central Intelligence still maintains the discretion to protect the disclosure of operational files under section 701 of the National Security Act of 1947. Given the nature and age of the files it is unlikely he will need to exercise this authority. Title VIII requires an agency head who determines that one of the exceptions for disclosure applies to notify the appropriate congressional committees of a determination that disclosure and release of records would be harmful to a specific interest. It is the intent of title VIII that the IWG will be able to undertake an effort to search through U.S. Government records and disclose classifiedmaterials under statutory guidelines regarding the activities of the Japanese Imperial Government during the Second World War.
