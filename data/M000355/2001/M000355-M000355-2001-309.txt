 President, what the Senator from Nebraska has provided us is an opportunity to have three votes on the three component parts of his amendment. That is allowed under the rules of the Senate. It gives us an opportunity to deal with the core issues the Senator from Nebraska has laid out here: The increase in hard money, increased disclosure, and the soft money cap. It is my understanding that when I yield back my time, we will go to the vote on those three amendments. I therefore yield back my time.
