I think the amendment is very good, and I am in support of the amendment. Initially the Senator had it that under a managed plan, if a person wanted to leave the managed plan in one area of specialty, there was a split between the additional costs, if there were additional costs, of 70-30 percent. My suggestion in talking with the Senator and with his staff was it might be a better idea if we had a managed plan that allowed the market to take care of that differential so that if an individual went into a managed plan and at a later date wanted to go to another specialist, that individual would pay the differential himself so that the patient would have the choice of any practitioner he wanted to use and yet the savings of the managed plan would be effected.  My question would be, does the Senator think that perhaps this might avoid a duplication of all kinds of actuarial calculations, just to have one? And maybe we could talk about this or bring this up during the conference.
