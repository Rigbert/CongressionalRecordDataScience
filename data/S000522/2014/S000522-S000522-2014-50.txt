Mr. Gohmert, I want to thank you, again, for your leadership and for taking the time to go to Lagos to meet with all the families and to, again, amplify the message that we must do more. There is more that we can do.  I was extraordinarily impressed with our people that are on the ground. They are totally can-do, both our Embassy, as well as our military people. They want to help. We have got to make sure that we are resourcing them sufficiently as well.  The Government of Nigeria and President Goodluck Jonathan need to listen to the international chorus--the U.K. is there, the French are trying to be helpful on the intelligence side as well--but they own the leadership of this. They need to step up to the plate. Again, I can't emphasize enough the specialized training that could really enable their troops to efficaciously combat Boko Haram.  It needs to be done so urgently and so comprehensively. They need a comprehensive strategy.  I thank my good friend.
