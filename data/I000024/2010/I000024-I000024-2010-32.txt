Following the disposition of the Risch amendment, we will be scheduling my amendment No. 4833 having to do with verification and numbers of inspections. I will be wanting to speak on this. I don't want to take time from the Risch amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the Risch amendment for consideration of amendment No. 4833.
