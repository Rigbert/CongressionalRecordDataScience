 President, this is a good-government amendment, and it goes after the Justice Department grant management program because the inspector general has had grant management at the top of his 10 major management challenges. The inspector general says that management of grants at the Justice Department is abominable, so this amendment is trying to take care of what the inspector general has said is needed to be done for a long period of time. Grant recipients would be held to basic principles of accountability. There are only a handful of grants audited each year, but out of that handful 25 percent talk about mismanagement, fraud, and things of that nature.  A vote against my amendment would be a vote to allow fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer-funded grant programs. A vote against my amendment would allow nonprofit charities to continue to hold money in offshore bank accounts for tax purposes and still receive Federal grants. I have a letter in my office that justifies $54 million in offshore accounts.  I hope my colleagues will vote for this good-government amendment.
