Speaker, I would say to the majority leader, I understand, of course, Saturday is the Sabbath, Sunday is the day of rest for many, as well, and for religious services. But, Mr. Leader, you are well aware that we have now shut down the Government for the longest period of time in history as a result of an impasse between the Congress and the President. Waiting until Monday or Tuesday to try to resolve this will not only put many, many people in the public and private sectors in great distress and trauma, but it also will incur substantially additional costs.                              {time}  1730  If we could resolve this by the end of the weekend so that the Federal Government could undertake operations on Monday, that would be beneficial for every American and would be in the fiscal best interests of our country, which, of course, are some of the things we have been discussing.  Toward that end, I would hope we would very seriously consider trying to resolve this impasse before the beginning of next week.
