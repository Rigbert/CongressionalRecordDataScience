Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the gentleman on his hard work brining this to my attention. The gentleman is absolutely correct. The committee has been very sensitive to the concerns of the consumers of Hawaii as a result of the actions from the gentleman. Knowing of these concerns, I supported his amendment in committee and further revived the text of the committee print to insure that the President will consider the impact of proposed exports on consumers in noncontiguous States before making his national-interest determination. As the gentleman will recall, the committee print also established a mechanism for the President to monitor supply and price developments. The committee print provides the President with the power to modify or revoke the authority to export in appropriate circumstances.  Again let me assure the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie] that it is in the intent of this legislation to cause no harm to consumers in Hawaii. I will be glad to work with him in the future to address any problems that arise but otherwise cannot be adequately addressed in the procedures included in our legislation.
