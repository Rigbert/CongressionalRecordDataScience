Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues why we have been arguing so vehemently against Speaker Gingrich's stacking votes on the Committee on Ways and Means. The reason is that committee is precisely where the most egregious assault on the living standards of elderly Americans is taking place. It is on that committee where legislation to cut Medicare benefits and Medicaid benefits for people in nursing homes will be drafted to provide tax breaks for the privileged few. In fact, $245 billion in breaks to the well heeled while cutting the lifeline for Medicare and Social Security recipients.  Mr. Speaker, I favor balancing the budget, but why take it out on seniors? Why not cut costs first by reining in the insurance companies? the hospitals? the pharmaceutical companies responsible for rising costs? Why does the majority party want to balance the budget on the backs of our grandmothers and grandfathers while they pander to the rich and powerful friends they hold in high places?                          ____________________
