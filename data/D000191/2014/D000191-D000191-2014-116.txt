Chairman, on January 17, 2014, the Governor of California issued a proclamation, a state of emergency regarding the drought. My amendment simply states that the Secretary of Commerce should treat this emergency proclamation as requested by the Governor under Section 312 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to determine whether there is a commercial fishery failure for any fisheries that originate in the State of California.  Many charter and commercial boat fisheries on the west coast are dependent upon chinook and coho salmon stock that originate in Colorado's rivers and then migrate to the Pacific Ocean, where they are harvested.  Just one of these runs, the fall-run chinook from the Central Valley, turns north, and it makes up as much as 50 percent of the salmon production off Oregon and to areas to the north, and it is responsible for as much as 90 percent of California's salmon catch.                              {time}  1645  This run and others are in peril due to the drought. The reductions in river flows will impact incubating eggs, juvenile fish that are rearing in the upper regions of the river, and fry that are trying to out-migrate to the ocean.  While many fishing groups are working with Federal and State agencies to plan for the drought conditions and mitigate as much as possible against the potential impacts by facilitating out-migration, we cannot know how successful those efforts will be. While it is likely the drought will not have a large impact on commercial activities this year, many of these fisheries could see devastating impacts over the next several years, particularly in 2015 and 2016.  This amendment does not mandate a fisheries disaster declaration, but it will enable the Secretary to issue one should it be necessary. Such a declaration will enable the fishermen to qualify for disaster assistance. Many of us--whether we are from fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, or the gulf--have dealt with fisheries disasters in the past.  During the last drought in California, I had to literally stalk Secretary Gutierrez of the Bush administration to get a declaration. Joe Barton graciously had him come in to testify and put him in a side room and said, Wait a minute. There are a few Members of Congress who want to talk to you, and it was myself and a number of other Members from California, Oregon, who got him to sign a disaster declaration, and we were successful. Well, this time, let's put it on the desk now and give the Secretary that capability to easily declare a disaster.  While it is clear this drought will have wide-ranging economic impacts, this amendment will put Commerce Secretary Pritzker on notice that we have the potential to face a major economic hardship in the fishing industry as well.  This amendment will ensure that our fisheries and our fishing industries that depend upon salmon stocks from California rivers will be given due consideration as these impacts unfold.  I reserve the balance of my time.
