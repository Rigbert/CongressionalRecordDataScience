 President, I rise today to express my support for S. 248, a bill to amend the Helms-Biden agreement on United Nations arrears payments.  I have long supported the goals of the United Nations as it works to promote peace, to protect human rights, and to improve economic and social development throughout the world. Participation in the UN acts as an incentive to promote peace and provides a forum for negotiations and international action which can avert the need for more expensive unilateral or bilateral military interventions in the future.  I believe repaying United States arrears to the UN is crucial to ensure that the organization can continue to be a force for peace and security in the 21st Century.  As you know, significant steps have been undertaken in the last several years by the UN to reform their administrative structure and to reduce costs as called for by the Helms-Biden agreement. Among other things, the UN has reduced its budget and staffing levels, and has strengthened its Office of Internal Oversight.  In addition, the UN has agreed to reduce the US assessment for the UN regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent, and the peacekeeping assessment from more than 30 percent. I congratulate Senator Helms, Senator Biden, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, and Secretary-General Kofi Annan for their efforts and hard work on these issues.  It is my hope that the UN will continue in this direction and enact further reforms designed to save costs and to make the UN a more effective and efficient organization. This bill recognizes that efforts have been made and will continue to be made towards achieving this goal. I urge my colleagues to support it.
