 There are some writers who have pointed out that increasingly the media, the corporate media, is owned by fewer and fewer larger multinational corporations. It is of concern to me, for example, that NBC is owned by the General Electric Corp., a company which is a major manufacturer of military hardware, a company which has a very poor labor relations record, a company which for a period of time under the Reagan administration paid very, very, little in taxes. The Fox network is owned by the huge international media corporation run by Rupert Murdoch who runs and controls media in several countries around the world.  I think there is increasingly a danger not only in the United States but around the world that the people are getting their information from fewer and fewer people who will not tell people I think the truth, but will use their ownership of the media to protect their own private interests.  As the gentleman knows, there has been a lot of discussion about the November 8 election in which the Republican Party took control of both the House and the Senate, but what is not often I think pointed out enough is that in that election 62 percent of the American people did not bother to vote. And that all over this country we have tens and tens of millions of people, primarily working people and low-income people, who are feeling enormous pain these days; they often do not have health insurance, they are working for low wages, their kids are unable to afford to go to college. For the first time in the history of the modern United States their children will have a lower standard of living than they do, yet with all of these problems, people do not go out and vote, because, I think, to a large degree they have given up on the political system, they do not see politics and government as it is presently constituted as a mechanism for them to improve their lives. Is that something the gentleman observes in his district?
