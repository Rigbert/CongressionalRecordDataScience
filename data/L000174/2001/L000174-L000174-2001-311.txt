President, I am pleased to introduce, with Senators Hatch, Schumer, Specter, Clinton, and McCain, a bipartisan bill to name the Department of Justice building in honor of the late Robert F. Kennedy. I am also pleased to join the bipartisan efforts of Congressmen Roemer and Scarborough, who are introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives today.  Robert F. Kennedy was a man of great courage and conviction. Of his many accomplishments during his life, the one we honor today is his tenure as Attorney General of the United States. Appointed by his brother, President John F. Kennedy, on January 21, 1961, he served his country admirably in the office of Attorney General until September 3, 1964.  During his tenure as Attorney General, Robert Kennedy led the fight against injustice and championed civil rights for all Americans. He ordered United States Marshals to protect the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Alabama. He sent Federal troops to openthe doors for James Meredith to walk with dignity as the first African-American to attend the University of Mississippi. He pushed Congress to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to guarantee basic freedoms for all our citizens, regardless of race, religion or creed.  Robert F. Kennedy's commitment to justice for all echoed in his fond saying: ``Some men see things as they are and ask why; I dream of things that never were and ask why not.''  Attorney General Kennedy also was a determined prosecutor. His investigated organized crime throughout America and became the first attorney general to establish coordinated federal law programs for the prosecution of organized crime. From 1960 to 1963, Department of Justice convictions against organized crime rose 800 percent because of his efforts and dedication to bring organized crime figures to justice.  As Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy represented President Kennedy in foreign affairs and closely advised the President in times of trouble. Attorney General Kennedy's wise counsel during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of 1962, as well as secret negotiations with the Soviet Embassy, helped bring a peaceable end to the crisis.  The memory of Robert F. Kennedy lives on in the work of others who care as much for justice as he did. As Attorney General, Robert Kennedy wrote these words: ``What happens to the country, to the world, depends on what we do with what others have left us.'' It is in that spirit that we honor him today.  I am proud to led this bipartisan effort to name the Department of Justice Building after Robert F. Kennedy with the greatest respect, admiration and appreciation for his service to his country.                                 ______                                       By
