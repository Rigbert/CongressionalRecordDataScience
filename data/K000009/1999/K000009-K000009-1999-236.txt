Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the Obey amendment, and I want to really thank the gentleman for crafting a careful amendment that looked at every single detail of this bill.  Truly, others have dealt with the plutonium issues and with other aspects of the offsets, but in the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), he specifically targets the PL-480 program, and I really want to focus my remarks there in the time that I have.  I cannot believe that in the bill that the majority has given us, that they would attempt to take $30 million or any amount, actually, from the PL-480 program. Now what is that? That is a program that lifts commodities off our market and sends them around the world. To not fund this program at the level requested really, and that is inadequate from the administration standpoint simply because they know Congress will add funds to that account in view of the situation, if we choose to cut these dollars, we are basically saying there are no more hungry people in the world.                              {time}  1415  That is an absolutely ridiculous position. Not only that, but here at home the need, the need, to move commodities is simply profound.  What is happening in rural America is something that we have not seen in our adult lifetimes, with the levels of price drops, whether we are talking about the milk market, whether we are talking about hogs, whether we are talking about grain, or whether we are talking about cotton. I mean, go down the list. Rice, historic price drops. We know what has happened in the Asian markets, we know what has happened to our former market in Eastern Europe because of the collapse of the ruble, the situations all around the world which have hurt our export markets. But here at home, because of good weather, we have an enormous surplus which has driven prices to all-time lows.  People in my part of the country are burying animals. This seems so illogical in a time when our feeding kitchens are absolutely begging for food. This is one tool that we have, PL-480, to help lift some of America's surplus, our bounty, to share it with those in the world that many of our esteemed Members, like the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tony Hall), of my own State, and former Congressman Bill Emerson of Missouri, worked so hard to sensitize this Congress and the American people on the needs of the hungry around the world.  So I just find it incredible that this particular measure was inserted into this offset provision. And I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) for bringing it to the attention of not just this Congress but the American people and people of good heart everywhere.
