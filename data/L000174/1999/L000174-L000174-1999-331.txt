President, let's be clear where we are. My friend from New Jersey speaks of the trial of the dissidents. Many who have spoken on the floor were critical of that.  I sat 10 feet across the table from Fidel Castro and strongly and harshly criticized the trial of the dissidents. I went to visit each of their families and strongly and harshly criticized that trial and spoke also on the floor. With my reputation on free speech issues, I would be the last person to yield to anybody on the question of criticism of those who try cases against dissidents and those who spoke out against the Government.  I was very pleased to see our European allies speak out about it. But I note for the Record that while they spoke out on that, not one of those European allies that the Senator from New Jersey says now come over to our side--not one of those countries--has put limits on the travel of their people to Cuba as we have--not one.  The United States, the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, limits its population in traveling only to this country.  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey said quite correctly that we limited travel of our people to China. It might not make much difference in what they did. I suspect it made some, but probably not much. I say that it probably wouldn't make any more difference in that Government than it does in the Government of Cuba. But we see a huge market there, so we are not going to do that anyway.  I suggest that during the cold war the fact was that we encouraged travel to places like the Soviet Union and China, and we got a diversity of views. Our thoughts and our views were heard more and more, not as much as we would like but more and more.  The Holy Father spoke out, as did most of us in this body, about the trial of the dissidents. But I point out that the Holy Father has never withdrawn his very strong criticism of the United States.
