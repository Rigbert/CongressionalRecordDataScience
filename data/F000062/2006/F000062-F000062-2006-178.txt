 NCIRE was founded in 1988 to administer research at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. It is the largest of over 90 nonprofit research institutes associated with the VA. It is also designated as a Department of Defense Center of Excellence in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging for its work benefiting our more recent veterans, including gulf war illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, neurotrauma and closed-head injury resulting from combat.  The Neuroscience Center of Excellence is the VA's premier research instrument for neurodegenerative diseases and brings together VA and Defense resources to conduct medical research in the areas most important for our active military and veterans. Research in neuroimaging, neuropsychiatry and basic neuroscience is targeted at diagnosis, prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases, brain and spinal cord injuries, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder.  In the near future, NCIRE will be working to enhance high-resolution imaging strategies to predict and prevent combat-related damage to the brain and the nervous system, expand neuropsychiatric studies into PTSD, and understanding of vulnerabilities to PTSD and its effect on combat performance.  I would note that the House version of this bill provides $4 million for the Neuroscience Center of Excellence's research in neuroimaging and neuropsychiatric trauma in U.S. warfighters. I understand the chairman's concern about the growth of health research spending in this bill, but would point out that this facility is designated as a DoD Center of Excellence.  I look forward to working with Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye as we go to conference. It is my hope that we can work together to support this important funding provided in the House version of this bill.
