President, I offer this amendment along with Senators Corzine, Mikulski, Kerry, and Rockefeller. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.  It addresses the potential detrimental effect on the low-income housing tax credit by proposing to reduce or eliminate taxes on dividends. If those proposals with respect to dividends are passed, they could provide a disincentive for corporations to invest in the low-income tax credit, which is the major form of support for low-income and moderate-income housing, and rental housing in particular, in the United States.  I understand this amendment is acceptable to the other side. I urge its adoption.
