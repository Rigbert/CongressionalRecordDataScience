 President, I would like to pay tribute to a strong community leader, dedicated public servant, and advocate from the State of Washington, Barbara Geller.  I first met Barbara early in my political career and I would not be where I am today without her support and encouragement.  She was always willing to pitch in to do whatever was needed. Her strong commitment to her community showed in everything she did. She was a State committeewoman, chair of the 41st LD Democrats, and a delegate to the Democratic National Convention too many times to count.  But more importantly, she was a dedicated mother, grandmother, wife, and friend to many.  You could always count on Barb helping out. She never hesitated to pick up a phone, plan the Annual Eastside Democrats Annual Dinner, and to do every task in between. No matter how small the task, Barb would make it fun.  As a longtime Mercer Island resident, her kindness and grace inspired all who were around her.  Barb passed away on March 17, 2013, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 71.  Barb is survived by her husband Art, her two children, Randy and Betsy Geller, daughter-in-law Jennifer Hubbard Geller, and her two grandchildren, Rachel and Lucy Geller.  She will be missed by many, but her legacy of service will live on with all she has touched.  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to Barbara Geller. She lived a full life and our thoughts are with her loved ones at this time of great loss.                          ____________________
