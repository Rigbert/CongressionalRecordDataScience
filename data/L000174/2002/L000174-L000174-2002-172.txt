This was the first opening of a Court of Appeals seat from the Western District of Pennsylvania.  When I look at this, I look at the way he misled us in his initial description of the club that he belonged to and then further misled us in his intention. Frankly, I cannot support him. Every Senator can vote how they want. I cannot vote for him.
