President, I agree with the Senator from Nevada. In response, I would say, the reason why the Senate does not talk about education is because the President's education bill, No Child Left Behind, has been underfunded by $20 billion. We put Federal mandates on school districts that cost them enormous sums of money, which changed the way teachers teach in a classroom.  This administration--the President and his followers in Congress--has refused to send the money to help kids who are not scoring well on tests, kids who need someone to sit next to them and help them read, someone to help them understand basic math, someone to be there after school to sit down and work with them on their homework, someone to be with them in the summer months so they can do something and not lose all the knowledge they gained in the previous school year.  It takes people--dedicated men and women--who are teachers. It takes money. This administration says the money should go for tax cuts for wealthy people; it should not go for education. We should continue to spend $1.5 billion a week in Iraq, with no end in sight. That is why we don't talk about education.  This administration will not budget the money to pay for the Federal mandates the President included in No Child Left Behind. Ask any school district--in Nevada, Illinois, across America--what do you think of No Child Left Behind? We like accountability, but where is the promised money the President said would come to the school district to help us improve test scores? It is not there. That is why this do-nothing Congress avoids the issue of education, like the issue of helping families and businesses pay for health insurance.
