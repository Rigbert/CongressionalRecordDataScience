Madam Speaker, let me conclude with just a couple of comments.  First of all, I think most people need to realize who Margaret Sanger really was. And I've read her books; I've read her writings. She wrote in a book called ``The Pivot of Civilization'' that ``we are paying for,'' and I quote her, ``and even submitting to the dictates of an ever-increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who should never have been born at all.'' In chapter five, she has a chapter called the ``Cruelty of Charity'' and takes to task those who would provide maternal health care and outreach to those women, poor women especially, in her writings. And I will put them in the Record. She says that ``such benevolence is not merely superficial and near-sighted, it conceals a stupid charity.'' To her, these babies and these mothers should have never been born.  Let me conclude, Madam Speaker, abortion mills don't nurture, they don't heal, they don't cure disease. Abortion is violence against children. Some abortion methods dismember and rip apart, the fragile bodies of children. Other methods chemically poison children. Abortion has turned children's bodies into burned corpses, a direct result of the caustic effect of poisoning. Consider a dismemberment abortion, this is called the D abortion. It is used later term, at least from the 20th week or so onward. These children, Madam Speaker, feel pain.  My colleagues will remember that last Congress we brought forward a bill called the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act which would at least inform the woman that a child at this age feels excruciating pain. Sadly, the abortion lobby, including Planned Parenthood, lobbied vigorously against informing women that these children feel such excruciating pain, sometimes as much as four times that which would be felt by a newborn or a child later in his or her life.  We need to, again, Madam Speaker, respect all human life. In the life of an unborn child, birth is just part of a process. It's an event in a child's life; it is not the beginning of life. These children deserve their fundamental human rights.                          ____________________
