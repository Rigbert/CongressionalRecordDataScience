Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our Nation's and California's eminent civic leaders and authority on water law. On May 27th, Arthur L. Littleworth was presented with the Frank Miller Civic Achievement Award for his contributions to the community. This annual award, given by the Mission Inn Foundation in Riverside, California, is a small step towards recognizing the enormous contributions by Art for his community, state and Nation.  Art Littleworth has always done the work of four men. His civic and professional engagements cannot help but serve as model to us all and include: senior partner at the law firm Best Best & Krieger, respected expert in water law, former board president of the Riverside Unified School District--playing a leading role in steering the district into voluntary integration of the schools in the mid-1960s, member of the task force that examined Riverside Police Department's use-of-force rules after the 1998 Tyisha Miller shooting, and first board president of the foundation that is honoring him. A dedicated leader, Art has willingly and unselfishly given of his time and talent to make our community and Nation a better place to live and work.  Born and raised in Los Angeles, Art went to Yale University on a full scholarship earning a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in American History. He later entered the U.S. Navy and saw battle in the Pacific during the final months of World War II. Returning home he proceeded to earn a Masters in American History from Stanford University and J.D. from Yale Law School in 1950. That same year he joined Best Best & Krieger.  Art soon found himself representing a local group of ranchers in a federal case regarding Santa Margarita River water in 1958. The case would be in court for five years and have Art emerge as an expert on water law. His expertise grew to a point that the United States Supreme Court appointed him ``Special Master,'' in 1987, in a water rights case between the States of Kansas and Colorado involving the Arkansas River. The Supreme Court unanimously approved his first major finding in this case which became precedent setting in determining damages and awarding prejudgment interest approved by Court, 533 U.S. 1. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear his most recent ruling in this case this fall.  On the hometown front, Art's reputation also continued to grow as he served on the Riverside Unified School Board from 1958 to 1972, the last 10 years as its president. As president, Art Littleworth played a leading role in overseeing the voluntary desegregation of the district's elementary and middle schools. The feat made Riverside Unified School District the first large school district in the Nation to voluntarily integrate its white and black school children populations and brought the community together as one.  In 1976, Art took the helm as founding President of the Mission Inn Foundation to help the City of Riverside take over the bankrupt hotel and revive it to its historical beauty. The foundation was able to improve the hotel to the point where it was able to be sold to a hotel developer a few years later. It now stands as a testament to the City of Riverside's progress and growth as a city.  Mr. Speaker, Art's tireless passion for water law and vital social issues has and will continue to contribute immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, the state of California and our Nation. I know that many community and national leaders are grateful for his service and salute him for his acceptance of the Frank Miller Civic Achievement Award--a fitting token of our appreciation and esteem.                          ____________________
