I thank the gentleman for that good advice.  I would just say to the gentleman this is the type of insertion in a bill that breaks down camaraderie, and the proposal that I want to debate on this floor had bipartisan support in the committee. It is a program that has been operating since 1988.  We are being denied that opportunity, and you are being given special privilege. I really think it is wrong of the Committee on Rules.
