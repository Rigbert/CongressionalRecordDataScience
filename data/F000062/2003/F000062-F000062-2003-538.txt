 President. I rise to reintroduce, along with Senator Judd Gregg, the Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act. This is critical legislation, especially in light of the increasing number of cases of identity theft.  In fact, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, this week announced that identity theft is the Nation's top consumer fraud complaint for the third consecutive year.  Last year, this legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Finance Committee was set to vote on it as well, but it got entangled in an unrelated, amendment.  It is my hope that Congress will approve this legislation this year, so that we can begin to protect one of the most fundamental rights of all Americans.  I believe all Americans should have the right to: control how their personal identifying information is used. Keep their Social Security number out of the public domain. Limit disclosure by public agencies of personal information; and I also believe that Americans have the right to expect that businesses and government agencies willprotect your personal information held within their databases.  Lately, however, these rights have been seriously compromised by thieves who are stealing American's identity's in record numbers.  Just in the last year, identity theft cases have doubled nationwide. American consumers filed approximately 163,000 identity theft complaints with the FTC in 2002. Fully 43 percent of all the complaints the FTC receives are about identity theft.  My own State, California, has more victims than any other State. The FTC recorded 30,738 identity theft cases last year from California consumers alone.  Senator Gregg and I are reintroducing our Social Security number protection bill because Social Security numbers are the keys thieves use to unlock and take over a person's identity.  Identity thieves use Social Security numbers to: fraudulently obtain credit cards, access existing financial accounts, commit bank fraud, falsely obtain employment and government benefits; and create additional false identification documents, such as drivers' licenses.  Sally Twentyman, for instance, had her identity stolen when a thief rifled through her mail and stole credit card renewal forms.  The thief used her name and Social Security number to make $13,000 in cash advances and to open two additional credit card accounts in her name.  Not surprisingly, reports of Social Security number misuse have risen lockstep with the growth in identity theft.  Allegations of Social Security number fraud have increased by 600 percent over the past several years from 11,000 in 1998 to 73,000 in 2003.  Social Security Number Prevention Act:  The goal of this legislation is straightforward, to get Social Security numbers out of the public domain so that identity thieves can't access the number.  First, this bill prohibits anyone from selling or displaying an individual's Social Security number to the general public without the individual's consent, but does permit legitimate business-to-business and business-to-government uses of the number.  This practice occurs today. A stranger or stalker can buy your Social Security number off the Internet for a few dollars.  In one troubling case, Christopher Jones, a twenty-five-year old employee at the University of North Carolina-Pembroke, stole approximately 3,000 Social Security numbers through his job handing out towels and other equipment at the university gym.  In order to get equipment from Mr. Jones, students had to give him their Social Security numbers. Jones mined these numbers over several months and advertised the Social Security numbers for sale on eBay with an opening bid of $1.00 per number for a block of 1,000 numbers.  One advertisement, for example, read ``100 (one hundred social Security # Numbers Obtain False Credit Cards Idenity Theft I Don't Care Bid Starts at a Dollar a Piece USPS Money Orders only all Different.''  Second, this legislation gives consumers the right to refuse to give out their Social Security numbers to companies that don't really need it.  Companies, however, can still require Social Security numbers for purposes under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, for background checks, if required by law, or if the number is necessary to verify identity or prevent fraud.  Third, this legislation curbs the public display of Social Security numbers on government documents. Specifically, the bill removes Social Security numbers from government checks and driver's licenses.  In addition, the bill prohibits governments entities from displaying Social Security numbers on public records that are posted on the Internet or in electronic media after the effective date of the act.  I don't believe a complete stranger should not be able to get access to my Social Security number from my birth certificate or marriage license, especially just by logging onto the Internet!  Finally, this legislation creates new penalties targeting the misuse of Social Security numbers. Specifically, the bill gives the Social Security Administration the authority to issue civil penalties of up to $5,000 for people who misuse Social Security numbers.  The bill also creates a maximum five year prison sentence for anyone who obtains another person's Social Security number for purpose of locating or identifying that individual with the intent to physically harm that person.  This legislation is fundamental to protecting the identities of American citizens.  I look forward to working with Senator Gregg to secure its passage this year, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 228       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Social      Security Number Misuse Prevention Act''.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social      security numbers has contributed to a growing range of      illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in      some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers,      and other entities have often used social security numbers to      confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to      the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used      to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of      individual privacy.       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every      individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a      social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for      social security benefits, or to seek employment. An      unintended consequence of these requirements is that social      security numbers have become one of the tools that can be      used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy      of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because      the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and      because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to      exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate      for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of      social security numbers.       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security      numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale,      or purchase would not affect public debate.       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or      purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that      create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or      financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are      assigned.       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that      has been assigned a social security number some degree of      protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that      number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful      conduct.
