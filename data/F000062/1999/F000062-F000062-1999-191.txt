 President, today I am introducing legislation to help teachers use technology in their teaching, the Teacher Technology Training Act of 1999.  This bill has three major provisions:  It authorizes $500 million for state education departments to award grants to local public school districts on the basis of need to train teachers in how to use technology in the classroom.  It specifies that grants may be used to strengthen instruction and learning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of teacher training in using technology in the classroom.  It requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate the technology training programs for teachers developed by school districts within three years.  I am introducing this bill because teachers say they need to learn how to use computers and other technology in their teaching. In a 1998 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, only 20 percent of teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' to integrate educational technology into instruction.  Furthermore, the training that does exist for these teachers is inadequate. In the same Department of Education survey, among full-time, public school teachers, 78 percent said they had participated in professional development programs on using educational technology in their instruction, but only 23 percent of those teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' in this area. Of the teachers who report having received some training, 40 percent felt that it had improved their classroom teaching only ``somewhat'' or ``not at all.'' This is unacceptable. What we see now is that in many schools the students know more about how to use computers than the teachers do. In one Kentucky school profiled by Inside Technology Training magazine, the students run the school's computer systems. The article quoted the school district's technology coordinator as saying that the students had ``long surpassed'' what the teachers could do andreported that one student had recently trained twenty teachers on software for Web page construction (``Fast Times at Kentucky High,'' Inside Technology Training, June 1998).  I see this problem in my own state. A report by the Los Angeles County Office of Education in 1996 found that in Los Angeles County, nearly half of the teachers had no experience with computers or had only limited familiarity with word processing software. According to a 1998 report by the California Teachers Association, teachers in California rank training in the use of new technology fourth among eighteen changes they believe could most improve public education. Forty-five percent of the teachers surveyed said more technology training would greatly improve conditions for teaching and learning (CTA for the Next Century, 1998).  It is crucial that we given students the opportunity to become familiar with technology in their classrooms because post-high school education and most good jobs require experience using computers. U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has said, ``Opportunities are now dependent upon a person's ability to use computers and engage in using the Internet'' (CQ Weekly, ``Digital Haves and Have Nots,'' April 17, 1999). In my state, a 1997 Rand report found that there is currently a shift in the state's economy away from manufacturing and toward higher-skill service and technology industries, and employers are placing a higher premium on the computer skills necessary for these positions (Immigration in a Changing Economy, Rand, 1997). Students are better educated when their teachers are well trained. We cannot prepare students for the increasingly technological workplace without trained teachers.  We have made great efforts to make technology available to students in their classrooms, and now we have a national student to computer ratio of 10 to 1. Seventy-eight percent of our nation's schools have Internet access. These are good first steps.  But also essential is having teachers and students use all this technology in their day-to-day classroom activities when it can enhance learning. This will not happen until teachers are trained in how to include technology in their instruciton.  One teacher expressed her frustration in an article in the National School Boards Association's Electronic School magazine:       Most teachers have no model to show them the advantages of      hooking up to the projects available on the Internet. And      shrinking school budgets don't provide nearly enough money to      train teachers in new or visionary techniques. Meanwhile, we      can't escape the magazine and newspaper articles touting the      Information Superhighway and heralding new ways of responding      to, using, and learning information in our society. Well, who      most needs to learn to traverse this road successfully?      Society future leaders--and their teachers (Electronic      School, ``Going Global,'' February 1995).I agree.  Our teachers are not prepared to use technology in their classrooms. Students need to learn to use modern technology and it can help them learn. If we are expecting teachers to use up-to-date methods and tools, we must train them to do so. This bill will provide some of the funds needed to do that.  By introducing this bill I am not suggesting that technology is a cure-all for the problems in our schools. Technology is one of many teaching and learning tools. It can bring some efficiencies to learning, for example, providing a new way to do math and spelling drills or keeping students engaged in learning while a teacher works with other students who need extra help. It can also be an important research tool by providing easy access to information that, without a computer, is not easily available.  We expect a great deal from our teachers and students. We must give them the resources they need. This bill is one step.                          ____________________
