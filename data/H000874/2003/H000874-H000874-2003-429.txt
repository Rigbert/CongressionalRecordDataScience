 Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, I do want to repeat that it is very possible that we could have votes on Friday and we intend to pass the War Supplemental Conference Report and send it to the President before we break for the break. And if things get a little difficult, we could actually be here through the weekend.
