 President, as the Senate gets ready to update our Nation's Federal education policy, I want to talk this morning about the importance of the education debate, some of the issues that we all agree on, the principles that guide my decision, and a few concerns I have as we look at this bill coming before us.  Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has defined how the Federal Government helps students across the country. In America, we believe that no matter where you are born, no matter who you are or where you come from, and no matter whether your parents are rich or poor, every child deserves an equal chance to succeed.  This law, the ESEA, puts that principle into practice. Forty years ago, many students did not get the help that they needed. Many lived in poor or rural areas that didn't have the tax base to support them. Many were discriminated against and many were left behind because they had special needs.  In 1965, Congress passed the historic Elementary and Secondary Education Act to fix those problems, providing a safety net for disadvantaged students, a stepping stone to help all students succeed, and a way to help us meet our education goals.  During the Cold War, ESEA helped us focus on building skills in math and science. Today, with our high-tech economy, ESEA is helping students learn to use technology. As we update this law, we are not just changing letters on a page; we are changing the law that helps make our schools more equal, more fair, and more successful for students across the country. I take this responsibility very seriously.
