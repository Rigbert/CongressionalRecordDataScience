  For the information of all Senators, we have worked through a lot of amendments, and I appreciate everybody's hard work. I am about to ask for unanimous consent that will lock in the next 16 amendments, which will take us well past midnight. I suggest that any Senator who is going to need a vote and wants to keep the Senate later talk to either Senator Sessions or myself very soon.Amendments Nos. 693, 307, 198, 697, 482, 263, 314, 247, 606, 689, 537,                   535, 442, 514, 273, and 373 en bloc
