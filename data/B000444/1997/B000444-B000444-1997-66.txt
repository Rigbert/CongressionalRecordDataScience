 President, I rise today in support of delaying a World Bank loan to Croatia until that country fully meets the obligations it agreed to when it signed the Dayton Accords in November 1995.  Two days ago, the Clinton administration announced that it would attempt to block a $30 million World Bank loan to Croatia until Zagreb extradites Croats indicted on war crimes charges and allows Serbian refugees to return to their homes in Croatian territory.  It appears that we may have difficulty in persuading other countries on the World Bank's board to go along with this postponement, but I believe that the United States should stick to its principles.  Mr. President, the horrifying wars that took place in Bosnia and Croatia from 1991 to 1995 had many and complex causes. One of them was the thinly disguised desire of Serbian President Milosevic and Croatian President Tudjman to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina. The revolt and temporary secession from Croatia by the Krajina Serbs--who themselves were led by extremely unsavory individuals who also carried out atrocities--interrupted the planned cooperation of the two rapacious strongmen in Belgrade and Zagreb.  There is also no doubt, Mr. President, that the Croatian army--trained by private Americans--played a valuable role in turning the tide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the summer and fall of 1995 as part of its successful campaign to oust the Krajina Serbs from Croatia.  But, Mr. President, the behavior of President Tudjman since then has been deplorable. He has knowingly coddled indicted war criminals, despite his obligation under Dayton to turn them over to the International Tribunal at The Hague. On numerous other occasions, I have spoken out in this Chamber against the atrocities--murder, rape, and vile ``ethnic cleansing''--that were perpetrated against innocent civilians in Bosnia.  Most expert observers believe that Bosnian Serbs were responsible for the majority of these heinous acts. But several Bosnian Croats and some Croats from Croatia apparently were among the sadists, as were a few Muslims. That President Tudjman refuses to hand over the indicted who are living in Croatia is an affront to civilized people everywhere, and a direct slap in the face of the United States, which brokered the Dayton Accords.  Moreover, despite pretty rhetoric and laws on the books, Tudjman has thrown up practical roadblocks to the resettlement of ethnic Serb refugees, preferring instead to govern a Croatia that is now much more ethnically homogeneous. I should add, Mr. President, that ethnic Croats who were displaced by Serbs earlier in this decade should also be allowed to return to their homes. Our goal is a peaceful, multi-ethnic, democratic Croatia.  In Herzegovina, President Tudjman continues to rule through thuggish ethnic Croatian proxies headquartered in Mostar. These lawless types have refused all international attempts to integrate Mostar and have resorted to deadly violence against Muslims.  In addition, despite their Bosnian citizenship, the Croats of Herzegovina were allowed to vote in Croatia's national elections earlier this month, providing much of the support by which Tudjman was re-elected in a campaign distinguished by his nearly one-sided access to the media and violence against opposition candidates.  Mr. President, I firmly believe that Croatia will some day re-enter the Western European community to which it alleges it belongs. But Croatia cannot even think of becoming a member of Western institutions like the European Union or NATO until it lives up to its moral and legal commitments.  Postponing the World Bank loan to Croatia would serve as a useful warning to President Tudjman that he cannot escape the consequences of his authoritarian and duplicitous behavior.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.                          ____________________
