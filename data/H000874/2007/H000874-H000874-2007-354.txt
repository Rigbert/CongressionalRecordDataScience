SHAYS asked me informally when we are getting out. We are working on a unanimous consent agreement between the minority and the majority on the MILCON bill, and that will hopefully facilitate us getting out. I will tell you the minority and majority both believe it ought to be relatively brief, as the MILCON bill has been in the past.                          ____________________
