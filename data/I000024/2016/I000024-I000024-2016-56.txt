President, first of all, being one of the managers of the bill, the WRDA bill that we are all anxious to consider, along with Senator Boxer--she and I as well as the leadership, are in agreement, that we should take this bill and consider it. I do have a talk I want to give concerning the bill but with the understanding that I have been asking for amendments to come forward from the Republicans primarily. She has done the same with Democrats. I believe there are a number of amendments that have come forward. However, the way we are going to run this is that any amendments that are going to be considered, No. 1, must be germane and, No. 2, have to be acceptable by both managers of the bill--Senator Boxer and myself.  With that, I ask that we move forward on this bill and yield to the leadership.
