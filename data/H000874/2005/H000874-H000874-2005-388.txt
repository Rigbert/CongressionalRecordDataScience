Leader, would it be fair to say that that decision would be made prior to the close of business on Monday so that we would have some notice of that in time to fairly consider it?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We will try our best, in consultation with you, to give you some idea of when we could possibly bring that bill, and if it is going to be considered next week and we can fit into the schedule, then certainly we would let you know by probably the end of business Monday.                              {time}  1230
