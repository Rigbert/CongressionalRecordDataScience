Speaker, I thank the leader for the information.  If I might start with perhaps a general question, I noted in the paper that the leader indicated that he thought we would probably be here through at least the week before Thanksgiving, which is what I related to my Members in the whip's meeting this morning; but I wonder perhaps if he could amplify that. The gentleman has had a few days to discuss it with the leadership and with the administration and perhaps the Senate leadership to have some better idea of where we might be going. Obviously, with Katrina and other challenges, I know it is very flexible, but I appreciate and I know the Members would appreciate getting my colleague's further thought on where he sees the possibilities for the balance of the session.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate the question because if we look at all the work that we need to do, we could probably get finished earlier.                              {time}  1630  As the gentleman knows, we are sort of at the mercy of the schedule of the Senate. Conversing with the Senate and looking at our schedules, particularly as the gentleman has mentioned, Katrina has risen to the top priority of this House. It has pushed other issues back a week or two.  We still have to get our appropriation process done. There is the entitlement reform process that needs to be done. There are some other issues we would like to get done. And, at the same time, there are not just short-term issues dealing with Hurricane Katrina, but there are intermediate issues we will have to be dealing with, major policy considerations, and who knows what else the hurricane may give us. And trying to put all that together and on a calendar, it is pretty obvious to me that we will be here until at least, at least, the Friday before Thanksgiving.
