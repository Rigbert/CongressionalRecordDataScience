We won't be here on that particular date, or week, and therefore, we might have to make accommodations for that.  There are other things, obviously, that we have talked about that we are having concerns about: creating jobs, providing for jobs in our economy. We're doing a lot of investing in, some would say ``bailing out'' companies that had a whole lot of assets, but now we have people who don't have a whole lot of assets, have lost their home and who are facing heating bills that are spiking up very seriously, facing a tough time buying groceries because grocery prices have spiked, and they may be out of a job.  There are a number of issues that we are concerned about. We have been faced with Lehman Brothers and AIGand Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But there are a lot of little people who are having equal problems for them, and we want to make sure that we address them, and I know you do as well.
