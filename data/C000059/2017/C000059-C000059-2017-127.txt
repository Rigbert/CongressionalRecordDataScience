Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Lianne Dennstedt, who passed away in Flagstaff, Arizona on Monday, September 18, 2017. Lianne was the eldest daughter of Brenda Dennstedt, Vice President of the Western Municipal Water District Board of Directors, and Shawn Dennstedt, a 24-year veteran of the San Diego County Sheriffs Department, as well as the older sister of Jaimee Dennstedt. She will be greatly missed.   Lianne attended Murrieta Valley High School in Murrieta, California, where she was a decorated cross country runner in addition to being an excellent student. Following her graduation in 2016 with a full International Baccalaureate diploma, she decided to attend Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona, due to its high scholastic standards. In her freshman year at NAU, Lianne selected Environmental Science as her major and made the Dean's List both semesters.   Just a few weeks ago, Lianne had just begun her sophomore year at NAU when she became ill with a severe sore throat. A week later, she was admitted to the hospital with meningitis, double pneumonia and renal failure. Despite her strength, the unwavering support of her family and dedicated actions by her medical team, Lianne lost her battle with this aggressive illness. I join the Dennstedt family in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to the doctors, nursing staff and team of medical specialists at Flagstaff Medical Center for their heroic efforts, kindness and compassion during this incredibly difficult time.   I had the distinct privilege of knowing Lianne and her family for many years, and there are simply no words that soften the heartbreaking loss of Lianne's loving and bright spirit. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Dennstedt family and her friends. Although Lianne may be gone, I know that the joy and happiness she brought to those around her will endure forever.                          ____________________
