Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, we are exporting more than 60 percent of the oil that we produce every day either as refined or even as crude product. In this case, Canadian oil, exempt from a tax, will flowthrough the United States to a refinery.  It will be processed and exported overseas. Somehow, that is going to lower prices further at the pump. Somehow, that is going to lead to American energy security.  You have to blow the dust off those arguments. They are a little dated, so we have raised a number of concerns here today.  Minimally--minimally--the Republicans should require this Canadian corporation to pay the same tax that most U.S. corporations pay when they transport products through pipelines and not put American taxpayers at risk.  I yield back the balance of my time.
