 President, I have the opening script that the majority leader would usually give. I will do it in his stead.  The Senate will begin debate in relation to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2, the jobs and economic growth bill. Under the previous order, the Senate will vote on the adoption of the conference report at 9:30 a.m.  Following the disposition of the conference report, the Senate will consider H.J. 51, the debt limit extension legislation. Amendments to the measure are expected throughout the day. Therefore, rollcall votes will occur into the afternoon. If Members show restraint in the number of amendments offered, the Senate could complete action on this necessary measure early in the afternoon.  Following completion of the debt limit extension, the Senate will take up the unemployment insurance extension.                          ____________________
