 President, I am introducing legislation today that reforms and improves the regulation of lobbying and raises congressional ethics standards.  There is a perception in America that members of Congress care less about the public interest and more about advancing their own personal and financial interests. We need to make fundamental changes in how we permit lobbyists to influence legislation, hearings, appropriations, and our general oversight of the Executive Branch.  The Democratic leadership bill to reform lobbying rules, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which I am cosponsoring, contains sensible enough reforms.  Rather than standing pat, the measure I am introducing today is tougher medicine. I believe it will go a long way to changing the view of constituents that Congress is corrupt and ethically challenged.  The measure: institutes a Congress-wide two year ban on Senators, House members and their staffs lobbying Capitol Hill; takes a zero tolerance approach to lobbyist offered sports and entertainment tickets and meals; prohibits any lobbyist sponsored, or paid for, travel; and eliminates the option of registered lobbyists working in any capacity for a Senator's or House Member's election campaigns or fundraising operations.  A New York Times poll this past Friday sums up, in stark terms, public perceptions of Congress.  When asked ``Do you think that recent reports that lobbyists may have bribed members of Congress are isolated incidents or is this the way things work in Congress'', 77 percent of the respondents said bribing is the ``way things work'' in Congress. The survey indicates a 61 percent disapproval rating of Congress as well.  One poll participant, Mr. Donald Pertius from Arkansas, commented that ``It seems like the integrity of Congress Members in the last few years has just gone to pot.''  A key step, that will go a long way to clearing up the perception that individuals leaving the Hill immediately trade on their contacts and friendships, is a two year Congress-wide ban on lobbying for Members and staff once they leave their jobs.  Members and staff make a beeline for K Street when they leave the Hill. According to the New York Times, 50 percent of the 36 Senators retired since 1998 and 40 percent of the 162 House Members have signed up as lobbyists.  The Democratic leadership bill, and from what I understand the Republican measure being drafted, restricts staff from lobbying their former offices. That is good but we need to go further.  We need to change the minds of people across America that working in the Senate or House is about a commitment to public service--not a revolving door to cashing in as a private sector lobbyist.  On another front, numerous Senate and House campaigns have registered lobbyists as Treasurers for Members' PACs and in other key finance roles. It's another backdoor way for a lobbyist to insinuate his or her way into a politician's inner circle.  Published reports confirm that 71 lawmakers now list lobbyists as treasurers to their PACs or their campaign committees, nearly a fivefold increase since 1998. We need to make a clean break from this kind of collaboration that's fast on the rise.  The legislation I am introducing prohibits the formation of any political committee by a politician if a person registered as a lobbyist is formally affiliated with such an entity. Alex Knott at the Center for Public Integrity stated in the Wall Street Journal last week that ``By putting a lobbyist in charge of your political operations, you are conflicted from the start.'' He's absolutely correct.  Senators, House Members, their staffs and lobbyists alike ought to brace themselves for major change. The old rules and regulations that govern Washington are due for overhaul, and I believe that the two comprehensive leadership bills will represent a good start to that process. I hope my colleagues are receptive to even more stringent efforts, in the form of this legislation I am introducing today, and look forward to the full Senate debate on this issue in the coming months.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2233       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TWO-YEAR TOTAL BAN ON LOBBYING BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS                    AND EMPLOYEES OF CONGRESS.
