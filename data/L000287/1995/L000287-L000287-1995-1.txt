Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the Gingrich Christmas, Republicans are giving American children an early Christmas surprise.  During this season, the season of giving, the Republicans have instead taken--taken from our Nation's poor children. They are stealing the hopes and dreams of millions of children who have little else.  The Republican plan puts a million and a half children into poverty. It takes from school lunches and child care. Poor children are no longer guaranteed basic health care.  The Republican proposal destroys the safety net that protects our Nation's children. It is an extreme, mean-spirited and radical proposal--devoid of compassion and feeling.  As your children open their presents Monday morning--as we join our families in love and fellowship--take a moment to remember the children who will do without, the children that this plan will make do with even less.  Merry Christmas--Mr. Speaker.
