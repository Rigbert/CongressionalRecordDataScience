President, let me wholeheartedly agree with the Senator from Oklahoma on Mike Pompeo, as well as the comments he has made about  Jim Bridenstine.                Anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing  I would like to deviate just a little bit, though, and remind people that this is April 19, the anniversary of what could be characterized as the greatest domestic terrorist attack in history. It was in our State of Oklahoma at the Alfred P. Murrah office building, and 168 people were killed--many of those were very close personal friends of mine--and 850 others were wounded. I remember so well being there at the time.  Second Corinthians reminds us not to lose heart in times of struggle and tragedy. Instead, through our inherent strength and selflessness, Oklahomans united together to support our neighbors and rebuild our city--``Oklahoma Standard.''  Today, we remember the victims, thank the first responders, and continue to pray for Oklahoma and the families and friends who lost loved ones.  I agree wholeheartedly with the comments that have been made about  Jim Bridenstine. I was on the committee that went through his confirmation. I have never heard so many things. The one thing they all had in common was that none of them knew  Jim Bridenstine. My colleague talked about a smear campaign. I have never seen a smear campaign like that. I have never seen so much hatred, and for no reason at all. The two of us know  Jim Bridenstine well. In fact, he holds the 1st Congressional District seat in the State of Oklahoma. That was my seat. I held that seat for 8 years. Of course, I have gotten to know him very well since that time, and the things that have been said about him--again, the one thing they have in common is they just don't know him and didn't want to know him.  So we will have an Administrator who I think is going to do a good job.  The best thing I can do now, because I think Senator Lankford said it better than I could, is just mention two quotes, one of which is from the 2015 SpaceNews. They named him as one of five space leaders making a difference.  Mention was made of Buzz Aldrin. There is no one who is better known in that community than Buzz Aldrin. So I want to use his statement. This is Buzz Aldrin speaking:       We heartedly support the president's nomination of Mr.      Bridenstine as the next NASA administrator, wish him Godspeed      during the Senate confirmation process. We encourage you to      join us in uniting the space community and our nation behind      this nominee so NASA can return to its job of boldly      exploring the final frontier.  I couldn't have said it better than that.  So I leave my colleagues with that recommendation from Buzz Aldrin, and I look forward to his confirmation and the vote today.  I yield the floor.
