The ranking member, Mr. Dicks, has eloquently pointed out why we are opposing this amendment. But like Mr. Dicks and like Mr. Poe, the author of the amendment, I couldn't agree more. If this language included the word Pakistan, I would probably have to have a different attitude on this amendment because I share those concerns and I share them strongly. However, I understand the importance of our coalition and the coalition support fund that we have agreed to and the importance of maintaining that agreement.  But I would say that someone at a higher level who deals diplomatically with other countries, including Pakistan, has dropped the ball somewhere. I agree with Mr. Poe, but I just don't think that we can be in a position where we can renege on our agreements and arrangements with our coalition partners, because they are very important to us and to the missions that we face.  So as reluctant as I might be because I share Mr. Poe's thoughts, I also will oppose this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
