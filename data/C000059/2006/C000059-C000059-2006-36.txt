Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding and professional effort of the staff working in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Printing and Design Office for their high quality work, and contribution to NASA's overall mission. Throughout the course of a legislative cycle, NASA officials meet with Members of Congress and their staff via meetings, briefings and Congressional Hearings. The effectiveness of these interactions is directly attributed to the quality of the products developed by the staff of NASA's Printing and Design Office. Under the outstanding leadership and commitment of the Printing and Design staff, the Agency has been prepared and able to present professional briefing charts, Congressional testimony, posters and publications to the United States Congress in an exemplary manner.  The staff includes: the Head of Printing and Design Office, Michael Crnkovic; the Printing Officer, Stanley Artis; the Printing Specialist, Jeffrey McLean; the Customer Service personnel, Frantz Casmir; the Duplication Specialists, Carl Hammond and Ondray Mackin; and, the Distribution Clerk, Carl Paul. In addition, the competent, professional and expert Exhibit Design Team, consisting of Michael Barnes, Ray Brown and Steve Schaeberle, has enabled NASA to present montages depicting various Space Shuttle missions to Members of Congress that are proudly displayed and observed by all who visit these Members' offices.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing NASA's Printing and Design Team for its role in presenting the Vision for Space Exploration.                          ____________________
