Those jobs are gone. Add those to Fruit of the Loom 2 weeks ago. I mentioned yesterday that even Hershey's kisses in Pennsylvania has decided to make its giant kisses in Guadalajara, Mexico, so it is a giant kiss of death to all the Hershey workers in Pennsylvania who will no longer be employed, and all the dairy farmers who supply the milk into that plant and so forth.  But it is a massive hit on workers' pension funds, and I would be proud to serve here during a day when we talk not just about changing capital gains, but helping worker gains and helping our workers benefit from their hard labor across this country so they can have a more secure economic future, but that $40 billion is a gigantic amount, double what we experienced back in the 1980's, and we all remember what happened then.
