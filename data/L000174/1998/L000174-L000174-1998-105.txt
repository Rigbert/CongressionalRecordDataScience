President, I have been working diligently along with Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin, and Lieberman to get this measure considered and passed by the Senate. It an important measure to America's future.  Along with all the Democratic cosponsors of the bill, I signed on to offering our patent bill as an amendment to this bankruptcy bill. I helped provide an opportunity for this amendment in the unanimous consent agreement accepted by the Senate on Friday September, 11th. It is long past time for the Senate to consider this patent reform legislation.  Unfortunately, Republican opposition to the bill has prevented Senate consideration for more than a year. This is another example of how secret, anonymous holds on the Republican side are preventing important legislation from being considered by the Senate. I deeply regret that those same Republican objections have now succeeded in preventing our Republican cosponsor, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, from even offering this amendment to the bill in the amendment spot that we had reserved for that purpose. I believe that there is strong support for this measure. I cannot guarantee that all 45 Democratic Senators will vote for it, but I do know that no Democrat has prevented or is now preventing its consideration.  I want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their unflagging support of effective patent reform. Our patent bill would be good for Vermont, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good for America. Unfortunately, the Republican majority or some secret minority of that Republican majority will not allow patent reform to proceed.                      Overview of the Patent Bill  The Patent Bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. It would: reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions.  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill be one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like IBM. So I talked to independent inventors and representatives of smaller companies to see what reforms they recommended. I have tried to make sure that their recommendations were incorporated into the Patent Bill as the legislation has advanced through Congress.                          legislative history  The reforms that would be implemented with the passage of this legislation have been subject to careful and deliberate consideration by Congress. In fact, over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional hearings with over 80 witnesses testifying about the various proposals incorporated in the Patent Bill.  Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported these reforms. Last year, five former Patent Commissioners sent a letter to the President and to the members of the Senate supporting the Patent Bill.  In addition to the thorough consideration that has been given these reforms over the years, the Senate has given close scrutiny this Congress to the bill before us today. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this legislation on May 7, 1997. The Committee heard testimony of Senator Frank Lautenberg, Representative Henry Hyde; Representative Howard Coble; Representative Dana Rohrabacher; Representative Marcy Kaptur; the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks; the Executive Director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association; the Vice President of the International Trademark Association; the President and CEO of a small business in Utah; and Bill Parker, President of the Vermont Inventors Association.  After the hearing, Senator Hatch and I worked to address the concerns of independent inventors, small businesses, universities, the Administration, and other Senators. We made several changes to the legislation, which I think significantly improved the Patent Bill. Let me give you some examples of the changes that we made to the legislation: (1) any applicant who does not apply for a patent overseas can elect NOT to have early publication of their patent (2) any applicant who diligently prosecutes a patent application will receive a full 17 years of patent protection; (3) non-profit research laboratories or other nonprofit entities such as universities, research centers, or hospitals can petition the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for additional patent protection; and (4) the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) must develop statewide computer networks with remote library sites to enhance access to information in state patent and trademark depository libraries for independent inventors and small businesses in rural states.  On May 22, Senator Hatch and I offered a substitute amendment with these changes. Every member of the Committee, save one, voted in favor of the Hatch/Leahy substitute amendment.  After the markup, the White House Conference on Small Businesses, which consists of over 2000 delegates elected from hundreds of thousands of active small businesses nationwide, made additional suggestions on how to improve the bill. Senator Hatch and I agreed to incorporate their suggested changes into a substitute amendment to the Patent Bill, and I am pleased to report that as a result, the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the National Venture Capital Association, National Small Business United, and the Small Business Technology Coalition has concluded that, if enacted, this bill would be of great benefit to small businesses.                        TITLE BY TITLE ANALYSIS  Unfortunately, because of Republican opposition to this bipartisan bill, the Senate will have no opportunity to consider this legislation to assist U.S. inventors small and large. I find this particularly unfortunate since our Patent Bill was geared toward improving the operational efficiency at the PTO and making government smaller and leaner. I would like to provide a title-by-title overview of the substitute amendment to the Patent Bill that Senator Hatch and I were prepared to offer as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill.     Title I of the amendment: PTO reforms  Title I of the amendment would have made some modest, albeit important, reforms to the PTO. It provides that the PTO shall not be subject to any administratively or statutorily imposed limitation on positions or personnel. This should allow the PTO to hire the necessary number of examiners to review the increasing number of applications received by the office. Title I also creates a Patent Management Advisory Board and a Trademark Management Advisory Board. Of the five members of the Patent Management Advisory Board, not more than three shall be members of the same political party, at least one member shall be an independent inventor, and the members shall include individuals who represent small and large entity patent applicants located in the United States in proportion to the number of applications files by such members.     Title II of the amendment: Publication of Patent Applications  Title II of the amendment responds to the concerns of independent inventors and small businesses regarding the matter of 18-month publication. These concerns were articulated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by the President of the Vermont Inventors Association, Bill Parker. Mr. Parker suggested giving applicants who only file in the United States a choice whether or not to publish early. He also recommended that we enhance the protections granted to those who choose 18-month publication if we wish to encourage them to take that course.  Title II does both of these things. In particular, it allows any applicant to avoid publication before the granting of the patent simply by making such a request upon filing the application and by certifying that their application has not--and will not--be published abroad. The substitute also provides for the issuance of patents on individual claims in published applications as they are approved, rather than waiting for the disposition of all claims contained in such an application, as now occurs. This allows applicants to gain full patent protection--including reasonable royalties, damages, and attorneys fees when appropriate--for some of their component inventions earlier than they would have under the original draft of the bill.  This new Title II in our substitute amendment will benefit U.S. researchers and manufacturers who will have early English language access to the applications filed with the PTO that are of foreign origin. This bill measures the 18-month publication period from the earliest patent application date anywhere in the world. Since foreign-origin applications typically are filed abroad 12 months before they are filed here, those applications will be published 6 months after they are filed in the U.S.; that is a year earlier than domestic-origin applications. This will level the playing field with foreign countries that already are publishing our applications in their languages within 6 months after our applications are filed abroad.     Title III of the amendment: Patent Term Restoration  In 1995, GATT changed the U.S. patent term from 17 years from issuance to 20 years from filing. On average, this new term does not result in loss of patent term. It is still possible, however, that an individual patentee would haveless patent term under the post-GATT term than under the pre-GATT term. To remedy this situation, Title II of the substitute amendment restores patent term lost to ``unusual administrative delay'' by the PTO and guarantees all diligent applicants a minimum 17-year term.  More specifically, the 1995 law authorizes patent extensions for only 5 years, and authorizes extensions only for PTO delays occurring in three specific situations: interference proceedings, imposition of secrecy orders, and appellate review. Title II of the substitute amendment makes extensions available to compensate for any type of delay by the PTO--extensions up to 10 years in the case of appellate review or unusual administrative delay, and unlimited extensions for delays caused by secrecy orders and interference proceedings.     Title IV of the amendment: Prior Domestic Commercial Use  Title IV of the amendment will provide protection against an infringement suit for anyone who has commercially used an invention for more than a year before another person files for a patent on an invention. In raising this defense, the burden of proof will be on the person claiming the defense, not the patent holder. This provision will protect the unsophisticated entrepreneur from being ruined. Under current law, an independent entrepreneur who has invested perhaps his or her entire life savings to produce and market an invention can be shut down completely by someone else who comes along much later and gets a patent on the same invention. A prior use right will protect independent entrepreneurs from this financial disaster.     Title V of the amendment: Patent Reexamination Reform  Although the goal of the original re-examination provisions--reducing legal bills for patent applicants--was laudable, I was concerned that the legislation protect against harassment by third parties. Title V of the amendment now requires that everyone who requests reexamination of a patent to identify the real party in interest that they represent. It continues to limit the grounds for patent invalidity that can be raised during a reexamination proceeding to earlier patents and publications. Grounds that require evaluation of live testimony cannot be raised. Parties are prohibited from requesting a second reexamination until the first reexamination is completed. Parties cannot raise issues during reexamination that they raised or could have raised in earlier court litigation. Neither can they raise issues in court litigation that they raised or could have raised in an earlier examination. Furthermore, no reexamination proceeding can ever be started unless the Commissioner makes a determination that a substantial new question of patentability is raised. The Commissioner's determination not to start a reexamination is unappealable. In all of these ways, the re-examination provisions in the substitute amendment will provide an alternative to the current costly and time-consuming process of Federal litigation and at the same time, protect patent applicants against undue harassment.     Title VI of the amendment: Miscellaneous Provisions  The final title of the amendment contains several lower-profile, but nonetheless important and needed changes to American patent law. A matter of special interest to me is the section I suggested be added in this Title to enhance access to patent information. I have long thought that electronic access should be more widespread and want to work with the PTO to ensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent information in rural states and eventually in all areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make further advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, which just recently established a patent and trademark depository library.  Also important is the section that clarifies the authority of the Copyright Office. It is intended to codify the traditional role of the Copyright Office and to confirm the Register's existing areas of jurisdiction. The new subsection 701(b)(1) reflects the Copyright Office's longstanding role as advisor to Congress on matters within its competence. This includes copyright and all matters within the scope of title 17 of the U.S. Code. The new subsection (b)(2) reflects the Copyright Office's longstanding role in advising federal agencies on matters within its competence. For example, the Copyright Office advises the U.S. Trade Representative and the State Department on an ongoing basis on the adequacy of foreign copyright laws, and serves as a technical consultant to those agencies in bilateral, regional and multilateral consultations or negotiations with other countries on copyright-related issues. The new subsection (b)(3) reflects the Copyright Office's longstanding role as a key participant in international meetings of various kinds, including as part of U.S. delegations as authorized by the Executive Branch, serving as substantive experts on matters within the Copyright Office's competence. Recent examples of the Copyright Office acting in the capacity include its central role on the U.S. delegation that negotiated the two new WIPO treaties at the 1996 Diplomatic Conference in Geneva, and its ongoing contributions of technical assistance in the TRIPS Council of the World Trade Organization and the Register's role as a featured speaker at numerous WIPO conferences. The new subsection (b)(4) describes the studies and programs that the Copyright Office has long carried out as the agency responsible for administering the copyright law and other chapters of title 17. Among the most important of these studies historically was a series of comprehensive reports on various issues produced in the 1960's as the foundation of the last general revision of U.S. copyright law, enacted as the 1976 Copyright Act. Most recently the Copyright Office has completed reports on the cable and satellite compulsory licences, legal protection for databases, and the economic and policy implications of term extension. The reference to ``programs'' includes such projects as the conferences the Copyright Office co-sponsored in 1996-97 on the subject of technology-based intellectual property management, and the International Copyright Institutes that the Copyright Office has conducted for foreign government officials at least annually over the past decade, often in cooperation with WIPO. The new subsection (b)(5) makes clear that the functions and duties set forth in this subsection are illustrative, not exhaustive. The Register of Copyrights would continue to be able to carry out other functions under her general authority under subsection 701(a), or as Congress may direct.  Today's inventors and creators can be much like those of Thomas Jefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They can also be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our colleges and universities. Our nation's patent laws should be fair to American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations. To maintain America's preeminence in the realm of technology, which dates back to the birth of this republic, we need to modernize our patent system and patent office. Our inventors know this and that is why they support this legislation.  I have received letters of endorsements of S. 507, which I placed into the Congressional Record on June 23, July 10 and July 16, from the following coalitions and companies: the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, the 21st Century Patent Coalition, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of American (Parma), the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Software Publishers Association, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Business Software Alliance, the American Electronics Association, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the International Trademark Association, IBM, 3M, Intel, Caterpillar, AMP, and Hewlett-Packard.  In addition, I have letters of support of the Patent Bill from the National Association of Manufacturers, TSM/Rockwell International, Obsidian, and Allied Signal.  I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is being prevented from considering this important legislation by Republican recalcitrance. American inventors deserve better and America's future is being short changed.                          ____________________
