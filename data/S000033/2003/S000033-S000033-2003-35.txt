 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment is cosponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski), who is a leader on this issue and has a related freestanding bill which I am happy to have cosponsored.  The purpose of this amendment is simple. It will reverse an ill-conceived policy at the VA to forbid outreach to veterans who may be eligible for VA health care. This policy is unacceptable. The men and women who have put their lives on the line for this country should be fully informed of the benefits that their service has earned them.  Finally, let me thank the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member, who I understand have agreed to accept this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski).
