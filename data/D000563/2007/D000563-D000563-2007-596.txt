President, this H-1B visa issue was debated during the course of the immigration bill. We decided to increase the number of the H-1B visas but also increase the safeguards against abuse. We know abuses are taking place. We wanted to be sure American workers have first chance at these jobs, No. 1; and, No. 2, we want to stop these foreign job shops that are using thousands of these H-1B visas to outsource jobs in the United States then back to their home country.  None of those reforms are included. All we have is an increase in the H-1B visa numbers. We need a balanced and coordinated approach that increases the numbers with the safeguards. Unfortunately, Senator Cornyn's amendment does not do that, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.  Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of order pursuant to section 305(b)(2) and section 310(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
