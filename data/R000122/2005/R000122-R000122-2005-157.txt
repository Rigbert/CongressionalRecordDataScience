President, the Gregg amendment would appropriate $1.2 billion into the State block grant program for LIHEAP. That would mean, because of the arcane nature of the formula, States such as Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin will see no increase, Iowa will have under a 3-percent increase, and Oregon has less than a 7.5-percent increase.  In sum, the States that need this help right away, the cold-weather States, will see little help from the amendment.  Moreover, his amendment is funded by cutting valuable programs--Head Start, education for disabled Americans, a host of programs--that cannot be made up.  As our chairman and ranking member said, this amendment probably will be disregarded in conference because they will not fund but be taking away what very little exists already--title I, Head Start, and a host of other programs.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. We will try again for a real LIHEAP amendment.
