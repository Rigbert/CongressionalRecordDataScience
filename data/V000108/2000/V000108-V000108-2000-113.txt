Speaker, it is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I congratulate Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. in Gary, Indiana, as it celebrates its 75th anniversary as a parish on May 3-7, 2000. This anniversary is made even more special because a charter member, Brother Oliver B. Hardy, is able to celebrate with his fellow parishioners.  Christ Temple Church was formed largely through the efforts of two dedicated people. Sister Ella Bradley attended a church service in Gary, where she met Elder William A. Nolley. Elder Nolley was singing a song that Sister Bradley recognized, a song written by Bishop Charles Prince Jones, the founder of the Church of Christ Holiness U.S.A. After several discussions, Sister Bradley opened up her home on Tuesday, November 25, 1925, and Christ Temple Church was born. The initial membership consisted of Sister Bradley and her family as well as Elder Nolley and his wife, Velma.  After much hard work and dedication, land was purchased at 2472 Pierce Street in Gary. It was here that the church began to flourish. Elder Nolley was returned to the south by the presiding bishop and was replaced with Elder J.J. Peterson in 1931. Elder Peterson built a sanctuary on the lot on Pierce Street, and the congregation began to grow steadily. In June of 1962, the generous Elder Peterson was laid to rest, but his commitment to the church had made a lasting impression on the congregation and community.  After Elder Peterson's passing, the church continued to expand. By September of 1962, the membership of the church was beginning to outgrow the limited space of the sanctuary. The church leadership took the visionary approach by forming a building fund. They predicted that once the fund had reached $100,000 it would be time to build a new place of worship. Through the selflessness and generosity of the membership, their vision came to fruition on January 13, 1980, when they held their first service at their current location, 4201 Washington Street, in Gary.  Under the extraordinary leadership of Bishop O.W. McInnis and Elder Dale Cudjoe, the church members were able to pay off their new church's mortgage within nine months. On September 24, 1989, Elder Cudjoe was appointed pastor of Christ Temple Church of Christ, the position he holds today. Through his efforts the church has grown both spiritually and numerically.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the membership of the Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. as they celebrate their 75th anniversary. From humble beginnings they have emerged into a thriving spiritual family. The church's positive impact on Northwest Indiana has been significant during the past 75 years. May they enjoy good fortune for many more years to come.                          ____________________
