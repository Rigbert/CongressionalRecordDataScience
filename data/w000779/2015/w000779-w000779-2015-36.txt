 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 FreedomWorks,                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2015.           Key Vote YES on the Wyden Amendment #2621 to CISA       As one of our over 6.9 million FreedomWorks activists      nationwide, I urge you to contact your senators and ask them      to vote YES on the Wyden amendment to add crucial privacy      protections to the Cyber Information Sharing Act (CISA), S.      754.       CISA purports to facilitate stronger network security      across the nation by facilitating the interchange of      information on cyber threats between private companies and      government agencies. But one of CISA's several gaping flaws      is the incentive it creates for some companies to share this      data recklessly.       The personally identifiable information (PII) of a      company's users can be attached to cyber threat indicators      after a hack--potentially sensitive information that is      generally unnecessary to diagnose the threat. But since      companies which share cyber threat data are completely immune      to consequence if that shared data should be misused, their      incentive is to share the data as quickly as possible--even      if that means some would be sharing PII.       And if that personal data is irresponsibly shared with the      government, it gets spread far and wide between government      agencies (including the NSA) in real time, thanks to CISA's      mandatory interagency sharing provision.       The Wyden amendment goes a long way toward addressing the      potential misuse of this personal information by requiring      companies which share cyber threat data to review said data      to ensure that all PII that is not directly necessary to      counter the cyber threat is deleted before it is shared.       Passing the Wyden amendment wouldn't fully fix the problems      with CISA, but it is an important protection against      potential distribution and misuse of innocent consumers'      private information.       Please contact your senators and ask that they vote YES on      the Wyden amendment to CISA. FreedomWorks will count the vote      on this amendment as a Key Vote when calculating our      Congressional Scorecard for 2015. The scorecard is used to      determine eligibility for the FreedomFighter Award, which      recognizes Members of Congress who consistently vote to      support economic freedom and individual liberty.           Sincerely,                                                     Adam Brandon,                                                CEO, FreedomWorks.
