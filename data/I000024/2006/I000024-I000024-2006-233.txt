President, today I wish to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Association of Energy Service Companies and the beneficial contributions it has made to the oil and gas industry since February 1956. This organization has helped unite the oil and gas industry and advocates the most efficient production models for all of the member companies, resulting in vastly superior oil and gas operations across the Nation.  The association formed when six service contractors met and formed the Association of Oil Well Servicing Companies to combat increasing governmental regulations, rising insurance costs, and the rising difficulty in employee recruitment. With Mr. Frank Poole appointed as the first president, the association began to gradually grow and gain prominence in the oil and gas industry. Soon after formation, the group grew to represent 35 wells and 15 trucks and eventually placed an association chapter in 17 oil-producing States.  Over the past 50 years, the organization has blossomed from 6 members to over 400. The association currently boasts representation of over 70 percent of the well-servicing rigs in domestic oil production. In 1996, due to a rapidly growing national membership and expansive chapter representation, the Association of Oil Well Servicing Companies changed their name to the Association of Energy Service Companies.  The AESC continues to lead the oil and gas industry by providing a host of services including safety training and seminars on current and new technology, environmental protection initiatives, monthly meetings of State and local chapters, as well as national meetings, conferences, and tradeshows.  Mr. President, as the members of the AESC prepare to celebrate 50 years of dedicated service, I extend my congratulations to all of those members who have remained committed to excellence in the oil and gas industry. In a world driven by oil and gas production and consumption, this organization has provided guidance and regulation to maintain equal standards in a competitive industry. For the next 50 years and beyond, I sincerely hope this organization's leadership and dedication to fairness remains as strong as it has been the past 50 years.                          ____________________
