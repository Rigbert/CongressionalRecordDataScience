 Let me first say that the money comes from general administration, and we have been assured that much of this can come from belt tightening for travel.  I will also tell my colleague from Idaho that the offset has been an item of discussion all week long because of the sequencing of amendments that have come to the floor, and we were not sure which ones would pass or not pass. Senator Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has assured us that we can continue to discuss this legislation. It has a long way to go when it gets to conference, where we can reconsider this. A lot of dollar figures will be discussed and changed around. It is an item we will be able to be flexible with once it is passed.
