President, I voted in support of cloture on the motion to proceed to the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014. This is a procedural vote to begin debate on this bill, which has been introduced by Senator Hagan of North Carolina and is cosponsored by 45 Senators, including 26 Republicans.  Senator Hagan's bill seeks to enhance opportunities for outdoor recreation, including hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. It also reauthorizes key conservation programs that support outdoor recreation. It is no secret that I strongly support efforts to combat violent gun crime and to reduce the high number of gun deaths and injuries that occur each year, but I recognize the distinction between legitimate hunting and target shooting activity, as opposed to irresponsible or criminal gun use. I believe there are ways to support the former without undermining efforts to reduce the latter.  If, during debate on this bill, Senators try to add provisions to weaken the laws on the books when it comes to keeping our citizens safe from gun violence, I will strongly oppose those provisions, but for purposes of today's procedural vote, I support moving forward on this bipartisan legislation.
