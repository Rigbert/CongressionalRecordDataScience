 There are obvious similarities between Government and football. In both, blows to the face are disallowed. And there is much that Government can learn from football--hopefully, beyond trick plays and sneaks. For one thing, we can learn that sportsmanship and mutual respect that go with handshakes between players after the battle is over, the score is settled and life moves on to other challenges. Here is to a great game.                          ____________________
