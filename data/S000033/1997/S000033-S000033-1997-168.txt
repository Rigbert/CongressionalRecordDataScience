 BONIOR. I will. When I make my point, I will yield to my friend from Vermont. The problem is the jobs that they have got, they have gotten at about two-thirds the wage level which they were making before the original job is lost. And of course that just puts incredible pressure on them to reach a sustainable living wage for their families. So they get another job, they are sort of working two jobs, and when they are working two jobs or three jobs, they are not home for their kids' soccer game, they are not home for PTA meetings or school nights out, and then the whole family structure suffers.  So it is more than just jobs and wages. It is the whole social fabric of our society today.  And I yield to my friend from Vermont if the gentlewoman from Ohio will yield.
