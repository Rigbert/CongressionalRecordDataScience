President, if the Senator would yield on that point, when the Republicans were in charge of the responsibility of bringing forth his record, they never brought forth either the sexual or the racial issues that have been raised when he was up for district court judge. But we will discuss this tomorrow. I hope the Senator will be able to join us at the markup tomorrow. We have had a couple of occasions when the President's nominees for judges have been on our agenda and Republicans did not show up to make a quorum. I don't know if this helps to keep their numbers--I remind the Senator, however, that with the Democrats in charge, the time the Democrats have been in charge, President Bush's judges have been confirmed at a far more rapid pace and in greater numbers--in greater numbers--than they have been under a Republican-controlled committee or Senate.
