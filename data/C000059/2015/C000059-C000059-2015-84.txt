Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part:  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment requires a new determination.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair will rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new determination as to whether a rule ``follows'' a specified Environmental Impact Statement.  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.            Amendment Offered by Mr. Rice of South Carolina
