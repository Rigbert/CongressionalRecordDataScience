 I ask, when it comes to the Federalist Society--of course, like so many of these dark money organizations, they refuse to fully disclose their donors. They say it is to protect their identity from harassment. It is also protecting the American people from the truth.  Three that we do know have been actively involved would be the Koch brothers--a well-known group supporting Republican candidates--the Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, as well as the Mercer family, now merging with millions and millions of dollars supporting these Republican causes.  I ask the Senator: Is it a leap of faith for me to think that they would not be working so hard to put someone on the Court, unless they felt that person was going to rule along the lines that they believed?
