 President, people in my hometown of Louisville, KY, are still recovering this morning from a series of storms and possible tornadoes last night that inflicted considerable damage across the city, including at the historic Churchill Downs racetrack, home of the Kentucky Derby.  More than 600 Louisvillians were without power this morning after thousands lost power yesterday. The storms did their worst at Churchill Downs in South Louisville, where there were reports of funnel clouds, and some barns were destroyed, sending many horses running loose. In many parts of the city, there were downed power lines. The storms also did considerable damage near my alma mater, the University of Louisville, and in the Jeffersontown area.  The National Weather Service plans to be in Louisville today to survey the damage and determine if the city was indeed struck by tornadoes. The town is bracing itself for another round of severe weather with severe thunderstorms, high winds, and even hail in the forecast for today.  Luckily, it appears so far that only property was damaged and no lives were lost or people injured. The horses are all OK too, for that matter, which is extremely important to us in Kentucky.  We are thinking of those who have been affected by these storms and will continue to keep a close eye on the city of Louisville and make sure the people have everything they need to clean up and rebuild.                               Debt Limit  Mr. President, this morning I would like to address what I view as a worrisome development in connection with the ongoing debt limit talks, but first I think it is important to remind ourselves what the purpose of these talks is.  From the very beginning, the goal has been clear: to come up with a serious and significant plan for reducing the deficit as a condition for any agreement to raise the limit. Without such a plan, we are told, America could very quickly face an economic calamity of historic proportions, at a time when millions of Americans are still trying to recover from the last one.  As one of the major credit agencies recently put it:       The rating outlook [of the U.S.] will depend on the outcome      of negotiations on deficit reduction . . . a credible      agreement on substantial deficit reduction would support a      continued stable outlook; lack of such an agreement would      prompt Moody's to change its outlook to negative on the AAA      rating.  This is serious stuff, and many of us have been hoping for and working toward a serious bipartisan solution, a plan that would convince the American people, the markets, and the world that America is capable of getting its fiscal house in order. Let's be clear about something else: We all know what such a plan would look like. Everyone, including the President, knows we cannot rein in our debt without a reform of long-term entitlements. It cannot be done. And everyone knowsany serious plan would have to be in the trillions to get the job done. That is why even the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee said this week that he wouldn't even support a plan that proposed to cut less than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. That is also why it is so concerning to many of us that some have begun to suggest a different goal for these talks.  Over the past several days, some have suggested in various news stories that the real goal of these talks is to devise a plan that satisfies one side by reducing the debt and satisfies the other side by raising taxes. The suggestion here is that all this is all just some quid pro quo exercise between the two parties. This is a dangerous trend, and it is wrong. It is important that we dispel it.  The central issue in these talks, as every serious person knows, is our Nation's massive deficit and debt and the disastrous long-term consequences for jobs and the economy that would result if we do absolutely nothing about it. We have this problem for one very understandable reason: The government spends too much. The way to solve it is to spend less.  It is mystifying, really, that at the eleventh hour some would now propose tax hikes as a condition to any agreement. It is mystifying not only because of the absurdity of proposing a tax hike as a way to help the economy and create jobs, it is mystifying above all because we know quite well that a tax hike would never make it through Congress, not because of Republican opposition but because of Republican and Democratic opposition. We have already had the votes to prove it. Six months ago, Democrats couldn't even muster enough votes to pass a tax hike on upper income Americans when they had 59 seats in the Senate, a 40-seat majority in the House, and a Democrat in the White House. They couldn't get that done 6 months ago. Less than 2 weeks later, right after that effort to raise taxes, which they couldn't get done, they voted almost 4 to 1 in favor of keeping the current tax rates in place. That was when the Democrats had a huge majority in the Senate, a huge majority in the House, and a President of the United States. They couldn't raise taxes.  So there is one of two things going on here: Either someone on the other side has forgotten that there is strong bipartisan opposition in Congress to raising taxes or someone involved is acting in bad faith. We have known from the beginning that tax hikes would be a poison pill to any deficit reduction proposal. Those who are proposing them now either know this or they need to realize it very quickly.  That is to say nothing of those who are now proposing more spending as a solution to our debt crisis. This isn't just mystifying, it is absolutely farcical. Most Americans had to wonder if they were dreaming this morning when they saw this headline: ``Democrats Call for New Spending in U.S. Debt Deal.'' It is unbelievable. More spending as a solution to the debt crisis? What planet are they on?  All of which gets at the larger issue in this whole debate, and here I am referring to the continuing silence of the one person who matters most to its outcome.  For weeks, lawmakers have worked around the clock to hammer out a plan that would help us avert a crisis we all know is coming. Do you remember what Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said when asked what our biggest national security threat was? He said: Our debt. Erskine Bowles, Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, Cochairman of the deficit reduction commission, called it the most predictable crisis in American history. We all know this crisis is coming, knowing at some point the President will have to sign on to some solution. So it is worth asking, where in the world has President Obama been for the last month? Where is he? What does he propose? What is he willing to do to reduce the debt and to avoid this crisis that is building on his watch? He is the one in charge. I think most Americans think it is about time he started acting like it.  It is not enough for the President to step in front of a microphone every once in a while and say a few words that somebody hands him to say about the jobs situation and our economy. Americans want to see that he is actually doing something about it. What they see instead is more bad economic news every day, a gathering crisis that threatens to make current problems even worse, and a President who is either unwilling or unable to recognize that our Nation's economy is in very serious trouble. He is the President. He needs to lead. He needs to show that he recognizes the problem. He needs to do something about it. We are not in the majority. We can't sign anything into law. That is the President's job. That is his job. Yet, until now, he has stood in the background. He has acted as if it is not his problem. Well, it is his problem. This is his problem to solve. America is waiting.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
