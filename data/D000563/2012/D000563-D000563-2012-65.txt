President, I rise today to honor my friend, Illinois State Senator Jeff Schoenberg, on his more than two decades of service in the Illinois General Assembly.  Jeff was elected to the Illinois House in 1990 at the age of 30. He served six terms there before being elected to the Illinois Senate in 2003, where he rose through the ranks, serving as assistant majority leader, chairman on the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, and vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. More importantly, Jeff Schoenberg has been a dedicated public servant to his constituents in Evanston and to the people of Illinois for 22 years.  During his time in the Illinois General Assembly, Jeff sponsored a bill that would provide better access to quality health care and give consumers the opportunity to make better choices for their health. He also secured more than $5 billion in Federal funds for safety net hospitals such as Mount Sinai, Mercy, and Holy Cross.  Jeff Schoenberg supported the Illinois Safe Choice Zones Act, which helped pave the way for Illinois' pioneering work in stem cell research, and insisted on greater accountability and oversight at the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority.  A father of two himself, Jeff was critical to the passage of a measure allowing schools to keep and administer epinephrine for anaphylactic shock following the death of a 13-year-old girl from Chicago who had an allergic reaction to peanut oil while at school.  Jeff also understood foreign policy issues, including support for legislation to divest State pension funds from foreign countries doing business with Iran and drawing attention to the genocide in Cambodia. Jeff visited Cambodia last month as part of a delegation representing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.  Incoming State Senator Daniel Biss will have large shoes to fill given how well Jeff has served the Illinois Senate's Ninth District. Since the outset of his political career, Jeff has been inspired by the likes of Congressman and Federal Judge Abner Mikva and U.S. Senator Paul Simon, for whom he and I both worked.  Jeff's dedication to service now takes on a new focus in improving the livesof children and families through an expanded role advising the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation on its philanthropic endeavors. His approach to this work is made clear by something he said just last year:  My position in the Senate is only one point of entry into public service.  As Jeff moves into his new role, I can only say to him: Thanks for being my friend and my ally in so many good causes. While you may be retiring from the Illinois State Senate, your constituents and I know that you will never retire from working for the public good.  Thanks to Jeff Schoenberg and his family for all they have given to our State.                          ____________________
