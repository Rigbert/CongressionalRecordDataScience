Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), our ranking member, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I intend to vote for this continuing resolution, as I presume most of us will. But let us recognize what we are doing for what it really is. It is the budgetary cap stone to 6 years of the Republican's Perfectionist Caucus.  I do not remember how many remember Speaker Gingrich's speech to the Perfectionist Caucus in 1998, but it was a compelling and accurate speech as to why we are here right now.  Now, my very close friend for whom I have great respect, and I emphasize that because I want the public to know that in a bipartisan way, I think the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the chairman of our committee, does an excellent job. And, frankly, had his caucus listened to him and the other appropriators as to what we should be doing, we would not be here now.  But the Perfectionist Caucus moniker was born 2 years ago when then Speaker Gingrich walked on to this floor and chastised his Republican colleagues, the Perfectionist Caucus, not all of these Republican colleagues, for urging the defeat of an omnibus spending measure. Perhaps they would do so again this year.  After 4 years in the majority, it seems Mr. Gingrich had finally seen the light. But not before these things had happened:  The GOP failed to pass a budget at all in 1998. The first time we had not passed a budget since the adoption of the Budget Act in 1974.  And not before the GOP dared the President to veto a disaster relief bill in 1997 to which Republicans had attached controversial policy riders.  And not before the GOP provoked two Federal Government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.  Pleading for compromise 2 years ago, Mr. Gingrich who was pleading for compromise, Mr. Gingrich stated and I quote: ``Surely,'' this is Mr. Gingrich's quote, in case anybody missed it. ``Surely those of us who have grown up and matured in this process understand after the last 4 years that we have to work together on the big issues. If we do not work together on big issues, nothing gets done.'' So said Mr. Gingrich, the Speaker of the House.  Well, now we know that common sense advice went in one ear and out the other. With all due respect to the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) who gets on the floor and says we have passed all 13 appropriations bills, the gentleman is absolutely right. And we knew at that time that at least 11 of those appropriation bills were not real and could not pass, and would bring us to an impasse. The gentleman knew that. I do not expect him to get up on the floor and say he knew that. But I know that in his heart, he knew we were right.  Mr. Speaker, today we are living with those results. With only 5 days left before the start of the fiscal year in 2001, we have failed to complete our work on 11 of the 13 must-pass appropriation bills.  Continuing resolutions, of course, are not unusual. Since 1977, we have completed our work on all 13 spending bills on only four times in that period of time.  But in the 6 years under this majority, we have completed our work on two or fewer appropriation bills by October 1 four separate times. That is 4 out of 6 years, less than two. In 1995, none were completed in time. Not one. In 1997 and 1998, we completed one bill each. So my colleagues on the Republican side are 100 percent ahead of where they were in 1995 and 1996. I suppose that is some sort of progress.  And this year we finished just two. The die for this end-of-the-year budget debacle was cast 6 months ago. It was inevitable. It was predictable and we all knew, at least on the Committee on Appropriations, on both sides of the aisle, that we were going to be here today doing exactly what we are doing. As the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), my good friend, the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, correctly predicted in April when the GOP passed its budget resolution, and I quote, ``This resolution puts us on a track for another budgetary train wreck in September.''  Mr. Speaker, he said that in April. He predicted then we would have a train wreck in September. He said that their budget ``calls for deep cuts in domestic programs to make room for very large tax cuts.'' Let me be precise. The GOP's budget resolution calls for $175 billion tax cuts over 5 years. That is 12 percent more than the Congress passed and the President vetoed the year before. Nobody was surprised at what the outcome of these proposals was going to be. They just did not care. Inevitably, we are here.  Yet in urging passage of the budget resolution conference report on April 13, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kasich) stated, and I quote, ``I am disappointed that we do not have four times as much tax relief in this bill.''  I do not know where he thought he was going to get the votes to pass appropriation bills under that circumstance. It is one thing to hail huge tax cuts. We all like to say that. It is something all together different to explain how one would actually pay for them, how we would get there.  The huge tax cuts in this year's budget resolution would have necessitated cuts in non-defense discretionary of $121.5 billion over 5 years, in education, in health care, in law enforcement, in all of the work that the Federal Government does. There were not the votes on that side of the aisle to accomplish those cuts. Period. And certainly not in the Senate on that side of the aisle.  However, Mr. Speaker, I do not believe there is a soul in this body who thought for a minute that such Draconian cuts would ever happen. Notwithstanding that, we passed these bills knowing that we would be here in this situation 5 days before the end of the fiscal year. Thus, this ill-conceived budget resolution which made a shambles of our appropriations process this year put us in this predicament.  As The Washington Post observed, and I quote, ``The appropriation process is again a charade in which the Republicans pretend to be making cuts in domestic spending that in the end they know they will lack the votes to sustain, and with good reason; some of the cuts would do real harm. The first round of appropriation bills,'' they went on to say, ``is mainly for show.''  The distinguished gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young), my friend, knew that. He characterized that as: Well, we are in the second or third inning. Mr. Speaker, I do not know what inning we are in now, but it is obviously getting late in the ball game.  The gentleman said then that: ``We will get real then. We will fix these bills.'' I think he was right and hopefully we are going to.  Mr. Speaker, the blame for this budget mess lies squarely with Members of the Republican's Perfectionist Caucus, so coined by your predecessor, the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, who failed to heed the advice of their Speaker 2 years ago and instead adopted an unrealistic budget this year that disrupted the entire appropriations process.  After 6 years in the majority, I really have to wonder just how long, in the words of the former Speaker, it takes to grow up and mature in this process.  Notwithstanding that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this continuing resolution.                              {time}  1545
