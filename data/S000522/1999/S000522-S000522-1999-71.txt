Mr. Chairman, every day 33,000 children die from preventable causes. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan) has done hard work on this over the years. I have worked on this. The gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) just mentioned a moment ago, 15 years ago.  A little over 15 years ago, I joined with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) and Gus Yatron not only in providing money for child survival, but in saving it. It was going to be zeroed out, and I offered the amendment to put it at $50 million that passed and went on to become law. But that is past.  We now know that there is so little money going to some of the most important aspects of child survival, and we need to make sure that there is a fire wall. Yes, money can be drawn down, the $385 million, and used in a way that works side by side with child survival money, but this very small amount of money--support for immunization, $25 million, that is all that is in this budget. Kids are dying from preventable diseases every day and we put a mere $25 million into that budget. That is outrageous. These kids are dying.  I would hope that we would at least make sure that from this scarce fund, these what we call direct impact programs, get this modest amount of money. Yes, it can work side by side with the family planning money, but let us not use or divert any additional moneys that could be used to immunize a kid from tetanus, from all of these preventable diseases, and also the oral rehydration salts that can save a child from diarrhea which is the leading killer of children around the world.  I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania has a very, very laudable amendment. It says there are different funds. Why should we put at risk this minimal amount of money, this modest amount of money used for these important goals? We have got the other money in the other spigot for family planning. I urge support for the Pitts amendment.
