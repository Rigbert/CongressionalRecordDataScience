President, I come to the floor today to congratulate an outstanding school on 150 years of educational excellence.  Lake Forest Academy is an independent high school and boarding school in Lake Forest, IL, 30 miles north of Chicago. It was founded by elders of the Presbyterian Church in Chicago and 150 years ago today--on February 13, 1857--it was chartered by the State of Illinois as a college preparatory school for boys.  Classes began at Lake Forest Academy in 1858 with a total of five students. While its enrollment today is considerably larger, Lake Forest Academy remains committed to its founding principle: to educate the whole child.  Dr. Martin Luther King said, ``Intelligence plus character that is the goal of true education.'' And for 150 years, that has been the goal of Lake Forest Academy. Its educational mission is based on ``four pillars:'' character, scholarship, citizenship and responsibility.  Some things have changed at Lake Forest Academy, however. Among the most notable changes: in 1974, Lake Forest formally merged with The Young Ladies Seminary at Ferry Hall, becoming a college prep school for young men and young women.  Lake Forest takes pride in the diversity of its students and faculty, and the global perspective of its programs.  As the oldest institution in the city of Lake Forest four years older thanthe city itself Lake Forest Academy is an integral part of the fabric of its community and the State of Illinois. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to please join me in congratulating this fine school on a century and a half of educational progress and excellence.                          ____________________
