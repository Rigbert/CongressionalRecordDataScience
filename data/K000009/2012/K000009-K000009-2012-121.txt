Speaker, during the Christmas Season we remember people far and near and reminisce about those who are no longer with us. I rise to remember Frank Venner, who passed from this life in the summer of 2012 at age 85 years.  Frank Venner was born March 8, 1927, in Baltimore, Maryland. After living in Providence, Rhode Island and Binghamton, New York, the family moved to Toledo when Frank was a teenager. He graduated from Central Catholic High School in 1944 and from the University of Notre Dame in 1949. He served in the Army Air Corps. Frank and his wife Ruth married in 1952 and together raised six children. Their children, along with their eleven grandchildren, were his pride and joy.  While in college, Frank began working in radio on the college station. Back in Toledo he embarked on a career over four decades in broadcasting. He started at WSPD, Toledo's local radio and television station. Later, the television component became WTVG. Frank Venner was a news fixture at the station, his journalism respected in the community. His signature features were the popular ``Weather-in-the-Weather'' show which was broadcast from atop the former Commodore Perry Hotel, the High School Quiz program which he hosted for a quarter century, and the Venner-Ward Report which he co-anchored with another longtime Toledo newsman Gordon Ward. Mr. Ward recalled, ``Integrity was primary in all that he did. His word was his bond.'' Frank Venner also served as editorial director and news director at the station.  Frank Venner's imprimatur on Toledo news is solid. A true journalist, his impact on television from its earliest days into the 21st century is remarkable. He leaves a lasting legacy. He was a man who often reported what others did, but also went beyond his profession and left our community and its institutions stronger for his presence. His resonant voice became synonymous with Toledo.  A more important legacy is his family. His presence will be missed by his children and grandchildren, relatives and friends. Yet, he lives on in them and in the media he was so much a part of shaping.                          ____________________
