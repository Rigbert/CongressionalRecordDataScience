 President, I was forced to cast my vote against the budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year.  As a member of the Budget Committee, I take seriously my responsibilities to form and oversee our Nation's budget. Accordingly, I believe the budget resolution is one of the most important documents produced by the Congress each year.  This resolution is critical legislation because it sets our Nation's priorities. It steers our economic policies. And, it carries weight with the American people.  I believe this process should be used to give the American people hope. The American people deserve a sound budget, which reflects their spending priorities. And, they deserve economic security in youth as well as in older years.  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this budget fulfills none of these requirements. It is truly the worst of slash and burn politics. It is misguided economic policy. It robs our constituents of hope and our children of their future.  Mr. President, our colleagues offered a number of amendments which would have gone a long way to improve this bill.  I must say, Mr. President, I was pleased that a strong bipartisan coalition of Senators supported a sense of the Senate measure I offered on impact aid. Impact aid is critical educational assistance for our federally impacted school districts. I hope my amendment will ensure that the Federal Government lives up to its responsibilities to our Nation's schoolchildren who live on Federal property. That is the minimum we owe the children of our women and men in uniform, and I am pleased the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, accepted my amendment as part of his resolution.  Unfortunately, many other amendments which would have improved this bill failed to pass on largely party-line votes.  I was pleased to support a substitute budget proposed by my friend, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad. His proposal--the fair share plan--reached balance, closed loopholes, excluded Social Security, but smoothed the glidepath of reduced spending. It is my sincere belief that the budget proposed by Senator Conrad would have been a better starting point than the one put forth by my Republican colleagues. The Conrad plan was not perfect, but it would have been better for our children, our elderly, the environment, and the most vulnerable members of our society.  My friends, the distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, offered a wise amendment which aimed at restoring the draconian cuts to education. I was pleased to speak in favor of this amendment, and [[Page S7707]] an truly sorry that our Republican friends were unable to join colleagues on this side of the aisle in restoring some hope for our children's future.  Similarly, my Budget Committee colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, and my friend from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, offered an important amendment to restore some of the nasty cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This amendment would have given some much-needed security to our elderly. It would have also loosened the squeeze on the middle class--average Americans like me, who are caught between elderly, frail parents, and kids at home.  I was honored to join two of my distinguished colleagues from the Finance Committee, Senator Bradley and Senator Breaux to roll back the tax increase on our country's working families. This budget plan raises the taxes on families earning less than $28,000 per year. I think nearly everyone in this country would agree it is inherently unfair to raise taxes on the lower middle class and give a break to the wealthiest among us. Unfortunately, this amendment was rejected on party lines. That is a tragic and sad mistake.  Time and again, some of our colleagues attempted to restore common sense to this budget, but we were caught up in the partisanship of this body. One of the worst examples of this came with the defeat of the Murray amendment. My amendment simply would have protected kids from Medicaid cuts. Despite the defeat of my amendment which would have put the Senate on record that children should not be left without insurance, I will continue to fight for the interests of children in this Nation as the Medicaid system is reformed by this Congress.  Lastly, I was very disappointed that an amendment offered by my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, was defeated. The Senator from Delaware correctly called attention to the risks to our environment if oil exploration were to be extended in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This amendment was important for the future of our Nation's environment, and its defeat is shortsighted and ill-advised.  Mr. President, without these amendments, without this safety net for our children, without protections of our environment, and without other safeguards for our most vulnerable citizens, this resolution is fatally flawed. And, I cannot support this draconian and risky budget plan.                          ____________________
