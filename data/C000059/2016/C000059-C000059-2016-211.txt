Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the remarkable Arthur ``Art'' Robert Seidler who passed away in California on Wednesday, March 30, 2016. Art was a pillar of the community in Corona, California, and he will be deeply missed.  As a child, Art moved from Chicago, Illinois, to Glen Avon in Riverside County, California. After attending Riverside Poly High School, Art enlisted in the Army Air Corps in March of 1942, where he would ultimately fly B25 Medium Range bomber planes. In a highlight of his time in military service, Art was given orders to fly a brand new B25 from San Francisco to Hawaii, where it would be outfitted for combat. Art immediately flew the new plane and buzzed the house of his girlfriend Patricia Smith, who later became his wife and mother to his three children Kurt, Trudy, and Robert.  Following his military service, Art went to college at the University of Southern California where he obtained an undergraduate degree in business and a law degree. After passing the California State Bar, Art worked for the Riverside District Attorney and later joined the Ganahl and Ganahl law firm in Corona. Eventually Art started his own law practice alongside his son, Kurt, where he practiced law for the next thirty-six years. As an active member of the Corona community, Art was a dedicated member of the Corona Elks Club on East Sixth.  The way in which Art lived his life should serve as a reminder that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a strong work-ethic can do great things. His dedication to his work, family, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I was proud to call Art my friend and I will deeply miss him. I extend my condolences to Art's family and friends; although Art may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remains and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
