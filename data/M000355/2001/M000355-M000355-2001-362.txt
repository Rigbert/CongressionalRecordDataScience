 President, pursuant to the Senate Rules, I am giving notice that I plan to offer amendments to the Senate rules that would (a) require Senators to report allegations of corruption to the Select Committee on Ethics, and (b) make the Senate rules applicable to an individual after he or she is officially and legally certified as the winner of the Senate election in his or her state.                          ____________________
