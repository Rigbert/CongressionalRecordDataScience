 President, I rise to comment on the Senate's procedure for consideration of the nomination of Paul O'Neill for Secretary of the Treasury. Under regular order, the nomination for Secretary of the Treasury, which is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee would be considered by the committee after referral to the committee. The process usually involves a hearing and a vote on the nomination. In this case, a hearing in anticipation of the nomination was held. The nomination, however, was not fully considered by the committee. The committee agreed to be discharged only because of highly unusual circumstance. The circumstances arise from the fact that all Senate committees, including the Finance Committee, are not yet composed and organized. Moreover, the Secretary of the Treasury is a critical Cabinet position and expeditious consideration of the nomination is in the best interests of the Nation.  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the Finance Committee will insist on its jurisdictional prerogatives. This nomination presents a highly unusual and compelling procedural exception.
