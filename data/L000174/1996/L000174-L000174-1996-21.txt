President, the United States has played a central role in the quest for peace in the Middle East, and in recent years we have seen remarkable progress. I will never forget standing on the White House lawn to witness the handshake that is etched in our memories between Israel's late Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat, signaling the beginning of a new partnership to end decades of bloodshed.  We had high hopes then, and I am among those who believe in the durability of the peace process. But the recent explosion of violence between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza, the worst fighting since the 1993 peace accord, threatens to undermine the advancements that have been made and stability in a region of vital importance to the United States.  We have seen rock throwing crowds, Palestinian police firing on Israeli soldiers, Israeli helicopter gunships spraying bullets into houses and at unarmed civilians, gruesome photographs of the dead and wounded, and the look of terror on children's faces.  There is ample blame to go around. Under cover of darkness and without warning, the Israeli Government opened a tourist tunnel that runs virtually under a holy site revered by both Israelis and Palestinians. A mob response by Palestinians escalated into a firefight between Palestinian police and Israeli troops.  Even before this latest crisis, the shift in policy of Prime Minister Netanyahu on West Bank settlements reinforced the apprehension of Palestinians that Israel would not fulfill the agreements entered into by the Rabin and Peres governments.  The Israelis in turn can point to continued acts of terrorism and extremely hostile statements by its Arab neighbors have contributed to an atmosphere of increasing insecurity.  Mr. President, if we have learned anything in the Middle East, it is that violence will not solve the age old problems there. While I fully respect the decision of the majority of the Israeli people to change their leaders, I do not believe that the election signified a decision to abandon the peace process. Indeed, Prime Minister Netanyahu has indicated that he has no intention of doing so. His intentions, and his leadership, are being tested now.  The situation could not be more fragile. There is tremendous distrust on both sides. Each suspects the other of seeking advantage, and of failing to live up to prior commitments. As President Clinton has stressed, this is a time for both sides to refrain from provocative actions. The focus should be on emphasizing the positive, not accentuating the negative.  Mr. President, I know others believe as I do that the peace process can survive this latest catastrophe. But many lives have been lost in the past 2\1/2\ days, and many innocent people have suffered. For our part, the Congress should do everything possible to urge restraint, to renew our pledge to support the efforts for peace of both Israelis and Palestinians, and to condemn the extremists on both sides who would seek to sabotage these efforts.  Among the concrete steps we can take is to ensure that U.S. assistance to the Palestinians goes forward. With unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza estimated at over 60 percent, there is an urgent need to show the Palestinians that the peace process will lead to tangible improvements in their lives. These improvements can be the best engines of peace.  Mr. President, I want to commend President Clinton for his remarks on Thursday, and to urge him to continue to use his influence with both sides to stop the bloodshed.  I ask unanimous consent that two articles from today's Washington Post, describing the deadly actions by both sides, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1996]In Gaza, Civilians Flee in Terror, as Helicopters Attack From Night Sky                          (By John Lancaster)       Rafah, Gaza Strip, September 27.--Barely visible against      the night sky, the Israeli military helicopter hovered      several hundred feet above a darkened Rafah neighborhood. The      beat of its rotors mixed with crack of gunshots as Israeli      border troops exchanged fire with armed Palestinians hidden      in nearby buildings.       Two Palestinian youths, eager to display their battlefield      knowledge, argued about the model of the U.S.-made chopper      that hung over the rooftops. ``Apache,'' said one. ``No,      no,'' insisted the other. ``Cobra.''       Suddenly, the debate seemed academic.       With no warning and in the absence of any apparent threat      from the young men gathered in a sandy alley--without visible      weapons or involvement in the exchange of gunfire--the      helicopter opened fire in a terrifying, thunderous burst that      sent everybody scrambling for cover at the base of a      concrete-block wall. A moment or two later, in the midst of      another volley, a young man several feet away clutched his      forehead with both hands and fell to his knees, his face a      mask of crimson.       ``I'm hit! I'm hit!'' he screamed.       Things had not started out this way. For the better part of      the day, calm seemed to prevail in the teeming, semi-     autonomous Gaza Strip. Residents observed the Muslim day of      rest. Palestinian police politely dispersed crowds of teens      who gathered to     throw stones at Israeli troops. That was in sharp contrast to      Thursday's armed clashes that killed 24 Palestinians and five      Israelis in Gaza.       By late in the day, however, violence had again erupted in      Gaza. The flash point this time was Rafah, a ramshackle town      of potholed roads and half-finished concrete building that      serves as the gateway between Egypt and the Palestinian self-     rule area in the Gaza Strip. The border crossing is guarded      by Palestinians on one side and Egyptians on the other, with      Israeli troops manning posts in between.       Witnesses said the trouble began around 3 p.m., when large      crowds of young people began throwing stones at the Israeli      posts. According to the witnesses, the Israelis then open      fire on the crowds. Next, armed Palestinian civilians began      returning fire from nearby buildings.       [The Israeli army said shots also were fired from the      Egyptian side and that the helicopter gunships were called in      to rescue trapped soldiers after an Israeli colonel was      killed and six soldiers were wounded, the Associated Press      reported.] The accounts could not be independently confirmed.       Palestinians in Rafah said their police at least tried to      avert the clash. ``The Palestinian police tried to stop me,''      said Akram Louli, 21, a student at the Islamic University in      Gaza who was among the stone-throwers. ``They told me, `Leave      this area and go away.' ''       But the police also appeared to be doing their best to      avoid confrontation with the protesters. ``They were so      polite,'' Louli said, adding that when they asked him to      leave, ``I told them, `No, I don't want to go,' so they left      me and went to push away some other kids.''       Ahmed Hassan, a 25-year-old policeman, said he and his      fellow patrolmen were ``trying to calm down the situation''      on orders from the Rafah police captain. But he added: ``The      people have too much anger. They are very courageous. They      are not listening to the police.''       Louli, the student, seemed to confirm as much when he vowed      that he would be on the streets the next day. ``I am planning      to do the same thing I did today,'' he said to murmurs of      approval from the young men at his side. ``The incidents are      going to be bigger.''       The city seemed relatively calm at dusk. Shops were open,      and children played on piles of sand used in construction.      Closer to the border crossing, however, the streets grew      dark, residents and shopkeepers having turned out many of      their lights.       A moment later it was clear why. Two young men, one      carrying a rock in each hand, waved down our vehicle and      told us to douse the headlights. They said the lights      could draw fire from the helicopters, which could be heard      plainly. Other drivers apparently had heeded the same      advice; occasionally they flashed their lights to      illuminate an intersection or perhaps a child.       On a side road, the gunfire became louder, and it seemed      prudent to go no farther. We stopped the car and darted into      a sandy alley where perhaps 20 teenagers and young men were      leaning against a building. Cocksure and chatty, the youths      said the helicopters had been firing on the area      sporadically, displaying several large brass cartridges that      they said had come from their cannons.       They said the gunfire from the buildings came not from      Palestinian police but from armed civilians who had ignored      police orders to leave the area.       After a few minutes, one of the men offered to show a      nearby home that he said had been fired on by a helicopter.      The owner, Talal Salah, led the way into a cramped rear      bedroom, then pointed to a fist-sized hole in the ceiling      that he said had been caused by shrapnel from an Israeli      cannon shell at 5:30 p.m. Salah, 35, said his two small      children were lying on the bed at the time but escaped      injury.       We left the home in a large group, and as we emerged from      the narrow alley in front of the house, the helicopter opened      fire. The young men's cockiness suddenly vanished. The      chopper fired perhaps three more bursts. It was after one of      them that the young man clutched his forehead and fell to the      ground.       In a panic, his companions rushed to his side. ``The car!      The car!'' they yelled, indicating they wanted to take the      injured man to the hospital. As they carried him to the car,      however, the helicopter unleashed another volley and the      crowd scattered. Several people ran down the street away from      the car, feeling nearly naked under the light of a street      lamp that had not been turned off.       After running for perhaps 50 yards, I was welcomed into a      small restaurant by a man pointing to the sky in warning. A      girl of perhaps 4 peeked out from the door of a makeshift      home. After offering a glass of water, one of the people      inside guided me to a nearby hospital, where I found my      Palestinian journalist companion and the injured man.       ``It's not safe here,'' the journalist said, guiding me to      his car before I could inquire about the man's condition.      ``We should leave.''                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1996]  Palestinians, Israeli Police Battle on Sacred Ground--Clashes Cool                Elsewhere as Guns Meet Stones in Jerusalem                          (By Barton Gellman)       Jerusalem, September 27.--Israeli police and border guards      this afternoon stormed Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a holy site      for both Muslims and Jews, and shot dead three young men as a      stone-throwing crowd of worshipers emerged from Friday      prayers at al-Aqsa mosque. The clash brought the third day of      bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians to an emotional      crescendo at the plot of ground that embodies their national      and religious divide.       But even after that incendiary clash, or perhaps because of      its implications, the two sides stepped back carefully from      confrontation elsewhere. In all, nine people died in street      battles today, according to hospitals and Israeli and      Palestinian officials, and a major gun battle raged tonight      in the Gaza border town of Rafah between armed Palestinians      and Israeli troops, who opened fire on groups of civilians      from helicopter gunships. But direct firefights involving      uniformed Palestinian police nearly ceased, and forces loyal      to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planted themselves      between demonstrators and Israeli troops in Nablus and      Ramallah in the West Bank and in many parts of the Gaza      Strip.       After a three-day death toll of 66--52 Palestinians and 14      Israelis--both sides seemed headed back from the brink of      genuine war. The sullen stalemate to which they returned      sounded much the same as the one that began the week, and it      was not obvious tonight whether the traumas that intervened      had done more to harden their positions or to spur them      toward new political steps.       ``Maybe we've gotten through it,'' said an exhausted U.S.      consul general in Jerusalem, Edward Abington, who worked      through the night on Thursday and all day today to broker a      still-unscheduled summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime      Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. ``I don't know for sure, but      it's a possibility.''       Netanyahu, in his first public remarks since returning from      an aborted European tour, accused Arafat's Palestinian      Authority of ``willful and untruthful incitement'' against      the Jewish state. ``I tell him today: Our hand is stretched      out to you in peace, but we will not agree that during the      negotiations there will be a war option too,'' the premier      said in a news conference with his security chiefs,      maintaining that the Palestinians were using the threat of      violence to extract concessions.       After two days of telephone diplomacy by Secretary of State      Warren Christopher, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns      said the United States believes a meeting between Netanyahu      and Arafat ``will be held very soon.''       According to witnesses on both ends of a 30-minute phone      call between Netanyahu and Arafat after 2 a.m. (8 p.m. EDT      Thursday), the Israeli leader warned Arafat to put a stop to      Palestinian police rifle fire at Israeli forces and said he      would use ``every means available'' to respond if it resumed.      Netanyahu deployed tanks and armored personnel carriers      outside Nablus, Ramallah and Jericho to underscore the      threat, and hawks in his cabinet said he had waited too long      already and should use them.       But the worst violence of the day came in the old style of      the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation that began      in 1987: Palestinians threw rocks on the Temple Mount, and      Israeli forces responded with overwhelming force.       The Temple Mount--where the third-holiest mosque in Islam      rises over the Western Wall, which is Judaism's most sacred      site--was regarded from the start as today's greatest risk.      Israel ringed the walled Old City with more than 3,500 police      and border police, who stopped and frisked young Arab men all      morning.       With Arafat calling for a return to calm, fewer worshipers      than usual--well under 10,000--turned out today at the      sprawling al-Aqsa mosque, which faces the Dome of the Rock      across a broad plaza. Mohammed Hussein, who delivered the      sermon inside the 8th-century mosque and by loudspeaker      audible for blocks, said the Netanyahu government committed      ``a crime against God'' by completing a tunnel adjacent to      the outer wall of the Temple Mount, which Muslims call Haram      Sharif.       ``These are great confrontations for al-Aqsa,'' he said,      voice booming. ``It's your religious duty to defend al-     Aqsa.''       Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, in an      interview at the scene, said his troops did not open fire      until worshipers departing the mosque threw ``thousands and      thousands of stones at police'' standing at the gates and at      Jews standing on the Western Wall plaza below. ``We're not      going to turn the other cheek,'' he said, adding that police      had responded with ``a little gas'' and ``a few rubber      bullets.'' He denied categorically that live ammunition had      been used.       That account conflicted with some of the physical evidence      and the recollections of witnesses atop the Temple Mount,      including a Dutch relief worker interviewed at Makassed      Hospital in East Jerusalem. There were no stones visible on      the Western Wall plaza, and Jewish witnesses there said none      or nearly none had fallen. Many stones were scattered atop      the Temple Mount, but they were concentrated in the central      plaza as if thrown at targets who were already inside.       Palestinian and a few foreign witnesses, corroborated in      parts by amateur videotape shot on the mount, said hundreds      of Israeli troops rushed in swinging clubs and fired hundreds      of rounds of steel-cored rubber bullets, which can be lethal      at close range. Doctors at Makassed Hospital, where three of      the wounded Palestinians died and 48 others were admitted,      allowed reporters to inspect X-rays demonstrating that some      of the     wounded had been struck by conventional high-velocity rounds      from Israeli M-16 assault rifles.       For more than an hour after the confrontation, wounded      Palestinians were carried out in haste through stone      alleyways toward the gates of the Old City. Frantic friends      and relatives raced toward the hospital with a women bleeding      from the head, a man unconscious on a stretcher, an old man      in a wheelchair with bleeding wounds in the chest and arm,      another old man bleeding from the head and several more      injured.       Many worshipers were still praying inside al-Aqsa mosque      when the confrontation began outside. Some of those on the      plaza ran back inside, and the Israeli forces fired through      the doors and open windows, causing many more casualties.       ``Bullets were flying over our heads,'' said Hussein Adib,      47. ``The rugs on which we were praying were covered with      blood.''       If the Temple Mount was the day's great failure, Nablus was      its success. Six Israeli soldiers died there Thursday at      Joseph's Tomb, traditional burial place of the biblical      patriarch and an island of Jewish control in the      Palestinian self-ruled town. By nightfall Thursday, about      40 Israeli soldiers remained, surrounded by hundreds of      Palestinian troops.       On-scene negotiations through the night between Maj. Gen.      Uzi Dayan, chief of Israel's Central Command, and Maj. Gen.      Haj Ismail Jabber, chief of the Palestinian West Bank police,      worked out a cease-fire. This morning, when demonstrators      from the Balata Refugee Camp tried to resume the attack,      senior Palestinian Authority leaders linked arms and, backed      by Palestinian troops in riot gear, stood between the angry      crowd and its Israeli targets. Similar scenes played out in      Jenin and Ramallah.       There were a few places in the territories today where      uniformed Palestinian troops joined again in attacks on      Israeli soldiers. Two Israeli border guards and a Palestinian      policeman died in a gun battle outside the northern West Bank      town of Tulkarm, and Palestinian policemen helped attempt to      storm an Israeli army post outside the self-ruled town of      Jericho.       In Gaza, Palestinian police appeared to make a genuine      effort to avert further clashes, though there was some      question as to how far they were willing to go to rein in      angry Palestinian youths.       Near the Erez crossing point, scene of some of Thursday's      bloodiest battles, about 30 armed Palestinian police in olive      drab uniforms formed a cordon across the road to keep out      potential protesters.       Protesters did converge on another potential flash point,      the crossroad leading to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim.      But police prevented them from getting anywhere near the      Israeli posts.       In some cases, police officers handled the mostly youthful      protesters with almost fatherly indulgence, sometimes draping      an arm around a shoulder to emphasize their eagerness to      avoid confrontation.       ``What we had yesterday was enough,'' explained police      Capt. Shaban Awad. ``Fifty killed--it's enough. We want to      avoid more violence.''       In Jerusalem the tunnel that sparked three days of lethal      conflict was closed to tourists today.       In many parts of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule      territories, attention turned from fighting to burying the      dead. Israeli Staff Sgt. Itamar Sudai, who died at Joseph's      Tomb Thursday, was laid to rest at Mount Herzl with eulogies      from top army brass and a tribute from a survivor of the      battle there.       ``My brother,'' said the young soldier, identified only as      Uri, ``you've gone before me. All our dreams were so close to      being realized. So close and in a minute, everything's      gone.''
