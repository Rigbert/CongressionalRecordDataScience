Speaker, I rise to defend the right of every American to be safe and healthy at work. Americans who do the right thing and go to work every day should not have to pay for it with their health or their lives.  I have two photos with me this evening, and I hope the camera can catch them. The first shows a job which I am personally familiar with, working in a slaughterhouse, which I did when I was working my way through college. It is tough work, it is dangerous work. I have seen people literally mutilated and hurt on the job in this employment, and yet those of us who take for granted the meat in the grocery department do not realize how many men and women each day literally risk their own health and lives in their jobs.  Below this is another photo in which we cannot see the gentleman who is carrying it, but he appears to be a worker in some sort of a grocery outlet carrying a bag of bakery flour, which of course can be a challenge at times, depending on the size of it.                              {time}  2145  These are just two, I guess, regular employment opportunities in America that we do not think much of. But the reason that I rise this evening and invite my colleagues to join me is to talk about the men and women who go to work each day in America and how safe it is in their workplace.  Unfortunately, for too many Americans in all kinds of jobs, they pay each day with their health and their lives. The numbers are absolutely staggering in America. Six thousand Americans are killed at work every single year, almost twice as many as are killed by fires in the home. Fifty thousand Americans die of occupational diseases every year, almost as many died in the entire Vietnam War. Sixty thousand Americans are permanently disabled every year because of their jobs, more than all the newly reported AIDS cases reported in 1992. And more than 6 million workers suffer serious injuries and illnesses every year because of their work. That is more than twice the number of people who live in the city of Chicago. And it happens every single day.  On an average day, 16,000 Americans are injured at work. On an average day, 154 Americans are killed by job-related injuries and occupational diseases. We know how many people are killed and injured in auto crashes and we are horrified by it and we demand that the Government take action to make our highways safer. We know how many people are killed and injured in airplane accidents and we rightly demand safer airports and airplanes. The Director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has said that ``if a plane crashed every day in this country, the hue and cry for action would be deafening.'' But when a plane full of Americans die at work each day, silence is all we hear. These are not just numbers. They are real people. Their only fault is they get up and go to work every day to provide for themselves and their family, and that is certainly no fault. They are our coworkers, our friends, our relatives, our family, our neighbors.  Darrell Drummer of Loves Park, IL. He was killed in a gravel pit when a cable came loose and struck him in the head. He was 41 years old. Janice Banks of Pulaski, TN, killed when the lumber stacker she was working on fell up against her. Lloyd Mills, who lost his hearing because of this job, and he said, ``Had I had the right to wear hearing protection, I would have worn it because the longer I live, the longer I'm going to have to listen to that humming in my ears.'' Or the 25 workers who died in a poultry processing plant in Hamlet, NC, trapped in a raging fire because the emergency exits had been locked by their employers.  Unsafe workplaces are not limited to giant factories, meatpacking plants, and high elevation construction sites. Job hazards affect Americans who work in all kinds of jobs. They affect the employees of nursing homes who work in what has become one of the most dangerous jobs in America. They affect workers in grocery stores who work with band saws that can cut workers as quickly as they slice meat. They include locked exit doors that trap workers in fires, electrical hazards, toxic chemicals and noise that causes permanent hearing loss.  This special order tonight by my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle is a reminder to those who think it is time to turn back the clock on job safety and health in the workplace, a reminder that the job is not yet done and the victory is not yet won. With me are Members of Congress from across the country, and I might add from both sides of the aisle now, and I welcome the gentlewoman from Maryland. They know the importance of safety and health in the workplace, because they have worked for safety and health laws for years. They know the importance of safety and health because they have constituents who have been killed and maimed at work. They will tell you about the hazards American workers face in food processing plants, coal mines, grocery stores, and construction sites and they will tell you what the new majority in Congress, some of them, are proposing to do in response, from cutting safety and health funding to gutting safety and health laws.  Mr. Speaker, it is not enough to say that you care about the safety and health of Americans at work. The American people will judge us by our actions. I hope this special order will remind people of the importance, the life-and-death importance, of a healthy and safe workplace. I hope it will encourage Congress to work for real improvements and real solutions.  I see among my colleagues this evening the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens], the gentleman from Rhode Island [Mr. Kennedy], the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Wise], and the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella]. I welcome them all.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens].
