I am not going to mention them by name because I would leave out somebody, perhaps, but I will say, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Cantor's staff and my staff--no matter what the differences might have been--have been able to work together in a collegial, effective, and productive manner on behalf of this House, I think.  I want to thank the members of Mr. Cantor's staff for that. They have always been receptive to our discussions. We haven't always agreed, as no one would expect, but they have always been cordial and effective and have worked closely with my staff, and we appreciate that, and I appreciate that.  I will now yield to the majority leader for the schedule.
