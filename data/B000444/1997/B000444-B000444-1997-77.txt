 President, this budget bill--which would put us on a path to eliminating the budget deficit in the year 2002--contains numerous reforms of the Medicare program. In addition, the bill would restore short-term solvency to Part A of Medicare--the part that pays hospital bills and will otherwise be bankrupt in four years. I have no objection to most of the Medicare reform provisions, and I will vote for this bill overall.  However, I want to talk briefly about two provisions that I oppose and explain why I voted to take them out of this bill.  First, Mr. President, this bill would raise the age at which a person becomes eligible for Medicare from the current age 65 to age 67. I voted to keep the eligibility age at 65. While this increase would be gradual and would be phased in over the next 30 years--so it would not affect any current seniors--I think it moves us in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is making sure that more, not fewer, people have health insurance.  Changing the current law so that today's workers will have to wait until they are 66 or 67 before they become eligible for Medicare threatens to add millions of people to the rolls of the uninsured. It is my understanding that 70 percent of Americans who retire between the ages of 60 and 65 will have no health insurance through their employers. If they have health insurance at all, they are paying exorbitant rates to buy it on their own.  Increasing the eligibility age for Medicare by 2 years would leave most of these people unprotected for 2 more years. This result is totally counter to why we created Medicare in the first place: To make sure that older Americans have access to health care services when they are likely to need it the most. Raising the eligibility age for Medicare without addressing the issue of those who will lose--or those who will continue not to have--health insurance is a glaring gap in this proposal.  Now, it has been argued by supporters of this change that because the Social Security retirement age will gradually increase to age 67, the eligibility age for Medicare should increase at the same time. But, Mr. President, there is no rational basis for linking Social Security and Medicare. They are two separate and distinct programs. If it is good policy to raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67--which I do not think it is at this time--then those arguments need to be presented. It is not good enough simply to say, ``Well, that's what we're doing with Social Security.'' And, I should note, that even when the Social Security retirement age increases, people will still have the option of early retirement at age 62. That is not the case with Medicare. It is all or nothing. And, we should not tell people between 65 and 67 that they get nothing.  The second provision that I opposed would have--for the first time--imposed means testing on higher income seniors. Under the plan, the monthly premiums for Medicare part B, which pays for doctor services, would have been based on how much income a person has. Now, I have long said that I believe it is not unfair or inappropriate to have wealthy seniors pay more for their Medicare coverage. So I support means testing in principle. But I am not sure that the means testing scheme in this bill is either fair or appropriate--and I think we ought to be sure of both before we make such a significant change in this program.  This legislation was just drafted last week. Until noon yesterday--Tuesday--this bill would have charged wealthier seniors higher deductibles under part B. But, then at midday, just a couple of hours before we voted on this issue, the bill was changed so that retirees with greater income would pay higher premiums, not higher deductibles. The fact that this last minute change was made just exemplifies the problem of trying to address this issue with haste.  The premium increases in this budget bill are very substantial, and they would hit individuals with incomes over $50,000 and couples with incomes over $75,000. But we really do not know yet what the effect of these increases would be on these families, or on the Medicare system itself. This is why we need to proceed with greater caution.  What we do in this budget bill--and what we must do--is what we have done many times in the last 30 years: Make the changes necessary to ensure the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund over the next 10 years. To address the long-term concerns once the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, I have previously called for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to study the situation and make recommendations. This bill establishes just such a commission, and instructs it to report back to Congress in a year.  My point is that neither the increase in the Medicare eligibility age nor means testing are necessary to solve the short-term financial problems of the Medicare system. Instead, these are issues that the new commission should look at. In making significant changes to the Medicare program--among the most successful Federal programs ever--we need to do so with great thoughtfulness and deliberation.  These changes have no immediate impact on the Medicare trust fund or on our general goal of balancing the overall Federal budget by 2002. In short, there is no reason why we cannot wait until we have the benefit of the recommendations of the bipartisan commission--within the next year--before we take action of this nature. That is why I supported taking these changes out of the budget bill, and why I supported Senator Reed's alternative Medicare proposal to make only those changes needed to make sure that Medicare remains financially solvent.                          MEDICARE PROVISIONS  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate took several difficult votes in the last two days related to Medicare reform. After carefully considering each of the amendments offered in the Senate, I cast my vote in favor of preserving and protecting the long-term solvency of the Medicare system.  I voted for an amendment to eliminate the bill's provisions which would require means testing of Medicare premiums. I also voted for an amendment which would have simply delayed the implementation of premium means testing until the year 2000. I believe it is foolish to hastily make such a drastic change as this without the benefit of an indepth study of the entire Medicare Program. Unfortunately, both of these amendments failed.  I am concerned about the bill's provisions which would delay the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from the current age of 65. However, the bill would not implement this change until the year 2003, which will not affect current beneficiaries and, I believe, will allow us to assess this change within the context of a larger study of the program.  The bill does establish a bipartisan commission to study the entire Medicare Program and make recommendations for the changes necessary to keep the program solvent beyond the year 2001, which is when the trustees have reported the program will be bankrupt. I believe we should wait for the commission's recommendations before enacting any fundamental changes to the program. However, I felt it was important to show a willingness to consider taking a first step toward long-term structural changes in order to give impetus to the commission's work.  The budget reconciliation bill before the Senate contains many key provisions to expand benefits under Medicare and incorporate choice and competition into the current program. For example, the bill authorizes Medicare coverage of mammography screening, colorectal screening, bone mass measurement, and diabetes management. It also creates a Medicare Choice Program and a demonstration program for medical savings accounts for seniors. It contains provisions designed to eliminate waste and fraud in the Medicare system which could result in significant savings. These are improvements to Medicare for which I have fought for many years.  I believe firmly that our priority must remain protecting the Medicare system from bankruptcy by the year 2001, and I will continue to work toward that goal.
