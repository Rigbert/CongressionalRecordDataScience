 President, I would like to discuss a tax policy matter that is important to several Senators. Although it is not a priority for me, I pursued the issue for those Senators during the ``trailer'' bill negotiations. On my side of the aisle, the interested Senators included Senators Smith, Lott, Cornyn, Dole, Graham, and Vitter. I know Senators on the other side of the aisle have similar interests, including Senators Lincoln, Pryor, Landrieu, Cantwell, and Murray.  Under current law, the tax treatment of capital gain income from timber activities varies. The variance depends to a great degree on the form of the business entity that holds the timber. The top individual capital gain rate of 15 percent applies to capital gain from timber if the timber is held by pass-through entities. By contrast, capital gains from timber held by regular ``C'' corporations are taxed at the top corporate rate of 35 percent.  Senators Smith and Lincoln filed an amendment for the Finance Committee reconciliation tax relief markup last year. The amendment aimed at addressing the differential treatment of timber capital gains among entities. A form of that amendment was included in the first round of negotiations on the trailer bill. The final form of the trailer bill agreement did not include the timber capital gains amendment.  Since this issue was not fully resolved, and many Members remain strongly interested in the issue I would like to ask my friend, the ranking Democrat and incoming chairman, Senator Baucus, if he plans to further examine the issue in the next Congress.
