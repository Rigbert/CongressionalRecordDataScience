 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 10. I further ask unanimous consent that following the recognition of the two leaders, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, no resolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be dispensed with and the morning hour be deemed to have expired.  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a period for the transaction of morning business, not to extend beyond the hour of 10 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein up to 5 minutes each.
