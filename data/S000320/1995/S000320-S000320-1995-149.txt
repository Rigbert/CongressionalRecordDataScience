 President, today I am introducing the Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among American men. Over 215,000 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease this year and over 40,000 men will die from it.  Despite recent advances in the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer, the number of cases and the number of deaths continue to rise. Prostate cancer is as common today in men as breast cancer is in women, and the death rates for the two diseases are similar as well. Over this decade, prostate cancer cases and deaths are expected to continue their rapid rise--with cases increasing by 37 percent and deaths by 90 percent between 1985 and 2000.  Early detection has been greatly improved with the development of the prostate specific antigen [PSA] test--a simple and inexpensive blood test for the presence of prostate cancer. As a result, the American Urological Association and the American Cancer Society now recommend that men ago 50 and over get an annual screening with the PSA test. Treatment has been improved through new surgical techniques that remove the cancer without disastrous side effects, and through new drug therapy that can extend life expectancy and improve patient comfort for patients with advanced stage cancer.  These improvements have meant the difference between life and death for many men. The ability to detect prostate cancer in the first stage of the disease has made it possible to surgically remove the cancer when it is still confined to the prostate. Over 70 percent of patients treated in this way never have a recurrence of the disease. Waiting until the second stage or later, which was necessary under previous techniques, greatly increases the risk that the cancer has spread, with small hope for a cure.  I know how important it is to get screening and early treatment for prostate cancer--I am a prostate cancer survivor. I had a PSA test--I had a positive score--I had my prostate removed--and I am here to tell about it as a result. A number of my colleagues in this Chamber--Senator Dole, Senator Stevens, among them--are here with us today because their prostate cancer was spotted early and treated effectively. General Schwarzkopf, the hero of the gulf war, is another man nearly felled by prostate cancer, but saved through screening and surgery. General Schwarzkopf has become a national spokesman for prostate cancer detection. General Schwarzkopf and all of us in Congress are lucky to have the kind of insurance coverage we do through the Military and Federal Employees Health Benefit plans and the access we have to the finest medical facilities and doctors at Walter Reed Hospital among other places.  We can all be sure we get our annual PSA test and any treatment we may need.  The tragedy is that 13 million American men who are at the highest risk for this disease do not have health insurance coverage for the best early detection methods and drug therapies. They do not have it because we, the Congress, have not seen fit to provide it for them through the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Medicare covers the old diagnostic test but does not provide for an annual PSA test. The Veterans Health services could provide annual tests for their resident and in-patient populations, but rarely do the tests or the follow-on surgery. Both of these programs cover part of the hormonal drug therapy for treatment of advanced prostate cancer, but leave out the oral drug which is particularly effective when given in combination therapy. These omissions are particularly troubling because these programs cover the overwhelming majority of men who have the disease.  Finally, it is remarkable that we have had these breakthroughs in detection and treatment given that we have so completely neglected funding for prostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is a disease that has a similar incidence and death rate to breast cancer [[Page S5427]] yet receives one-fourth as much research money. This is a serious oversight that we should correct to increase the pace of research and develop conclusive evidence on what really works and does not work in treating prostate cancer.  The Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 1995 would take three important steps to halt the progression of this disease. First, it would nearly double spending on research to develop more effective treatments of the disease. Second, it would make PSA tests available under the Medicare and Veterans Health programs. Third, it would extend Medicare and Veterans Health coverage for prostate cancer drugs to cover the advanced combination therapy including oral drugs that can significantly extend and improve the lives of prostate cancer victims.  Mr. President, it is important that we increase our efforts to combat this deadly form of cancer and address these deficiencies in our Federal health coverage and research programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring the legislation that could make a difference for thousands of men who might otherwise have suffered greatly or died an untimely death from prostate cancer.                                 ______      By
