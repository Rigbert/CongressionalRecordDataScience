I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Congressman Calvert for introducing this bill to designate a memorial in honor of the over 150,000 current and former members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  The new memorial was dedicated on October 27, 2010, at March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California. With the legislation, the memorial will be designated as the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial. This designation honors these patriots and does not require or permit the expenditure of any Federal dollars.  I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
