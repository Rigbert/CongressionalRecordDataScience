President, earlier this week, the Senate passed a compromise version of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. It took several months to negotiate the minor differences between the House and the Senate bills, simply because we were not allowed to go to conference. Then we had to work for over a month to remove a hold placed on the legislation. When it finally passed the Senate on Monday night, we expected that the House of Representatives would pass it without delay. Unfortunately, one of the compromise provisions triggered a problem that would have prevented passage in the House.  We corrected that problem late last night with an enrolling resolution that strikes the provision of section 502 that caused a budgetary problem. Fortunately, we were able to maintain the important provision of life insurance benefits for our dedicated magistrate judges.  I appreciate the work of Senators Specter and Kyl to make sure that we were able to pass this resolution late last night and I look forward to the House of Representatives passing both the resolution and the Court Security Improvement Act without further delay.  I urge the President to sign this vital legislation, introduced 11 months ago, without delay so that we can protect the dedicated judges, and other personnel who serve as part of our Nation's justice system. The security of our Federal judges and our courthouses around the Nation is at stake.                          ____________________
