 President, 2 years ago health insurance companies could deny women care due to so-called preexisting conditions, such as pregnancy or being a victim of domestic violence. Two years ago women were permitted to be legally discriminated against when it came to insurance premiums and were often paying more for coverage than men. Two years ago women did not have access to the full range of recommended preventive care, such as mammograms or contraception and more. Two years ago the insurance companies had all the leverage, and too often it was women who were paying the price.  Mr. President, that is why I am proud to come to the floor today, 2 years after we passed the Affordable Care Act, to highlight just how far we have come when it comes to making sure women across America get the care they need at a cost they can afford. Because of this law, women will be treated fairly when it comes to health care costs. Deductibles and other expenses will be capped so a health care crisis doesn't cause a family to lose their home or their life savings. Preventive care will be free, so women never have to delay care because they can't afford to see a doctor. Because of this law women will have more options.
