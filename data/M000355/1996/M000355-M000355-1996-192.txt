 COVERDELL. I yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator makes a very important point. I thought we wanted to pass a health care bill. This is essentially the same bill we wanted to pass in 1991. I thought they wanted to pass the minimum wage bill. The Senator from Georgia, I think, makes a very important point as to what is going on here. This is not about principle. There is no principle involved here. This is pure sabotage. I thank my friend from Georgia.
