President, I thank the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Alabama for their usual courtesies. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to set aside, under our understanding, the pending amendment so I might introduce an appropriately referred amendment for myself, Senator Snowe, and Senator Cantwell.
