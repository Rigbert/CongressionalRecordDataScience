Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague on the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Engel].  It would require the retention of sanctions currently imposed against Serbia until the Serbian Government implements specific improvements in the human rights situation in Kosova. The amendment implements the Kosova Peace, Democracy and Human Rights Act of 1995, which was introduced by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], cosponsored by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Engel] and myself, among others.  The amendment recognizes the people of Kosova are a captive nation. These ethnic Albanians, who take great pride in their own history, language, and culture, have been forced to submit to a foreign rule, first by great power politics and then by a communist tyranny.  The amendment also recognizes the harsh conditions, and we have had hearings on the Helsinki Commission on this, Mr. Chairman, and it is very, very, very harsh, and they have been imposed by the Serb state.  It further recognizes that until basic justice is done, Kosova will always be a place not only of oppression but also of potential conflict.  Finally, the Engel amendment recognizes the potential of the Kosova conflict to affect relations among a large number of states, including not only Serbia but also Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey.  It is a good amendment. I hope the body will accept it.
