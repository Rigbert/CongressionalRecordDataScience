They buried the revote in the intelligence authorization.  Well, the Republican leadership wants to buy itself another month to make deals, trading favors and funding pet projects in this district or that district, in exchange for a vote against the best interests of the American people, jobs in America with good wages.  Imagine Congress fast-tracking a bill to repair our roads, bridges, and harbors all across this country. Imagine a bill to be fast-tracked to renew the powers of the Export-Import Bank that actually increases exports and jobs in this country.  Instead, fast track is being rammed through Congress with House Republican leaders bending the rules and breaking regular order. Intelligence authorization bills should not be another name for secret fast-track life support.  No more delays. It is overtime for Congress to move on from fast track to a real fair trade deal that creates jobs and good wages in America for a change.                          ____________________
