President, Senator Booker from New Jersey is on the floor. The three of us asked to come to the floor at 3, because the rollcall was delayed.  I ask unanimous consent, if it is all right with the Senator from Ohio, that Senator Booker be allowed to follow and to complete his statement on the legislation we are supporting.
