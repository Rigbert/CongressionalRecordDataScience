Mr. Speaker, the President wants to blame the Democrats for the economic mess he's made. He is the one who wants to sweep our problems under the rug. He should be ashamed of himself.  When he came into office, the previous administration had created more than 22 million new jobs. The economy was booming. People had the chance to live the American dream. Now gasoline is too high, food is too high, the rent is too high, and nobody can get a raise.  Bush had his hand on the wheel for 7 years. He has been in charge. But he wants to blame the Democrats for the economic mess he made. Well, as they say in the South, that dog won't hunt.  The Republicans got us into the mess, and now it's going to take the Democrats to get us out.                          ____________________
