President, earlier today, along with my friend and colleague, Senator Allen of Virginia, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would establish the technology equivalent of the National Guard. It is an effort we have been pursuing in the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee. I am very pleased to have the Presiding Officer of the Senate on the subcommittee and pleased that he is in the chair as we discuss this legislation tonight.  This is a subject we have been working on since September 11 and the tragedy that struck our country that day.  We are all aware that the public sector, government, military, and law enforcement have begun a very significant mobilization effort to fight terrorism. It is a laudatory effort, one I fully support. This public effort is not going to be successful alone, if we don't take steps to tap the tremendous technology and science talents of America's private sector.  Considering the enormous technological challenges faced on September 11, the quality of emergency response is more than exceptional. But the many private companies and their science and technology experts who rushed to offer their help that day have told our committee they can do more. They can move faster, and they can help save more lives if the U.S. Congress provides a portal, an opportunity for them to more accessibly participate and offer their talents. That is why the legislation Senator Allen and I offered today, the Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act, provides an opportunity to tap those talents of the private sector.  It doesn't create a large bureaucracy. It is not going to snarl our private companies in red tape. It is simply going to provide a gateway to bring the resources of the private sector to bear in the war against terrorism.  I believe, just as John F. Kennedy gave America's youth a forum for public service, now is the time for our Government to throw open its doors to a new generation raised on information technologies that will be able to respond to the wide variety of technology and science-related challenges that arise in the wake of a terrorist attack or other disaster.  The legislation we are offering today offers four opportunities to capitalize on the immense technology resources of our Nation. One I am especially pleased about would establish a virtual technology reserve. As my colleagues know, we have a strategic petroleum reserve in our country. It is an energy insurance policy, an energy bank, in effect, that we can tap when we are in a crunch with respect to oil products. I think we ought to look at technology as the same sort of resource.  So we have created a virtual technology reserve in our legislation that would allow communities all across this country to put in place a preexisting database of private sector equipment and expertise that they could call upon in the case of an emergency. Access to this database would enable Federal, State, and local officials, as well as nongovernmental relief organizations, to locate quickly whatever technology or scientific help they might need from the private sector.  For example, a city official tasked with setting up a command center in the wake of an emergency might need laptop computers and high capacity telecommunications equipment. A State health director facing a potential bioterrorism incident might need to locate experts with expertise concerning a specific pathogen and to obtain special detection and remediation technology as soon as possible. An emergency official coordinating in the field rescue and recovery efforts might need a batch of hand-held radios or might need to bring in mobile cellular units to expand local cellular coverage and capacity so people on the ground can communicate.  In all of these instances, the key is locating equipment and expertise quickly. By turning to our virtual technology reserve, these officials would have a quick way to identify companies that have what they need and companies that have expressed their willingness to help in an emergency.  The Wyden-Allen legislation has several other provisions that we believe will help make a meaningful difference in this fight against terrorism. The legislation provides for the formation of rapid response teams of science and technology experts. It establishes a clearinghouse and test bed for new antiterror technologies. Suffice it to say, our Government has received thousands and thousands of ideas, unsolicited, from private companies and citizens all across this country with respect to products to aid in the fight against terrorism. And there is no systematic way to evaluate the quality of those products.  The bipartisan legislation we brought to the Senate today would provide that test bed and a plan to have those products evaluated.  Finally, our legislation provides for pilot projects to help overcome a problem that seems incomprehensible in a communications center as advanced as the east coast of the United States. We saw on September 11 that first responders, people on the front lines, police and fire and others, were not able to communicate to each other. Before our subcommittee, we were told that on the east coast of the United States, arguably the most sophisticated communications center on the planet, there were firemen actually hand walking messages to their colleagues because all of the available communications systems--the hard-wire systems, the land lines, the cell lines--was down. So we badly need to have innovative work done in trying to make interoperable these communications systems that our first responders need.  Our Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space found, as we analyzed the events of September 11, that the private sector was ready, willing, and able to contribute, but too often they were up against obstacles when they wanted to help. Some couldn't get proper credentials to access disaster sites. Some simply could not find the right place to offer their people their expertise and equipment and were literally knocking on doors offering to help, and people literally could use their skills.  On December 5 of last year, FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh testified before our subcommittee that emergency response officials could have used the help of people in the technology sector to set up databases to track the missing and injured, as well as the goods and services being donated. But what Director Allbaugh has said--and he has been very helpful in this effort--was there simply wasn't a centralized go-to desk to provide experts for immediate needs.  In the event of a bioterror attack, we have been told by the health authorities that communities would face the very same confusion. Right now, if a town is hit with a biological agent and local officials are looking for the closest medical authority, there is no comprehensive list of certified experts to help them.  Suffice it to say, in our effort to try to come up with a coordinated plan to fight terrorism, there are going to be some difficult issues. I have great sympathy for Tom Ridge as he tries to bring together these agencies--perhaps 20 agencies--that are going to be involved in this effort. There are going to be some very difficult decisions that have to be made to maximize the talents and work of these agencies.  But it seems to me the idea of having a preexisting database, so that in communities in Florida, and in Oregon, and across this country, if you are hit with a bioterror agent or have a calamity involving a terrorist attack, that you would have a preexisting database of individuals who can help and companies that are willing to donate equipment. That strikes me as eminently doable, something practical that the Government can do to make a real difference. That is why our virtual technology reserve and setting up these databases can make a real difference.  In addition to that virtual technology reserve, the Wyden-Allen bill seeks to move experts into a community as rapidly as possible when problems arise. To that end, in our bill we provide for the creation and certification of national emergency technology guard teams. We call these teams NET guard teams. They would be made up of volunteers with technology and science expertise, and they would be organized in advance and available to be mobilized on short notice.  After consulting at length with leaders in the Bush administration, we have decided that these unique teams ought to be modeled after the urban search and rescue teams that are now under FEMA and the medical response teams under the Department of Health and Human Services. But instead of providing search and rescue or medical services, which, of course, is what is available today, the NET guard teams would provide the technology, information, and communications support to help rescuers work more effectively. Once assembled, NET guard teams can provide technology-related help in the aftermath of floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters as well.  In the testimony Director Allbaugh gave to the subcommittee, we were told that the technology challenges that are facing crises such as the September 11 attacks are not just technology problems, they are problems that ultimately cost lives. The essence of this legislation is about saving lives, and one way it can do that is to establish a structure to form and activatewhat we call NET guard teams of technology experts who can step in when crises occur.  We also think science and technology experts from the Nation's leading private sector companies have a role to play before disaster strikes. Clearly, we need to respond more effectively when there is a disaster. But it is only common sense to utilize the talents and energy of those in the private sector in a preventive way as well, and that is also a key feature of our bipartisan legislation.  Since September 11, thousands of experts and entrepreneurs have contacted the Federal Government offering new technologies. We would like to have those evaluated. That evaluative kind of effort can go forward as we employ a preventive kind of strategy for our leaders in the private sector and for purposes of making sure we accept and evaluate and implement these ideas that are now flooding in from around the country.  We create a Center for Civilian Homeland Security Technology Evaluation. It is going to have two purposes. It will serve as a national clearinghouse for security and emergency response technologies, helping to match companies with innovative technologies with the Government agencies that need them; it would provide a single point of contact to which both companies and Government agencies could turn to have their technology proposals addressed.  What we have heard in our committee--and I have been told as well in the Commerce Committee, and in other forums--is that the private sector really doesn't know where to turn. Should they go to the Department of Health and Human Services? They have been interested in ideas from private sector leaders. Should they go to the Department of Defense? They are interested as well. We establish a center for evaluating technologies, so there will be a central clearinghouse for companies to know where to turn.  More particularly, the center will operate a test bed to evaluate the ability of proposed technologies to satisfy Government needs. This test bed will work in conjunction with existing Federal agencies and the national laboratories. It is not meant to be a technology gatekeeper, somehow having the Federal Government picking winners and losers, but it is designed to assist agencies that are now telling us they do not have the capability to evaluate these technologies on their own. This test bed is necessary, in my view, to keep new technologies from slipping through the cracks.  I don't want to see American lives lost because the Federal Government could not find a way to accommodate fresh, new ideas from our leaders in the technology and science area.  The legislation springs, as I have touched on, from firsthand accounts of what happened on September 11. Here in the Capital and in New York, the terrorist strikes flattened telecommunications and information networks. Many people of New York wandered the streets, unable to find out anything about an injured or missing loved one or even to register their names. Web sites, voice mail, and e-mail systems of relief organizations filled up and crashed.  When emergency workers moved in, they told us they were hindered by the fact that their communications systems could not work together. Courageous emergency workers told our subcommittee that communications breakdowns made their job more difficult and more dangerous as well.  So for that reason, we would establish a pilot program under which grants of $5 million each would be available for seven pilot projects aimed at achieving interoperability of communications systems used by fire, law enforcement, and emergency preparedness and response agencies.  In simple English, what that is all about is making sure the police, fire, and health agencies can communicate with each other. It is probably as important as anything the Government can do. But because in many instances there are overlapping authorities in different systems, we are not making that possible in our country. It involves a lot of complicated issues, many of which the occupant of the chair and I have a chance to wrestle with in the Commerce Committee. Certainly spectrum or forum are a part of it.  At a minimum, we ought to test out through the pilot projects in the bipartisan bill we are introducing today some ideas for making it easier for police, fire, and health to communicate and save the lives of citizens, and certainly make their lives less dangerous as well.  The Nation's top technology companies have been very involved in developing this effort, including Intel, Microsoft, America Online, and Oracle, that have all expressed support for the legislation. All of them believe that creating a high-technology reserve talent bank--a talent bank that serves as a new force to confront a new threat--and the other initiatives proposed in the Wyden-Allen bipartisan legislation make sense. I thank them and other leaders in the private sector for their involvement.  In drafting the legislation, I have consulted with a number of leaders in the administration in the antiterrorism effort, including Director Allbaugh; Richard Clarke, the President's Special Advisor for Cybersecurity; Commerce Secretary Donald Evans; and John Marburger of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. To a person, they have been very responsive and they have met us more than halfway in terms of making their own time and that of their staffs available. Senator Allen and I appreciate their bipartisan commitment.  I pledge tonight to continue to work with them and, on a bipartisan basis, with the administration and with colleagues in the Congress on both sides of the aisle, to move this bill forward as rapidly as possible.  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support from several of the Nation's leading technology companies be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Intel Corporation,                                  Santa Clara, CA, March 18, 2002.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I write to express our support for the      ``Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act'', your      legislation--soon to be introduced--that would establish a      national emergency technology guard and a civilian homeland      security evaluation center within NIST. This legislation      would provide a means for enhancing emergency response and      recovery of information technology infrastructure in the      event of major disasters such as the events on September 11      of last year.       A national strategy for ensuring the resiliency of our IT      infrastructure against attacks and natural disasters is long      overdue, particularly as our country has become increasingly      dependent on the interconnected digital network. We look      forward to working with you on the details of this      legislation in committee and on the floor as it moves toward      enactment.       Again, we applaud your leadership and forward vision on the      need for strengthening our information technology backbone.           Sincerely,                                                  Andrew S. Grove,     Chairman of the Board.                                  ____                                           Oracle Corporation,                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2002.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     United States Senate, Washington, DC.       Senator Wyden: I am writing to express Oracle's support for      the ``Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act'',      your proposed legislation that would establish a national      emergency technology guard, and a ``virtual technology      reserve'' consisting of a database of private sector      equipment and expertise that emergency officials may call      upon in an emergency. This legislation would improve and      enhance emergency response capabilities, particularly the      recovery of information technology infrastructure, in the      event of major disasters such as the events on September 11      of last year.       As you well know, this country has become increasingly      dependent on continued operation of its vast information      networks. That is why a national strategy to ensure the      resiliency and continued operation of our information      technology infrastructure against attacks and national      disasters is critical. Oracle looks forward to working with      you on the details of your proposal as it moves through the      legislative process.       On behalf of Oracle, thank you for your leadership on      issues important to maintaining our nation's technology      infrastructure.           Sincerely,                                                Robert P. Hoffman,     Director.                                  ____                                        Microsoft Corporation,                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2002.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     United States Senator, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: We welcome the opportunity to comment      on your legislation to create a reserve of technology and      science experts capable of responding to national     cyber emergencies. We applaud your ongoing leadership on this      and other key technology matters in the United State Senate.       Microsoft is deeply engaged in security matters. Our      Trustworthy Computing Initiative, recently announced by Bill      Gates, places a primary emphasis on security, privacy and      reliability across our products, services and operations.       We agree with you that, in case of a national cyber      emergency, the Federal Government should draw upon the      brightest minds in industry in its efforts to protect Federal      agencies and other critical entities. In fact, on September      11th our Chief Security Officer was called to active military      duty to support the government's response to the attacks. He      recently left Microsoft to become the Vice Chairman of the      President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.       We view your focus on a National Emergency Technology      Guard, like our Trustworthy Computing Initiative, as a means      to strengthen America's cybersecurity via better trained      personnel.       We thank you again for the opportunity to comment on this      matter and commend you once again for your ongoing leadership      in cybersecurity.           Sincerely,                                                   Jack Krumholtz,         Director, Federal Government Affairs, Associated General      Counsel.                                  ____                                              AOL Time Warner,                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2002.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Hon. George Allen,     United States Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden and Senator Allen: On behalf of AOL Time      Warner, I would like to express my appreciation for your      efforts and leadership in the area of antiterrorism and      disaster response, including the development of legislation      to address this critical issue.       September 11th forever changed the way our country thinks      about crisis response and emergency management, and has made      all of us realize the importance of working together as a      team when disaster strikes. Like so many other organizations      and individuals across the country and around the world, we      at AOL Time Warner watched with horror as the tragic events      of that day unfolded--and did what we could to contribute to      the immediate needs of the emergency response personnel, from      financial and humanitarian assistance to technical support.       Since that time, we have participated in numerous      discussions, including several ongoing initiatives led by the      Administration, about both how to prevent such a catastrophe      in the future and how to mitigate the effects of such a      disaster should the unthinkable occur again. It is clear from      these discussions and from our experiences on that day, that      one of the most critical objectives in formulating a disaster      response strategy is to ensure the functioning of our      communications infrastructure in the event of an emergency.       Your legislation, ``The Science Technology Emergency      Mobilization Act,'' recognizes the important role played by      volunteers--like those from our company and countless and      countless others across the nation--in providing technical      assistance to enhance communication in times of crisis, and      creates a mechanism for coordinating and deploying such      assistance in a systematic fashion during a national      emergency. We believe that this type of voluntary partnership      between industry and government is vital to ensuring that      disaster response and recovery efforts are coordinated and      effective.       We are grateful for your work on this issue of such      importance to our nation, and look forward to continuing to      work with both Congress and the Administration on matters      relating to security and critical infrastructure.           Sincerely,                                                  Susan A. Brophy,          Senior Vice President, Domestic Public Policy, AOL Time      Warner.                          ____________________
