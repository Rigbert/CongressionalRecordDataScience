Mr. Chairman, there are no provisions in this bill that prevent the FAA from taking up the idea of separate entrances for pilots in airliners. That idea could be a solution to some of our air security problems, and deserves serious consideration and study at the FAA.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), newly elected, and I hope he will be reelected.
