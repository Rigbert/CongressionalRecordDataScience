President, those of us working constructively and in a bipartisan way to extend the USA PATRIOT Act with improvements have repeatedly offered to meet to work out the remaining differences. Sadly, the Senate leadership has not made the effort to work through the remaining concerns or brought us together.  I have continued meeting and talking with interested Republican and Democratic Senators. Senate staff has finally gotten together this week in a bipartisan meeting. I urge the majority leader to bring together key interested Senators to work out a bipartisan compromise that improves the failed conference report.  A majority of Senators--Republicans and Democrats, those who voted against cloture on the conference report that failed to pass the Senate and those who voted for it urged the Republican leader to act on a short-term, 3-month extension before the end of the last session. Instead, he chose to proceed with a 6-month extension that Republicans in the House found objectionable. That led to the short extension that is about to expire this week. The President had said that he would not approve a short-term extension. House Republicans had said that they would not allow a short-term extension. But just before Christmas they demanded and enacted a shorter extension than anyone else had proposed.  As soon as it became apparent that the conference report filed by the Republican leadership would be unacceptable to the Senate, I joined on Thursday, December 8, in urging a 3-month extension to work out a better bill. On the first day the Senate was next in session, Monday, December 12, Senator Sununu and I introduced such a bill, S.2082. We sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to other Senators on December 13 and that bipartisan bill was cosponsored by 46 other Senators. That bill would have extended the PATRIOT Act until March 31, 2006, to allow us all to work out the remaining differences andimprove this reauthorization legislation in ways to better protect the rights of ordinary Americans. It proposed a commonsense solution to allow us to take a few more weeks to get this right for all Americans.  Contrary to the false claims and misrepresentations by some, there was no effort on either side of the aisle to do away with the PATRIOT Act. That is just not true. Along with others here in the Senate, I am seeking to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. There is no reason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both effective and that adequately protects their rights and their privacy. The only people who were threatening an expiration of the PATRIOT Act were the President and House Republicans. As I noted on December 21, the administration and the Republican congressional leadership were the ones who were objecting to extending the act and threatening to have it expire. That was wrong. That made no sense. They came to their senses in the days that followed. But now, as we approach the expiration of the current extension this Friday, the Republican congressional leadership has taken no further action and we risk sections of the PATRIOT Act expiring, again.  Republican and Democratic Senators joined together last month to say we can do better to protect Americans' liberties while ensuring our national security is as strong as it can be. In the days after 9/11 we acted as Americans, not Democrats, not Republicans. The President's political adviser Karl Rove and the rest of those who are seeking to make the PATRIOT Act a partisan political issue should instead join with our bipartisan coalition and work with us to provide a better balance to protect the rights of Americans.  Every single Senator--Republican and Democratic--voted last July to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act. That bipartisan solution was cast aside by the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders when they hijacked the conference report, rewrote the bill in ways that fell short in protecting basic civil liberties and then tried to ram it through Congress as an all-or-nothing proposition. I have joined with Senators of both parties in an effort to work to improve the bill. Some of us are working hard to protect the security and liberty of Americans. What is wrong is for the White House to manipulate this into a partisan fight for its partisan political advantage. Instead of playing partisan politics, the Bush administration and Republican congressional leadership should join in trying to improve the law.  This is a vital debate. The terrorist threat to America's security is very real, and it is vital that we be armed with the tools needed to protect Americans' security. At the same time, however, the threat to civil liberties is also very real in America today. The question is not whether the Government should have the tools it needs to protect the American people. Of course it should. That is why I coauthored the PATRIOT Act 5 years ago, and that is why that Act passed with broad bipartisan support. When I voted for the PATRIOT Act, I did not think it was an ideal piece of legislation, and I knew that it would need careful oversight and, in due course, reform. None of us wants the PATRIOT Act to expire, and those who threatened to let it expire rather than fix it play a dangerous game.  This is about how to reconcile two shared and fundamental goals--ensuring the safety of the American people and protecting their liberty by means of a system of checks and balances that keeps the Government--their Government--accountable. Those goals are not the goals of any particular party or ideology; they are shared American goals. How to balance security with liberty and Government accountability was the most fundamental dilemma with which the Framers of our Constitution wrestled, and how to adjust that balance in the post-9/11 world is a fundamental dilemma before this Congress.  Our Nation is a democracy, founded on the principles of balanced government. We need to restore checks and balances in this country to protect us all and all that we hold dear. Our Congress and our courts provide checks on the abuse of executive authority and should protect our liberties. Congress must write the law so it provides not just a check on Presidential power but also a clear role for the courts. All Americans need to take notice and need to demand that their liberties be maintained. We can do better and must do better for the American people.                          ____________________[Pages S362-S363]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       IMPROVING THE PATRIOT ACT
