 President, following the previous agreement, all amendments had to be filed by 11:30. I think it is a little past 11:30. We should now have all of the amendments.  At this time, I would like to review with my ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, all amendments that have been filed.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
