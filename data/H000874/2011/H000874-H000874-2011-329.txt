Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of Hyattsville, Maryland, as it celebrates its 125th anniversary. Throughout its long and rich history, the growing population of the city of Hyattsville has seen advances in education, industry, as well as preservation, illustrating the important role the city and its citizens have played in the economic and historic nature of our region.  Before its founding, the area was a pivotal settlement in the development of the region due to the area's waterways and American Indian trails. In the early 1700s European settlers had begun making land purchases in the region and in March of 1885, Christopher Clark Hyatt became the first landowner in the district which was later designated Hyattsville in his honor. Although its name was unofficial, Hyattsville became a distinguished community due to its proximity to railroad tracks and telegraph lines, and quickly established itself as a celebrated city among its year-round residents. Due to easy access to the Anacostia River and Victorian mansions, Hyattsville also held a reputation as a summer residence for those living nearby. In April of 1886, the Act of Incorporation of the City of Hyattsville was enacted, and since then Hyattsville, Maryland, has been transformed into a thriving suburb of Washington, DC.  Hyattsville has certainly progressed throughout its 125 years, yet still maintains its historic magnetism. Existing inside of the Capital Beltway, Hyattsville provides its residents easy access to Washington, DC, and still utilizes its long-standing railroads with Metro access and light rail service. Contemporary town homes, apartments, and condominiums have blossomed throughout the recent history of Hyattsville, while its Historic District maintains structures that exhibit late-19th and early-20th century style. Although new shopping centers like University Town Center and The Mall at Prince Georges provide modernized entertainment and employment opportunity, revitalization of businesses in downtown Hyattsville allow conservation of the city's 125 year history.  It is my honor to recognize and congratulate the city of Hyattsville, Maryland, and its residents on its 125th Anniversary and acknowledge its many achievements.                          ____________________
