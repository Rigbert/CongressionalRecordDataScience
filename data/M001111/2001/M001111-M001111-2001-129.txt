  I would reiterate, again, that we are ready to go to final passage at a moment's notice. We could wrap this bill up in the next half hour quite easily. We have a managers' package. I do not believe there is any other Senator who has any requests out there. We could pass the managers' package and move to third reading within a few minutes and Senators could go home for the weekend.  I know many Senators have called and said: Can we finish? I have a noon flight I need to catch. I know that planes are leaving and people have plans for this weekend. I certainly would like them to be able to go home and see their families. I would like to go home and see my family, of course, but I am willing to stay here if that is what we need to do. And I will stay here because what is in this bill is so critically important to my constituents at home who are now sitting in traffic at 7:30 in the morning.  Many of them are traveling to work right now, probably sitting in traffic on the Alaskan Way Viaduct or the I-5 corridor because we have failed to do our job.
