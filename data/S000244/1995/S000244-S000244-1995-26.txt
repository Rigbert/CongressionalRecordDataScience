Chairman, we are pleased to accept this amendment. I believe that the gentleman from Florida has made an extremely valuable contribution to this bill.  Obviously safety cannot be compromised with the space shuttle, because if we should have another disaster, America is out of manned space exploration for a generation. That is why I believe that mandating the Administrator of NASA to place safety first and going to a single prime contractor, as is proposed by the gentleman from Florida, puts the horse before the cart, and that is really important if we are to have a viable space program for generations to come.
