President, I rise today in support of the legislation introduced by Senator Wyden, of which I am an original cosponsor, the `Hospice Evaluation and Legitimate Payment Act.' The HELP Act.  The HELP Act does what the title says it does and takes initial steps in helping our hospices in Kansas and across the Nation continue to give the valuable care that patients and families need.  It is impossible to describe the value of hospice services to the patients and families for whom they provide selfless and compassionate care. Over the next 10 years hospice is facing drastic reductions in their reimbursements, negatively impacting at least 1.3 million patients and families, which is the number served by hospice programs in recent years.  The HELP Act sets realistic requirements for a face-to-face encounter. The Accountable Care Act included a requirement that a hospice physician or nurse practitioner should have a face-to-face encounter with hospice patients before their 180-day recertification and for each 60-day recertification period after that date, has caused a significant burden on our hospice communities, especially those in rural areas. The limits on who can conduct the face-to-face encounter and the timeline for compliance do not reflect the operational realities of hospice programs, especially for small and rural hospices. The HELP Act would allow Nurse Practitioners, Clinical Nurse Specialists and Physician's Assistants to conduct the face-to-face encounter, and that hospice programs be afforded 7 days after the election of services to fulfill the requirement.  The HELP Act would require the Secretary to establish a payment reform demonstration program to test any prospective payment revisions to hospice, and would include an evaluation period for data analysis; increase the frequency of hospice surveys to every 3 years; and would amend the new face-to-face encounter statutory framework to reflect operational realities for hospice programs, and the needs of the patients and families they serve.  Under this legislation the new payment methodologies for hospice must first be piloted through a 2-year, 15-site demonstration program to allow for any recommended payment reform schemes to be tested across a representative sample of the hospice community and to assess their impact on beneficiary access to hospice services.  The HELP Act also requires more frequent hospice surveys. A recent Office of the Inspector General's, OIG, report noted that CMS was remiss in its supervisory responsibilities by not regularly reviewing the operational and clinical delivery processes of the hospice community. OIG has recommended on numerous occasions that ``CMS should conduct more frequent certification surveys of hospices as a way to enforce the requirements.'' Accrediting organizations, such as the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, JCAHO, have set an industry standard of certification every 3 years for hospices. The HELP Act requires an initial survey for those seeking certification to be followed by a standard survey every 3 years.  While there is more work that needs to be done to address payment reductions for hospice providers, the HELP Act takes some initial steps to addressing these problems. I am grateful to my colleague Senator Wyden for introducing this legislation and I am happy to lend my support. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to review and consider supporting this very important piece of legislation.                          ____________________
