My question is this: Aren't the steps I have outlined here today commonsense, practical steps, whether it is a hate-inspired attack? We have seen the human toll that discrimination takes against those who are targeted on the basis of hate. We have seen what it means to families who have been struck by terror. But aren't the steps that have been outlined here by you and colleagues on the floor--Senator Casey, with his very valuable proposal--commonsense legislative efforts that make sense whether this has been primarily a terror attack or a hate-inspired attack?
