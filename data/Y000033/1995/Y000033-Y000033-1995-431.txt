Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce the Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation Act of 1994. When enacted, this legislation will ratify an agreement to settle a longstanding and difficult dispute between the National Park Service and Alaska Native landowners over the use of all-terrain vehicles--or ATV's for access for subsistence purposes in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.  The residents of Anaktuvuk Pass and the National Park Service have had a longstanding dispute over the use by village residents, of certain ATV's for substance purposes on national park and wilderness lands adjacent to the village. In an effort to resolve this conflict, Arctic Slope Regional Corp.--the regional corporation established by the Inupiat Eskimo people of Alaska's North Slope under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA], Nunamuit Corp.--the Anaktuvuk Pass ANCSA Village Corp.--the city of Anaktuvuk Pass and the National Park Service have entered into an innovative agreement both guaranteeing dispersed ATV access on specific tracts of park land and limiting development of Native land in the area. The agreement will limit the types of ATV's allowed and will also lead to enhanced recreational opportunities by improving public access across Native lands.  The village of Anaktuvuk Pass is located on the North Slope of Alaska in the remote Brooks Mountain Range, completely within the boundary of and surrounded by the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Village residents have long relied upon the use of ATV's for summer access to subsistence resources, primarily caribou, on certain of these nearby park, and park wilderness lands. As there are no rivers near the community for motorboat access to park lands, ATC's provide the primary means by which to reach and transport game in the summer. The only alternative to ATV use is to walk which is not feasible in these remote areas. Snowmobiles are the primary mode of transportation for subsistence activities in the winter.  With the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA] in 1980, Congress expressly reserved the rights of rural Alaska residents to continued, reasonable access to subsistence resources on public lands, by providing in section 811(a) of that [[Page E16]] act, ``rural residents engaged in subsistence uses shall have reasonable access to subsistence resources on public lands.'' Section 811(b) of ANILCA provides further that ``the Secretary shall permit on the public lands appropriate use for subsistence purposes of snowmobiles, motorboats, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed for such purposes by local residents, subject to reasonable regulation.'' The National Park Service and the Native landowners disagree about whether ATV's are other means of surface transportation traditionally employed for subsistence purposes in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. But there is no dispute that ATV's are necessary for the summertime subsistence activities of the residents of Anaktuvuk Pass.  Following several years of discussions, the Native landowners and the National Park Service have reached an agreement which will finally resolve the ATV controversy on the public lands surrounding Anaktuvuk Pass. In April 1992, the Park Service issued a final legislative environmental impact statement embracing the proposed agreement, and in November 1992, the Secretary of the Interior endorsed the agreement in a Record of Decision. The parties executed the agreement on December 17, 1992.  The parties have since executed two technical amendments to the original agreement.  The agreement involves an exchange of land and interests in lands between the Native landowners and the Park Service. Specifically, the Federal Government will convey in fee approximately 30,642 acres of park land to Arctic Slop Regional Corp. and Nunamuit Corp. On the Federal land conveyed to the Native corporations, the National Park Service will reserve surface and subsurface access and development rights as well as broad public access easements. In addition, certain nonwilderness areas of federally owned park land will be opened to dispersed ATV use. In return, the Native landowners will convey to the Federal Government approximately 38,840 acres in fee for inclusion in both the national park and national wilderness systems. Native landowners will also convey to the Park Service additional surface and subsurface development rights on 86,307 acres as well as a series of conservation, scenic, and public access easements on other Native-owned lands within the boundaries of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Finally, the city of Anaktuvuk Pass will convey a city lot to the National Park Service for administrative purposes.  Congressional ratification of this agreement will be required in order to remove 73,993 acres of Federal land from the National Wilderness Preservation System, as well as to designate approximately 56,825 acres of other park and presently Native-owned lands as new national wilderness. If ratified by Congress, the agreement will expressly authorize dispersed ATV use on certain lands within the park boundary. Without congressional approval, the agreement will become null and void, and none of the conveyances or creation of easements proposed by the agreement will occur.  It is intended that this agreement will resolve the longstanding dispute over subsistence use of ATV's only on public lands in and around Anaktuvuk Pass. It is important to note that neither this agreement nor the accompanying Federal legislation will diminish, or otherwise affect in any way, anyone's rights and privileges to access public lands in Alaska for subsistence purposes. This agreement does not conform or deny that ATV access to public lands for subsistence use is a statutorily protected traditional access right under ANILCA, and consequently, this agreement does not purport to resolve this issue.  As discussed previously, this legislation would remove 73,993 acres of wilderness from the park and designate 56,825 acres of new wilderness. Consistent with agreements reached during the 103d session, 13,168 acres of wilderness will be designated along the Nigu River, adjacent to the park, hence, a no-net-loss, no-net-gain of wilderness in the area.                          ____________________
