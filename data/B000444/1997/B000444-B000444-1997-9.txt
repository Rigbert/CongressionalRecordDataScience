 President, on Tuesday, Americans from around the country gathered here at the Capitol to hold a rally in conjunction with Brain Tumor Awareness Week. I want to add my voice to those calling attention to this debilitating disease and to the calls for continuing to increase our funding for medical research.  It sounds wrong to call one debilitating disease more important than another. After all, a life-threatening disease is a life-threatening disease. However, as a society, we often get caught up in the rhetoric and publicity surrounding one of these terrible afflictions and forget that, unfortunately, there are a number of other terminal illnesses. While brain tumors do not receive as much press as other terminal illnesses, their impact on the lives of brain tumor patients and their families is equally devastating.  One of those people is a constituent of mine, Ms. Kathy Delledonne-Minutola. She and her husband attended the rally on Tuesday because, four years ago, their son Joseph was diagnosed with a brain stem tumor. The roots of the tumor have wrapped around Joseph's brain stem, a condition which makes removal of the tumor impossible.  Mr. President, there are thousands of people across this country who have been diagnosed with brain tumors, just like Joseph. In fact, each year approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a braintumor. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death for children and young adults up to age 34, and they are one of the fastest growing causes of cancer death in the elderly.  Furthermore, each patient is different, and potential for recovery depends on a number of factors. The type of tumor, its location, the area of the brain involved, and the forms of therapy the patient will receive all contribute to a patient's prognosis. Currently, there is no cure for most malignant brain tumors. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are the three most common treatments. However, because brain tumors are located at the control center for human thought, emotion, and movement, both the tumor and its treatment can have devastating effects on a person's physical and cognitive abilities.  Despite often bleak projections for recovery, however, the community of people who have been affected by this disease has refused to give up. Their courage and support for one another in the face of tragedy is truly inspirational. They are proof that the power of the human spirit can triumph over adversity in even the darkest of moments.  So, Mr. President, in this, Brain Tumor Awareness Week, I rise today to applaud the tireless commitment that brain tumor patients and their families have made to beating this disease. This is a remarkable group of people. However, they cannot take on the burden of finding a cure on their own. We in Congress need to help, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, as I have in the past, to support medical research funding. While Brain Tumor Awareness Week may only last seven days, our commitment to finding a cure must be a year-round endeavor.                          ____________________
