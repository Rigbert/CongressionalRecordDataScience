Chairman, I would like to make two points. First, under the present procedure, whether or not court records are sealed is a matter of judicial discretion. I believe it ought to be kept that way. The judge who presided over the case, and assuming that there is a settlement offer that is coming before the court for approval, makes a determination on whether or not sealing the records is a reasonable request, and I think we ought to, in this instance, trust the judges to represent what is in the public interest.  This has to be done on a case-by-case basis. That is not to say that all records should be sealed, but it also is not to say that all records should be open, which is what the gentleman from New York is proposing.  The second problem with this amendment is, I think, what the gentleman from New York is trying to do is to do the work for lawyers in subsequent lawsuits on the same issue. Rather than doing their own discovery and findings out their own facts, they can simply go to the courthouse and rummage through the records that are already on file. Consequently, they end up not having to do as much work.  Mr. Chairman, we all know that most of these types of cases are taken on a contingency fee basis. By opening up the records and not having the lawyers do the work that they would have to do, they are going to end up spending less time, but their fees are not going to be reduced, because the fees are a certain percentage of the amount that is recovered.  For all these reasons, I think this amendment is a bad one, and ought to be defeated.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
