Speaker, today, the Committee on Resources held a hearing on the coming fire season in the West. Officials of the Bush administration predicted that arguably, this could be the worst fire season in the Nation's history. So far, so good. They are looking out for our resources, our communities, our people.  Unfortunately, they went on to say that because the President shorted the budget and the Congress agreed with the President, that there is only about half the money in that budget that they expect they are going to need to fight the fires this year. Last year, a pretty bad fire season, but not the worst in history, the Forest Service ran out of money in August. Now, they cannot stop fighting the fires, so what do they do? Well, they go out and rob other Forest Service programs that are already underfunded. Over the last few years, they have gone and canceled fuel reduction contracts; that is, preventing the intensity or the possibility or probability of future fires through thinning and other activities, they actually would rob that program to pay for fighting this year's fires. But they do not learn their lesson.  Over the last 5 years, the average spent to fight fires by the Federal agencies has been $1.2 billion. So what did the President ask for and the Republican Congress give him in this year's budget? Mr. Speaker, $600 million, one-half of that amount. We are going into the worst fire year in history with less than one-half of the 5-year average. Even worse, just a few days ago, the Bush administration grounded all the tanker planes, because they cannot coordinate between the FAA and the BLM and the Forest Service and they cannot work out some paperwork on certifying whether or not these planes are safe or not. So our first line of defense, the heaviest line of defense we have, that which I know has saved the lives of firefighters and has saved homes and communities, is grounded.  Fourteen months ago I anticipated this problem and wrote to the Forest Service and they said, oh, do not worry, we have a plan. Their plan is a whole bunch of small planes and helicopters and yes, they can perform a valuable function, but they cannot get very quickly to distant fires, they cannot drop the huge loads that are sometimes needed to save a fire crew or stop a fire from breaching a hill and going down into a community or engulfing ahouse. We will not have that tool this year, because they did not plan.  Now they say, well, they are trying to figure out where they might borrow the money to fight the fires. Might borrow the money. That means going back and decimating already underfunded programs in the Forest Service, maybe fuel reduction again, recreation most probably, capital investment improvements, all sorts of things that are detrimental to the resource and the public lands.  I have a novel idea. Why do they not instead be honest about how much money they need and come to the Congress from the White House with the President's support and ask for what they think they will need to fight this year's fires? Ask for another $600 million. Yes, it is a lot of money, but we cannot ignore this problem. We could better prepare if they knew they had the money on hand. Instead of people scrambling around the Forest Service looking for other budgets to rob, they could be training more initial attack teams.  We got a report on the Biscuit Fire, a huge fire in southern Oregon a couple of years ago, which says there were no initial attack teams available. It is reported by some observers from California that the big southern branch of that fire was isolated to a couple of trees on one ridge on the first day. Now, if we had been able to get an initial attack team in there, but again, because of underfunding they were not available for days, we might have been able to prevent the whole southern branch of that cataclysmic fire.  So what is going to happen this year? They proudly say, well, they get 98 percent of those sorts of things. That is true. But if the 2 percent of the ones that they do not get, or even the 1 percent, are huge destructive fires that destroy resources, that destroy communities, that maybe even take lives, then is that not kind of a faulty way to save money? They say, well, we do not want all of those young people sitting around waiting for the initial attack teams; that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Well, it cost $200 million to fight that fire. So we could have spent a couple of thousand dollars to have young people trained. If there really are not any fires going on, let us put them out there and do some trail maintenance or something else; they can certainly do that work too if that is what we are paying them for. But when the fires are already starting to burn, to have them ready to go at a moment's notice is crucial and critical and could stop and prevent a huge catastrophic loss of resource, loss of life, loss of property.  That is a good Federal investment. I do not begrudge paying those young men and women who are going to risk their lives for a little bit of down time when we are going to use them sometimes 3, 4, 5, 6 days straight a week or 2 later.  So I find that this administration is just being so shortsighted. They can see the problem: The most catastrophic predicted fire in history, they grounded the tanker planes, asked for and got only half the money they think they are going to need; we will lack the initial attack teams and a whole host of other things we need to do. We are going to short the communities for their fire prevention programs, their cooperative fire management and other things where we help communities fireproof themselves and homeowners with a little bit of Federal matching money and assistance.  What is wrong with this administration? Why will they not ask for the money they need to protect our people, our communities, our resources?                          ____________________
