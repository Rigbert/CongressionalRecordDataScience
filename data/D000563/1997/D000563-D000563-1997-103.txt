President, I rise today to honor the people of India on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of India's independence.  Independence days, like birthdays, are for celebrating. And we have much to celebrate in United States-India relations. The friendship between the Indian and American people today is stronger and more deeply rooted than ever--deeply rooted because it is based on shared values, and strong because it is shared by more Indians and more Americans than ever before.  The friendship between the United States and India is a friendship that goes back to the beginnings of the American Nation. In fact, the first Asian Indian-American is said to have come to the United States 200 years ago.  It is a friendship that was strengthened when the United States supported Indian independence in 1947. It was strengthened again when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi during the American civil rights movement. And it was strengthened most recently when India embarked on its bold strategy of economic openness.  It is a friendship based on mutual respect and understanding--understanding that the problems we face are mutual problems. In a shrinking world, India's challenges and India's successes are also those of the United States. Because radicalism and terrorism threaten all civilized countries, especially democracies. Because in a world economy, one nation cannot long prosper while its neighbors do not.  India and the United States stand on the threshold of a new era. In just the past few years, India has flung open its doors to the world, and emerged as a rising star on the world scene. We should commit ourselves to continue the progress of recent years.  We have a great advantage in this effort. It is the Indian-American community. Indian-Americans are the magnet that will keep India and the United States moving closer together, making our friendship worthy of the world's largest and oldest democracies.  Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of a resolution in the Senate designating August 15, 1997 as ``Indian Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Indian and American Democracy.'' This resolution reaffirms the democratic principles on which the United States and India were established, and it requests that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And to the people of India, Indian-Americans, and all those who support the ideals of liberty and democracy, I wish you a happy independence day!                          ____________________
