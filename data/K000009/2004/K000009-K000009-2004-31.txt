Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, in closing today, I would just like to ask the Members of this House to think about the communities that they represent, how many farmers markets, how many potential farmers markets, how many roadside stands could be helped by additional marketing authority. We are not taking or creating any new money here. We are just moving money from an information account to a direct-market account for farmers to put income in their pockets through direct marketing of their own product, made and grown and harvested with their own hard labor. And I am always proud to stand up on behalf of the farmers of our country and try to help them find new ways to the market.  I would urge the membership to vote in favor of the Kaptur amendment for farmers markets across this country.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
