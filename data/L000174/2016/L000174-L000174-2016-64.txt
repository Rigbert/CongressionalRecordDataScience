President, I have come to this floor many times to speak about the toll the abuse of prescription opioids and heroin has taken on our communities. When I talk with Vermonters about this crisis, whether at our Judiciary Committee field hearings in Vermont or in conversations at kitchen tables or on street corners, I hear how opioid abuse destroys lives, tears apart families, and overwhelms communities.  As a lifelong Vermonter, I am proud of our small State. I see law enforcement and community leaders joining together. They have taken a real constructive approach to fighting addiction. They have created innovative and successful programs, such as the Rapid Intervention Community Court in Burlington and Project VISION in Rutland. The Boys & Girls Clubs throughout Vermont are working with schools and public health officials to help children affected by this epidemic. They are trying to keep them from being swept up into that world. Our local television stations are participating in public awareness campaigns. They are educating our citizens about drug abuse. These are the positive efforts that make me proud to be a Vermonter. But I am not just here to praise the good work in my State. I am here to work for my State and for all States that are coping with this drug addiction scourge--because all States are.  Earlier this year, Congress took an important step forward by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. This new law treats addiction as the public health crisis it is. I was proud to support this legislation in the Senate. But the final product fell short. CARA did not include the funding necessary to put its programs to work. The final legislation stripped out many of the best practices that were included in the Senate bill, including, among others, my provision to authorize the anti-heroin task force program I helped to establish. This provision was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate, and I thank my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--who joined with me on that. But it was stripped out at the last minute by the House. That was really a shortsighted decision. It could hamper law enforcement agencies' ability to keep illegal opioids out of our communities.  So today I am introducing bipartisan legislation along with Senator Grassley to help ensure that State and local law enforcement agencies can get the necessary funding and the support for anti-heroin task forces around the country. Our bill would authorize the Attorney General to provide grants to law enforcement agencies--those agencies that are engaged in statewide collaborative efforts to investigate and stop the unlawful trafficking of heroin, fentanyl, carfentanil, and prescription opioids. The bill also authorizes grants to support task forces to combat the trafficking of methamphetamines.  Our States are seeing an influx of powerful, deadly opioids that have never been seen by law enforcement before. Communities that have been struggling with heroin and prescription drug abuse are now encountering opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil. What is so frightening about these is that they can kill the user even in small amounts. So I think we have a responsibility--all of us in Congress--to support smart policies and reduce the demand for these poisons. We must support targeted enforcement efforts to keep them out of our communities in the first place.  Now, I know these task forces work. Last month I heard from Vermont law enforcement officials who shared examples of how the Vermont Drug Task Force is helping to combat heroin trafficking in our State. The Vermont Drug Task Force has seen a significant increase in heroin investigations so far this year--up 70 percent from the same period last year. The task force has seized the equivalent of more than 94,000 bags of heroin this year alone, with a street value of more than $1 million. Now, in an urban area that might not seem like much, but our State has 625,000 people. The largest city in our State has 38,000 people. We are being hammered by this.  But there is good news. The recent addition of five new investigative positions, as a result of Vermont's $1.4 million anti-heroin task force grant, could not come at a more critical time. So this legislation will provide the anti-heroin task force program with the resources they need to help more States, just like it is helping in Vermont.  I say this because we should know and the American public should know that our work in Congress on opioid abuse and addiction did not end when we passed CARA. In fact, I would say that it only began. If we are serious about combating drug addiction--and all of us will say we are against it, but if we are really serious--then we have to invest in our communities. Let us build on what we know is working. Let us give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to do their job effectively.  In my State of Vermont, I spend considerable time every month. I was there just a couple of days ago. We are a special State because you can talk with people. My wife Marcelle and I will talk with people coming out of church on Sunday or in the grocery store or just walking down the street to pick up our paper. Some of the stories we hear are so sad. We hear from people we have known for years--wonderful families, pillars of the community--who will tell us of their son or daughter suffering from opioid and other addictions. The saddest, though, are those people we have known who have lost a member of their family because of the powerful new drugs coming on the market.  I saw a lot of terrible things in this area when I was a prosecutor, but nothing like what we are seeing today. So let us look at the legislation that Senator Grassley and I are introducing. Let us stop trying to fight this with slogans and goodwill. Let us fight it with real tools.  Again, I would add, let us not just rely--any of us--on saying we are against this. Let us do something. It is too bad the House stripped out much of what we had done well in our bill, but there is no reason why we cannot fight to put it back in. There is no reason why we cannot get the funding necessary. This will only work if we have the tools and the money.  I know that in our State it is not just law enforcement but the faith community, educators, parents, Boys & Girls Clubs, and medical professionals who are all working together. It is not just numbers. Every one of us--almost every one of us in our State--knows people who have suffered. I want to go back home and say that we are doing something to help them.                                 ______                                       By
