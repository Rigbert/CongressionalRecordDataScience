President, first of all, I would like to get into some of the legal background. For the legal analysis, let me start by mentioning Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld who was the author of the seminal Fundamental Legal Conceptions, a powerful and enduring analysis of the nature of rights and the implications of liberty. Hohfeld noted that rights correlate to duties. A has a duty to B if B has a right against A. If A has no duty, that means B has no right and A has liberty, are the terms that he used. Such Hohfeldian analysis applies here.  My amendment makes clear that nobody has a right or entitlement to sue the Federal workers or the Federal Government for services or materials in languages other than English. In Hohfeldian terms, the Federal Government has no duty to provide services or materials in languages other than English, but the Federal Government is free to do so. In other words, they are not compelled to do it, but they may do it, they have the authority to do that.  The question has been asked: How does this amendment affect the X program? Will the Federal Government be free to offer X service or material in Y language? The answer is, yes, the Federal Government is at liberty to offer, can offer, X services or whatever the program is, in whatever language seems to be appropriate, but the Federal Government only has the duty to offer X services and Y language if a statute creates that right.  In other words, we are talking about English as the national language. We are talking about certain exceptions that are written into law, and we have said on page 2 that I have read several times, ``unless otherwise authorized or provided by law.''  That means there are many cases where that would be the case. Again, such examples exist, such as the Voting Rights Act, which provides for bilingual ballots, and the Court Interpreters Act of 1978, which provides for translation services in the Federal courts.  Prior to 1978, there was no such act, and that was not the case. This does not change the decision in the change in law that took place in 1978.  For over 30 years, the courts have ruled uniformly and consistently on these matters, of providing services and materials in languages other than English. Federal courts have rejected attempts to equate a person's language with their national origin in dozens of court cases. This is what I referred to. It seems to me perhaps the other side is trying to say they are one and the same.  But the Federal courts have rejected the attempts to equate a person's language with their national origin in dozens of court cases and court decisions going back more than 30 years. Therefore, any expansion of the concept of national origin to encompass a theory repeatedly rejected by the Federal courts must come explicitly from Congress. It must be a law. It must be something that Congress proposes and passes and not be imposed by a flawed or arbitrary interpretation of the law. Today the Senate is stating that there is no right, entitlement or claim to services and materials in any language other than English. That is assuming we pass our amendment.  I will mention just three of the long, unbroken line of court cases spanning over 30 years.  In 1983 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined in Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, which the Supreme Court let stand, that there is no right to government forms in languages other than English.  In 1994 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined in Toure v. U.S. that there is no right to government deportation notices in languages other than English.  The most recent United States Supreme Court case in this area is Sandoval v. Alexander, the Alabama driver's license case. Justice Scalia wrote the decision in Sandoval in 2001.  The Supreme Court in Sandoval rejected the equation of language and national origin.  Indeed, the Federal courts have repeatedly considered and rejected just this equation of the failure to provide foreign language services and materials with a violation of the prohibition against national origin discrimination.  There is no support in the legislative history or judicial interpretations of title VI for the right or entitlement to Federal Government services or materials in languages other than English. Executive Order 13166 purported to interpret title VI, but it was written before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval.  This amendment now clarifies in Federal statute the line of cases culminating in the United States Supreme Court decision in the Sandoval case. Here we are making clear that there is no legal basis for Executive Order 13166 that purported to direct services and materials in languages other than English. I state it again clearly: There shall be no right or entitlement to services or materials in languages other than English.  I ask unanimous consent additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Legislative History       The legislative history does not support a language-based      definition of national origin. The Supreme Court has noted      that the legislative history concerning the meaning of      national origin, even under statutory law, is ``quite      meager.'' Espinoz v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88 (1973).      Nevertheless, ``[t]he terms `national origin' and `ancestry'      were considered synonymous.'' 414 U.S. at 89. During debate      on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Representative Roosevelt      stated: ``May I just make very clear that `national origin'      means national. It means the country from which you or your      forebears came from. You may come from Poland,      Czechoslovakia, England, France, or any other country.'' 110      Cong. Rec. 2,549 (1964).       The Supreme Court supports that assessment: ``[t]he term      `national origin' on its face refers to the country where a      person was born, or, more broadly, the country from which his      or her ancestors came.'' Esoinoza, 414 U.S. at 88; see also,      Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, 840 F.2d 667, 672-73 (9th Cir.      1988) (persons of Serbian national origin are members of a      protected class under Title VII).                              Case History       Federal courts have rejected attempts to equate a person's      language with their national origin in dozens of court      decisions going back thirty years. Therefore any expansion of      the concept of national origin to encompass a theory      repeatedly rejected by federal courts must come explicitly      from Congress, and not be imposed by a flawed and arbitrary      interpretation of the law.       The Supreme Court has never held that the language a person      chooses to speak can be equated to the person's national      origin. Though this issue was briefed and discussed in      Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), the Court did not      make a holding on this question. ``Petitioner argues that      Spanish-language ability bears a close relation to ethnicity,      and that, as a result, it violates the Equal Protection      Clause. . . . We need not address that argument here.'' 500      U.S. at 360. The Circuits, on the other hand, have rejected      such an equation. See, e.g., Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, 717      F.2d at 41: ``A classification is implicitly made, but it is      on the basis of language, i.e., English-speaking versus non-     English speaking individuals, and not on the basis of race,      religion or national origin. Language, by itself, does not      identify members of a suspect class.''       See, also, Toure v. United States, 24 F.3d at 446      (affirming Soberal-Perez and rejecting request for      multilingual forfeiture notices). ``A policy involving an      English requirement, without more, does not establish      discrimination based on race or national origin.'' ``An v.      General Am. Life Ins. Co., 872 F.2d 426 (9th Cir. 1989)      (table).       The oldest administrative interpretation linking language      and national origin is the EEOC's arbitrary presumption      against English language workplace rules. 29 C.F.R.      Sec. 1606.7. The Supreme Court has never reviewed those      purely administrative interpretations. But many other courts      have reviewed the EEOC guidelines and have rejected them and      their underlying equation of language and national origin.      See, e.g., Garcia v. Spun-Steak, 998 F.2d 1480, 1489-90 (9th      Cir. 1993), cert. den. 512 U.S. 1228 (1994) (EEOC Guidelines      equating language and national origin were ultra vires);      Vasquez v. McAllen Bag & Supply Co., 660 F.2d 686 (5th Cir.      1981)(upholding English-on-the-job rule for non-English-     speaking truck drivers); Garcia v. Rush-Presbyterian St.      Luke's Medical Center, 660 F.2d 1217, 1222 (7th Cir.      1981)(upholding hiring practices requiring English      proficiency); Long v. First Union Corp., 894 F. Supp. 933,      941 (E.D. Virginia, 1995)(``there is nothing in Title VII      which protects or provides that an employee has a right to      speak his or her native tongue while on the job.''),      affirmed, 86 F.3d 1151 (4th Cir. 1996).       A few cases indicate that if the language policy is a      pretext for intentional discrimination, a language-related      rule might violate national origin rules. In addition, two      recent lower court decisions have adopted the EEOC's      interpretation equating language and national origin. See,      e.g., EEOC v. Synchro-Start Products, 29 F.Supp.2d 911, 915      n. 10 (N.D. Illinois, 1999)(on advice of law clerk, Judge      Shadur was ``staking out a legal position that has not been      espoused by any appellate court.''); EEOC v. Premier Operator      Services, 113 F.Supp.2d 1066 (N.D. Texas, 2000) (Magistrate      Judge Stickney, rejecting appellate cases against EEOC      Guidelines and relying on Synchro-Start Products and Judge      Reinhardt's dissent from denial of rehearing en bane in Spun      Steak, found disparate treatment of Hispanic employees in the      promulgation of an English-workplace rule; the defendant      company was bankrupt and did not present a defense).       But almost all cases, including all Circuit decisions, have      rejected the equation of language and national origin. See,      e.g., Gloor, 618 F.2d at 270 (``The EEO Act does not support      an interpretation that equates the language an employee      prefers to use with his national origin.''); Nazarova v. INS,      171 F.3d 478, 483 (7th Cir. 1999)(permitting deportation      notices in English); Carmona v. Sheffield, 475 F.2d 738 (9th      Cir. 1973)(permitting English benefit termination notices);      Frontera v. Sindell, 522 F.2d 1215 (6th Cir. 1975) (civil      service exam for carpenters can be in English); Garcia v.      Spun Steak, 998 F.2d 4 1480, 1489-90 (9th Cir. 1993), cert.      den., 512 U.S. 1228 (1994) (rejecting EEOC guidelines);      Gonzalez v. Salvation Army, 985 F.2d 578 (11th      Cir.)(table), cert. den., 508 U.S. 910 (1993)(rejecting      employment discrimination claim); Jurado v. Eleven-Fifty      Corp, 813 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1987) (permitting radio      station to choose language an announcer would use);      Vasquez v. McAllen Bag & Supply Co., 660 F.2d 686 (5th      Cir. 1981) (upholding English-on-the-job rule for non-     English-speaking truck drivers); Garcia v. Rush-     Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, 660 F.2d 1217 (7th      Cir. 1981) (upholding hiring practices requiring English      proficiency); Long v. First Union Corp., 894 F.Supp. 933,      941 (E.D. Virginia, 1995) (``there is nothing in Title VII      which protects or provides that an employee has a right to      speak his or her native tongue while on the job''),      affirmed, 86 F.3d 1151 (4th Cir. 1996); Gotfryd v. Book      Covers, Inc., 1999 WL 20925, *8 (N.D. Ill. 1999)      (rejecting attempt to use EEOC guidelines to establish      hostile workplace); Magana v. Tarrant/Dallas Printing,      Inc., 1998 WL 548686, *5 (N.D. Texas, 1998) (``English-     only policies are not of themselves indicative of national      origin discrimination in violation of Title VII''); Tran      v. Standard Motor Products, Inc., 10 F.Supp.2d 1199, 1210      (D. Kansas, 1998) (``the purported English-only policy      does not constitute a hostile work environment''); Mejia      v. New York Sheraton Hotel, 459 F.Supp. 375, 377 (S.D.N.Y.      1978) (chambermaid properly denied a promotion because of      her ``inability to articulate clearly or coherently and to      make herself adequately understood in . . . English'');      Prado v. L. Luria & Son, Inc., 975 F.Supp. 1349 (S.D. Fla      1997) (rejecting challenge to English workplace policy);      Kania v. Archdiocese of Philadelphia, 14 F.Supp. 2d 730,      733 (E.D. Penn. 1998) (surveying cases: ``all of these      courts have agreed that--particularly as applied to multi-     lingual employees--an English-only rule does not have a      disparate impact on the basis of national origin, and does      not violate Title VII'').       There is, therefore, no basis in the terms, history or      interpretation of ``national origin'' which supports a per se      rule equating a person's language and that person's national      origin.       The Executive Order 13166 is based on the equation of a      person's language and that person's national origin. Again,      here we are making clear that there is no legal basis for      Executive Order 13166. Neither is there any legal basis for      federal regulations based on Executive Order 13166,      including, but not limited to those federal regulations in      the following list:         Index of Federal Regulations on Executive Order 13166                       Cabinet-Level Departments     Commerce       Department of Commerce: ``Guidance to Federal Financial      Assistance Recipients on the Title VI Prohibition Against      National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English      Proficient Persons'' (March, 2003).
