Speaker, I take to the floor of the House today to acknowledge the outstanding career of Corona Police Sgt. Terry D. Gustin. Sergeant Gustin, who spent 32 years in law enforcement, will retire on September 13, 1997. My hometown of Corona, CA has been extremely fortunate to have had Sergeant Gustin protecting our community and making it a safer place in which to live and work.  Sergeant Gustin is a native of southern California and attended California Baptist College in Riverside. After serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy and serving in Vietnam, Sergeant Gustin returned to southern California and in 1965 was hired as a reserve police officer in Corona. This was the beginning of a long and distinguished career in law enforcement. In 1968, he was hired full time by the Corona Police Department, where he has served as a police officer, a detective, traffic sergeant, acting lieutanant, and relief watch commander. He will finish his career as a sergeant with the patrol division.  During his early years in law enforcement, Sergeant Gustin started the first YDT team in Riverside County with one RSO deputy and one probation officer. Sergeant Gustin has also been involved in a wide range of activities during his career, including being a former member of the Police National Rodeo Association for 10 years in steer wrestling, the Riverside County Peace Officers Association, the California Combat Association, the Peace Officers Research Association, the FOP Lodge in Riverside, among many others.  Sergeant Gustin has been a great credit to the Corona Police Department, and his service has been appreciated by citizens throughout the city, who will remember him as someonewho took the time to help others. On behalf of the citizens of the 43d Congressional District, I wish to extend my thanks and appreciation to Sgt. Terry D. Gustin for his years of dedicated service to our community and extend my best wishes in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
