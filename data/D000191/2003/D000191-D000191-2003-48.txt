We just managed to add $87 billion to the debt of the United States of America if this legislation stands in conference with the Senate. $87 billion will be borrowed to continue the conflict in Iraq and to build a vibrant new economy for Iraq, roads, bridges, highways, telephone systems, 9/11 ports, a lot of things that we could use here in the United States, investment that if it was made in the United States, would put more than a million people to work.  But in the wisdom of the Republican majority in the House, this will be money that will be borrowed and spent in Iraq. They would not allow us to convert it to loans. One gentleman from Indiana famously stood up with an amendment to convert it to loans last night. He knew his amendment was not going to be made in order. He got an hour to debate it and then went away like a sheep when his amendment was not allowed, did not even challenge the ruling of the Chair, did not even try to get a vote. And then when he was offered a chance to vote on a democratic amendment to turn it into a loan because they have $7 trillion of oil reserves, he voted no.  People like that are going to have to explain that to their constituents. How is it more important that the working people of America assume billions of dollars of debt, that people for three generations are going to repay over the next 30 years for the people of Iraq so they may prosper, so they may better exploit their $7 trillion of oil reserves, and we cannot ask them to contribute to that process. It is not about war damage. It is about the damage done to their economy by a brutal dictator.  Here are a few things that were not in the bill. Even though we are borrowing $87 billion, it did not include $4.6 billion transferred from rebuilding Iraq to quality-of-life enhancements for our troops so they can have potable water, health and dental screening, postdeployment health care coverage for the Guard and Reserve, prepaid phone cards, transportation home on leave, they would not allow that. It was more important to borrow the money and spend it on Iraq.  An amendment to increase imminent-danger pay for the troops, the American men and women serving over there. And family separation allowance, prepaid phone cards, and $25 million in loans to Reservists who own small businesses disrupted by this deployment. That was not in the bill because it was more important to borrow and spend the money to rebuild Iraq and to benefit the Iraqi people.  An amendment to add $1.8 billion for veterans health care was not part of this bill. An amendment to add $1.8 billion, another, a second one, by reducing the Iraqi construction account for veterans health care was not allowed.  I guess we know where the parties stand. We hear a lot about the Republicans are with the troops. They may be good at wrapping themselves in the flag, but when it comes to putting the money and their vote where the troops are, they are not there. They are AWOL. And they were AWOL on these amendments. They were AWOL on the amendment to add the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act to the bill. It would not have taken any money away from the Iraqi people, but would have given benefits to the people in the Armed Forces here.  An amendment to provide additional compensation to Guard and Reserve members, an amendment to provide Guard and Reserve members medical and dental screening upon being called to active duty, tricare coverage to certain Reserve members. An amendment to increase the basic pay of Reservists by $1,000 a month.  An amendment, this one was quite an amendment, it was a tie vote, so that means that any person who voted against it on that side of the aisle, and 99 percent of them did, to give a $1,500 bonus to those serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, and it would have come out of the foreign aid portion, the build-Iraq portion of this budget.  So the Republican majority decided it was more important to give more money to a country with $7 trillion of oil reserves than it was to give a $1,500 bonus. I guess they have not talked to their Reservists who have been called up. I have. Many of them have taken huge cuts in pay. They are putting their family businesses at risk, if they have family businesses. Yeah, they may get their jobs back when they return, but they are never going to make up for that income.  This would have just been a fraction of what many of them lost. But, no, they could not do that. It was more important to give $20 billion to the Iraqi people to build their infrastructure, their roads, their bridges, their health care, their education system, their sewer, their water systems, things that we could use across America.  An amendment to reimburse any servicemember or any family who purchases protective body armor. We voted $79 billion last April, we borrowed, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the President, borrowed $79 billion for this war last April, and it did not include the body armor. Well, the money was there, yes. But Rumsfeld did not order it because he said, oh, the troops are not going to be there long enough to need it, and people are going to greet them by waving little tiny American flags. So he just did not order the body armor. It is not that they did not have the money. They did not order it. They did not order the armored Humvees for our troops.  What they have not done is incredible, but what they have done is even worse. They have indebted the people of the United States of America for $87 billion, most of it to benefit the residents of another nation and not here in America.                          ____________________
