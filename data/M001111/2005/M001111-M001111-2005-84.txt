 President, I rise today in memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It is hard to believe that on this date 3 years ago, the lives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, and others, were taken in a plane crash in Minnesota. On that day, I lost a good friend, the Senate lost a leader, and the American people lost an advocate who was never afraid to stand up and speak for those who had no voice.  Today I honor my friend and colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, who inspired so many people to speak up and to serve. Even as I stand here today, I cannot imagine that when I turn around I won't see Paul standing at his desk, his arms flailing in the air, making his point with great passion.  Paul inspired me to run for the U.S. Senate. His brilliant example reminded me that you don't need to be powerful or rich to make a difference. You just need to have an honest concern for others, an optimistic spirit, and the courage to act. Paul embodied these traits.  I am grateful for the time we had with Paul. He and I worked on everything from domestic violence and education to providing health care to veterans and protecting families from asbestos.  As the month of October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, draws to a close, there is much the Senate has accomplished on this issue. The Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which contains many improvements to the current law, haspassed the Senate. But the absence of the Wellstones has truly been felt. Paul and Sheila were such champions for victims of domestic violence, especially in the area of economic security.  Paul knew that it is important to address the economic barriers that trap women in violent homes or relationships. That is why he and I worked together to introduce bills to provide economic protections for victims. I am proud to carry on the legacy of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, and in their honor I have introduced the Security and Financial Empowerment, SAFE Act, which will protect and even save the lives of victims of domestic or sexual violence and their families.  We are all poorer for the loss of Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, his daughter Marcia, the members of his staff, and the pilots who were taken from us on this day 3 years ago. But I continue to hope that each one of us who are here will take on part of Paul's legacy--for example, the spirit to speak out for the underprivileged or for the woman on welfare because of domestic violence who is trying to get back on her feet.  If we can remember to fight for all Americans no matter what challenges they face, and do so with respect and dignity, then Paul's legacy will live on in the Senate, as it lives on in our hearts and minds. In the name of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, I pledge to carry on their legacy throughout my time in the Senate.                          ____________________
