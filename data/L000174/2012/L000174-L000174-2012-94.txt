President, this fall also marks the 10th anniversary of the passing of another great Senator, Paul Wellstone, and his wife Sheila. They were dear friends. Among the many things for which they are fondly remembered is the important work they did to combat domestic violence and help victims. We have made much progress on this issue, in large part thanks to the Violence Against Women Act, which has long demonstrated the bipartisan commitment to work together against domestic violence and rape.  Sadly, so much remains to be done. Recent reports find that almost one in four women have experienced severe domestic violence, and nearly one in five women have been raped. In some communities, the picture is much worse. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, one in five female college students will be a victim of sexual assault during college. A recent study found that three out of five Native American women have been assaulted by a spouse or intimate partner.  The bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act includes vital provisions to help these and other particularly vulnerable victims. As the New York Times observed this weekend:       The act's reauthorization is must-do business for the lame-     duck session. Mr. Boehner should relent and allow the House      to vote on the Senate bill.  I ask that the full Times editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 24, 2012]                 The G.O.P. and Violence Against Women       If Republicans are serious about repairing their party's      standing among women, gay and Hispanic voters, they need to      adjust some policies and stop sending hostile messages. A      good place to start would be for Republicans in the House to      stop blocking reauthorization of the Violence Against Women      Act over provisions deemed too protective of gay and      immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.       The 1994 law remains crucial to the nation's efforts to      combat domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.      Previous reauthorizations sailed through Congress.       A thoughtful renewal measure introduced by Senator Patrick      Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and Judiciary Committee chairman,      and Senator Michael Crapo, an Idaho Republican, cleared the      Senate in April with strong bipartisan support. But it has      hit a wall in the Republican-led House. Instead, House      Republicans pushed through a regressive version of the      measure that omits new protections for gay, bisexual or      transgender victims of abuse.       The House bill also left out a needed increase in the      number of visas, known as U visas, available for undocumented      immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and sexual      assaults. And it would reduce the incentive for frightened      victims to come forward by ending the current ability of U      visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three      years.       Speaker John Boehner and his Republican colleagues blame      Democrats for the impasse, suggesting the Democrats inserted      changes to invite opposition and score political points. But      the provisions at issue respond to real humanitarian and law      enforcement needs identified by experts working in the field.       By refusing to accept the principle of protecting all      victims of domestic violence, House Republican leaders are      conveying a belief that rapes of gay people and immigrant      women are not ``legitimate'' rapes, as Representative Todd      Akin, the failed Republican candidate for the Senate from      Missouri, put it so appallingly. Is that really what      Republicans want to stand for?       The act's reauthorization is must-do business for the lame-     duck session. Failure to agree on a bill would mean having to      start the legislative process all over again next year. Mr.      Boehner should relent and allow the House to vote on the      Senate bill. There is a chance it would not muster sufficient      Republican votes to pass. But at least it would give      Republican representatives who value moderation a chance to      dissociate themselves from the narrow-minded prejudices and      politics hurting their party.
