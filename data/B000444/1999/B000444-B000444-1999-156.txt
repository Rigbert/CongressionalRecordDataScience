 WARNER. Absolutely. Do not worry about small matters. Worry about what I am about to tell my dear friend.  We are all making the best of efforts. I am listening to Senator Byrd, in a very clear and precise way, an evenhanded way, state his case. Then I am handed the President's speech in Ottawa.  A Reuters report states:       It is clear now that the level of opposition to the treaty      and the time it would take to craft the necessary safeguard      to get the necessary votes are simply not there. So I hope      the Senate will reach an agreement to delay that vote.  That expresses our common purpose.  All I have called upon the President to do is to share the burden the leaders would bear should this decision go forward.  I turn the page. Again, quoting:       Establish an orderly process, a nonpolitical orderly      process to systematically deal with all the issues that are      out there and take whatever time is necessary to do it.  As I told the press a few minutes ago, the President, each day, is taking a step in realization of what has to be done. His National Security Adviser is quoted this morning saying the President asked the vote be delayed. The day before, the Secretary of State said for another day this treaty should be decided by the Senate.  I say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, the last quote of the President: ``The whole thing is about politics.''  Is everything you are saying today about politics?
