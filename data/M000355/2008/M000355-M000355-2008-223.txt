 President, let me say on this occasion I almost entirely agree with the majority leader about what needs to be accomplished this week. We do indeed need to do the housing bill. We do indeed need to do the supplemental for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FISA bill, the Medicare fix--it is a complicated legislative tangle which my good friend, the majority leader, has described, and with which he is trying to deal as we move through the week. But my goal is really the same as his, and we are going to continue talking to each other, continue to sort of run the trapsand hopefully clear the traps in such a way that we can have a highly successful week before the recess.  That is my goal. It is the same as his goal. I will be working with him to see if we can get all of those things done in the next few days.
