Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Helen Mayhak who regretfully passed away recently at the age of 91. A dedicated and selfless woman, Helen's charity and work throughout the community made Southwest Michigan an even greater place to live and grow.  For the last 40 years Helen served the Hartford community as township clerk, making her one of Michigan's longest-tenured officials. A lifelong resident of Berrien County, Helen was an active member in her community. Whether she was serving hot lunches to students in our public schools, working with the Boy Scouts of America, or assisting in our local hospitals, Helen did her part to improve the lives of everyone she encountered. As a member of the Van Buren Republican Party, she was honored as the Van Buren Republican of the Year.  Helen will be remembered for her commitment to the betterment of the lives of those she served. We will certainly miss her enthusiasm and passion that she brought to her work each and every day.  On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, our prayers and sincere regards go out to Helen's family and friends--she will certainly be deeply missed.                          ____________________
