Speaker, I know that there are a number of Members wishing to come over tonight to talk on this Special Order, and I also know that there is a markup going on in the Committee on Armed Services, so a number of Members may put their remarks in as an extension of remarks.  We are holding this Special Order tonight to provide our colleagues and the public with information about a key component of the 1996 welfare reform law, title V, Abstinence Education Block Grant program. When we passed welfare reform in 1996, we emphasized a number of points, two specifically: work and responsibility. And we have made great strides in promoting work, but too many young people's dreams have been cut short by poor decisions that dramatically affect the course of their lives.  Teen birth rates have been falling for the last 9 years and that is good news. But nearly half a million teens are giving birth each year, a rate higher than those of most industrialized nations. And 8,519 births last year are to girlsunder the age of 15. We know that out-of-wedlock births and teen births take a high toll on the teen mom, the child and our society as a whole; and we know that that life is rough for them as well. And while the teen birth rate may be falling, sexually transmitted diseases, STDs, have reached epidemic proportions in this country, placing the health and the very lives of sexually-active teens in peril.  Today, one in four sexually-active teens is infected with an STD. Numerous studies show that if you give abstinence education a chance to work, it does. I know in my State of Michigan we have been at the forefront of this effort, and we have made significant progress in reducing teen births and the number of abortions through education and mentoring programs, and that has got to be our national goal.  Mr. Speaker, President Bush got it right when he said that abstinence is not just about saying no to sex, it is about saying yes to a happy, healthier future. Anyone who thinks abstinence education does not work has only to examine the Michigan record, my State. Begun back in 1993, Michigan's Abstinence Partnership, MAP, the MAP program, is an innovative approach implemented through the community empowerment model.  Community coalitions plan, implement, evaluate, revise and monitor the program. Parent education is provided to encourage effective communication with youth about the importance and the benefits of choosing abstinence. For the last 3 years in a row, Michigan has received a bonus award from the Department of Health and Human Services given each year to up to five States which experience the largest decrease in their ratio of out-of-wedlock to total births while also experiencing a reduction in their abortion rate.                              {time}  2000  Michigan is far from alone in embracing abstinence education as an effective means of reducing teen pregnancies in out-of-wedlock births and of protecting our young people from the scourge of sexually transmitted diseases.  State participation in the title V abstinence program is voluntary, and for every $4 in Federal funding States receive, they must put $3 into non-Federal funding. So it is a 4-to-3 match, and yet interest in this program is very high.  Today 49 out of the 50 States are participating in the program. Over one-third of all school districts in the Nation now choose to teach abstinence education in their classrooms, and as part of their abstinence education programs, States and local grantees have launched media campaigns to influence attitudes and behavior, develop abstinence curriculum, revamp sexual education classes, start mentoring programs and implement other creative and effective approaches to encourage abstinence.  It is important to note that reauthorization of title V abstinence education program, which we did in the Committee on Energy and Commerce last week, will in no way affect Federal support for other teenage pregnancy prevention sexual programs. Let me say that again. The reauthorization of this program last week in no way affects other Federal support for other teen pregnancy prevention programs. There are at least 25 Federal programs providing funding for contraceptive and sex education while there are only three abstinence-focused programs.  Contrary to claims that my colleagues may have heard about restrictions about what may be discussed in abstinence education programs, nothing in the Federal law or the guidelines to the States prohibits the discussion of any subject.  Contrary to the claim that there is no scientific evidence that abstinence programs work, there are, in fact, 10 scientific evaluations available now showing that abstinence education is effective in reducing sexual activity.  Since 1996, the enactment of the Welfare Reform bill included abstinence education, teen pregnancy and birthrates have been falling. That is great news, but we need to continue and build on that success. Out-of-wedlock births are often disastrous for mothers, children, society as a whole, and children born out-of-wedlock are far more likely to be poor, suffer ill health, drop out of school. In the case of boys, they are twice as likely to commit a crime, lead to incarceration by the time they reach their early 30s.  STDs have reached epidemic proportions in our country, placing the health and lives of sexually active young people in serious peril. In fact, in the 1960s, one in 47 sexually active teenagers were infected with an STD. Today it is not one out of 47, it is one out of 4. Young people need to know that having sexual relations puts them at risk not only for HIV/AIDS but also herpes, which is obviously incurable, and may affect babies during birth, resulting in severe damage or death.  Teens need to know they are at risk for human papillomavirus, PHV, which is the leading viral STD and which causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and they need to know that scientific research shows that condom use offers relatively little protection from herpes and no protection from HPV. Abstinence education programs provide the right information.  Too many of our kids' dreams have been cut short by poor decisions that dramatically alter the course of their lives. Abstinence education programs give our young both the inspiration and education that they need to make good, healthful decisions. Our young people look to us for clear messages and for help in setting high standards for themselves. Abstinence education programs will, in fact, give them that help.  I would yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Sullivan).
