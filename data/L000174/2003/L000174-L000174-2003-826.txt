President, I rise today to speak in favor of the amendment offered by Senator Nelson that would provide $600 million in emergency food aid to sub-Saharan Africa. I know other Senators are waiting to speak so I will make three short points.  First, there is an enormous humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Food Program estimates that there are 38 million now at risk of starvation. The situation has gone from bad to worse.  Second, humanitarian organizations with field operations in Africa, such as Catholic Relief Services and Save the Children, report that at least $600 million is needed to address these immediate needs. What are the reasons for this shortfall?  We are debating a budget request that is almost a year old. When the request was submitted last year, this crisis in Africa had not reached this magnitude. On top of that, commodity prices have increased 30 percent.  Third, the Nelson amendment is carefully tailored to give the President the flexibility he needs to deal with the crisis. If the President does not want to spend this money, he does not have to declare an emergency. However, if he feels, as many of us do, that this money is needed now to address this growing crisis, he can declare it an emergency and provide this assistance to sub-Saharan Africa.  This is a bipartisan issue. I know Secretary Powell and Administrator Natsios care deeply about Africa. Representative Wolf just came back from Ethiopia and Eritrea and issued a compelling report on the dire situation there.  The administration does not currently have the resources to deal with this crisis. It is up to Congress to provide the resources to prevent mass starvation in Africa. We may not get another chance for months.
