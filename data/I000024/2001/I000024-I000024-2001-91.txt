President, today I rise to bring attention to an issue that affects all Americans, government waste. As we all know, the Federal Government is infamous for its profligate programs and approaches to problem solving. In the last decade, we have seen inefficiency of mammoth proportions within the government.  As a result, I have introduced legislation that would establish a national commission to eliminate government waste. This act would resurrect President Reagan's work to find an equitable way to enact fiscal responsibility and accountability within the government. During the Reagan Administration, a private sector study of government was commissioned to dispose of Federal waste, mismanagement, and abuse. Led by industrialist J. Peter Grace, the Grace Commission produced 47 reports with 2,478 recommendations. As a result of this study, President Reagan issued executive orders that saved the Federal Government more than $110 billion.  Today, many Federal agencies still use cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. The National Commission to Eliminate Waste in Government Act would establish a commission to conduct a private sector survey on management and cost control within the government. It would also provide an opportunity for the commission to review existing reports on government waste. Because the commission would be funded, staffed, and equipped by the private sector, it would not cost the government one dime.  I urge my colleagues to support this end to government waste and the beginning of discipline and efficiency within our government.                                 ______                                       By
