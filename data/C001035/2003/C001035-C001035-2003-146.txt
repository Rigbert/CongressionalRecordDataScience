Medicaid is a partnership between the Federal Government and our partners, the States, to provide health care to low-income families, the very poor individuals, to those who need it most. Medicaid is the fastest growing component in State budgets. So States certainly are contributing to this program. It has been a successful partnership. We are suggesting a temporary increase over the next 18 months. I hope we will grant that.  I have several letters which I am going to have printed in the Record, which talk about protecting the States' ability to provide and deliver this health care, and points out, again, that these are health care services to the most vulnerable Americans we serve.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Association for Home Care and Hospice be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Homecare & Hospice,                                                 January 22, 2003.     Hon. Bob Graham,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Association      for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC), the nation's largest      association representing home care and hospice providers,      caregivers and the patients they serve, I am writing to      commend you on the introduction of S. 138, the ``State Budget      Relief Act of 2003.''       As you are well aware, the current economic downturn has      resulted in drastically lower state tax revenues. Moreover,      the number of uninsured continues to grow as more and more      people are forced from the labor market. This has resulted in      states being forced to cut their Medicaid budgets at the      exact time that there is a growing need for services.       Your legislation, by temporarily increasing the Federal      Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) as a way to direct      additional federal funding to state Medicaid programs, will      protect states' health care delivery systems and ensure the      continuation of health services for the most vulnerable of      our population. Without this assistance, many communities      will find themselves with providers that are understaffed,      have crumbling infrastructures, lack current medical      technology, or have reduced or eliminated certain services.       NAHC believes that home health and hospice services remain      one of the remedies to the widespread concern over growing      health care costs. In recent years, state Medicaid programs      have increased their utilization of home and community-based      long-term care services in lieu of institutional care through      the use of waivers. In fact, the Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services (CMS) recently reported that Medicaid      spending growth levels for home care services more than      doubled between 2000 and 2001--from 8,6 percent to 17.3      percent. Some of this trend reflects the growing desire to      implement the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision to provide      disabled individuals care in the least restrictive setting      possible and the Administration's goals as set forth in its      ``New Freedom Initiative.'' This desirable trend is at risk      of falling victim to the widespread cuts to the Medicaid      program that states are being forced to implement due to      budget shortfalls.       Once again, thank you for your leadership on this issue.      Let me know if there is anything my staff or I can do to      ensure the passage of this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                              Val J. Halamandaris,                                                        President.
