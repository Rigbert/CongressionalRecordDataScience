 The Senator from Arizona listed a series of provisions contained in his proposed substitute. Those provisions, such as the requirement to inspect every truck, would apply to Mexico, not to Canada, and that really is the point. We can and should impose strict requirements on Mexico.  The Senator cited inspection statistics. These are the results of those inspections. We believe very clearly, as the NAFTA arbitration panel has stated, that the underlying provisions are not a violation of NAFTA, and we think the Senate should uphold the NAFTA arbitration panel by voting to table the Gramm amendment.  I know Senator Shelby has 5 minutes remaining on his side. How much time is left on the other side?
