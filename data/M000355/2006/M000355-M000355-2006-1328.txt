 President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We are familiar with Judge Alito's academic and professional qualifications. He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law School, where he served as editor of its prestigious Law Journal. He spent his life serving his country as a captain in the Army Reserve, as an assistant, and then as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, and for the past 15 years as a distinguished judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to name a few of his qualifications with which we are all quite familiar at this point in the process.  Equally important is his deserved reputation for fairness and for integrity and his measured approach to thelaw. The American Bar Association, hardly a bastion of conservatism, found this out during its exhaustive review of its record. The ABA solicited the views of 2,000 people, including 130 Federal judges and every Supreme Court Justice. After that, the ABA awarded Judge Alito its highest rating, unanimously well qualified. What that means is that every member of the committee of the ABA gave Judge Alito the highest possible mark. It is like getting straight A+'s on your report card.  Let me repeat that since some who are watching and listening have undoubtedly heard the attacks by Judge Alito's most vociferous opponents: The ABA, the largest professional association of lawyers in the country, found Judge Alito to be unanimously well qualified for the Supreme Court. In the past, this rating was referred to by our friends on the other side of the aisle as the gold standard.  More insightful than the ABA's rating is the testimonials of those who know Judge Alito best, his colleagues and his coworkers. Although they possess different political philosophies, Judge Alito's colleagues enthusiastically praise him as ``thoughtful, intelligent, and fair'' and a judge who ``has a great respect for precedent-setting decisions.'' To most people, that sounds like the kind of Justice we would want on the Supreme Court.  Judge Timothy Lewis served with Judge Alito for 7 years during which Judge Lewis typically voted with the court's liberal members. He recounted how when he joined the Third Circuit in 1992 he consulted his mentor, the late Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., who was a Carter appointee, a former chief judge of the court and a scholar of U.S. racial history. According to Judge Lewis, Judge Higginbotham said:       Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on this court.      He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito      is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest. He      doesn't have an agenda. He is not an ideologue.  That is the late Judge Leon Higginbotham. Judge Lewis added his own experience bore out Judge Higginbotham's evaluation. Judge Lewis said Sam Alito ``does not have an agenda'' and ``is not result-oriented. He is an honest conservative judge who believes in judicial restraint and judicial deference.'' He ``faithfully showed a deference and deep respect for precedent.''  That is liberal Judge Lewis of the Third Circuit.  Another former chief judge of the Third Circuit, Edward Becker, similarly praised Judge Alito. Here is what he had to say:       I found him to be a guy who approached every case with an      open mind. I never found him to have an agenda. I suppose the      best example of this is in the area of criminal procedure. He      was a former U.S. attorney, but he never came to a case with      a bias in favor of the prosecution. If there was an error in      the trial, or a flawed search, he would vote to reverse.  Judge Becker noted that Judge Alito is ``very principled, very analytical, never decides more than he has to in a case. He does believe in judicial restraint in the way he writes opinions, with no ideological overtones.''  The Third Circuit current chief judge, Anthony Scirica, succinctly said:        . . . whatever quality you think a judge ought to have,      whether it's scholarship or an ability to deliberate, or      fairness or temperance, Sam has each one of these to the      highest degree.  That is the current chief judge of the Third Circuit.  These reflections, which include three former or current chief judges of the Third Circuit, are echoed by Judge Alito's former law clerks, many of whom are self-described committed Democrats. Jeff Wasserstein clerked for Judge Alito in 1998. Here is what he had to say:       I am a Democrat who always votes Democratic, except when I      vote for a green candidate--but Judge Alito was not      interested in the ideology of his clerks. He didn't decide      cases based on ideology.  Mr. Wasserstein recounts how in one criminal case the defense attorney had submitted a sloppy brief while the prosecutor had submitted a neat, presentable brief. Mr. Wasserstein says that in his youth and naivete he suggested to Judge Alito it would be easy to decide the case for the Government. But Judge Alito stopped him ``cold by saying that was an unfair attitude to have before I had even read the briefs carefully and conducted the necessary additional research needed to ensure that the defendant had received a fair hearing.''  Mr. Wasserstein's simple anecdote illustrates how Judge Alito approaches each case fairly and with an open mind. He observes that Judge Alito has a ``restrained approach to the law.''  Another former law clerk, Kate Pringle, who worked for Senator Kerry, whom we heard speak a few moments ago, for his Presidential campaign, describes herself as a left-leaning Democrat and a big fan of Judge Alito's. She rejects the notion that Judge Alito is an ideologue, stating he ``pays attention to the facts of the cases and applies the law in a careful way. He is a conservative in that sense. His opinions don't demonstrate an ideological slant.''  That is Kate Pringle, law clerk of Judge Alito and Kerry supporter for President in 2004.  In light of the accolades from those who know him best, in light of his brilliant academic and professional achievement, in light of receiving the highest possible rating by America's largest association of his peers, the ABA, I was hopeful the Senate would provide Judge Alito with a fair and dignified process. Sadly, this has not been the case.  In the Senate we have known for over 200 years, a judicial nominee with Judge Alito's character, ability, and achievement would command a large bipartisan majority of support. Now it appears Judge Alito will not get that tomorrow. Why is that? It is because there has been a change in the standards by which the Senate considers qualified judicial nominees. In my view, it has not been a change for the better.  According to the New York Times, in early 2001, some of our Democratic colleagues attended a retreat where law professors such as Larry Tribe and Cass Sunstein implored them to ``change the ground rules'' with respect to how the Senate considered judicial nominees by injecting a political ideology test into the confirmation process. Soon after that meeting, some of our friends initiated a premeditated and sustained effort of serial filibusters of circuit court nominees. We saw a lot them. Those most passionate for this tactic thereby wrote a new and sad chapter into the pages of Senate history.  Like many Republicans and Democrats, I had hoped this sad chapter of trying to deny judicial nominees a simple up-or-down vote would recede into memory as a mere footnote in a long and proud history of the Senate. Unfortunately, today some are trying to revive it with the Alito nomination.  We stand today on the brink of a new and reckless effort by a few to deny the rights of many to exercise our constitutional duty to advise and consent, to give this man the simple up-or-down vote he deserves. The Senate should repudiate this tactic, and it will have an opportunity to do that at 4:30 this afternoon.  There is a role for the filibuster for legislative matters. Although I may disagree with its application in a particular legislative case, I neither deny the tactic nor begrudge it when a colleague employs that tactic when there is good reason to do so. I have done so on many occasions myself. I have not seen a good reason for employing it in the context of judicial nominations. Nor did any Senate prior to the last Congress find that tactic should be employed for judicial nominations.  It certainly is not warranted in the case of Judge Alito. He is clearly qualified. His friends, his peers, and, indeed, his entire life story tell us so.  During his hearings and despite the best efforts of those opposed to his nomination, he acquitted himself admirably. Over 18 hours of testimony he was asked 677 questions and was able to answer 659 of them--truly an impressive feat. In doing so, Judge Alito demonstrated an impressive command of the law and a model judicial temperament.  Now, while Judge Alito conducted himself with grace and dignity, unfortunately, some Senators did not. In fact, those who listened most attentively to the outside pressure groups, such as one whose top lobbyist declared ``you name it, we'll do it to defeat Judge Alito,'' could have learned a thing or two about grace and dignityby watching Judge Alito perform in the face of the most absurd and baseless charges.  Despite the repeated efforts to caricature Judge Alito, the public's support for him only increased. After the hearing, the only thing the American public was concerned about with respect to Judge Alito was the sometimes shabby treatment he received.  With Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Republicans resisted playing base politics and instead measured those two nominees by the traditional confirmation standard of integrity and legal excellence and not a political ideology standard. We did not grandstand on the colorful--to put it delicately--statements Justice Ginsburg had made decades before her nomination such as possibly abolishing Mother's Day and Father's Day and statements about purported constitutional rights to prostitution and polygamy, to name a few. Nor did Republicans seek to disqualify Judge Ginsburg from further judicial service because of her longstanding leadership of the ACLU and the controversial positions it often takes.  And Republicans did not succumb to the idea of a reckless filibuster to gain the approbation of a newspaper or an interest group.  If Republicans had wanted to demagogue and defeat the Ginsburg nomination, we could have done the things to Justice Ginsburg that have been done to Judge Alito. In fact, with her highly controversial writings and advocacy for the ACLU, it would have been a lot easier to do so, but we exercised self-restraint and self-discipline for the good of the country.  In conclusion, I implore my Democratic friends to consider that to engage in these tactics is neither fair nor right. If this hyperpoliticization of the judicial confirmation process continues, I fear in this moment we will have institutionalized this behavior, and some day we will be hard pressed not to employ political tests and tactics against a Supreme Court nominee of a Democratic President. In that case, no one--Republican or Democrat--will have won.  I urge my colleagues to desist in this tactic of turning the confirmation process of a judge into the functional equivalent of a political campaign. It is shortsighted, and we will mourn the day this tactic became the norm.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
