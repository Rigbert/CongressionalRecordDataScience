Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Beauprez), a good friend, for his statement and for his fine work.  Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues we are at a crossroads. We have not done our due diligence in ensuring that sufficient funds were available to renovate, to update, to modernize our aging infrastructure of VA health care and other facilities within the VA, that is to say, those dealing with research and development.  There was a consultants' report as far as back as June of 1998 that suggested we spend 2 to 4 percent on plant replacement value to upkeep these vital facilities. We have not done that. We need to now do some hurry-up-and-catch-up baseball here. This legislation is certainly a step in the right direction. I hope it has the full support of our colleagues.
