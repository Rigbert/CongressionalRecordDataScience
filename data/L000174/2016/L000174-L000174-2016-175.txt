President, I have often likened the counsel that Senators receive from their staff to the confidential advice a lawyer provides to a client. That is why it is so rare that, over the last 40 or so years, Ross Baker, a Distinguished professor at Rutgers University, has taken several sabbaticals to research the inner workings of Capitol Hill. Most recently, as a scholar in residence in Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's office, Professor Baker has been given the unusual access to the inner workings of one of the Senate's leading offices. The result? Professor Baker is considered the go-to academic expert on the Senate, one of the preeminent scholars of congressional history, the author of six books about Congress and government, and an insightful resource for the news media about the often inscrutable goings-on in Congress.  I came to know Professor Baker when he joined my staff as an adviser in 2000, when he returned to Capitol Hill to gain a better understanding of Senate seniority. When he returned to my staff in 2004, during a period of fierce debate in the Senate Judiciary Committee over the direction of our courts and our national security policy, Professor Baker saw firsthand how lawmakers, including myself, balance meaningful, large-scale policy debates with the day-to-day responsibility of representing and advocating for our constituents. It goes without saying that my relationship with Professor Baker was a two-way street. It was not uncommon for me to respond to his questions with some of my own.  In 2008, Ross Baker joined then-Majority Leader Reid's staff at a pivotal time in both Congress and in the political arena. Long and diverse primary campaigns, coupled with the winding down of the tumultuous Bush administration, provided Professor Baker with even more fodder for his courses at Rutgers. As he concludes his final stint with Senator Reid's office, one can only wonder how today's political dialogue both on the campaign trail and on the floor of the Senate will inform Professor Baker's American Government course when he resumes teaching this fall.  Vermonters have entrusted me to represent them in Washington several times. Like Professor Baker, I have spent time studying what works, and what doesn't. His insights are as important to the chronicle of Senate history as they are to the students he teaches today.  I ask unanimous consent that a May 5 article in the Washington Post entitled ``History Professor Landed a Privileged Perch to See How Harry Reid Works'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 2016]History Professor Landed a Privileged Perch To See How Harry Reid Works                             (By Paul Kane)       Harry Reid almost never says no.       When he gets a new piece of information or a request or      anything, he says--he uses this phrase all the time--he says:      `I'll look at it,' '' says Ross K. Baker, a distinguished      congressional scholar at Rutgers University.       That approach gives the Senate minority leader wiggle room      to make decisions in private, a style of leadership that is      decidedly different from the ``master of the Senate,''      bulldozing approach that Lyndon B. Johnson honed as leader in      the 1950s.       That's just one of the countless insights that Baker, 77,      has drawn in three separate stints as ``scholar in      residence'' on Reid's staff Last week, he finished his final      tour with the retiring Senate leader as an unpaid adviser and      observer, a one-of-a-kind sabbatical for the professor. Over      the past 41 years, Baker has done seven stints on Capitol      Hill, working in the House and Senate.       Rather than teaching undergraduate students his ``American      Government'' course, the professor embedded himself in real      American government at an irregular pace in the past, but      over the past 16 years he's been here every four years.      Nothing can compete with the access he has been given in      Reid's leadership office in the Capitol. He watched the early      stages of the 2008 presidential primary play out on the      Senate floor between then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary      Clinton. He has seen Senate battles over treaties, and,      without fail, has seen countless legislative battles end in      gridlock.       Baker's time on Capitol Hill has provided history the      chance to have an academic get an up-close view of one of      this era's most influential political figures, but also one      of the most difficult to understand.       ``The panorama is breathtaking,'' Baker said. ``Here is      somebody who has his [finger on the] pulse [of] all the major      policy areas, has to, and has a staff that is equipped to do      that. So the feelers are out, the sensors are everywhere, the      neurons are firing constantly.''       Reid said he wanted Baker to ``focus on the Senate as an      institution'' for history's sake, and the professor wrote a      2014 book, ``Is Bipartisanship Dead?,'' based largely on his      2012 experience with Reid.       ``We all trust him,'' Reid said in a telephone interview      this week from Nevada.       He allowed Baker into every senior staff meeting and let      him watch Reid's senior aides prep the senator every Tuesday      morning for his weekly news conference. ``He doesn't speak up      very often, but when he does, we all listen,'' Reid added.       The low-light came when Republicans filibustered the      ratification of a treaty to elevate global standards for the      disabled, opening Baker's eyes to the ability of conservative      groups to block legislation.       Now, Baker thinks the calls on both sides for ``regular      order''--legislation beginning in committee, involving junior      members, emerging to full and open debates on the House and      Senate floor--are hollow.       ``There are just too many forces arrayed against it for it      to work,'' he said. ``I think it's a function of      polarization, that leaders have to get control of the process      and have to use exotic procedures that are basically      incomprehensible.''       Yet Reid was never the dictator in Johnson's 1950s style,      according to Baker. Those senators whom Reid rebuffed after      his initial ``I'll take a look at it'' would soon find him      doing a quick favor. ``He will double back and do something      for that person to make them feel important,'' Baker said.       Baker has long been known as a leading congressional      expert, a go-to resource for news media in need of      translating Washington. These stints on Capitol Hill have      given him a first-hand experience, spanning decades, that few      scholars can match.       Baker's political interests started randomly. In the mid-     1970s, when he was fashioning himself as an Africa expert and      writing occasional op-eds in The Washington Post, Baker      decided to refocus his career on U.S. politics, and on      Congress in particular.       So the 36-year-old professor persuaded Sen. Walter      Mondale's chief of staff, Richard Moe, to give him a break.      Baker read the academic version of Washington in journals on      his bus commute, then lived the real-life version by day,      spending a full academic year among the offices of Mondale      (D-Minn ) and Sens. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Frank Church (D-     Idaho).       Back then, Baker was more like a regular staffer, writing      speeches for Bayh and helping Church in his late-breaking bid      for the 1976 presidential nomination. He almost accepted      Church's offer of a full-time job but returned to Rutgers for      the fall of 1976.       ``But I got a serious, you know, a chronic case of Potomac      Fever,'' Baker said.       By 1983, the time of his next full-year sabbatical, he had      landed a gig with the House Democratic Caucus, when the      massive majority included dozens of ``Boll Weevil'' Democrats      who backed Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and strong military      posture.       Baker went another 17 years before he got back to the      Capitol, returning to the Senate     and to his only Republican boss, then-Sen. Chuck Hagel      (Neb.).       He bounced from there into the office of Sen. Patrick J.      Leahy (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,      spending several months there in 2000 and again in 2004.      There, he saw up close how senior senators have to focus on      one significant policy arena at the expense of others.       ``There's this sort of policy triage that senators have to      engage in, which is: They can't possibly devote themselves      equally to three major committee assignments,'' Baker said.       Several years later, Baker's Rutgers connection paid off.       Reid's longtime senior aide Susan McCue was a Rutgers      alumna, connecting Baker with Reid, which led to tours with      the majority leader in 2008 and 2012, as well as a brief      stint during the 2014 lame-duck session. These past four      months were Baker's first stint with Reid in the minority.       With his Reid partnership ending, Baker is returning to      another semester of ``American Government'' this fall at      Rutgers.       ``I at least come out of it with fresh anecdotes for my      undergraduates,'' Baker said. ``I mean, I just don't want to      ever be in a position of mentioning a name and they look at      me blankly.''                          ____________________
