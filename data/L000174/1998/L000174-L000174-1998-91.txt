I tell my friend from Alabama, this is what I would propose. I already stated that. And I have informed the floor staff on the Republican side that I would not make the unanimous consent request to this proposal at this time. Anyone who has known me for 24 years here knows I would never do this. I would not propose a unanimous consent request on aday when everybody has taken off already to the various airports or home. But I am putting into the Record, so that Senators can read it on Monday, what would have been my proposal if we were able to make it. I would not seek to ambush the other side. I have not done that in 24 years, and I am not about to start now.
