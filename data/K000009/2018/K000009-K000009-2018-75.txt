 I just wanted to say, the gentleman who is offering this amendment, I oppose the amendment, and you and I view the world very differently.  I view the Government of the United States as a bulwark for social and economic stability in this country. If I look at why we have a deficit going back, one of the reasons is oil wars.  This department is one of the most important departments in the country to lead us to energy independence as a country. I don't think we should do what you are asking us to do here. If we look at our trade deficit, we haven't had balanced trade accounts since the mid-1970s.  Adding trillions of dollars to our trade deficit every year is making it harder to fund Social Security and Medicare, programs that are essential to social stability in this country. If we look at the 2008 crash and the trillions of dollars that cost us as a country, nobody on Wall Street went to jail.  It is interesting to me where people want to pick away, pick away, pick away when you look at the big money, the moneys for war, the money for paying for imported goods as opposed to producing here at home, the causes of what happened in 2008, and there was no justice that was given to the Republic.  So, to me, energy independence is critical, if you look at the trillions we have added to the deficit because of war. So we look at the country through different ends of the telescope, I think, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I really think the result of your amendment will be less investment in the Republic, less investment in water resource infrastructure and energy development, and less investments that create good jobs and have substantial returns on investments such as modernizing our ports and all of the infrastructure that helps us to achieve social and economic stability in this country, which isn't easy to do.  So I thank my colleagues for listening, and I would urge opposition to this amendment.
