Speaker, today in this joint session of Congress commemorating the victory of freedom in the 20th century, as we remember and honor all those who served in World War II, I want to introduce to the House a veteran, a woman, a pilot who served as a Women Airforce Service Pilot, Lois M. Nelson of Ohio's Ninth District. Lois is a remarkable woman. A pilot before joining the service, she flew our B-17s, B-24's and many other planes from the factories to the front where they could do some good. She also flew planes that had been on the front back to the repair hangers and recalls ``you could smell the odor of combat on them; you knew where they had been.'' Lois and the more than one thousand other Women Airforce Service Pilots performing an invaluable and, unfortunately often overlooked, service in America's war effort. Let us remember them today. Lois represents all veterans from our community who are being commemorated here. Her life reminds us all of the treasured values of duty, honor, and country.  Last August 26, the citizens of Lucas County held a ceremony establishing our community as a World War II Commemorative County. That commemoration was graced with Lois's poignant remarks, and I ask that those remarks be printed at this place in the Record on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Allied Victory.       As a Nation, and as a people, we are always available to      celebrate war. Flesh against flesh, blood against blood, and      steel against steel. We mark with pride the winning of war,      but with our ego centered on victory. Equally we turn our      collective back on war if there is no winner.       Turn back to the ending of the war in Korea. Remember that      February day when Viet Nam released and returned prisoners,      was it victory when Gerry Denton stepped off the plane and      held Jane in his arms for the first time in over seven years?      It was for Denton, but not for America.       We celebrate victory perhaps, because we have never learned      to celebrate peace.       When I came home to Tucson after my time in the service of      my country, my road was perhaps different from yours, and      yours,      not because I am a woman, because no sooner was the ink on my      separation papers dry--than I was, along with so many other      women, lost in the bright light of victory in Asia and in      Europe.       My return raised more eyebrows than salutes. The question      of patriotism lost in the questions. A widow at 20, a reason,      perhaps. A call to do what was needed to be done, a need to      compete, anything you can do--I can do better. Or was it a      legacy of generations of soldiers and sailors--a bloodline.       An uncle in South Africa and winning the Victoria Cross--     dead in the Battle of the Marne in France. Cousins in the      Battle of Normandy and in the landings in the Pacific. A      brother in the North Atlantic on the run to Murmansk in      Russia. Are my genes less willing? Willing to take the oath.      Any less willing to work for victory? Parades! Celebrations!      And perhaps--thanks for the peace.       But no parades, no thanks, only the challenge that comes      from the feeling, as soon as I took off that uniform, put my      wings in a drawer and visited my mother's grave; that I was      overcome by the feeling, my service had stepped into the      glare of challenge, and somehow, never cast a shadow.       Like many other women who answered the call, heard the      challenge, we marched home to the sound of muffled drums and      vanished. Over the past few years the drums have picked up      the beat. Was it Desert Storm? Or was it the women in gun      ships, on bomb runs. Or was it the shadow of the women in the      1940s who hit the flight lines running--who heard the call.       Was it my cousin who, as a nurse, lead the children into      safe haven from the bombing in Liverpool. Or was my cousin      who commanded an ack ack battery near Dover and who met the      ragged convoy coming from France and to find her badly burned      brother in those wounded.       My challenge to myself, and to you today, will be to pledge      to volunteer for peace. To extend that hand that covers your      heart and reach out to help. Help the fallen and the falling.      To steady the step of those who have lost the way. Take the      time to share--time--with those who have only the memory of      other times. To wage a war for peace!       Hear again the call to volunteer--when you raise your right      hand to pledge your life, your energy, your compassion to win      the peace.       As veterans we share a common thread of willingness to be      counted. Our Nation is calling on you again to be counted.      Get out of the back row and step up front. Into the front      lines, get the facts. Get the ammo of involvement and get off      your fences and fight for the right to be an American. A      nation that shows the way with people--not with the gold of      treasury--the strength of industry--but a people who are      celebrating peace--hearing and healing.       I am proud of my American birth, I must also thank the      warriors my family gave me in my heritage. A heritage I      pledged for war and continue to pledge--again--for peace.       My husband, of only four weeks, name is on this monument. I      honor his name and will not forget his sacrifice.                          ____________________
