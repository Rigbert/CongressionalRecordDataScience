Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would also just like to say that the CRS, Congressional Research Service, has found that price controls in this bill, H.R. 3, the underlying bill, may be unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause.  So, instead of considering yet another amendment which expands radical government-mandated price controls at the expense of developing lifesaving cures, our time would be better spent considering bipartisan policies such as what is in the substitute, H.R. 19.  So I would encourage my colleagues to, instead, vote for the amendment on H.R. 19 and vote against H.R. 3.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
