Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer legislation which will authorize a study to assist in the implementation of the recommendation of the Joint Federal/State Commission on Policies and Programs affecting Alaska Natives. This legislation is needed to address the social and economic crisis status of Alaska Natives.  In 1990, President Bush signed Public Law 101-379 which created a public commission funded jointly by Federal and State appropriations to complete a comprehensive study on the social and economic conditions of Alaska Natives and the effectiveness of programs and policies of the United States and the State of Alaska which provide services to the Alaska Native communities. This was in response to the 1989 report ``Report on the Status of Alaska Natives: A Call for Action'' published in cooperation by the Alaska Federation of Natives and the University of Alaska's Institute for Social and Economic Research. A 14-member commission was formed, half of whom were appointed by the President of the United States and the remainder of whom were appointed by the Governor of the State of Alaska.  The primary focus of the study was to provide an in-depth analysis, with specific recommendations to Congress, the President of the United States, the Alaska Legislature, the Governor of the State of Alaska, and the Native community on the social and economic conditions of Alaska Natives. The commission completed 2 years of research, public hearings, and task force discussions, and submitted its report to the Congress, the President of the United States, the Alaska Legislature, and the Governor of Alaska in May 1994.  Volume one of a three-volume report provides an overview and summary of 22 months of hearings, research, and deliberations. ``Native Self-Reliance,'' ``Native Self-Determination,'' and the ``Integrity of Alaska Native Cultures'' are the central fundamentals of the first volume. It also provides the historical causes of Native personal and cultural breakdowns. Also include in this first volume are statistics on Native social/cultural, judicial/correctional, economic, educational, physical/behavioral health problems. Finally, 34 main policy recommendations--plus an additional 76 recommendations--was submitted to the United States, and State of Alaska, the Alaska Native community and the general public.  Volume two provides a narrative text, data, and recommendations of five separate studies of Native problems conducted by the Commission's task forces: ``Alaska Native Physical Health,'' ``Social/Cultural Issues and the Alcohol Crisis,'' ``Economic Issues and Rural Development; Alaska Native Education,'' and ``Self-Governance & Self-Determination.''  The final volume provides a full narrative text, data, and recommendations of two separate studies of Native public policy issues conducted by the Commission: ``Alaska Native Subsistence,'' and ``Alaska Native Tribal Government.''  The Committee on Resources held a joint oversight hearing with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to accept testimony on the Alaska Native Commission report dated May 1994 from the Alaska Native Community, the Governor of the State of Alaska, industry representatives and from the administration. Their testimony focused on recommendations provided by the Commission report on how to address the extremely volatile social and economic conditions of Alaska Natives. This legislation is the outcome of the testimony accepted by all entities in the first step of addressing the crisis status of the Alaska Natives.                          ____________________
