Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and strongly support the motion to recommit.  This is a historic bill, the FAA bill. I want to thank my staff: Kathy Dedrick; Alex Burkett; Rachel Carr; Michael Tien; Luke Strimer; Janet Erickson; David Napoliello; Helena Zyblikewycz; Auke Mahar-Piersma; Ward McCarragher, who has moved on; Alexa Old Crow; and Jamie Harrell.  I want to congratulate the outgoing chair, Frank LoBiondo. It is his last major bill in Congress, and Frank was great to work with. I hope he has a great life after Congress.
