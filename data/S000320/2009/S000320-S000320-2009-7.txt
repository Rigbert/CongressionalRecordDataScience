 President, I would like to take the opportunity to expand upon some of my earlier comments, and those of other Members of the Senate, in relation to NASA and the future of human space flight.  I am concerned with aspects of the Augustine Commission's report that add credibility to far-reaching options for furthering our manned space flight program. If Congress and the public are to be asked to spend more for change, then it should be change that will give us the best chance to succeed and to continue to lead the world in human space exploration.
