 The action was taken to deter the Assad regime from using chemical weapons again.  I support both the action and the objective. The planning of this operation was clearly well considered. It was taken against the Shayrat airfield from which the aircraft used in the attack had been launched, where chemical weapons had been stored, and was taken against assets of importance to the regime--aircraft, hardened shelters, and air defense systems.  In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to prevent a failed state.  Our gratitude goes out to the world's most capable military, which in a span of just hours presented options, capabilities, and plans to the Commander in Chief and then executed a difficult mission. None of this occurs without years of training, investment, and the dedication by our servicemembers.  This was an action of consequence. It is a clear signal from America that Bashar al-Assad can no longer use chemical weapons against his own people with impunity.  In addition, for the attention of all Senators, we will have a briefing on this matter later today.                          ____________________
