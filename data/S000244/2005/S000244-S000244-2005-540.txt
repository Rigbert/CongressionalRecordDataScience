Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Let me say that the gentleman from Michigan correctly states the law that anything that has race-based quotas in it or set-asides is subject to strict scrutiny by the courts.  I am afraid that if the manager's amendment goes down, there will be a lawsuit and a temporary restraining order against disposing of any of these funds to underserved communities, and that would be a shame. What the manager's amendment does is err on the side of caution.  Now I point out that the bill, H.R. 357 of the 106th Congress, which the gentleman from Michigan himself introduced, does exactly what the manager's amendment proposes to do. And in section 651(c)(7), his bill from the 106th Congress says underserved populations include populations underserved because of race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, alienage status, geographic location, including rural isolation, language barriers, or any other populations determined to be underserved by the State planning process.  Now the gentleman from Michigan has changed his position. The manager's amendment keeps it the way it is because we know that the money will be flowing and cannot be enjoined as a result of a constitutional challenge irrespective of how that challenge ends up being finally decided by the courts. I urge adoption of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
