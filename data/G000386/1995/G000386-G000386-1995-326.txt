 President, over the next few days, I intend to give a series of speeches on the integrity of the Department of Defense budget.  Before I get started, and for the benefit of all new Senators, I want to give some background on how I got involved with these defense issues.  I want to share a small piece of history with my colleagues. I think we can learn from this history and hopefully we can avoid past mistakes. But we cannot learn from our mistakes if the history remains buried in old issues of the Congressional Record. So I want to share my experiences with, particularly, my new colleagues, because over half of the Members in the Senate today were not Members of this body 10 years ago when President Reagan's massive military buildup was fiercely debated right here in this Chamber. I think that was a defining experience for me.  We made a major decision when we stopped the Reagan defense buildup that, at that point, had been going on for 3 or 4 years. This process helped to shape my thinking, as I said. Even though it took place more than 10 years ago, I think it still is having some ripple effect today. Its mark on current defense policy is unmistakable. So it is important to understand the dynamics of that debate, at least from my perspective.  I was convinced--almost from day one--that the Pentagon, through its actions, was bent on launching a wasteful budget buildup. I was convinced that we were about to throw huge sums of money at a problem better solved by structural reform and honest management.   [[Page S4165]] Let me say that by the time we finally made a decision to stop the Reagan defense buildup and freeze the defense budget, we had, in fact, wasted a lot of money.  So, seeing this, I did--and there were several others that did, as well--what I could to stop this waste of money. I offered an amendment to freeze the defense budget. That was on the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution. My amendment was adopted on May 2, 1985, by a one-vote margin of 50 to 49. That act alone threw a monkey wrench into the Reagan administration's plan to continue their ramp-up of the defense budget.  But, more than anything else, it was the spare parts horror stories in the early 1980's that changed my thinking on this issue. You know, the $750 pair of pliers or the $7,000 coffee pot. The spare parts horror stories were a turning point. They convinced me that the plan for this massive ramp-up of defense expenditures was a colossal taxpayer ripoff. These spare parts horror stories undermined the credibility of the Reagan defense buildup. The spare parts horror stories turned me into a defense reformer. They drove me to watchdogging and to digging into fraud, waste, and abuse at the Pentagon.  That was early in my Senate career.  I began watchdogging from my vantage point as a member of the Budget Committee and as chairman of the General Oversight Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee.  I am not, nor ever have been, a member of the Armed Services Committee, and only served 4 short years on the Appropriations Committee.  So, as a conservative Republican, it is not easy for me to take on these issues, not being on the appropriate committees. But if common sense tells me something is not right, I speak out and I dig. I am still digging today, and I hope a lot of my colleagues are digging as well.  As a consequence of my position on defense, I took a lot of heat from Republicans during the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush administrations. Most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle think that defense is some kind of sacred cow. They think it has been inoculated and should be immune from criticism. They take a dim view of my position on defense.  The Democrats, by comparison, gave me no heat at all. In fact, on defense issues, I got a lot more support from Democrats than I did from Republicans.  In the 1980's, Democrats--plus a handful of Republicans like Senator Roth, for example--helped me ferret out waste and abuse at the Pentagon.  I had the privilege of working closely with a number of Democrats, some in the House, some in the Senate--Senators like Senator Pryor, Senator Levin, Senator Boxer, and others--to bring about some defense reform. We worked together to freeze the Department of Defense budget. We worked together to beef up independent testing of a new weapons system. We crafted the false claims bill, which brought $1 billion of fraudulent wasted money back into the Treasury, and we passed the whistleblower protection legislation. And we worked together to cut out wasteful spending.  That is my point, Mr. President.  When we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, it was very unpopular for a Republican Senator to take on a Republican President on defense. But I was not afraid to do it.  Then in 1993, as you know, we got a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress. I kept right on doing what I had been doing--digging into fraud, waste, and abuse at the Pentagon--even though some of my Democratic allies at that point seemed to disappear into the weeds because they did not want to be criticizing a Pentagon run by a political appointee of their party.  Now we have a Republican Congress, Mr. President, but we still have a Democratic President. And it happens that this Democratic President is considered weak on defense.  Once again, it is very unpopular to tangle with the Pentagon. But I intend to keep right on doing it as we move into this budget season once again.  Because the same old problems persist. So we need to keep right on digging. We need to keep right on watchdogging just like before, because really, Mr. President, nothing has changed.  I only hope that the Members on the other side of the aisle will be there when I and the American people need them. I say that because they are the President's party. I hope a few of my Republican allies will help me bring some fiscal discipline to the Pentagon budget.  I hope all the new Members of the Senate who were not here the last time we debated this issue will study it very closely. I hope that the new Republican Members who ran on a campaign of no longer business as usual, they ran on a campaign to make a difference, everything I have seen from the new Members of this body--who are all Republicans--they are showing, every Member, that they have not changed one iota since November 8, the night of their election.  They are equally committed to showing the people of this country it is no longer business as usual. They are equally committed to making sure that things change. They have made an impact on the other Members of this body who are not new, both Republican and Democrat. They are keeping the focus where it ought to be.  I am saying, especially to those new Republican Members of this body, that I hope they will take as tough a look at how money is being spent in the Defense Department and that they will not buy the argument that you can throw money at the Defense Department and automatically get more defense, any more than I know these new Members will accept the argument from the other side of the aisle on social welfare, education, and a lot of other domestic programs, that all we have to do somehow is spend more money and we automatically get more and better programs.  The fact of the matter is, it does not matter whether it is Republicans or Democrats, Republican spending on defense or Democrat spending on social programs, we only get for our money what we make sure we get for our money. It is not how much money we appropriate. It is how that money is spent that we ought to be concerned about. And it will determine whether or not we have a strong national security program, or whether we have a strong education program, or a strong welfare program.  I hope that my allies--and I hope we have some new allies, as well--will fight just as hard with me for a good, sound, defense policy now that the Republicans are the majority party in this Congress. I hope they will help me make sure that the taxpayers' money is spent wisely and, most importantly, according to law. I will have four or five speeches later on in the next few days on how some of this money is not being spent according to law.  I hope they will help me make sure that the citizens get a full and accurate accounting of how their money was spent by the Pentagon. And I hope that my speeches will help set the stage for a better understanding of the problem and more sound decisions on defense. I hope they will help the new Senators understand that just throwing more money at the Defense Department will not automatically give Americans greater and better defense.  Tomorrow I plan to talk about the accuracy of the Department of Defense budget and accounting data. As I go along, I hope to draw on my experiences with the defense issues of the 1980's. I want to use those experiences as a way of trying to bring today's defense debate into sharper focus. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
