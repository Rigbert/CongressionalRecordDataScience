 I'm from the great State of Michigan where our unemployment is, sadly, at 15.2 percent, almost twice the national average. Last night we learned from the National Association of Auto Dealers that, in fact, in just 3 days this program has brought about almost a quarter of a million new car sales, yet the cash is going to run out literally in the next couple of days without an infusion. It's important that we're not taking new money. This is existing money. This bill moves existing money from other accounts, so it will not add to this year's deficit, but it is going to run out without this legislation.  Here is today's USA Today, a full page ad by Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep, $4,500 back if you purchase a new vehicle, turn in your old one, and get something that's at least 10 miles per gallon better. A lot of our auto dealers can do it, whether it's the Big Three or the transplants too. Nationwide, one in 10 jobs are auto-related. In Michigan it's about one in four, one in five jobs. For the last 3 years, auto sales have declined by nearly 50 percent. There are 16 other countries that have done this. Whether it be Germany, South Korea, even Slovakia has done this. In all of those 16 countries, car sales have come back. This country lost one in five manufacturing jobs in the last 16 months. If we want to keep jobs here in this country, bring back some of those that we have lost, obviously it's got to be in the auto sector where 1 in 10 jobs are auto-related. This bill sends those dominos the other way. It brings people back in the showroom. We've demonstrated that just this week. It brings back the call orders. We've heard from a number of dealers across Michigan that they're, frankly, running out of cars. Guess what they're going to do--they're going to order them back, and that's going to bring people back to work.  Let me just end on this, wouldn't you rather have people working and paying taxes than being unemployed and receiving benefits which, in Michigan, are becoming exhausted? I ask my colleagues to vote for this bill.                              {time}  1230
