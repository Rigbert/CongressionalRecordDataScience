President, I would like the people following this debate to understand what is being said. We have spent billions of dollars on the war in Iraq, and I voted for every penny of it. If it were my son or daughter over there, I would give them everything they needed to get their mission accomplished and come home safely. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, how many official committee hearings and investigations have there been in Congress looking into the sole-source, multibillion-dollar contracting the Senator has referred to?
