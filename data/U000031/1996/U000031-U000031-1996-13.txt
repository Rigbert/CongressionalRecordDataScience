Chairman, I care deeply about the deficit and maintaining a strong national defense. Next year we will be spending more just on the interest servicing the $5.5 trillion national debt than all of the Defense Department budget and foreign aid put together; and, consequently, we need to look under every rock and stone for savings.  Last year a similar amendment passed this body 273 to 176. Our amendment this year provides flexibility to offset the cost of our troops overseas by our European NATO Allies. If we can ask Americans to tighten their belts on a whole host of issues, is there any reason why we cannot ask our European allies to do the same?  This amendment can save the taxpayers $11 billion. That is certainly worth a ``yes'' vote.
