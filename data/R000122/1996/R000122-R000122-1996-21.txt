Meaningful welfare reform should move individuals to work and instill individual responsibility, while ensuring that children are protected.  The Republican bill debated today, just like the one vetoed by the President last year, does not pass these essential tests. In fact, the Republican bill fails to provide sufficientfunding to move welfare recipients to work; does not provide adequate resources for States and individuals in the event of a severe recession; and unduly and unnecessarily harms children. The Republican bill can be summed up as weak on work and tough on children.  I support the Castle-Tanner alternative which is a tough, balanced, and bipartisan welfare reform bill that can be signed into law if the Republicans would let it reach the President's desk. Castle-Tanner contains the funding States need to put people to work according to the Congressional Budget Office. In addition, Castle-Tanner contains time limits for welfare benefits, guarantees protections for children, requires State accountability in operating welfare programs, and improves the response to economic downturns.  In my State of Rhode Island, a coalition of State officials, business leaders, and anti-poverty groups are currently working out the final details of a compromise welfare reform package. Unlike the Republican bill which would jeopardize this Rhode Island welfare reform effort, Castle-Tanner compliments it by providing the necessary resources and flexibility to move Rhode Island welfare recipients into work.  I urge my colleagues to support the Castle-Tanner substitute. Castle-Tanner is the only bill offered today that will provide the funding, flexibility, and protections necessary to create a reformed welfare system that promotes work. Castle-Tanner is responsible and meaningful welfare reform and it is a better bill for both Rhode Island and America.
