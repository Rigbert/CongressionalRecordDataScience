President, I know the Senator has advocated for satellite offices. His amendment speaks for geographic diversity. Otherwise, every one of us would be asking for one in our State. Vermont, which receives more patents per capita than any other State in the Union, would be asking for one, and so forth. He does not try to tilt the balance in favor of a particular State but he calls for geographic diversity. That is very wise. When the amendment comes to a vote, I will be there to support it.  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is pending?
