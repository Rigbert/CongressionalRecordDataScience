I will make two very brief points.  First, in 1972, we passed the Pell grant. If we simply indexed that grant for inflation, the maximum Pell grant today would be $4,300. We are asking for an increase from $3,000 in this budget to $3,500. Second, back in 1980, the maximum Pell grant covered 72 percent of the cost of a 4-year public college. Now it covers roughly 20 percent. We need more. That is what the Wellstone-Reed amendment asks us to do.
