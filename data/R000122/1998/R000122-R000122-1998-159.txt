President, I rise today to pay tribute to Christmas in April USA, our Nation's oldest volunteer home repair initiative. This program has helped to rehabilitate the homes of over 31,000 elderly, low-income, and disabled individuals nationwide.  I would particularly like to recognize the 5th anniversary of the Christmas in April program's arrival in Providence, Rhode Island, where it is making a difference in many communities. In just five years, Providence's Christmas in April has helped to restore over 100 dwellings, through the efforts and commitment of thousands of volunteers. Indeed, this important initiative has dedicated almost $1 million to improve our communities and to help Rhode Island's less fortunate homeowners. The Christmas in April program exemplifies the true spirit of volunteerism.  Mr. President, I would particularly like to commend Providence College and its President, Reverend Philip A. Smith, for his leadership in creating our nation's first Christmas in April campus chapter. I am convinced that this unique volunteer service organization will continue to better Rhode Island's communities for many years to come.                          ____________________
