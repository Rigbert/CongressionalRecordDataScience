 President, I came to the floor to oppose two amendments, the Ensign amendment and the Barrasso amendment. However, before doing so, because my distinguished colleague from South Carolina spoke about the horrible earmarks, I wish to present my point of view.  I come from the largest State in the Union.  We are about 38 million people. In population, we are bigger than 21 States and the District of Columbia put together. We have 10.1 percent unemployment. We have 1.86 million people unemployed. That is more people unemployed in California today than are people in 14 States in the United States. We have increasing wildfires. We have decreasing water. We are the largest agricultural State in the Union--a $40 billion agricultural industry. For the great Central Valley south of the delta, the water allocation for this year is zero. We are a State that is in great need of infrastructure repair.
