President, I have long worked to pass legislation to bring additional transparency and accountability to the government. I do so again today by calling on all Senators to support the Death in Custody Reporting Act, a bill that has moved multiple times through the Senate Judiciary Committee and should pass the Senate without further delay.  This is about an open and fair government. The Death in Custody Reporting Act requires that local and Federal law enforcement officials report deaths that occur while people are held in their custody, including those that occur during arrest. Nothing more. Just yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that hundreds of police-related deaths are unaccounted for in Federal statistics. I ask that the article, ``Hundreds of Police Killings AreUncounted in Federal Stats,'' be made part of the Record. The details of the article are unacceptable. The Justice Department should have an opportunity to analyze the data and see what we can learn from it. And the American people deserve the same.  This important opportunity for needed transparency comes at a time when many Americans are losing faith in our justice system. We are having an important conversation about the loss of human life in communities across the country. Here we have an opportunity to instill some measure of accountability, and hopefully begin to restore some measure of trust in these communities.  This legislation, sponsored by Congressman Bobby Scott, overwhelmingly passed the House last year in a bipartisan vote. We reported the bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a similarly strong bipartisan vote, with Ranking Member Grassley speaking in strong support of the legislation. Currently, every single Senate Democrat is in support of its passage, but a handful of Senate Republicans are not yet convinced. It is my hope that they soon reconsider, and we can send this legislation to the President for signature without delay. The American people would expect as much.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 3, 2014]       Hundreds of Police Killings Are Uncounted in Federal Stats      FBI Data Differs from Local Counts on Justifiable Homicides                    (By Rob Barry and Coulter Jones)       Washington--When 24-year-old Albert Jermaine Payton wielded      a knife in front of the police in this city's southeast      corner, officers opened fire and killed him.       Yet according to national statistics intended to track      police killings, Mr. Payton's death in August 2012 never      happened. It is one of hundreds of homicides by law-     enforcement agencies between 2007 and 2012 that aren't      included in records kept by the Federal Bureau of      Investigation.       A Wall Street Journal analysis of the latest data from 105      of the country's largest police agencies found more than 550      police killings during those years were missing from the      national tally or, in a few dozen cases, not attributed to      the agency involved. The result: It is nearly impossible to      determine how many people are killed by the police each year.       Public demands for transparency on such killings have      increased since the August shooting death of 18-year-old      Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Mo. The Ferguson Police      Department has reported to the FBI one justifiable homicide      by police between 1976 and 2012.       Law-enforcement experts long have lamented the lack of      information about killings by police. ``When cops are killed,      there is a very careful account and there's a national      database,'' said Jeffrey Fagan, a law professor at Columbia      University. ``Why not the other side of the ledger?''       Police can use data about killings to improve tactics,      particularly when dealing with people who are mentally ill,      said Paco Balderrama, a spokesman for the Oklahoma City      Police Department. ``It's great to recognize that, because 30      years ago we used to not do that. We used to just show up and      handle the situation.''       Three sources of information about deaths caused by      police--the FBI numbers, figures from the Centers for Disease      Control and data at the Bureau of Justice Statistics--differ      from one another widely in any given year or state, according      to a 2012 report by David Klinger, a criminologist with the      University of Missouri-St. Louis and a onetime police      officer.       To analyze the accuracy of the FBI data, the Journal      requested internal records on killings by officers from the      nation's 110 largest police departments. One-hundred-five of      them provided figures.       Those internal figures show at least 1,800 police killings      in those 105 departments between 2007 and 2012, about 45%      more than the FBI's tally for justifiable homicides in those      departments' jurisdictions, which was 1,242, according to the      Journal's analysis. Nearly all police killings are deemed by      the departments or other authorities to be justifiable.       The full national scope of the underreporting can't be      quantified. In the period analyzed by the Journal, 753 police      entities reported about 2,400 killings by police. The large      majority of the nation's roughly 18,000 law-enforcement      agencies didn't report any. ``Does the FBI know every agency      in the U.S. that could report but has chosen not to? The      answer is no,'' said Alexia Cooper, a statistician with the      Bureau of Justice Statistics who studies the FBI's data.      ``What we know is that some places have chosen not to report      these, for whatever reason.''       FBI spokesman Stephen G. Fischer said the agency uses      ``established statistical methodologies and norms'' when      reviewing data submitted by agencies. FBI staffers check the      information, then ask agencies ``to correct or verify      questionable data,'' he said.       The reports to the FBI are part of its uniform crime      reporting program. Local law-enforcement agencies aren't      required to participate. Some localities turn over crime      statistics, but not detailed records describing each      homicide, which is the only way particular kinds of killings,      including those by police, are tracked by the FBI. The      records, which are supposed to document every homicide, are      sent from local police agencies to state reporting bodies,      which forward the data to the FBI.       The Journal's analysis identified several holes in the FBI      data.       Justifiable police homicides from 35 of the 105 large      agencies contacted by the Journal didn't appear in the FBI      records at all. Some agencies said they didn't view      justifiable homicides by law-enforcement officers as events      that should be reported. The Fairfax County Police Department      in Virginia, for example, said it didn't consider such cases      to be an ``actual offense,'' and thus doesn't report them to      the FBI.       For 28 of the remaining 70 agencies, the FBI was missing      records of police killings in at least one year. Two      departments said their officers didn't kill anyone during the      period analyzed by the Journal.       About a dozen agencies said their police-homicides tallies      didn't match the FBI's because of a quirk in the reporting      requirements: Incidents are supposed to be reported by the      jurisdiction where the event occurred, even if the officer      involved was from elsewhere. For example, the California      Highway Patrol said there were 16 instances in which one of      its officers killed someone in a city or other local      jurisdiction responsible for reporting the death to the FBI.      In some instances reviewed by the Journal, an agency believed      its officers' justifiable homicides had been reported by      other departments, but they hadn't.       Also missing from the FBI data are killings involving      federal officers.       Police in Washington, D.C., didn't report to the FBI      details about any homicides for an entire decade beginning      with 1998--the year the Washington Post found the city had      one of the highest rates of officer-involved killings in the      country. In 2011, the agency reported five killings by      police. In 2012, the year Mr. Payton was killed, there are      again no records on homicides from the agency.       D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said she      doesn't know why the agency stopped reporting the numbers in      1998. ``I wasn't the chief and had no role in decision      making'' back then, said Ms. Lanier, who was a captain at the      time. When she took over in 2007, she said, reporting the      statistics ``was a nightmare and a very tedious process.''       Ms. Lanier said her agency resumed its reports in 2009. In      2012, the agency turned over the detailed homicide records,      she said, but the data had an error in it and was rejected by      the FBI. She referred questions about why the department      stopped reporting homicides in 1998 to former Chief Charles      H. Ramsey, now head of the Philadelphia Police Department.      Mr. Ramsey declined to comment.       In recent years, police departments have tried to rely more      on statistics to develop better tactics. ``You want to get      the data right,'' said Mike McCabe, the undersheriff of the      Oakland County Sheriff's Office in Michigan. It is ``really      important in terms of how you deploy your resources.''       A total of 100 agencies provided the Journal with numbers      of people killed by police each year from 2007 through 2012;      five more provided statistics for some years. Several,      including the police departments in New York City, Los      Angeles, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, post detailed use-     of-force reports online.       Five of the 110 agencies the Journal contacted, including      the Michigan State Police, didn't provide internal figures. A      spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police said the agency had      records of police shootings, but ``not in tally form.''       Big increases in the numbers of officer-involved killings      can be a red flag about problems inside a police department,      said Mike White, a criminologist at Arizona State University.      ``Sometimes that can be tied to poor leadership and problems      with accountability,'' he said.       The FBI has almost no records of police shootings from      departments in three of the most populous states in the      country--Florida, New York and Illinois.       In Florida, available reports from the Florida Department      of Law Enforcement don't conform to FBI requirements and      haven't been included in the national tally since 1996. A      spokeswoman for the state agency said in an email that      Florida was ``unable'' to meet the FBI's reporting      requirements because its tracking software was outdated.       New York revamped its reporting system in 2002 and 2006,      but isn't able to track information about justifiable police      homicides, said a spokeswoman for the New York State Division      of Criminal Justice Services. She said the agency was      ``looking to modify our technology so we can reflect these      numbers.''       In 1987, a commission created by then- Governor Mario Cuomo      to investigate abuse of force by police found that New York's      reports to the FBI were ``inadequate and incomplete,'' and      urged reforms to ``hold government accountable for the use of      force.'' The spokeswoman for the state criminal-justice      agency said it isn't clear what the agency did in response      back then.       Illinois only began reporting crime statistics to the FBI      in 2010 and hasn't phased in     the detailed homicide reports. ``We cannot begin adding      additional pieces because we are newcomers to the federal      program,'' said Tern Hickman, director of the Illinois State      Police's crime-reporting program. Two agencies in Illinois      deliver data to the FBI: Chicago and Rockford.       In Washington, D.C., councilman Tommy Wells held two      hearings this fall on police oversight. He said he was      surprised that the department hadn't reported details of      police killings to the FBI. ``That should not be a      challenge,'' he said.       More than two years after the knife-carrying Mr. Payton was      shot and killed by D.C. police, his mother, who witnessed the      killing, said she is still looking for answers. Helena      Payton, 59, said her son had many interactions with local      police because of what she said was his mental illness. ``All      the cops in the Seventh District knew him, just about,'' she      said.       The officers who arrived that Friday afternoon in August,      in response to a call from Mr. Payton's girlfriend, had never      dealt with her son, she said. According to Ms. Payton, her      son walked outside holding a small utility knife. As he      approached the officers, they fired dozens of bullets at him,      she said. He died soon after.       The U.S. attorney's office is reviewing the incident, as is      customary in all police shootings in Washington. A spokesman      for the office declined to comment on the status of the case.      The Washington police department, citing the continuing      investigation, declined to provide the officers' names, a      narrative of what happened, or basic information usually      included in the reports to the FBI, such as the number of      officers involved in the shooting.       The officers involved are back on duty, according to D.C.      authorities, but the case isn't closed.                          ____________________
