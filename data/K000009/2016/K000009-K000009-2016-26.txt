 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Javier Jorge-Reyes, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on this House floor. In his memory, we beg the Republican leadership, please, let us have a vote on a bill that has been awaiting passage for years.
