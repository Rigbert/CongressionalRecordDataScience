The case for this treaty is compelling. The CWC treaty was negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, two Republican administrations. It is now being moved to ratification by a Democratic administration. CWC is supported whole heartedly and overwhelmingly by the American people. According to a poll, 84 percent of all Americans support this convention. It also has the unconditional support of the U.S. chemical industry and the U.S. military as represented by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, General Shalikashvili, and Admiral Zumwalt among others. It is endorsed by veterans groups; religious organizations; the intelligence community; peace groups; societies for physicians, scientists, and engineers; and military organizations. It has already been ratified by 68 countries around the world including China, India, Japan, many of the former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries as well as our major West European allies. The fact of the matter is, the treaty is both effective and reasonable. It makes sense militarily and economically.  Despite this unprecedented support from such diverse groups, the Convention has been languishing, awaiting a Senate vote since 1993. Very simply put, and to quote from an editorial in the Chicago Tribune: ``This Treaty Ought To Be Ratified.'' This Tribune editorial goes on to state, ``In the annals of 20th century warfare, hardly a weapon short of nuclear explosives has produced such loathing and terror as those classified as chemical weapons.'' When you are considering outlawing the development, production, transfer, acquisition, and use of chemical weapons, partisanship and obstructionism should not be an issue.  There are many misstatements and much propaganda against the CWC. The truth is that there is a heavy price to pay if we are not an original signatory: The United States will have no place on the executive council; Americans won't be able to serve as inspectors; American chemical companies will lose significant business to overseas competitors because of mandatory trade sanctions; and U.S. credibility and influence will be undermined. We'll be in the same category as other nonsignatories such as Libya, Iran, and Syria.  On the other hand, the ratification of CWC will make it less likely that our troops will ever again encounter chemical weapons in the battlefield; less likely that chemical weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists; and less likely that rogue states will have access to chemical weapons. Unfortunately, CWC is not the panacea to remove all threat of chemical weapons, but it is a first important step.  I urge my Senate colleagues to take up the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention on the Senate floor so that this treaty can be ratified. I also ask that three editorials from Illinois newspapers supporting CWC be printed in the Record.  The editorials follow:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 27, 1995]                   The Helms Choke-Hold on Diplomacy       That the president of these United States must seek the      advice and win the consent of the Senate in making treaties      and appointing ambassadors is so integral to the American      system of checks and balances that it is written into the      Constitution.       The framers of that document certainly were no strangers to      the baser side of domestic politics, so a certain amount of      horse-trading in the conduct of foreign policy--which is the      province of the president--was to be tolerated and even      encouraged. Today, however, the pugnacious senator from North      Carolina, Jesse Helms, has turned advice and consent into      stonewalling and deadlock.       As Senate Foreign Relations chairman, a post he assumed      with the Republican sweep of Congress, Helms has laid down      his gavel and refuses to convene business meetings of that      powerful committee.       Frozen by his fit of pique are ratification of a dozen      treaties and international agreements, including two landmark      pacts; Start 2, the treaty slashing U.S. and Russian nuclear      arsenals that was signed by former President George Bush, a      Republican; and the Chemical Weapons Convention, which      outlaws the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.       Among the 400 State Department appointments locked up by      Helms are 30 ambassadorial positions. Thus, the United States      is left without chief envoys to 15 percent of its embassies,      including those in several nations critically important to      American national security and a peaceful world order--China,      Lebanon, Pakistan, Panama, South Africa and Zaire.       What is Helms after? He wants to reorganize the State      Department by eliminating the independent agencies that      handle foreign aid, arms control and public information.      Helms says $3 billion can be saved over four years by letting      the State Department swallow up the Agency for International      Development (AID), the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency      (ACDA) and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA).       The majority of Helms' Senate colleagues, however,      disagree. As recently as last week, the Senate refused to      approve Helm's controversial reorganization plan, which was      attached to the foreign aid bill.       President Clinton concedes there's fat to be trimmed from      the State Department budget but points out, for example, that      the AID budget has been trimmed by 20 percent since he took      office, part of a downward trend that has seen the overall      funding of foreign affairs drop by 47 percent since 1985.       This stonewalling by Helms is ill-considered, and extends      far beyond Congress' power of the purse. Helms should let the      treaties and appointments be voted in committee. Then, the      Senate as a whole and not just one senator--should be allowed      to consider what advice to give Clinton and whether to give      its consent on these important foreign policy matters.                                                                    ____            [From the State Journal-Register, Feb. 11, 1997]            Obstructionism Blocking Chemical Weapons Accord       The Senate's delay in bringing the chemical weapons treaty      to a ratifying vote is inimical to national interests. This      treaty is strongly supported by every major national      constituency.       The treaty is an American brainchild, negotiated under      Presidents Reagan and Bush. President Clinton sent it to the      Senate for ratification in 1993. It has bipartisan Senate      support and is enthusiastically backed by the U.S. military,      which is destroying its chemical weapons stockpiles and wants      to see other nations do the same.       The problem is summed up in two words: Jesse Helms. This      relic from North Carolina who, through seniority, not      ability, has become chairman of the Foreign Relations      Committee, has persuaded Majority Leader Trent Lott to      withhold the treaty from a vote on the floor, where it would      easily pass.       In playing this power game, Helms serves neither nation,      Senate nor party.       He serves his own ego.       The practical effect of Helms' obstructionism is to damage      the U.S. chemical industry, a strong treaty supporter.       After the treaty takes effect April 29, participating      nations (160 have endorsed it so far) and prohibited from      dealing with nonparticipants in any of the chemicals banned      by the treaty, many of which have commercial as well as      military uses.       The U.S. chemical industry puts the cost to it of this      provision at $600 million in exports annually.       But Helms does more serious damage to America's reputation.      This is our treaty. Since the United States renounced      chemical weapons 15 years ago and began destroying      stockpiles, it has been persuading other nations to do the      same.       The Chemical Weapons Convention is the first treaty calling      not just for the reduction of a type of weaponry, but its      entire elimination.       The United States has had success convincing others to      follow our lead, but now it is the Senate's turn to act.      Instead, Helms has blocked a ratifying resolution introduced      by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the man Helms ousted as      committee chairman four years ago in a particularly egregious      use of the seniority principle.       If Helms wants to thwart the Clinton administration and      does not care about the chemical industry, perhaps he should      listen to what the military is saying.       Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of      Staff, is supported by former military leaders Colin Powell,      Brent Scowcroft, Elmo Zumwalt and others in urging quick      ratification.       Disputing Helms' claim that the treaty somehow weakens the      United States, Zumwalt, former chief of naval operations,      says it ``is entirely about eliminating other people's      weapons, weapons that may someday be used against Americans.       That kind of sober warning should be enough to persuade      Helms to end his ego trip and let the treaty go forward.                                                                    ____               [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 19, 1997]                    This Treaty Ought To Be ratified       In the annals of 20th Century warfare, hardly a weapon      short of nuclear explosives has produced such loathing and      terror as those classified as chemical weapons, more commonly      known as poison gas.       Considered the poor-man's A-bomb because of their ease of      manufacture and battlefield delivery, the use of chemicals      was considered so inhumane that even the Nazis declined their      deployment on the battlefield--if not in the extermination      camps.       So horrible was the thought of Iraq using chemical      artillery against U.S. forces in the Gulf War that Baghdad      had the clear impression that to do so might bring quick      nuclear retaliation.       Who besides the leaders of renegade nations would oppose a      treaty that would ban and destroy such heinous weapons of      war? How about a handful of senators who oppose the U.S.      ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.       Jesse Helms, the powerful head of the Senate Committee on      Foreign Relations, and a few others oppose the treaty,      claiming that it cannot be effectively enforced nor can      violations of its provisions be verified. Proponents dispute      such claims. Helms has asked that instead of chemical arms,      Senate priorities first be focused upon other aims, like      legislation ensuring a comprehensive reform of the      ``antiquated'' Department of State and the United Nations.       In this there is a problem: if the Senate does not ratify      the pact by April 29, the day the convention becomes      international law, the sole remaining superpower will lose      out on the right to join teams to monitor suspect chemical      plants and guarantee the destruction of chemical arms      stockpiles. Another detriment would be denial to the U.S. of      access to information gathered by those chemical teams.       So far 161 countries have signed the Chemical Weapons      Convention, and the legislatures of 68 countries--including      those of our major allies--have ratified the pact. Russia,      which has yet to ratify, is nevertheless committed to destroy      its chemical stockpile by the year 2005 and the United States      its own by 2004.       The list of those backing the treaty contains names hardly      associated with a soft line on national defense. On that list      are military giants like Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf,      Brent Scowcroft and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., and civilians like      George Bush, Lawrence Eagleburger and James A. Baker III.       Our confidence on this issue is in them, not Jesse Helms.      The Senate should move quickly to ratify the treaty and join      the 21st Century.                          ____________________
