Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I am happy to accept this amendment that amends the sense of Congress section of the bill that says that victims of Hurricane Katrina cannot have their property condemned simply because it was damaged by the hurricane. Unless the amendment is adopted, then victims of Hurricane Katrina end up getting penalized twice. That is twice too many times. We can take away one of those times by adopting the amendment, and I urge the House to support it.
