Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable human being, Dr. Richard Ruppert. Dr. Ruppert unexpectedly passed from this life on October 22, 2012. Dr. Ruppert was a friend and advisor to many, including me, and we were indeed privileged to have known him.  Born in Rural Ohio 81 years ago, Richard Ruppert worked in the family farm for five years after he graduated from high school. He then went on to Ohio State University, where he received his undergraduate and medical degrees. While at Ohio State University, he met and married his wife, Elizabeth Ruppert, MD.  Following his residency, Dr. Ruppert returned to OSU, where he was professor of gastroenterology in the Department of Medicine for nine years. He was named assistant dean of the College of Medicine in 1970, adding medical director for patient services two years later. He was named vice chancellor for health affairs at the Ohio Board of Regents in 1974, and in 1977 Dr. Ruppert became the third president of the Medical College of Ohio. During his 16 year term, the Medical College of Ohio saw unprecedented growth, was established as a leader in medicine, and came into its own as a premier institution. Dr. Ruppert's able guidance directed the Medical College of Ohio through an illustrious time and his leadership is unparalleled. As one colleague described it, ``Much of MCO's success can be credited to Richard D. Ruppert. From a new college on a divided campus--one part farmland and the other a deteriorating county hospital complex--he provided guidance and the political skills to develop the new campus to its present ten structures . . . The school has emerged from its early growing pains to achieve an identity as a quality medical institution during Dr. Ruppert's tenure, with a large credit due to his leadership and vision.''  Even as he presided at the helm of the medical college, Dr. Ruppert gave himself to civic affairs. He served a decade on the Toledo Lucas County Port Authority Board, fouras chair. He was a Rotarian, serving one term as president. He chaired the United Way of Greater Toledo campaign, was a member and president of the Ohio Historical Society Board and member of the Hayes Presidential Center. He served a decade as trustee, campaign chair, and president of the Fort Meigs Historical Society and was president of the Torch Club.  In all things: family, work, and community, Dr. Richard Ruppert gave all. He leaves a legacy few could match. His brilliance, humor, grace, kindness and insatiable curiosity and love of life were true gifts. He and his wife Libby have been a team unmatched, a gift that keeps giving to us all--our community, advanced medicines, academic excellence, friends and colleagues, loyalty to community, persevering leadership. Dr. Richard Ruppert made a difference for humanity and we are eternally grateful for his life and service to America.                          ____________________
