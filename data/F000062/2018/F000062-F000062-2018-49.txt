 President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Capito, and Durbin to introduce the Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act.  This legislation provides additional tools to drug manufacturers and distributors to better enable them to determine when orders of opioids are suspicious.  It also provides additional tools for law enforcement to hold manufacturers and distributors who fail to identify, report, and stop suspicious orders of opioids accountable.  Between 2006 and 2016, nearly 21 million opioids were distributed to two pharmacies in Williamson, West Virginia, which has a population of nearly 3,000. Even worse, between 2007 and 2008, nearly 9 million pills were distributed to a single pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, which has a population of only 392.  In total, between 2007 and 2012, 780 million oxycodone and hydrocodone pills--two powerful opioids--were distributed to pharmacies throughout West Virginia. These two drugs contributed to 1,700 drug overdose deaths in the state.  All of this happened despite the fact that opioid manufacturers and distributors are required to detect and disclose suspicious orders of opioids to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). They are also required to keep complete and accurate records relating to the sale, delivery, or disposal of opioids through the Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System, often referred to as ARCOS.  While required by law to provide this information, once obtained, the DEA is not required to disclose to opioid manufacturers and distributors the total number of distributors serving a single pharmacy or practitioner, or the total quantity and type of opioids being distributed.  This creates a blind spot because there is no awareness of how many drugs are entering a community. This lack of information may be part of the reason that millions of opioids were able to be delivered to small mom and pop pharmacies in West Virginia.  Our bill corrects this problem by requiring the DEA to provide to opioid manufacturers and distributors anonymized information related to the number of distributors serving a single pharmacy or practitioner, and the quantity and type of opioids being delivered to each.  This information, coupled with the algorithms that these companies already use in their efforts to determine the legitimacy of opioid orders, will help manufacturers and distributors better prevent these substances from being diverted to someone other than the intended recipient who has a lawful prescription.  Our bill also strengthens accountability by establishing civil and criminal fines for drug manufacturers and distributors who fail to consider ARCOS data when determining whether an order for opioids is suspicious. Additionally, it increases existing civil fines for drug manufacturers and distributors who fail to report suspicious orders and keep accurate records ten-fold, from $10,000 to $100,000. It also doubles existing criminal fines from $250,000 to $500,000.  In addition to opioid manufacturers and distributors, accurate and timely data related to the manufacture and distribution of opioids can also assist state officials in stopping suspicious orders.  That is why our bill requires the United States Attorney General to share standardized reports with state officials, including regulatory, licensing, attorneys general, and law enforcement agencies, related to the distribution patterns collected by the ARCOS database on a semi-annual basis.  Finally, our bill requires the Department of Justice to provide an annual report to Congress on how it is using ARCOS data to identify and stop suspicious activity related to opioids.  Opioid manufacturers and distributors are on the front lines and have an important role to play in combatting the opioid crisis.  In 2016, we lost 64,000 individuals to drug overdose deaths in our country. More than 42,000 of these were opioid related.  Prevention is critical to reducing these deaths.  The Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act will help ensure that we never have another situation in which 9 million pills are delivered to a single pharmacy in a town that has a population of less than 400 people. It will provide drug manufacturers and distributors with the tools they need to better prevent the distribution of opioids to bad actors, and will provide law enforcement with the authority to hold them accountable for failure to do so.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to its passage.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
