 Ms. Gloria Margaret Gillespie was a friend to many on Capitol Hill. She worked as a hairdresser in the United States Senate, cutting the hair of many Members of Congress and staff, including a few of my own. You could always count on Gloria being in a good mood. Her great smile and southern charm lit up the halls of the Russell Senate Office Building. During her years on the Hill, she made many friends, including her fellow colleagues in the Senate Barber Shop who have many fond memories of Gloria. We all grew to love her, and she will be missed.  For 29 years, Gloria worked as a hairdresser in the beauty salon that served the Senate. My staff loved going to see her because they said she had magic scissors, great stories, and a wonderful southern accent. I loved to hear about their conversations with Gloria, and how she loved Kentucky and her family and friends back home in Berea. She made my staff feel right at home in her barber chair. Gloria kept them informed on what was going on back home. She enjoyed talking about Berea, and her true love, the University of Kentucky Wildcats. Gloria was one of the biggest Wildcat fans on Capitol Hill, and it was always a treat to hear her stories the day after a big game. Gloria loved the Cats, and if youever wanted to know anything about them, she was the one to ask.  Before moving to Capitol Hill, Gloria attended Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, KY, and eventually she ended up in beauty school. After finishing beauty school, she decided to pack her bags and leave Kentucky for the Nation's Capitol. Once arriving in Washington, she landed a job in the U.S. Senate beauty salon where she cut the hair of Senators and their staffs.  Gloria is survived by her parents C.H. and Mary Frances Gillespie of Berea, and many family and friends in Kentucky and here in Washington, DC. I ask that my colleagues in the Senate, many of whom spent a lot of time in her chair, join me in honoring the memory of Gloria Margaret Gillespie. She was an outstanding Kentuckian, and she will be missed.                          ____________________
