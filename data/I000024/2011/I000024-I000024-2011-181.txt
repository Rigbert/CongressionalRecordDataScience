President, on behalf of myself and my cochair of the Army Caucus, the junior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Daniel Akaka, I congratulate Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth O. Preston for his extraordinary dedication to duty and service to the United States as the 13th Sergeant Major of the Army. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston is retiring after 36 distinguished years of service.  Sergeant Major Preston is a native of Mount Savage, MD. He entered the Army as a cavalry scout in June 1975, and has served in every enlisted leadership position, including cavalry scout, platoon sergeant, and tank commander. He served as Command Sergeant Major of the 1st Armored Division, V Corps in Germany and the Combined Joint Task Force 7 in Baghdad, Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was an instrumental leader during the invasion of Iraq.  In 1975, Sergeant Major Preston was a member of the 1st Cavalry Division, as they were transforming from an Air Cavalry Division to a Heavy Division. He spent his first years in the military as a scout, excelling on every vehicle from motorcycles to dune buggies, surpassing his peers and distinguishing himself as a superior leader. Two years later, Sergeant Major Preston was promoted to sergeant and moved to the 33rd Armor Regiment, 3rd Armor Division in Germany. His commanders again recognized his superior leadership skills and selected him first as a senior gunner and then as the commander of the battalion commanders tank. Throughout his command, his tank was consistently named top tank in the battalion.  Sergeant Major Preston took the knowledge and expertise he gained inGermany to Fort Knox where he became a master gunner instructor. He excelled once again and was hand-picked for an exchange tour with the British Army as a tank instructor in Dorset, England. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston has served in every senior enlisted position in the Army, from platoon sergeant to command sergeant major. He held command sergeant major positions at 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division; then at 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, at 1st Armored Division, and finally at V Corps in Germany. Before becoming Sergeant Major of the Army, he was the command sergeant major for Combined Joint Task Force 7 serving in Baghdad, Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. His leadership and operational expertise were instrumental in planning and executing the attack on the forces of Saddam Hussein.  One of the most enduring contributions Sergeant Major Preston has made to our Nation was implementing the largest transformation of the Army's noncommissioned officer education system since the system was first developed. As the backbone of the Army, noncommissioned officers have specific education requirements throughout their career. The Advance and Senior Level Courses now are more in line with what our leaders need in Afghanistan and Iraq. With the roll out of Structured Self-Development, an online module system that will ensure our noncommissioned officers receive the best training, noncommissioned officers are better educated, which pays huge dividends on the battlefield. Also, with new distributed learning, the Army's first-line leaders are able to spend more time at home with their families while taking classes online.  Over the last 7 years, Sergeant Major of the Army Preston served as the Sergeant Major of the Army, the highest enlisted position attainable in the Army. He assumed this position during the first year of Operation Iraqi Freedom and proved  himself a tremendous wartime leader, demonstrating unselfish devotion to our Nation and the soldiers. He worked tirelessly to restore balance to a force stretched and stressed by the demands of the longest war our Nation has ever known. His personal observations and advice helped guide Army leadership during the implementation of the most comprehensive transformation of the Army since World War II. The end result was building of the most versatile Army in the history of our Nation. Its modular units and improved capabilities enabled the Army to execute its strategy of full-spectrum operations. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston was instrumental in ensuring that this plan adhered to principles of commonsense and care for soldiers and their families. He worked with Army leadership to increase support to families by implementing the Army Family Covenant and the Army Community Covenant. These programs increased support for Army families by expanding and improving services while raising awareness about the unique challenges military families face. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston testified numerous times before Congress on behalf of the 1.1 million soldiers and millions of family members under his care. His clear and passionate testimony resulted in increased compensation, improved housing, improved health services and an overall better quality of life.  The impact of Sergeant Major of the Army Preston's efforts will be felt and seen in our Army for decades to come. His untiring devotion to duty, his love for the Army and its soldiers and families, and his professionalism has left a legacy of trained and educated soldiers. When history looks back at the Army's 13th Sergeant Major of the Army, it will be clear that his personal leadership contributed to the building of the most professional Non-Commissioned Officer Corps the world has ever known. We wish him and his wife Karen continued success and happiness in all of their future endeavors.                          ____________________
