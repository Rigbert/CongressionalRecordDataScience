President, I was somewhat shocked last October whenthe vote came up and actually 75 Senators in the Senate and about 75 percent of the House of Representatives voted to give an unelected bureaucrat $700 billion to do with as he wanted with no accountability. I believe that 20 or 30 years from now, historians will look back and say that was the most outrageous vote, maybe in the history of these institutions.
