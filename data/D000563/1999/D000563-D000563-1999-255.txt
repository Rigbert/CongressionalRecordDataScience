President, let me say in conclusion that this is one of the legislative riders that calls into question the basic issue. Who owns the public lands of America? Will they be a playground for the companies that want to come in and use our lands to make a profit, or will these companies pay their fair share for using public lands?  The Senator from California is resisting Senator Hutchison's amendment. She wants these companies to pay their fair share in royalties.
