 In closing, you know your senatorial lineage is traced to Steven Douglas, and I checked the history of the Senate. I am afraid he is on our side of the aisle, and he traced himself to my seat. You have some distinguished senatorial colleagues who proceeded you, and I am certain you are very proud of them as well.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from California.
