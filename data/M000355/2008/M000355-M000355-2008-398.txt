 President, let me also note the passing of our former colleague, Senator Metzenbaum. I think the majority leader captured him well. He was a man who operated in the Senate similarly to two of our colleagues today--I think of Senator Coburn and Senator Feingold--in the sense that he actually was interested in every piece of legislation that went across the Senate floor. He took the time to look at it, to decide whether he thought it was a good idea or not. He was a man of extraordinary passion.  He was, by his own description, an orthodox liberal and made no apologies about it. As the majority leader has pointed out, he had extraordinary success, rising from absolutely nothing financially and in terms of connections, not only made a substantial amount of money in the private sector but then had a long and distinguished public career as well.  We all remember Senator Metzenbaum with fondness and with respect. I, too, extend my sympathy to the Metzenbaum family.
