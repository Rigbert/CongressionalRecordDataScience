 President, I want to turn to the nomination that is pending before the Senate and that we will be voting on as soon as I finish my remarks.  I have come to the floor many times to speak in opposition to President Trump's ideologically driven, deeply partisan judicial nominees and to express my frustration that under Republican leadership, the Senate is rubberstamping one lifetime judicial nomination after another. The Republican leaders have been willing to rubberstamp these nominees whose qualifications are in doubt. A record number have been deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association, whose impartiality is virtually nonexistent and who are, without a doubt, chosen for their commitment to upholding President Trump's agenda rather than to upholding our Nation's laws.  These nominees have sided with shady for-profit colleges rather than with student loan borrowers--just like the President's Department of Education. President Trump's nominees have followed his footsteps on healthcare, ruling and speaking against expanding affordable healthcare to more families. They have allowed major corporations to skirt rules that are intended to help address the urgent threat of the climate crisis.  Perhaps most consistently, President Trump's judicial nominees have adhered to rigid, backward, deeply harmful ideology when it comes to reproductive healthcare. One called Roe v. Wade ``radical abortion rights.'' Another pushed pseudoscience and claimed that birth control can lead to suicide.  The vast majority of women and men in our country would agree that these are not positions you would want a supposedly impartial judge to espouse. Unfortunately, what I have just laid out pales in comparison to what we know of the judicial nominee we are considering today, Sarah Pitlyk.  Ms. Pitlyk, whom the American Bar Association rated as ``unqualified,'' has actively worked to erode women's access to birth control and abortion. She even defended legislation that would have allowed landlords to have evicted their tenants and employers to have fired their employees simply because they had used birth control or had gotten pregnant before they had gotten married.  These views are already wildly invasive and disqualifying. Unfortunately, there is more.  Ms. Pitlyk has also not only expressed her personal bias against assisted reproductive technology, or ART, but she has actually authored briefs that have argued that surrogacy and ART have ``grave effects on society.''  I am very proud to have personally worked to expand access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, especially for our military families who struggle with infertility, and I firmly believe all families who face this painful challenge should have our strong support.  My good friend the junior Senator from Illinois, who has spoken powerfully about her struggles with fertility and how IVF gave her the opportunity to realize her dream of motherhood, wrote in a letter to our colleagues: ``As a mother who struggled with infertility for years and required IVF to start my family, I would be one of the many Americans who could never enter Ms. Pitlyk's courtroom with any reasonable expectation that my case would be adjudicated in a fair and impartial manner.''  Given Ms. Pitlyk's record of supporting cruel policies that would punish women for accessing basic healthcare like birth control, her support for banning women from exercising their right to abortion, as well as her personal bias and professional actions against starting a family via assisted reproductive technology, I believe a vote in favor of Ms. Pitlyk's nomination would be indefensible.  That is why I ask my colleagues on the Republican side to stop and really consider this vote. If confirmed, Ms. Pitlyk's tenure on the courts will last for decades--well beyond President Trump's last day in the White House. That would mean, for years and years, decisions would be made that we can only expect would harm women and families, restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare, and even potentially jeopardize their ability to become parents. In other words, a vote for Ms. Pitlyk now will keep hurting people long after the President's name-calling on Twitter doesn't drive headlines anymore.  I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing for women and families today and for years to come and join me in opposing this nomination on the floor.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
