 The White House was honest enough to make that very clear. So it would seem to me that for those people who want reimportation, you have to vote ``no.'' If you don't want reimportation, then you can vote for it. But that is the simple reality.  There is another issue which I understand was raised a little while ago--I was not on the floor at that moment--and that dealing with the Clinton administration's attitude toward reimportation. I must say when I was a Member of the House, I was very involved in this issue. I was one of the leaders in the House in fighting for prescription drug reimportation. Back in the year 2000, we worked very closely with the Clinton administration and with then Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala to craft and pass reimportation legislation. During that process, the Clinton administration came to support reimportation over a period of time.  Unfortunately, as many in this Chamber remember, it was during that debate on reimportation that the Senator from Mississippi first offered the certification language he is putting forward today. So he has been doing this for quite a while. It is true Secretary Shalala refused to implement the reimportation legislation passed in 2000 as a result of this certification. I know opponents of reimportation like to characterize Secretary Shalala's refusal to implement reimportation because she believed reimportation was impossible to make safe. That is the argument we hear over and over again: Hey, it is not us. Even the Clinton administration said reimportation could not be made safe. But what I must say,as straightforwardly as I can, is that argument is not accurate. It is not right.  In her December 26, 2000, letter to President Clinton dealing with this issue, Secretary Shalala outlined several ``flaws and loopholes'' that would prevent the legislation from being effective. As someone who was active in the debate of 2000, let me also say it is a fact that these ``flaws and loopholes'' were identified prior to the passage of that legislation, but opponents of reimportation refused to address them because they knew those flaws and loopholes would be fatal.  The legislation being offered today by Senator Dorgan addresses each and every one of those flaws and loopholes identified by Secretary Shalala. So let me say this again. If anyone comes to the floor of the Senate and says the Clinton administration thought reimportation should not go forward because there were flaws in it that could not be dealt with, that is simply inaccurate. What Secretary Shalala said is, there are concerns I have, and these concerns have got to be addressed. Well, guess what. Senator Dorgan's legislation does just that.  Let us take a look at her letter. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I am referring to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                December 26, 2000.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     The White House     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: The annual appropriations bill for the      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (P.L. 106-387), signed      into law earlier this year, included a provision to allow      prescription drugs to be reimported from certain countries      for sale in the United States. The law requires that, prior      to implementation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services      demonstrate that this reimportation poses no additional risk      to the public's health and safety and that it will result in      a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to      the American consumer.       I am writing to advise you that I cannot make the      demonstration called for in the statute because of serious      flaws and loopholes in the design of the new drug      reimportation system. As such, I will not request the $23      million that was conditionally appropriated for FDA      implementation costs for the drug reimportation system      included in the FY 2001 appropriations bill.       As you know, Administration officials worked for months      with members of Congress and staff to help them design safe      and workable drug reimportation legislation. Unfortunately,      our most significant concerns about this proposal were not      addressed. These flaws, outlined below, undermine the      potential for cost savings associated with prescription drug      reimportation and could pose unnecessary public health risks.       First, the provision allows drug manufacturers to deny U.S.      importers legal access to the FDA approved labeling that is      required for reimportation. In fact, the provision explicitly      states that any labeling information provided by      manufacturers may be used only for testing product      authenticity. This is a major loophole that Administration      officials discussed with congressional staff but was not      closed in the final legislation.       Second, the drug reimportation provision fails to prevent      drug manufacturers from discriminating against foreign      distributors that import drugs to the U.S. While the law      prevents contracts or agreements that explicitly prohibit      drug importation, it does not prohibit drug manufacturers      from requiring distributors to charge higher prices! limit      supply, or otherwise treat U.S. importers less favorably than      foreign purchasers.       Third, the reimportation system has both authorization and      funding limitations. The law requires that the system end      five years after it goes into effect. This ``sunset''      provision will likely have a chilling effect on private-     sector investment in the required testing and distribution      systems because of the uncertainty of long-term financial      returns. In addition, the public benefits of the new system      are diminished since the significant investment of taxpayer      funds to establish the new safety monitoring and enforcement      functions will not be offset by long-term savings to      consumers from lower priced drugs. Finally, Congress      appropriated the $23 million necessary for first year      implementation costs of the program but did so without      funding core and priority activities in FDA, such as      enforcement of standards for internet drug purchase and post-     market surveillance activities.       In addition, while FDA's responsibilities last five years,      its funding authorization is only for one year. Without a      stable funding base, FDA will not be able implement the new      program in a way that protects the public health.       As you and I have discussed, we in the Administration and      the Congress have a strong obligation to communicate clearly      to the American people the shortcomings in policies that      purport to offer relief from the high cost of prescription      drugs. For this reason, I feel compelled to inform you that      the flaws and loopholes contained in the reimportation      provision make it impossible for me to demonstrate that it is      safe and cost effective. As such, I cannot sanction the      allocation of taxpayer dollars to implement such a system.       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation      that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the      Congress next year. At the same time, I know you share my      view that an importation provision--no matter how well      crafted--cannot be a substitute for a voluntary prescription      drug benefit provided through the Medicare program. Nor is      the solution a low-income, state-based prescription drug      program that would exclude millions of beneficiaries and      takes years to implement in all states. What is needed is a      real Medicare prescription drug option that is affordable and      accessible to all beneficiaries regardless of where they      live. It is my strong hope that, when Congress and the next      Administration evaluate the policy options before them, they      will come together on this approach and, at long last, make      prescription drug coverage an integral part of Medicare.           Sincerely.                                                 Donna E. Shalala.
