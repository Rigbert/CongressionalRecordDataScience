Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan King-Thompson expanded backgrounds checks legislation, to honor the memory of Juan Ramon Guerrero, a victim of gun violence who never received either a moment of silence or a moment of action on this House floor. We ask Speaker Ryan to allow the vote.
