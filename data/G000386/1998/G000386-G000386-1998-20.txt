 President, first, I commend the chairman for all his hard work on this very complex and extremely important bill.  One project that is of continuing interest to me is the cost reduction proposal for Terfenol-D, the smart alloy used in Navy advanced sonar systems. These essential cost reductions will enable significant cost and operational effectiveness enhancements of U.S. Navy surface ship, submarine and torpedo undersea warfighting capability. Furthermore, this program is essential if the U.S. Navy is to have a competitive advantage and not be at a disadvantage compared to the Chinese, Japanese and Russians as they invest in TERFENOL-D manufacturing technology advancements.  As the chairman recalls, funding for this important project was included in the FY 98 Defense Appropriations bill only to be line item vetoed by the President. Due to the importance of the project, funds were included again in the FY 99 bill. However, because of the confusion caused by the line-item veto and the subsequent opinion by the Supreme Court, I would like to clarify with you that the full $3.0 million appropriated by the Congress in FY 98, line-item vetoed by the President and then nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court, continues to be available for its stated purpose of cost reduction for Terfenol-D. Moreover, it is my understanding that the $2.0 million currently provided in FY 99 is in addition to the $3.0 million provided in FY 98 for a total of $5.0 million over two years for this extremely important cost reduction initiative.
