President, I would like to make it a matter of record that on Monday, May 19, 2003, I was unavoidably delayed in arriving in the Senate because my United Airlinesflight 616 was held on the ground with mechanical difficulties and I missed a vote, which was vote No. 184 relative to the confirmation of Maurice Hicks as U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Louisiana. Had I been here, I would have voted in the affirmative.                          ____________________
