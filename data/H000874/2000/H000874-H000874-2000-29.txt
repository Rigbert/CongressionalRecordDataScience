Speaker, I yield myself 40 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I do not have time to correct all the misstatements of the gentleman from California. Suffice it to say, however, as he leaves the floor, that from 1981 through 1992, not a penny was spent in the United States from Social Security, from anyplace else, that was not approved by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Not a penny. Why? Because we never overrode a veto of a spending bill that asked for more spending of Ronald Reagan. Never.  So the fact of the matter is that it is Presidents who make policy. We make the laws, I understand that. But in your lament that Bill Clinton will not sign the bills you want signed, your tax bill of 1998 would have wiped out that surplus that you now so proudly say you want to pay down the debt with. It has been Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress that have brought us this surplus.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey).
