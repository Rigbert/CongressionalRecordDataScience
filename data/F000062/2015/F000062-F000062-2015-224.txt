 President, I am pleased to introduce the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015 with my colleagues and friends, Senators Charles Grassley, Richard Blumenthal, Heidi Heitkamp, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Udall.  This bill, which passed the Senate unanimously in the last Congress, supports the Obama Administration's Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime by providing the Department of Justice with crucial tools to combat the international drug trade. As drug traffickers find new and innovative ways to avoid prosecution, we cannot allow them to exploit loopholes because our laws lag behind.  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place penalties for extraterritorial drug trafficking activity when individuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug traffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold to reasonable cause to believe.  The Department of Justice has informed my office that, it sees drug traffickers from countries like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru who produce cocaine but then outsource transportation of the cocaine to the United States to violent Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Under current law, our ability to prosecute source-nation traffickers from these countries is limited since there is often no direct evidence of their knowledge that illegal drugs were intended for the UnitedStates. But let me be clear: drugs produced in these countries fuel violent crime throughout the Western Hemisphere as well as addiction and death in the United States.  Second, this bill puts in place penalties for precursor chemical producers from foreign countries, such as those producing pseudoephedrine used for methamphetamine, who illegally ship precursor chemicals into the United States knowing that these chemicals will be used to make illegal drugs.  Third, this bill makes a technical fix to the Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act, which increases penalties for the trafficking of counterfeit drugs. The fix, requested by the Department of Justice, puts in place a ``knowing'' requirement which was unintentionally left out of the original bill. The original bill makes the mere sale of a counterfeit drug a Federal felony offense regardless of whether the seller knew the drug was counterfeit. Under the original bill, a pharmacist could be held criminally liable if he or she unwittingly sold counterfeit drugs to a customer. Adding a ``knowing'' requirement corrects this problem.  As Co-Chair of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and as a public servant who has focused on narcotics issues for many years, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traffickers find new ways to circumvent our laws. The illegal drug trade is constantly evolving and it is critical that our legal framework keeps pace. We must provide the Department of Justice with all of the tools it needs to prosecute drug kingpins both here at home and abroad.                                 ______                                       By
