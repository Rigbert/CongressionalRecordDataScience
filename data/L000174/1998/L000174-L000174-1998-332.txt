President, yesterday, Xavier Becerra, Jose E. Serrano and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called upon the Republican leadership to vote upon the Latino nominees to judgeships who have languished in the Senate far too long. I welcome the views of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to the debate and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of their letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
