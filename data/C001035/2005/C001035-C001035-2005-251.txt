President, today I am submitting a Senate resolution to commend Chief Judge Annice M. Wagner of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for more than 32 years of public service. As the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which has oversight jurisdiction of the District of Columbia courts, I believe that it is important to recognize the contributions of Chief Judge Wagner who will be retiring this year. As chief judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals, she has worked closely with the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on various issues related to the D.C. courts and the justice system in the District.  Chief Judge Wagner entered Federal Government service in 1973 as the first woman to be appointed General Counsel of the National Capital Housing Authority, then a Federal agency. Subsequently, she served as People's Counsel for the District of Columbia, an office created by Congress to represent the interests of utility consumers before the District of Columbia Public Service Commission and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  Chief Judge Wagner was twice confirmed by the Senate. First, in 1977, when she was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to serve as an Associate Judge of the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and again when she was nominated by President George H. W. Bush, in 1990, to serve as an Associate Judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals. She was later appointed, in 1994, to serve as chief judge. During her 28 years of service in the D.C. courts, she served in every division of the D.C. Superior Court, and served for two years as presiding judge of the Probate and Tax divisions. She also served on various commissions and committees, including serving as chairperson of the Committee on Selection and Tenure of Hearing Commissioners, Chair of the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia, and as a member of the Superior Court Rules Committee and the Sentencing Guidelines Commission.  Chief Judge Wagner has also demonstrated a commitment to improving access to justice. To this end, she served as chairperson of the Court's Advisory Committee on Probate and Fiduciary Rules and was largely responsible for the implementation of new rules intended to streamline and clarify procedures regarding the affairs of missing, protected, and incapacitated individuals. She also served as chairperson of the Task Force on Gender Bias in the Courts, which conducted a comprehensive study of bias in the courts and, under her leadership, the District of Columbia courts established the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access to the Courts to ensure racial, gender, and ethnic fairness.  More recently, under her leadership, the Court of Appeals, along with the District of Columbia Bar, the District of Columbia Bar Foundation, and the District of Columbia Consortium of Legal Service Providers, established the D.C. Access to Justice Commission, a commission that will propose ways to make lawyers and access to justice more available for poor individuals in the District of Columbia.  Chief Judge Wagner's work at the D.C. courts also extends beyond legal issues. As the space needs of the District of Columbia courts continued to grow beyond their current building, Chief Judge Wagner led the effort to examine solutions to resolve the courts continued space problems. Her efforts led the D.C. courts to plan and initiate the renovation of the Old Courthouse/City Hall in Judiciary Square, a National Historic Landmark, for the future use by the D.C. Court of Appeals. In addition, as Congress enacted new legislative mandates on the courts which further increased their space needs, under her leadership, the District of Columbia courts initiated the master planning process for the renovation and use of all court properties in Judiciary Square. This effort will result not only in the improvement of court operations, but is expected to lead to the revitalization of the Judiciary Square area in the Nation's Capital.  Chief Judge Wagner's service also extends beyond the boundaries of the District. She has served as President of the Conference of Chief Justices, an organization of chief justices and chief judges of the highest court of each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the territories, as chairperson of the Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts, and as one of eleven members of the American Bar Association's Section on Dispute Resolution's Drafting Committee on the Uniform Mediation Act which collaborated with the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in promulgating the Uniform Mediation Act, which, in 2001, was approved and recommended for enactment in all the States, to foster prompt, economical, and amicable resolution of disputes through mediation processes which promote public confidence and uniformity across state lines.  Chief Judge Wagner's dedication and service to the District of Columbia and to the judicial system are highly commendable and warrant our recognition.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________[Pages S3688-S3689]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS                                 ______                                 SENATE RESOLUTION 107--COMMENDING ANNICE M.
