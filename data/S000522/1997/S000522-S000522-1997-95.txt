Mr. Chairman, today because virtually every military physician deployed around the globe, as a matter of deep conviction and conscience, has refused to facilitate a 1993 Clinton Executive Order on abortion, and because the Dornan amendment was signed into permanent law a few years later on February 10, 1996, overseas military hospitals continue to be havens of healing, nuturing and disease eradication, not baby killing centers.  The Harman amendment, if enacted, would turn these healing facilities into abortion mills where unborn children could be dismembered or chemically poisoned on demand. The Harman amendment makes a false distinction based not on what happens in an abortion, a baby is violently killed, but in who provides the cash. It also completely overlooks costs borne by the taxpayers to facilitate that abortion, like the provision of operating rooms, the hiring of abortionists and the procurement of poisons and potions and suction machines.                              {time}  2000  This amendment says, in effect, it is okay to tear an unborn child, to rip an unborn child from limb to limb or to apply that baby with deadly poisons using a hypodermic needle, so long as somebody else seems to be footing most of the bill.  Somebody earlier said that this is not about abortion. We hear that kind of excuse and defense every time we hear this on the floor. When the D.C. appropriations bill is up, it is a matter of home rule. When the Federal employees health benefits program ban on abortion comes up, it is labor-management negotiations. When the Hyde amendment comes up, it is a matter of rich versus poor women. Of course, that underscores the fact that the unborn of the poor seem to be more able to be discarded and are more expendable.  Mr. Chairman, let me conclude. The Harman amendment facilitates the killing of unborn children, and there is no doubt about that. It treats helpless, defenseless infant baby boys and girls as a disease, or a cyst, or a tumor that can be excised at will.  Medicine is all about curing and mitigating diseases. This is not maternal health care, this is not prenatalhealth care, this is killing of unborn children and the exploitation of their mothers.  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Harman amendment.
