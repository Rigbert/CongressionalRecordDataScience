 President, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, I would like to congratulate the Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments (INRCOG). Organized January 1973, INRCOG was the first council of governments formed in the State of Iowa.  As a voluntary association of local governments serving the member jurisdictions in Black Hawk, Bremer, Buchanan, Butler, Chicksaw and Grundy Counties, INRCOG has long been recognized as a leader among service and planning organizations. Responsible for coordinating, assisting, and facilitating programs in community and economic development, transportation, housing, environment, safety, planning, administration and transit, INRCOG's services have benefitted allgovernmental bodies in the INRCOG region and the State of Iowa.  Through INRCOG's intergovernmental communication and cooperation have flourished and public-private partnerships have been enhanced. The ability of Iowa communities to plan for their own future has been enriched. I wish them many more years of successful service for the success of Iowa's communities, for their efforts will continue to strengthen the backbone of America's governmental system, thus enriching the lives of our citizens.                          ____________________
