 President, I thank Senators Durbin, Kennedy, Clinton, Harkin, Schumer, Mikulski, Brown, Casey, and Menendez for cosponsoring this amendment. I also thank dozens of national organizations representing tens of millions of Americans for supporting it, including the AFL-CIO, the SCIU, the Children's Defense Fund, the YWCA, and many other organizations.  This amendment cannot be simpler. The wealthiest people in the country have not had it so good since the 1920s. Their incomes are soaring, while at the same time the middle class is shrinking, and we have by far the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country. The time is now to begin changing our national priorities and moving this country in a different direction.  This amendment restores the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $1 million a year, it raises $32.5 billion over 3 years, and invests that in our kids, including $10 billion for special education, because the time is long overdue that we kept our word regarding special education.
