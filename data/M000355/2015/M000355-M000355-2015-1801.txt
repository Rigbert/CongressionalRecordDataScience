 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday, February 9; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that the Senate then be in a period of morning business, equally divided, until 5 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. I further ask that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to executive session under the previous order.
