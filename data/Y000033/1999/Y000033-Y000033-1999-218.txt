Mr. Speaker, today I introduce a bill to solve a unique Alaska problem occurring in the city of Craig, a city located in the far southeastern part of Alaska on Prince of Wales Island, the third largest island in the country. Craig is unlike any other small town or village in Alaska. It has no land base upon which to maintain its local services and no ability to utilize many Federal programs which are dependent upon a large Alaska Native population for eligibility.  Nevertheless, the community has grown from a mostly Native population of 250 in 1971 to over 2,500 residents, most of whom are not Alaska Natives. Despite this change in demographics, the town is surrounded by land selections from two different Alaska Native Village Corporations. In fact, 93 percent of the land within the Craig city limits is owned by these village corporations. Under Federal law passed in 1987, none of the village land is subject to taxation so long as the land is not developed. The city of Craig has only 300 acres of land owned privately by individuals within its city limits to serve as its municipal tax base. It can annex no other land because the entire land base outside its municipal boundaries is owned by the Federal Government as part of the Tongass National Forest or another Alaska Native corporation.  As its population increases and costs rise, Craig's demands for municipal services increase. According to the State of Alaska, Craig is the fastest-growing first class city in the State. Since its large non-Native majority population makes the town and its residents largely ineligible for Federal programs which serve virtually all other ANSCA villages, it has requested a small conveyance of 4,532 acres of Federal land located not far from the town. That land entitlement would permit the city to develop a land base upon which it could support its increasing demand for municipal services.  The land base which is included in this bill has been carefully chosen. It is less than 20 miles from the city and abuts the existing road system. It is the first available land from the city limits not owned by an Alaska Native corporation. The land will complete a sound management system by providing municipal ownership of land adjacent to both existing private and State-owned land. It will be a good use of this land which is nowhere near any environmentally sensitive lands such as wilderness areas. This part of Prince of Wales Island has roads, communities, and other developed sites near it. There will be no land use conflicts created by this conveyance.  My bill provides a fairly simple and very reasonable solution to Craig's dilemma: it provides a direct grant of 4,532 acres to the city. While I reviewed a land exchange, the city has no land to trade. The city received no municipal entitlement because the Forest Service never agreed to any land selection by the State of Alaska in this part of Prince of Wales Island. The only substantial land near Craig besides the actual 300 acres on which Craig sits is owned by the Federal Government inthe national forest or by Alaska Native corporations.  I intend to hold a hearing on this bill early in the next session and begin the process to move the bill through the House to final passage in the Congress.                          ____________________
