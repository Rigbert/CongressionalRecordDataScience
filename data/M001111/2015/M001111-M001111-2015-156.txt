 President, the Affordable Care Act is a critical step forward in our efforts to build on our progress to put patients first and allows every family to get affordable, quality health care. But the work didn't end when the law passed--far from it. Families across the country are expecting us to keep working to build on that progress and continue to make health care more affordable, accessible, and of higher quality. That is what we are focused on, on this side, and the amendment that just passed did that, but we should not be playing political games in joining to move our health care system backward. It is bad enough that the underlying budget repeals the health care law and cuts patients and families off without proposing an alternative law, but this amendment makes it worse. It means patients and families get skewed, incomplete information about their health care costs. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
