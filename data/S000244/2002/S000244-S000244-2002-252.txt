Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3180) to consent to certain amendments to the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3180       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the      consent of Congress is given to the amendment to the New      Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact which have been      agreed to by such     States that is substantially as follows: Article VII D of      such compact is amended to read as follows:       ``D. Authorization Proceedings.--An interstate district      shall authorize the incurring of debts to finance capital      projects by a majority vote of the district passed at an      annual or special district meeting. Such vote shall be taken      by secret ballot after full opportunity for debate, and any      such vote shall be subject to reconsideration and further      action by the district at the same meeting or at an adjourned      session thereof. As an alternative, an interstate district      may provide in its articles of agreement that such a vote be      conducted by Australian or official balloting under      procedures as set forth in the articles of agreement, and      that such vote be subject to any method of reconsideration,      if any, which the interstate district sets forth in the      articles of agreement.
