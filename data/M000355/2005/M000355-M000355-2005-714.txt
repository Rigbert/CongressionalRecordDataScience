 President, I send a managers' package to the desk. It is a series of amendments by Senators Brownback and Kennedy regarding Vietnamese refugees; Senator Leahy, regarding the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Trust Fund; and Mr. Brownback, regarding education programs in Egypt.  I send these amendments to the desk. They have been cleared on both sides. I ask for their immediate consideration.
