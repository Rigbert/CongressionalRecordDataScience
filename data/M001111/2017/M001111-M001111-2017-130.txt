 President, I deeply share the concern of the Senator from New Hampshire. She came to the floor last night to speak eloquently about the challenges that our students with disabilities have and the promise that this country has made now for decades that if you are a student with a disability, you will be able to go to a public school and get the education that you need.  She spoke eloquently. For everyone who didn't hear her, I ask you to go back and look at the Record and listen to it.  Yes, I am deeply concerned that this nominee whom this President has sent to us is not committed to that basic premise that, no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or if you have a disability, you get a public education. But I am not only concerned that she doesn't have a commitment. I am deeply concerned that she didn't even understand that it was current Federal law.  How can someone be a Secretary of Education in this country and not understand that basic premise and not give that commitment to people across the country that, if it is your child or someone you love or someone you know, they, too, can go to school and get what they need.  So I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire. And, yes, I am deeply concerned, as we all should be in this body and across the country, that this nominee is not prepared or qualified to make that basic assurance for all students in this country.
