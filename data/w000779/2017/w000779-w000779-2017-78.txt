 Will it be possible, as part of Senator Durbin's statement, to add this ``written on the side'' portion as part of his statement so that the American people will actually know how outrageous this process is and that it at least states, as part of his speech, what is written in the margin? Can that be stated as part of his statement?  Would the Chair answer the question?  My question is, when the amendment is filed, I would like to ensure that the important point my colleague has made about what is written in the margin could be included as part of his written statement that will be entered into the Record so that the American people can get some sense of what kind of flimflam is actually taking place here.
