President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nomination of Ivan Lemelle to the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Judge Lemelle's nomination has been pending over a year. When the Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana testified in May 1996 that the vacancies on that Court should not be filled, it put this nomination on hold. I only wish that when the Chief Justice of the United States says that we need more judges, when Chief Judges in the Second Circuit and other Circuits and Districts say that they need their vacancies filled without further delay, we would listen to them.  Judge Sear has recently written a letter to Senator Breaux that reports that his Court now unanimously votes to fill the two vacancies in that District. I know that as a Magistrate Judge Ivan Lemelle has already contributed to the administration of justice in that District. It is high time to provide him the opportunity to contribute more fully to handling the District's caseload.  I congratulate and thank Senator Breaux and Senator Landrieu for their effective advocacy in support of this nomination.  Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the Senate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent possible. We made some progress today. I have been urging the Majority Leader to move judicial nominations through the Senate and I thank him for moving Judge Lemelle.  As the Senate recesses, seven judicial nominations still remain on the calendar awaiting Senate action. With this additional confirmation, the Senate will still have confirmed only 20 judges for the year in which the Federal courts have experienced 100 vacancies. So, while I thank the Senate for its actions today, I must note that we have not ended the crisis of which the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned in his most recent year end report.  Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second Circuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to vote upon the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or to provide hearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub. I look forward to action on these and the other judicial nominees left pending before the Senate.                          ____________________
