Speaker, March 23, 2002 was a great day of celebration for women and girls in Afghanistan. March 23rd was the official first day back to school for children in Afghanistan. At least 1.5 million children of elementary school age attended the first day back to school across the country. Children returned to classrooms for the first time in fiveyears, and many stepped into classrooms for their first time ever.  When the Taliban government took control of Afghanistan in 1996, it immediately imposed a repressive interpretation of Islamic law, forbidding girls from attending school and women from teaching. For five years Afghan girls were denied the basic right to education. Only 32 percent of Afghanistan's 4.4 million children were enrolled in school in 1999. Almost all girls, 92 percent, were not in school.  We have all heard of the courageous stories of former female teachers operating illegal schools out of their homes, teaching young girls basic math and writing. Women all over the country refused to give up their right to be educated and to educate. A survey conducted by UNICEF at the end of last year found there were almost 600 home-based schools in Kabul alone. The women and girls that kept learning through illegal home schools must be commended for their courage and bravery.  This is a time of hope for women and girls in Afghanistan. Education is important to the life of all nations. March 23 marked a new beginning for Afghan women and girls, and a new beginning for the entire country.                          ____________________
