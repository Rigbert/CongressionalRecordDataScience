 President, let me just say this is one of the finer moments in the Senate. We have come together on a bipartisan basis and structured a way forward on an important rescue package for our country.  I commend the majority leader, my good friend, for his extraordinary work on this issue, as well as Senator Dodd and Senator Gregg, who have been the lead negotiators on this matter for the Senate.  This is an important accomplishment and a way forward to get a result we need to achieve for the American people.  I yield the floor.
