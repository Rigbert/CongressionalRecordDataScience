Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. George Weeks, a long-time political journalist for the Detroit News, who is set to retire from writing his weekly column. Mr. Weeks has had a long and illustrious career as a journalist--evidenced by his induction into the Michigan Journalism Hall of Fame in 1996. However, his accolades and accomplishments are by no means limited to the field of journalism.  Mr. Weeks not only reported political news, but helped make some of it himself. He served as press secretary and chief of staff for Governor William G. Milliken for 14 years. Mr. Weeks used the expertise he gained in Governor Milliken's office to earn the position of a Kennedy Fellow at Harvard University.  Mr. Weeks, a native of Traverse City, MI, is a true Michiganian--an expert, not only in Michigan politics, but in Michigan culture and history as well. I would like to extend my thanks to him for all of his good work and wish him well in his retirement. The Wolverine State is better off for the contributions of George Weeks.                          ____________________
