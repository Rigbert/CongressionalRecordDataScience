President, recently, the Prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone briefed the staff of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. He spoke about his efforts to prosecute those responsible for the horrific crimes that were committed there and to help this nation emerge from a tragic episode in its history.  Whenever something like this occurs, the question that first comes to mind is why did it happen? Was it a political struggle? Was it because of religious extremism or ethnic hatred? Unlike Yugoslavia or Rwanda, most experts believe that the driving force behind this brutal conflict was control of resources, especially diamonds.  The problems associated with conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone are not confined to West Africa. They also have an impact in the United States. According to the Washington Post, al Qaeda reaped millions of dollars from the illicit sale of diamonds, and law enforcement officials have said that in order to cut off al Qaeda funds, you have to cut off the diamond pipeline.  With all that is happening in the world, it may be understandable that the issue of conflict diamonds is not front page news. However, we are starting to make some progress on this important issue.  The Administration has been working to help create an international regime aimed at stopping the trade in conflict diamonds. Initiated by a group of African nations, the Kimberly process has the support of a diverse group of non-governmental organizations and the diamond industry.  In March 2002, the last full session of the Kimberly process was completed and has now reached a point where the individual countries involved need to pass implementing legislation. In the United States, some modest legislation may be enacted before the end of this year.  While I am glad that Congress may pass something on conflict diamonds this year, there must be a serious effort next year to get stronger legislation signed into law.  Senator Durbin has introduced important implementing legislation, and he is working with the administration, a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators DeWine and Bingaman, and a range of non-governmental organizations such as Oxfam and Catholic Relief Services to come up with effective legislation that we can all support.  I am encouraged that the administration is consulting with Congress and has named Ambassador Bindenagle, a career diplomat with experience in complex negotiations, to lead this effort.  But, there must be more than an exchange of views on this issue. The administration must also seriously consider Congressional proposals to move beyond the Kimberly process.  For example, a major flaw in the Kimberly process is that it does not cover polished diamonds. This is important for two reasons. Polished diamonds contribute significantly to the problems associated with the illicit trade in diamonds, and the United States is far and away the world's largest market for these types of diamonds. Clearly, this is an area where the United States needs to show leadership.  As chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I will do what I can to ensure that resources are available for developing countries that want to enhance their capacity to implement Kimberly.  I look forward to working with the administration to make substantial progress on this issue next year. It will not be easy, but it can be done.                          ____________________
