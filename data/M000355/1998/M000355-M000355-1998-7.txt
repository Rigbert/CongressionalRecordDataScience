 President, since 1988, Congress has established three programs to provide low-income elderly and disabled individuals with Medicare cost-sharing assistance under Medicaid. Despite the availability of these dual-eligible programs, gaps in beneficiary knowledge and deficiencies in program administration by federal and state agencies have created persistent barriers to enrollment by eligible Medicare recipients.  For several years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration have sought to educate seniors on the availability of Medicare cost-sharing programs through mass mailings, informational hotlines, and pamphlet distribution. While these initiatives have helped, a study by Families USA found that over three million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in any cost-sharing program. In Kentucky, the study estimates that the lack of information about and participation in Medicare cost-sharing programs cost more than 49,000 low-income Kentuckians about $25 million a year. In order to overcome these troubling blockades to enrollment, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,the Health Care Financing Administration and the Social Security Administration are studying options to more effectively serve our nation's financially vulnerable seniors and disabled.  A key aspect to improving participation in cost-sharing programs is the capacity for federal and state agencies to identify those who experience critical income shifts after their initial enrollment in Medicare and Social Security. One group at particular risk of reduced income in later life is widowed spouses.  For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is overwhelming both mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse, often after a long, intensive illness, leaves many elderly with the difficult task of restructuring their lives in order to regain personal and financial stability. At this critical time of change, widowed spouses rely on their revised Social Security benefit as the foundation for their future budget planning. Statistics furnished by the Social Security Administration show that 40 percent of nonmarried women, a category which includes widows, rely on Social Security for 90 percent of their income in comparison to only 18 percent of married couples. In addition, nearly one-fourth of nonmarried women rely on Social Security as their sole source of income.  In an effort to focus federal and state agencies on the health and welfare needs of low-income, widowed spouses, I am introducing legislation for a research demonstration to identify potential dual eligibles during the recalculation of Social Security benefits for widowed spouses. The Social Security Administration would refer this information to the state administrators of Medicare cost-sharing programs for their followup.  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Arlen Specter for including my request to fund this research effort by the Social Security Administration in the committee report to FY 1999 Labor, Healthand Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in September. As the House and Senate work to complete the omnibus appropriations bill for FY 1999, I strongly urge my colleagues to include this research endeavor in the final measure as part of our commitment to improving the responsiveness of federal and state agencies to the health and welfare needs of our nation's at-risk seniors.                                 ______                                       By
