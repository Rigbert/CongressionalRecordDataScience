FINDINGS.       The House of Representatives finds the following:       (1) Texas, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida,      Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Governor Paul LePage of      Maine, Mississippi (by and through Governor Phil Bryant),      Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South      Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia have filed suit in      the United States District Court for the Northern District of      Texas, arguing that the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119) is      unconstitutional and should be enjoined by asserting that the      Act's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage      (commonly known as the ``individual responsibility      provision'') in section 5000A(a) of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986, is unconstitutional following the amendment of that      provision by the Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant      to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget      for fiscal year 2018 (Public Law 115-97) (commonly known as      the ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act'').       (2) These State and individual plaintiffs also seek to      strike down the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care      Act as not severable from the individual responsibility      provision.       (3) On June 7, 2018, the Department of Justice refused to      defend the constitutionality of the amended individual      responsibility provision, despite the well-established duty      of the Department to defend Federal statutes where reasonable      arguments can be made in their defense.       (4) The Department of Justice not only refused to defend      the amended individual responsibility provision, but      affirmatively argued that this provision is unconstitutional      and that the provisions of the Patient Protection and      Affordable Care Act guaranteeing issuance of health insurance      coverage regardless of health status or preexisting      conditions (commonly known as the ``guaranteed issue      provision'') found in sections 2702, 2704, and 2705(a) of the      Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-1, 300gg-3, 300gg-     4(a)) and prohibitions on discriminatory premium rates      (commonly known as the ``community rating provision'') found      in sections 2701 and 2705(b) of the Public Health Service Act      (42 U.S.C. 300gg(a)(1), 300gg-4(b)) must now be struck down      as not severable from the individual responsibility      provision.       (5) The district court recently held that the individual      responsibility provision is unconstitutional and that all of      the remaining provisions of the Patient Protection and      Affordable Care act are inseverable and therefore invalid.       (6) Up to 133 million nonelderly Americans have some type      of preexisting health condition, such as, but not limited to,      diabetes, high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, and asthma,      that could affect their insurance.       (7) Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act      and the enactment of protections such as guaranteed issue and      community rating, millions of Americans were denied health      insurance coverage, were unable to obtain coverage of      necessary medical services, or were priced out of the      individual market due to preexisting conditions.       (8) Without such protections for preexisting conditions,      millions of Americans could once again lose access to      affordable, comprehensive health insurance.       (9) More than 13 million Americans who gained coverage in      States that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act could lose coverage if the      Act were struck down in its entirety.       (10) More than 2 million young adults who gained coverage      under a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act allowing individuals under the age of 26 to stay on      their parents' insurance could lose coverage if the Act were      struck down in its entirety.       (11) More than 8.9 million low and middle-income Americans      who received tax credits averaging $520 per month to help pay      for     health insurance in the individual market under the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act could lose coverage if the      Act were struck down in its entirety.       (12) An estimated 105 million Americans who now enjoy      coverage without lifetime limits due to the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act could once again face      lifetime limits on their benefits if the Act were struck down      in its entirety.       (13) Nearly 12 million Medicare beneficiaries who received      an average of $2,200 in savings on prescription drugs due to      the closing of the Medicare prescription drug donut hole      under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would      face rising drug costs if the Act were struck down in its      entirety.

(a) Authorization.--The Speaker, on behalf of the House of      Representatives, is authorized to intervene, otherwise      appear, or take any other steps in the case of Texas v.      United States, No. 4:18-cv-00167-O (N.D. Tex.) and in any      appellate proceedings arising from such case. The Speaker, in      consultation with the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, is      also authorized to intervene, otherwise appear, or take any      other steps in any other cases involving the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act to protect the      institutional interests of the House and to defend such Act,      the amendments made by such Act to other provisions of law,      and any amendments to such provisions, including the      provisions ensuring affordable health coverage for those with      preexisting conditions.       (b) Role of General Counsel.--The Office of General Counsel      of the House of Representatives, at the direction of the      Speaker, shall represent the House in any litigation pursuant      to this title. The Office of General Counsel may employ the      services of outside counsel, including pro bono counsel, or      other experts for this purpose.       (c) Reports on Amounts Expended.--The chair of the      Committee on House Administration shall cause to be printed      in the Congressional Record a statement setting forth the      aggregate amounts expended by the Office of General Counsel      on outside counsel and other experts pursuant to this title      on a quarterly basis, and such statement shall be submitted      for printing not more than 30 days after the expiration of      each such quarter.
