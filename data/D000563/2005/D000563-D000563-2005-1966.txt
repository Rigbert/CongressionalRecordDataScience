President, I rise to speak very briefly about the amendments I have offered this evening to the pending bankruptcy bill. I have found as I traveled back in Illinois and around the country that some people follow the C-SPAN floor debate very closely. Just over this weekend, having traveled to Arizona and Nevada, I am amazed to find people who heard my speech on the bankruptcy bill, which always intrigues me that so many people suffer from insomnia that they watch C-SPAN gavel to gavel, but in all honesty I admire them for their interest in our Government, and I hope that they follow this debate. But if one is a newcomer to this bankruptcy bill debate, I will say a few words about the bill and the amendments which I have offered.  When it comes to the bill itself, which is 510 pages, it will amend the bankruptcy law of America. It is a bill which has been considered for years. We have had versions of this bill over the last 9 or 10 years. I know because years ago I worked with Senator Grassley on one of the first modifications to the Bankruptcy Code. Some of these changes passed the Senate and failed in the House. Some have passed the House and Senate and been vetoed by President Clinton.
