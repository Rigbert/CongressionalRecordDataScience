It is my hope it will be earlier in the week rather than later in the week. But I cannot say that at this point in time. There's still work being done on the bill. Chairman Obey is working very hard on a draft proposal that can be enacted in a short time frame.  We are aware of the time constraints of which the gentleman spoke. I anticipate we will include a package of items that we believe are a cost of the war, the GI benefits that have been discussed, and also items that address a small number of pressing needs. We are strong believers in PAYGO, as you know, but we understand that we have to deal with the other body and the White House, who has not supported that effort. We are sometimes not in agreement with their position, and we will have to keep working on that issue. I know Mr. Obey is working hard on that.
