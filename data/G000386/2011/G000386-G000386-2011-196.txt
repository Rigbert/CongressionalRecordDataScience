 Justice of Grimes, IA. He was killed by enemy small arms fire in Kapisa Province, Afghanistan, at the age of 32. Staff Sergeant Justice died trying to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter that made a hard landing in Alah Say District, Kapisa Province, Afghanistan.  Staff Sergeant Justice has served in the U.S. Armed Forces since September of 1998. He was assigned to Troop A, 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry, Camp Dodge, Johnston, IA. He was deployed to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Spring in 2001, the Multinational Force Observer peacekeeping mission in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt in 2003-2004, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005-2006. He volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan in November of 2010. In Afghanistan, he was one of approximately 2,800 members of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division.  Staff Sergeant Justice is survived by his wife Amanda Jo and daughter Caydence Lillian; his father and mother Larry and Lillian Justice; a brother and two sisters; as well as many other family and friends.  Sergeant Justice's family remembers him as a caring individual who was proud of the work he was doing for his country. He wanted nothing more than to serve side by side with his brothers and sisters in arms. His fellow soldiers remember him as a charismatic, natural leader and an integral part of his unit's community. The loss of Sergeant Justice is one that will be felt not only by his family and loved ones but by the entire Iowa Army National Guard and all those that were privileged enough to have known him.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Justice family in this incredibly trying time. While words cannot express the debt that we as a Nation owe to Sergeant Justice and his family, I would like to take this time to remember the sacrifice that he made so that we can enjoy the freedoms that this Nation provides.                          ____________________
