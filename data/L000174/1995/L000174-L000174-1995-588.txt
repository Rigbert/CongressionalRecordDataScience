President, today, I am releasing a GAO report that I requested when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee.  The report concludes that the Bush administration inappropriately used USDA's export credit guarantee programs to expedite billions of dollars in loans to the Former Soviet Union [FSU] and its successor states.  This misuse of taxpayers funds leaves me deeply concerned.  I have said time after time that the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program is not a foreign aid program. It is a U.S. commercial program that allows creditworthy countries to use short-term debt to finance the purchase of quality U.S. agricultural products.  But, eligible countries must be determined capable of repayment.  This was not the first time that the Bush administration chose foreign policy objectives over creditworthiness considerations in the use of this program. Throughout the late 1980's, foreign policy considerations were the prevailing criteria.  I am all too familiar with the Government of Iraq's receipt of billions of dollars through the GSM-102 Program.  When we responded to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Iraq defaulted on these loans forcing the USDA to pay claims of over $2 billion with taxpayer money.  That is why, in the 1990 farm bill, I inserted a provision that requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine that a prospective borrowing country is capable of adequately servicing the debt it incurs under these export credit guarantee programs.  It is also why in 1992, at my request, the Senate struck a Bush administration proposal that would have allowed USDA to balance creditworthiness against market development objectives in using the GSN programs.  I made it very clear on the floor, in committee, and in statements that the law did not permit loans to countries that were not creditworthy. Other foreign aid programs serve that purpose.  This GAO report confirms my suspicions about the Bush administration's use of the GSM-102 Program. When these loans were financed, the FSU was not creditworthy and should not have qualified for GSM-102 Program.  Instead, funds from one Government agency were allocated to support other administrative objectives. In a similar way, the Bush administration loaned money to help Saddam Hussein just before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  The Clinton administration understands the distinction between foreign aid and commercial trade.  Under this administration, no additional credit guarantees have been allocated for the Russian public sector.  In the spring of 1993, when Russian President Boris Yeltsin requested additional foreign aid, President Clinton simply supplied the import needs of Russia by using the Food for Progress Program--a foreign assistance program that I have long supported.  The Bush administration should have told taxpayers what was going on. If the executive branch wishes to provide foreign aid to another country they should at least say that to taxpayers. The aid could have been provided through established aid programs.  The Bush administration did a disservice to the taxpayers by hiding foreign aid under the guise of a commercial export program.  The GAO report comes too late to stop the Bush administration's inappropriate use of a commercial export program to help the states of the Former Soviet Union. But, it serves as a reminder that our agriculture programs are most effective when used for the purpose for which they are designed.  As we proceed through the 1995 farm bill debate, it will be important to create and enhance agricultural policies that best enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness to compete in the new world trade regime.  As part of that debate, we will examine the trade title closely to determine what programs are most effective in developing U.S. agricultural export markets.  And, we will ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place so that the experiences with Iraq and the FSU are not repeated.  I am confident that the Clinton administration will continue to do its utmost to ensure that all moneys borrowed under this and other USDA loan programs are repaid in full.                          ____________________
