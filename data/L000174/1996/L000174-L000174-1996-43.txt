President. A few weeks ago, one of Vermont's most noted and valued citizens, Mollie Beattie, died. Much was said on the floor of the Senate about her. Much was said in Vermont at her memorial service and again at the Department of Interior when the Secretary of Interior, as well as the Vice President, her husband and others spoke. Much also was written in Vermont.  I noted a commentary by Jim Wilkinson in one of our Vermont newspapers about Mollie Beattie. Jim Wilkinson is one of those quintessential Vermonters who represents the best values of our State. I have known him for decades, both in his role as the commissioner of Vermont Department of Forest, Parks and Recreation, and more recently as the consulting forester for the tree farm my wife and I have in Middlesex, VT. He is a man of great depth, great honesty, and, frankly, great wisdom.  I ask unanimous consent that what he had to say about Mollie Beattie, reported in the Rutland Daily Herald, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 23, 1996]                       Mollie Beattie Remembered                           (By Jim Wilkinson)       Webster defines ``memoir'' as ``a report on an event of      significance.'' This memoir is a personal observation on the      life of Mollie Beattie, an event of great significance.       Mollie has been proclaimed as a scholar, a forester, a      writer, a philosopher--all that and more. She was known as a      friend, a public servant, a leader. In all of these roles      Mollie's time with us was lived to the fullest, with      vitality, commitment, and serenity.       Others have written or spoken of her career in public      service to Vermont and to the     nation. Her political savvy and integrity brought      professional respect, as well as outstanding accomplishment.      The great courage of her final year has been cited as she      fought and at last accepted death with confidence, peace and      encouragement for others. Not only at death's door was      courage so evident. Her professional standards and personal      values demanded courage and confidence and determination in      reaching the goals she set for herself.       Mollie recognized the importance of maintaining a strong,      healthy persona--physically, mentally and spiritually--not a      selfish concern for her ego, but the pragmatic acceptance      that thus only could she give the most of her life. Carlyle      wrote that ``Life is a little gleam of time between two      eternities.'' Mollie's life was a great burst of light in      that time allotted to her. We have been blessed by it.       She had one unusual and wonderful attribute--that of an      unconscious but strong sense of personal presence, not one of      power or command, but a presence that, of itself, demanded      attention and got it. Hard to describe, but easy to recognize      when you were exposed to it. Yet there were occasions when,      while looking directly at you, she would leave you dreaming      or thinking of some secret, transmundane reality, some mystic      other world that only she could know and could not share.      Then with a glance and a grin she would return her attention      to you.       At the end Mollie could have assured us, ``I own only my      name. I've only borrowed this dust.'' Mollie's dust has      returned to the earth from which it evolved. But her name      will live long in our memories. May those memories serve to      guide, strengthen and encourage us in our lives of service.
