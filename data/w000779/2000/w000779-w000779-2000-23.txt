I am happy to allow Senator Gramm to speak before me. I would have to have unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator Gramm's remarks, I be recognized next to speak, and that I be allowed to address several issues before there are any votes that go forward. I am concerned about a number of issues. As the majority leader knows, I have dedicated my service here to bipartisanship. I happen to agree with the distinguished majority leader that no oneever gets everything they want in a package. Senator Kerry showed that Democrats are willing to bend over backward to be bipartisan in areas such as small business. But on a number of issues that concern this Senator, there has not been that level of bipartisanship. I am compelled to object and will need to speak at some length this morning on the several issues that are important to me.
