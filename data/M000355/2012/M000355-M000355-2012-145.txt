 President, we have all been sifting through the events of last Friday, and I think it is entirely appropriate for the Senate to take a moment today to acknowledge, as we just did, the victims of this nightmarish rampage, their families, and the wider community of Aurora.  In the life of a nation, some events are just so terrible they compel all of us to set aside our normal routines and preoccupations, step back, reflect on our own motivations and priorities, and think about the kind of lives we all aspire to live. This is certainly one of those times.  As is almost always the case in moments such as this, the horror has been tempered somewhat by the acts of heroism and self-sacrifice that took place in the midst of the violence. I read one report that said three different young men sacrificed their own lives in protecting the young women they were with. We know the first responders and nurses and doctors saved lives too, including the life of an unborn child.  I think all of us were moved over the weekend by the stories we have heard about the victims themselves. It is hard not to be struck by how young most of them were, of how many dreams were extinguished so quickly and mercilessly, but we were also moved by the outpouring of compassion that followed and by the refusal of the people of Aurora to allow the monster who committed this crime toeclipse the memory of the people he killed.  President Obama, Governor Hickenlooper, and the religious leaders in and around Aurora are to be commended for the time and effort they have put into consoling the families of the victims and the broader community. I think the best thing the rest of us can do right now is to show our respect for those who have been affected by this terrible and senseless crime and to continue to pray for the injured, that they recover fully from their injuries.
