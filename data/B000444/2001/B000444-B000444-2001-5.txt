 President, the final day of a legislative session often brings a flurry of activity as bills get un-jammed, compromises emerge, and the Senate produces progress on important issues. Depending upon one's perspective, these last-minute actions include both good things and bad things. Nevertheless, I think we all can agree that today's passage of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act is a real accomplishment in improving America's homeland defense. This bill authorizes $3.25 billion for comprehensive measures to take the first step in improving our nation's capability, in the event of a biological weapons attack, to respond quickly, contain the attack, and treat the victims. I want to applaud Senators Kennedy and Frist for coming together in a bipartisan spirit and displaying real leadership in drafting this bill.  When Sam Nunn testified in early September before the Foreign Relations Committee on the threat posed by biological weapons, he was very clear--bioterrorism is a direct threat to the national security of the United States and we need to invest the necessary resources to counter this threat accordingly. As troubling as the recent spate of anthrax by mail attacks was, we were very fortunate that this was a comparatively small-scale attack. Eighteen Americans contracted inhalation or cutaneous anthrax; unfortunately, five individuals died. The next time a biological weapons attack occurs, we may not be so fortunate in dealing with a small number of victims who emerge over a period of weeks and months. Instead, we may face thousands of victims flooding local emergency rooms and overwhelming our hospitals in a matter of hours.  Let's be real here--the anthrax attacks, as small-scale as they may have been, have greatly stressed our national public health infrastructure. One out of eight Centers for Disease Control employees at their headquarters in Atlanta is working on the current anthrax outbreak, forcing the CDC to sideline other essential core activities for the time being. Folks, what we have just been through is small potatoes compared to what we potentially will face. Plain and simple, we can't afford to be so under-prepared in the future.  Among Sam Nunn's recommendations for countering biological terrorism, he declared, ``We need to recognize the central role of public health and medicine in this effort and engage these professionals fully as partners on the national security team.'' There are many good things in this bill, ranging from the expansion of the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile to efforts to enhance food safety, but I am especially pleased that the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act provides direct grants to improve the public health infrastructure at the state and local level. Our doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and other public health personnel are our eyes and ears on the ground for detecting a biological weapons attack. We can't afford not to do everything we can to make sure they have the necessary tools and resources in containing any BW attack. This bill goes a long way toward fulfilling that core commitment.  So I am very pleased the Senate today has passed the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act and I look forward to a quick reconciliation of this bill with counterpart House legislation early next year. When this bill was introduced, I had expressed my serious concern that it was ignoring the international aspects to any effective response to potential bioterrorism. As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know that we cannot address the threat of bioterrorism within the borders of the United States alone. A biological weapon attack need not originate in the United States to pose a threat to our nation. A dangerous pathogen deliberately released anywhere in the world can quickly spread to the United States in a matter of days, if not hours. The scope and frequency of international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer unlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders and even to move from one continent to another. Therefore, I continue to believe we need to view all infectious disease epidemics, wherever they occur, as a potential threat to all nations.  It is for this reason that, when the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act was being drafted, Senator Helms, the distinguished Ranking Member on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I had worked together in seeking to insert provisions in this bill to enhance global disease monitoring and surveillance. With Senator Kennedy's strong backing, we had sought to ensure the full availability of information (i.e., disease characteristics, pathogen strains, transmission patterns) on infectious epidemics overseas that may provide clues indicating possible illegal biological weapons use or research. Even if an infectious disease outbreak occurs naturally, improved monitoring and surveillance can help contain the epidemic and tip off scientists and public health professionals to new disease that may be used as biological weapons in the future.  The World Health Organization (WHO) established a formal worldwide network last year, called the Global Alert and Response Network, to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the world. The WHO has done an impressive job so far working on a shoestring budget. But this global network is only as good as its components--individual nations. Many developing nations simply do not possess the personnel, laboratory equipment or public health infrastructure to track disease patterns and detect traditional and emerging pathogens. In fact, these nations often just seek to keep up in treating those who have already fallen ill.  Doctors and nurses in many developing countries only treat a small fraction of the patients who may be ill with a specific infectious disease--in effect, they are only witnessing the tip of a potentially much larger iceberg. According to the National Intelligence Council, governments in developing countries in Africa and Asia have established rudimentary or no systems at all for disease surveillance, response or prevention. For example, in 1994, an outbreak of plague occurred in India, resulting in 56 deaths and billions of dollars of economic damage as trade and travel with India ground to a halt. The plague outbreak was so severe because Indian authorities did not catch the epidemic in its early stages. Authorities had ignored or failed to respond to routine complaints a flea infestation, a sure warning signal for plague.  Owing to the lack of resources, developing nations are the weak spots in global disease monitoring and surveillance. Without shoring up these nations' capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we are leaving the entire world vulnerable to either a deliberate biological weapons attack or an especially virulent naturally occurring epidemic.  For all of these reasons, Senator Helms and I had worked together in proposing language to authorize $150 million in FY 1001 and FY 2003 to strengthen the capabilities of individual nations in the developing world to detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease epidemics. The proposed title would have helped train entry-level public health professionals from developing countries and provide grants for the acquisition of modern laboratory and communications equipment essential to any effective disease surveillance network. Upon first glance, $150 million is chump change in a bill that authorizes more than $3 billion. But I have been assured by public health experts that $150 million alone can go a long ways in making sure that developing countries the basic disease surveillance and monitoring capabilities to effectively contribute to the WHO's global network. The bottom line is that these provisions would have offered an inexpensive, common-sense solution to a problem of global proportions.  I was greatly disappointed, therefore, when the White House expressed resistance to the language Senator Helms and I had worked out and sought to drop it from the final bill. While voicing support for our ideas, the White House believed that the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act should only focus on domestic defenses against bioterrorism and was not the appropriate vehicle for the international programs we proposed.  I strongly disagreed. It doesn't make sense to draw artificial boundaries between ``domestic'' and ``international'' responses to bioterrorism. I have already pointed out that pathogens deliberately released in an attack anywhere in the world can quickly spread to the United States if we are unable to contain the epidemic at its source. The National Intelligence Council has concluded that infectious diseases are a real threat to U.S. national security. To ignore the international arena in favor of domestic solutions alone just doesn't make any sense.  Therefore, when the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act was introduced in November without any provisions to enhance global disease surveillance, I announced my intention to introduce an amendment to ensure this bill would enhance the capabilities of developing nations to track, diagnose, and contain disease outbreaks resulting from both BW attacks and naturally occurring epidemics. This week, the Senate leadership chose to move this bill under an unanimous consent procedure. I initially objected because I strongly believed the Senate should have an opportunity, at the very least, to vote on an amendment to incorporate global disease surveillance activities in the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. But I understand the urgency of the moment. There is no greater vulnerability in our nation's defenses than against the threat of bioterrorism and it is the responsibility of Congress to act quickly to correct this deficiency.  Therefore, I have chosen, for now, to cease my effort to include this amendment in this bill. Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels today sent me a letter where he expresses appreciation for the proposals contained in this amendment and recognizes that ``International public health has a critical role to play in protecting the United States and our global partners''. Furthermore, Daniels highlights the Administration's intention to engage in discussions with myself and other interested colleagues on these proposals when the Congress reconvenes in January. I ask for unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be included at the end of this statement in the Congressional Record.  I expect the Administration to follow up on this letter by planning and budgeting for improved global pathogen surveillance in Fiscal Year 2003. The need is urgent and our ability to lessen the threat posed by bioterrorism is real.The steps we take to combat bioterrorism overseas can keep diseases from reaching our shores and will give us vital early warning of new diseases and strains for which we must prepare.  Let me again salute today's passage by the Senate of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. While it does not include every essential proposal in enhancing our nation's bioterrorism defenses, it still accomplishes a great deal. If this bill becomes law, which I have no reason to doubt, it is my hope that the Congress will follow up next year with the necessary appropriations to carry out the programs authorized in this bill.  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on bioterrorism in September from Dr. D.A. Henderson, the man who spearheaded the international campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970's. Today, he is the director of the newly-formed Office of Emergency Preparedness in the Department of Health and Human Services, which has the mandate to help organize the federal government's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson was very clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In cooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen greatly our intelligence gathering capability. A focus on international surveillance and on scientist-to-scientist communication will be necessary . . .''  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                               Washington, DC., December 20, 2001.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: I very much appreciate the important      proposals contained within Title VI of the Kennedy-Frist      bioterrorism bill. International public health has a critical      role to play in protecting the United States and our global      partners from the threat of infectious disease.       As you are aware, the Administration supports the version      of the Kennedy bill that does not include Title VI. These      issues are critical, however, and I would very much like to      resolve them outside the context of the current bioterrorism      bill. Your willingness to discuss these matters in the future      is critical to the movement of this important piece of      legislation and I would welcome the opportunity to engage in      these discussions at the beginning of the next session.       Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.           Sincerely,                                         Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,                                                         Director.              additional bioterrorism preparedness issues
