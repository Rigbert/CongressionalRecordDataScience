 I am still optimistic that may happen and plan to ask unanimous consent in the morning that we go to that bill.  For the information of our colleagues, if they have had a chance to see the front page of the Washington Post this morning, the problems in Burma should be at the top of the Nation's international agenda. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, was attacked 9 days ago. We hope and believe that she is alive. But she has been injured, according to all reports.  It is time for the United States to take a leadership position, and it is time for the Senate to pass this bill, which I will ask consent to bring up and pass tomorrow. I might say that it is cosponsored by both the Democratic and Republican leaders and by both the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. It remains my hope that we will be able to get that cleared and vote on it tomorrow.                          ____________________
