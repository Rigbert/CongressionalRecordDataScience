 So I want to take a few minutes to address those questions.  In simple terms, a tax strategy is any method for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability based upon the tax law--including interpretations and applications of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and related guidance.  A tax strategy can be as simple as a plan to buy tax-exempt bonds or invest in an IRA to reduce your tax liability or as complex as some sort of sale-leaseback tax shelter involving multiple domestic and foreign corporations and partnerships.  A tax strategy patent, which is what we are talking about in this bill, is just that--a patent on a particular tax strategy.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from a publication called the Tax Adviser. This article provides some examples of tax strategies that should not be patented.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Tax Advisors, Aug. 1, 2007]                          Patenting Tax Ideas (By Justine P. Ransome, J.D., MBA, CPA; and Eileen Sherr, CPA, M.Tax)                           Executive Summary       TSPs have been issued in many areas, and many applications      are currently pending.       Such patents thwart Congressional intent and undermine the      integrity of, and the public's confidence in, the tax system.       AICPA will continue to work with the IRS, USPTO, Treasury      and Congress to handle--and hopefully resolve--this emerging      issue.       One of the greatest challenges tax practitioners face in      providing quality tax services to clients is to keep abreast      of the ever-changing complexity of the tax law. Added to this      challenge is the burden of determining whether the chosen      advice is another party's exclusive property. While this may      seem absurd, in the real world of tax consulting, tax      advisers must now contend with certain practitioners and      companies seeking patents to protect their exclusive right to      use various tax planning ideas and techniques they claim to      have developed.       Tax practitioners may be surprised to find that tax      strategies they have used routinely in practice are now      patented and unavailable for use without the patent holder's      permission. The trend of patenting tax strategies is on the      rise. This article explores tax-strategy patenting. It      provides an overview of the issue and discusses the AICPA's      concerns and activities to keep its members informed, as well      as its attempts to seek a legislative remedy that will stem      the tide of these types of patents.                               Background       The Patent Act of 1952 provided that patents may be granted      for innovations that are useful, novel and nonobvious. Under      35 USC Section 271, a patent gives its holder the exclusive      right to make, use and sell the patented idea. The      consequences of infringing a patent can be substantial. The      remedies for patent infringement under 35 USC Sections 283      and 284 include injunctive relief and money damages equal to      lost profits or a reasonable royalty. Money damages can be      tripled in cases of willful infringement, as authorized under      35 USC Section 284; under 35     USC Section 285, attorneys' fees can be awarded to the      prevailing party in exceptional cases. Issued patents are      presumed valid; under 35 USC Section 282, an accuser must      overcome this presumption with clear and convincing evidence      to invalidate a patent. Even if an accused is not found      liable, defending a lawsuit can be costly.       In 1998, the Federal Circuit, in State Street Bank & Trust,      held that business methods are patentable. Since this      decision, patents for business methods have flourished. In      some cases, these patents involve processes that would seem      to be neither novel nor nonobvious (i.e., other reasonably      intelligent people would come to the same or a similar      conclusion when confronted with the same or similar issue).       Recently, the Supreme Court held that the long-standing      test used by the lower courts to determine whether an idea      was nonobvious was not being applied correctly (and, in fact,      was being applied too strictly). The opinion stated that for      an idea to be nonobvious, it must be (1) one that would not      have occurred to persons of ordinary skill and intelligence      in the field of endeavor involved; or (2) previously      available knowledge that would have caused a person of      ordinary intelligence to affirmatively believe that the idea      would not work. Since this decision was just handed down, it      remains to be seen what effect it will have on the      proliferation of patents for business methods in the future.       The patenting of business methods has recently crept into      the practice of tax planning. At press time, 60 tax-strategy      patents (TSPs) have been granted; 86 are pending. There may      be additional TSPs; about 10% are generally unpublished,      because applicants can elect not to publish a patent if no      protection is being sought in a foreign jurisdiction. Also,      it can take up to 18 months for a patent application to be      published and listed on the USPTO website. As discussed      below, many of these patents deal with planning techniques      routinely used by tax practitioners in delivering tax      services to clients.     Reasons for Concern       SOGRAT patent: The primary catalyst for the concern of the      AICPA and other tax practitioners was a 2006 infringement      suit over the ``SOGRAT patent.'' Awarded by the USPTO on May      20, 2003, to Robert C. Slane of Wealth Transfer Group LLC,      the SOGRAT patent describes an estate planning technique that      uses grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) to transfer      nonqualified stock options (NQSOs) to younger generations,      with few or no gift tax consequences.       GRATs are permitted under Sec. 2702 and the regulations      there under. Many estate planners are familiar with, and      routinely use, GRATs to shift a variety of different types of      assets to younger generations. Thus, it came as quite a      surprise to many estate planners when an article touting the      estate tax benefits of placing NQSOs into a GRAT noted that      the technique had been patented by one of that article's      authors. This surprise grew into concern when the patent      holder instituted the above-mentioned patent infringement      suit against a taxpayer who implemented the technique without      its permission.       Warning letters: As previously stated, money damages can be      tripled in cases of willful infringement (which requires      knowledge of the patent). Some patent holders have resorted      to mail campaigns and/or press releases touting their patents      and warning other tax practitioners that they may be      infringing on said patents. For example, one patent      infringement warning letter addressed a method for financing      future needs of an individual or future intentions on the      death of such person, and a method for investing long-term      assets of tax-exempt charities. The letter noted that the      allowed claims in the patent involve investments used for      charitable remainder trusts, pooled-income funds, charitable      gift annuities, charitable lead trusts and permanent      endowment funds.       Part of this patent resembles the facts and results of      Letter Ruling 90090471 and TAM 9825001. In those rulings, the      IRS permitted a net-income charitable remainder unitrust to      invest in a tax-deferred annuity contract for the purposes of      controlling the timing and amount of income distributions and      to otherwise provide a guaranteed death benefit payable to      the charitable remainder interest holder. The patent purports      to achieve a similar result through the use of tax-deferred      arrangements.       The patent holder also sent a press release to the Planned      Giving Design Center (PGDC), a professional organization that      provides advice on charitable planning and taxation. An      article written by the PGDC's editor noted that the letter      ruling and TAM are well known to members of the insurance      community in particular, ``which have since facilitated      thousands of annuity invested charitable remainder trusts      since 1990.'' The article further noted that these rulings      are also well known to the IRS, which issued them and      subsequently discussed such arrangements in its 1999      Continuing Professional Education text. The IRS also added      these rulings to its annual ``no-ruling'' list as it studied      whether they conveyed an inappropriate tax benefit to      taxpayers. The article noted that all of these events      occurred well in advance of the date the holder applied for      his patent (2004).       In light of that patent, the AICPA and American Bar      Association (ABA) asked the USPTO whether IRS rulings were      considered ``prior art'' (and, thus, not novel) if they were      not listed in the ``Other References'' section of a patent      application. The patent application did not contain a      reference to either ruling. The USPTO replied that, although      it had not required such information in the past, it would      start requesting it for financial-type patents under its Rule      105 (which is used to ask applicants for more information).       Sec. 1031: A patent relying heavily on Sec. 1031 has also      drawn tax advisers' attention. The ``Section 1031 deedshare      patent'' involves a method and investment instruments      (deedshares) for performing tax-deferred real estate      exchanges. The patent follows the result in Rev. Proc. 2002-     22. Its exclusive licensee, CB Richard Ellis Investors,      L.L.C., has publicized and warned that it will aggressively      pursue patent enforcement.       Deferred compensation: A patent on hedging liabilities      associated with a deferred-compensation plan was granted and      assigned to Goldman Sachs & Company. The patent purports to      provide a mechanism to hedge the compensation expense      liabilities of an employer providing deferred compensation to      one or more employees.       IRAs: A patent has been granted to evaluate the financial      consequences of converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.      It describes a computer-implemented process for computing the      tax consequences of converting to a Roth IRA and various      options for funding the taxes, such as term insurance to fund      the Federal tax liability of early withdrawal for premature      death, calculating the entire rollover amount and financing      the tax and insurance premium.       FSAs: A patent has been granted on flexible spending      accounts (FSAs). The patent sets forth a method to calculate      costs using a ``health cost calculator'' and ``flexible      spending account calculator.''       FOLIOfn: The trend to patent tax ideas is only in its      infancy; however, several individuals and companies already      have applied for multiple patents. For example, FOLIOfn,      Inc., a brokerage and investment solutions company, holds      three TSPs. It has developed methods for tracking and      organizing investments and has patented mechanisms and      processes that allow users to view and manipulate potential      tax consequences of investment decisions. Several of      FOLIOfn's other business-method patents are in practice via      large licensing agreements. The company is similarly looking      for licensing opportunities for its three TSPs but has not      yet secured any deals.       As far as the AICPA is aware, only one of its members (a      sole practitioner) has applied for a TSP. The AICPA Tax      Division staff discussed the issue with that member. The      AICPA has confirmed that, currently, none of the ``Big Four'      accounting firms holds TSPs.                              AICPA Issues       In a Feb. 28, 2007, letter to Congress, the AICPA outlined      its concerns and position on patenting tax strategies. Its      position is that TSPs:       Limit taxpayers' ability to use fully tax law      interpretations intended by Congress;       May cause some taxpayers to pay more tax than Congress      intended or more than others similarly situated;       Complicate the provision of tax advice by professionals;       Hinder compliance by taxpayers;       Mislead taxpayers into believing that a patented strategy      is valid under the tax law; and       Preclude tax professionals from challenging the validity of      a patented strategy.       The AICPA is concerned about patents for methods that      taxpayers use in arranging their affairs to minimize tax      obligations. TSPs may limit taxpayers' ability to use fully      interpretations of law intended by Congress. As a result,      they thwart Congressional intent and, thus, undermine the      integrity of, and the public's confidence in, the tax system.      TSPs also unfairly cause some taxpayers to pay more tax than      (1) intended by Congress or (2) others similarly situated.      The AICPA believes that the conflict with Congressional      intent highlights a serious policy reason against allowing      patent protection. Allowing a patent on a strategy for      complying with a law or regulation is not sound public policy      because it creates exclusivity in interpreting the law.       The AICPA is also concerned with tax law simplicity and      administration. TSPs greatly complicate tax advice and      compliance. Tax law is already quite complex. The AICPA      believes that the addition of rapidly proliferating patents      on tax-planning techniques and concepts will render tax      compliance much more difficult.       Because TSPs are granted by the Federal government, the      AICPA is concerned that they pose a significant risk to      taxpayers. Taxpayers may be misled into believing that a      patented tax strategy bears the approval of other government      agencies (e.g., the IRS) and, thus, is a valid and viable      technique under the tax law. However, this is not the case;      the USPTO does not consider the viability of a strategy under      the tax law. The USPTO is authorized only to apply the      criteria for patent approval as enacted by Congress and as      interpreted by the courts. The IRS is not involved in the      USPTO's consideration of a TSP application.       The AICPA is concerned that tax professionals also may be      unable, as a practical matter, to challenge the validity of      TSPs as being obvious or lacking novelty, due to their      professional obligations of client confidentiality. Tax      advisers may also find it difficult to defend patent-     infringement lawsuits due to client confidentiality. The     USPTO will also find it difficult, if not impossible, to      determine whether proposed tax strategies meet the statutory      requirements for patentability because tax advice is      generally provided on a confidential basis.       The usefulness of TSPs is also questionable. The AICPA      believes that some of these patents may be sought to prevent      tax advisers and taxpayers from using otherwise legally      permissible tax-planning techniques, unless they pay a      royalty.       The AICPA is concerned that both tax practitioners and      taxpayers may be sued for patent infringement, whether or not      the infringer knew about the patent. A taxpayer can infringe      a patent without intent or knowledge of it; ignorance of an      applicable patent is not a defense. Practitioners must be      aware that once they know that a particular tax strategy is      patented, using that strategy without the patent holders      permission may expose them to claims of willful infringement      and triple damages. Unfortunately, the current environment      may leave some practitioners with no recourse, other than      engaging patent counsel to review and monitor techniques they      routinely use.     Advocacy Efforts and Communications       Background: In November 2005 and February 2006, the AICPA      Trust, Estate & Gift Tax TRP discussed this emerging issue      with IRS representatives. In addition, AICPA President Barry      Melancon discussed this issue with then-IRS Commissioner Mark      Everson on Oct. 17, 2006, advising him of the AICPA's concern      and desire to take legislative action.       In January 2006, the AICPA Tax Division's Tax Executive      Committee (TEC) decided to form the PTF. This article's      authors chair and staff that task force, respectively. The      PTF was formed with both large- and small-firm members, from      various technical areas of the AICPA Tax Division, including      individual, international, partnership, S corporation, tax      policy and legislation, and trust, estate and gift taxes. The      task force held several conference calls and meetings,      including one call with a patent expert who explained the      basis for patents and the application process.       In June 2006, the TEC authorized some PTF members to      participate in a joint multi-professional organization task      force (including the AICPA, the ABA's Real Property, Probate      and Trust Law Section and Tax Section, the American College      of Trust and Estate Counsel and the American Bankers      Association) on the issue. The joint task force had several      conference calls; its chair attended a PTF meeting in      November 2006.       In July 2006, prior to the Congressional hearings on the      issue, the PTF discussed its concerns with Capitol Hill      staff. This article's authors attended the hearing, then      updated AICPA Tax Division members about the issue and      hearing via an electronic alert (e-alert) in August 2006.       In October 2006, the AICPA up-dated members via an update      to state CPA societies. In February 2007, the AICPA sent to      the leadership of the House and Senate tax-writing and      judiciary committees its position on tax-strategy patenting,      including legislative proposals. E-alerts went out to the      AICPA membership and were included in the April 2007 issue of      the AICPA's The CPA Letter. In addition, PTF members authored      Journal of Accountancy articles on the subject.       In March 2007, the PTF drafted and submitted comments to      Treasury on the regulations for ``reportable transactions.''      These comments recommended that Treasury not require      taxpayers to report patented transactions as reportable      transactions, but require the patent holder or USPTO to      disclose when the patent is issued.       The AICPA Congressional and Political Affairs group has      made TSPs a top priority and is in discussions with Congress      and its staffs, as well as the USPTO's General Counsel and      Director of Business Method Patents, to develop and enact      legislation designed to bar grants of, or provide immunity      for taxpayers and practitioners from liability related to,      such patents. Currently, the AICPA's legislative efforts are      focused on the judiciary committees, which consider and vote      on any patent legislation.       Action: The AICPA has taken a pro-active role against the      patenting of tax ideas. Most of its efforts are reflected in      a website it has created on the subject, which contains:       AICPA comments to Congress, Treasury and the IRS, updates      to members, and its PTF roster;       Comments of other groups and the Joint Committee on      Taxation;       USPTO links;       Information on specific TSPs;       Related articles and other information; and       Links to additional resources.                           Recommended Steps       To minimize potential liability until a legislative      solution is enacted, tax practitioners should take the      following steps, as appropriate, in response to TSPs:       Stay current on matters regarding TSPs by continually      visiting the AICPA website on the subject.       Read articles and attend conferences about TSPs.       Continually visit the USPTO website to determine if a tax      idea, technique or strategy that a tax practitioner intends      to recommend to a client has been issued a patent or if one      is pending.       If a strategy is either already patented or is similar to a      patented strategy:       Advise the client about the patent's existence, the options      available and the associated risks;       Determine whether patent counsel is needed to further      investigate the patent; and       If there is a relevant patent, determine whether to      negotiate with the patent holder to be able to use the      strategy.                     Proposed Legislative Solution       The AICPA has considered various administrative solutions      to this issue and concluded that they are insufficient. In      its Feb. 28, 2007, letter, it encouraged Congress to develop      legislation to eliminate the harmful consequences of TSPs by      either (1) restricting the issuance of such patents or (2)      providing immunity from patent infringement liability for      taxpayers and tax practitioners.       HR 2365, legislation sought by the AICPA to limit damages      and other remedies with respect to patents for tax-planning      methods, was introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) on May      17, 2007, with initial co-sponsors Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)      and Steve Chabot (R-OH). Reps. Boucher, Goodlatte and Chabot      are senior members of the House Judiciary Committee, which      has jurisdiction over patent legislation. The bill was      referred to that committee. As of May 30, 2007, 14 cosponsors      had signed onto the bill. AICPA efforts and discussions      continue with other members of Congress, including members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee. On May 16, 2007, Reps. Lamar      Smith (R-TX), Boucher and Goodlatte sent a letter requesting      a hearing on the issue to Howard Berman (D-CA), chairman of      the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts, the      Internet, and Intellectual Property.     The Future       The AICPA continues to work with Congress to make      legislative changes regarding the patenting of tax      strategies. It is also currently working with the USPTO to      determine how both organizations might work together to      better scrutinize such patent applications. The AICPA will      continue to focus its legislative efforts on the judiciary      committees and to work with the USPTO, IRS and Treasury, as      well as other professional groups, to educate tax advisers on      TSPs and to enhance the flow of information among the groups.      The PTF and the AICPA will continue to update its website      with additional resources for members, develop other      educational and practice-oriented tools and study and address      related professional ethical issues.                               Conclusion       Practitioners and taxpayers need to (1) be aware that TSPs      are being granted and (2) review planning approaches and      consider consulting with patent counsel, if appropriate. Tax      advisers should ask clients about their use of tax      strategies, as they may be unknowingly using patented ones.      The AICPA will continue to work with the IRS, USPTO, Treasury      and Congress to handle--and hopefully resolve--this emerging      issue.
