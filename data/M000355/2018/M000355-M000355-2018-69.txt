 President, it is my honor to pay tribute to my friend, David Fields, who is the Butler County judge-executive from my home State of Kentucky. Earlier this year, David announced that his time in public service would come to a close soon, ending more than a decade of leadership and success for those who put their trust in him.  After a successful career owning a body shop with his wife, Virginia, David chose to dedicate himself to the service of his community. First elected in 2006, David quickly got to work leading the county. As a former judge-executive myself, I know firsthand just how many responsibilities land on your plate, and David accomplished a great deal along the way.  In particular, David has been a wonderful ally to me here in the Senate in our work for this region. The Green River, which flows through Butler County, brings the potential for transportation and commerce. I had the opportunity to work closely with Davidduring our effort to transfer the ownership of the Rochester from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USACE, to the local community. The dam, which is more man 175 years old and provides a vital water supply to nearly 50,000 Kentuckians, had fallen into disrepair and its uncertain status with the USACE threatened Butler County's economic future. With David's advocacy, I inserted a provision in a recent water infrastructure bill transferring control of the dam to the local community.  Last year, I also proudly supported the Rochester Dam Regional Water Commission's application for an economic development grant to renovate the dam and secure its future for the area. With a $3 million investment, local leaders like David can continue to help this region grow and benefit Kentuckians for years to come.  Although I am sorry to see him go, I wish David a wonderful retirement. I am told he looks forward to spending more time with Virginia, his son, Greg, and two granddaughters. I would like to thank David for his leadership of Butler County and for his dedicated service to its citizens. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating David on this remarkable milestone.                          ____________________
