President, before I begin, I should note my good friend, the senior Senator from Missouri, is on the floor. He had to put a unanimous consent request earlier, knowing that under the procedures we follow, it would be objected to by the senior Senator from West Virginia.  I will tell my friend from Missouri that in my 29 years here, I have never heard an objection so eloquently stated as was stated by the senior Senator from West Virginia. I think of the number of times we all make these requests, and most of the time unanimous consent requests are granted, as the Senator knows. For example, he recently made one allowing the junior Senator to speak and for me to follow. I can't help but think it would be nice if sometimes it wouldn't get so rancorous around here, if we could hear more of the words of Senator Byrd in this regard. He included a history, geography and literature lesson, all in a simple ``I object.'' It makes life better.  I wish my friend from Missouri a good break, as I do my friend, the distinguished Presiding Officer. He will soon, I am sure, be heading to New Hampshire, as I will to Vermont.                          ____________________
