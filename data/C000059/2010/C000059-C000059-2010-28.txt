In 1974 Turkey illegally invaded the northern part of the island nation Cyprus, and that occupation continues today. As a member of the Hellenic Caucus, I recognize and support the Republic of Cyprus as the sovereign political government of the island. This position is supported by the United Nations, and since 1974, more than 75 resolutions have been adopted by the U.N. Security Council calling for the return of the refugees to their homes and properties and for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from Cyprus.  In 2006, I cosponsored H. Res. 603, which urged the U.S. government to advocate for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish forces from the territories of the Republic of Cyprus. I will continue to support Cypriots as they seek a peaceful solution to the conflict dividing the island. It is my prayer that these two countries can find a solution to serve the best interest of all the people in the region, and one day live in peace.                          ____________________
