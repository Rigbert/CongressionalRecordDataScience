Mr. Arcuri will be offering the rule on the energy extender bill. We will not vote on the rule tonight. There will be no further votes tonight. After discussion with the Republican side of the aisle, we have agreed, and we will do a unanimous consent, but we will be coming in at 8 a.m. tomorrow.  The reason for coming in at 8 a.m. tomorrow, as I think all of you know, is that the Jewish holidays start at sundown tomorrow night. To accommodate, therefore, our Members getting to their homes to be with their families, it is necessary for us to complete our business by, hopefully, no later than 12:30. Therefore, we will be coming in an hour early. We haven't discussed this, but hopefully, perhaps, we could dispense with 1-minutes as well so we can get right to the business at hand if that's possible. We will try to get all Members out of here by 12:30 so that we can observe the holidays for our Jewish colleagues.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
