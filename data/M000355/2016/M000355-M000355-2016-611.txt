 President, combating the spread of the Zika virus has been a priority for both parties so Republicans and Democrats deliberated and forged a compromise in committee. Senators debated that $1.1 billion compromise on the floor and voted to pass it. Every single Democrat voted for it--every one of them.  We went to conference committee and the House agreed to fully fund the Senate-passed funding level. Now, with the House's action last night, we have a chance to send the $1.1 billion in Zika funding to the President's desk.  This agreement will allow us to focus on immediate needs like mosquito control, while providing resources for longer term goals like a vaccine. It also takes a broader view that U.S. experts should also have the ability to address other emerging mosquito-borne diseases as well.  The administration has called for Congress to take action on Zika by July 4. They have warned of dire consequences if Congress fails to act. Many of our colleagues here have raised similar concerns.  The House did its part, and now the Senate needs to do its part. This agreement represents our only chance to put Zika control money to work right now. Again, it contains the exact amount of Zika funding passed by the Senate last month with the vote of every single Senate Democrat.  Keeping Americans safe and healthy should be a top priority for all of us. We know pregnant women are at particular risk. Democrats should work with us to pass Zika control funding again, not block funding for combating this virus. Phony excuses and made up objections to the funding we have already passed will not help create a vaccine or eradicate the threat of Zika.  We also have an opportunity to support our veterans. This agreement substantially increases critical resources to ensure veterans receive benefits and health care they have earned. It will enhance the oversight and accountability at the VA. It will help improve quality of life on military bases for soldiers and their families. It will also advance critical national security projects like missile defense.  The Senate voted overwhelmingly to support ideas like these last month, too. We should now vote to get this critical veterans funding bill down to the President for signature.                          ____________________
