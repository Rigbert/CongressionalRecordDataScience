President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act.  Before I begin, I want to commend Chairman Inouye for his leadership in bringing this bill forward. Over the course of this grueling week of debate, he has done his best to ensure that this process has been civil, open, and transparent. In doing so, he has protected the authority and responsibility of the Congress to shape the funding priorities of this country.  I would be remiss if 1 did not recognize the work of Senator Byrd, who laid the groundwork in the Appropriations Committee last year, winning bipartisan support for nearly all of the bills that comprise this legislation.  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the work of all of the subcommittee chairs, but in particular, Senator Mikulski, for her support in helping address the needs of New England's lobster and groundfish harvesters who continue to be severely impacted by Federal regulations and catch restrictions and face the prospect of losing not only their livelihoods but a way of life. Because she has been such an effective advocate for the watermen of Chesapeake Bay, she has recognized, perhaps more than anyone outside New England, the economic and cultural importance of our fishing communities, as well as the strain they are under.  Mr. President, setting aside the fact that we must pass a bill now in order to avoid a Government shutdown, the fact is this is the right bill for us to pass.  It will, as I indicate, avoid disruption of essential services to the Nation at a time when the American people demand and need the support of a functioning Government.  This legislation complements the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by funding additional programs that will save and create thousands of jobs. It includes continued investments in transit, highway, and water infrastructure.
