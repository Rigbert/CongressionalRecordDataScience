Mr. Chairman, I would respond that the subcommittee made every effort to offset all of the defense supplementals for the Bosnian deployment from funds from the Department of Defense. We did that successfully. We were extremely careful to look at programs where the funding would have expired because the programs had been delayed.  I would say to the gentleman that he is absolutely correct. Missile defense systems to protect our troops is one of our highest priorities. THAAD remains one of the highest priorities in the missile defense program. We are committed to providing adequate funds to keep the program on track.  Our recommendation to rescind a portion of 1996 funds was strictly one of timing. Due to the ongoing program review and resulting schedule changes, all of the fiscal year 1996 funds could not have been executed by September 30, the date when they would expire. However, there are still sufficient 1996 funds remaining, as well as fiscal year 1997 funds, to carry the program forward. The department assures us that there are adequate funds to resume testing later this year upon completion of the review.
