Mr. Speaker, the ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001'' reflects a compromise agreement that the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Veterans' Affairs reached on certain provisions of a number of bills considered by the House and Senate during the 107th Congress, including: H.R. 2792, a bill to make service dogs available to disabled veterans and to make various other improvements in health care benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs on October 16, 2001, and passed by the House on October 23, 2001 [hereinafter, ``House Bill'']; S. 1188, a bill to enhance the authority of the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to recruit and retain qualified nurses for the Veterans Health Administration, and for other purposes, reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on October 10, 2001, as proposed to be amended by a manager's amendment [hereinafter, ``Senate Bill'']; S. 1576, a bill to amend section 1710 of title 38, United States Code, to extend the eligibility for health care of veterans who served in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War; and, S. 1598, a bill to amend section 1706 of title 38, United States Code, to enhance the management of the provision by the Department of Veterans Affairs of specialized treatment and rehabilitation for disabled veterans, and for other purposes, introduced on October 21, 2001.  The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have prepared the following explanation of the compromise bill, H.R. 3447 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions in the bills listed above are noted in this document, except for clerical corrections and conforming changes made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.  TITLE I--ENHANCEMENT OF NURSE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AUTHORITIES               Subtitle A--Nurse Recruitment Authorities     Current Law       Several VA programs under existing law are designed to aid      the Department in recruiting qualified health care      professionals in fields where scarcity and high demand      produce competition with the private sector.     The Department is authorized to operate the Employee      Incentive Scholarship Program (hereafter EISP) under section      7671 of title 38, United States Code. Under the EISP, VA may      award scholarship funds, up to $10,000 per year per      participant in full-time study, for up to 3 years. These      scholarships require eligible participants to reciprocate      with periods of obligated service to the Department.      Currently, enrollment in the scholarship program is limited      to employees with 2 or more antecedent years of VA      employment. Statutory authority for this program terminates      December 31, 2001.       The Department is authorized to operate the Education Debt      Reduction Program (hereafter EDRP) under section 7681 of      title 38, United States Code. Under the EDRP, the Department      may repay education-related loans incurred by recently hired      VA clinical professionals in high demand positions. Statutory      authority for this program, a program not yet implemented by      the Department, terminates on December 31, 2001. If      implemented, the program would authorize VA to repay $6,000,      $8,000, and $10,000 per year, respectively, over a 3-year      period, in combined principal and interest on educational      loans obtained by scarce VA professionals.       Under sections 8344 and 8468 of title 5, United States      Code, the Department is authorized to request waivers of the      pay reduction otherwise required by law for re-employed      Federal annuitants who are recruited to the Department in      order to meet staffing needs in scarce health care      specialties.     Senate Bill       Section 111 would permanently authorize the EISP; reduce      the minimum period of employment for eligibility in the      program from 2 years to 1 year; remove the award limit for      education pursued during a particular school year by a      participant, as long as the participant had not exceeded the      overall limitation of the equivalent of 3 years of full-time      education; and, extend authority to increase the award      amounts based on Federal national comparability increases in      pay.       Section 112 would permanently authorize the EDRP; expand      the list of eligible occupations furnishing direct patient      care services and services incident to such care to veterans;      extend the number of years to 5 that a Departmental employee      may participate in the EDRP, and increase the gross award      limit to any participant to $44,000, with the award payments      for the fourth and fifth years to a participant limited to      $10,000 in each; and provide limited authority (until June      30, 2002) for the Secretary to waive the eligibility      requirement limiting EDRP participation to recently appointed      employees on a case-by-case basis for individuals appointed      on or after January 1, 1999, through December 30, 2001.       Section 113 would require the Department to report to      Congress its use of the authority in title 5, United States      Code, to request waivers of pay reduction normally required      from re-employed Federal annuitants, when such requests are      used to meet its nurse staffing requirements.     House Bill       The House bill has no comparable provisions.     Compromise Agreement       Sections 101, 102, and 103 follow the Senate language.                Subtitle B--Nurse Retention Authorities     Current Law       Section 7453(c) of title 38, United States Code, guarantees      premium pay (at 25 percent over the basic pay rate) to VA      registered nurses who work regularly scheduled tours of duty      during Saturdays and Sundays. However, licensed vocational      nurses and certain health care support personnel, whose      employment status is grounded in employment authorities in      title 5 and title 38, United States Code, are eligible for      premium pay on regularly scheduled tours of duty that include      Sundays. Saturday premium pay for these employees is a      discretionary decision at individual medical facilities.       At retirement, VA registered nurses enrolled in the Civil      Service Retirement System receive annuity credit for unused      sick leave. This credit is unavailable, however, for      registered nurses who retire under the Federal Employee      Retirement System.     Senate Bill       Section 121 would mandate that VA provide Saturday premium      pay to employees specified in Section 7454(b).       Section 122 would extend authority for the Department to      provide VA nurses enrolled in the Federal Employee Retirement      System the equivalent sick-leave credit in their retirement      annuity calculations that is provided to other VA nurses who      are enrolled in the Civil Service Retirement System.       Section 123 would require the Department to evaluate nurse-     managed clinics, including those providing primary and      geriatric care to veterans. Several nurse-managed clinics are      in operation throughout the VA health care system, with a      preponderance of clinics operating in the Upper Midwest      Health Care Network. The evaluation would include information      on patient satisfaction, provider experiences, cost, access      and other matters. The Secretary would be required to report      results from this evaluation to the Committees on Veterans'      Affairs 18 months after enactment.       Section 124 would require the Department to develop a      nationwide clinical staffing standards policy to ensure that      veterans are provided with safe and high quality care.      Section 8110 of title 38, United States Code, sets forth the      manner in which medical facilities shall be operated, but      does not include reference to staffing levels for such      operation.       Section 125 would require the Secretary to submit annual      reports on exceptions approved by the Secretary to VA's nurse      qualification standards. Such reports would include the      number of waivers requested and granted to permit promotion      of nurses who do not have baccalaureate degrees in nursing,      and other pertinent information.       Section 126 would require the Department to report      facility-specific use of mandatory overtime for professional      nursing staff and nursing assistants during 2001. The      Department has no nationwide policy on the use of mandatory      overtime. This report would be required within 180 days of      enactment. The report would include information on the amount      of mandatory overtime paid by VA health care facilities,      mechanisms employed to monitor overtime use, assessment of      any ill effects on patient care, and recommendations on      preventing or minimizing its use.     House Bill       The House bill has no comparable provisions.     Compromise Agreement       Sections 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, and 126 are identical to      the provisions in the Senate bill.       The Committees are concerned about VA's current national      policy requiring VA nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees      as one means of quality assurance. VA has issued directive      5012.1, a directive that requires VA's registered nurses to      obtain baccalaureate degrees in nursing as a precondition to      advancement beyond entry level, and to do so by 2005. This      policy is effective immediately for newly employed nurses.       At a time of looming crisis in achieving adequacy of basic      clinical staffing of VA facilities, the Committees express      concern over whether such a policy guiding nurse      qualifications may work against VA's interests and      responsibilities to protect the safety of its patients by      creating unintended shortages of scarce health personnel. The      Committees urge the Secretary to consider the implications of      continuing such a policy in the face of future shortages of      nursing personnel. The American Association of Community      Colleges has reported that, each year, more than 60 percent      of new US registered nurses are produced in two-year      associate degree programs. The Department's current      qualification standard for registered nurses may dissuade      these fully licensed health care professionals from      considering VA employment.                     Subtitle C--Other Authorities     Current Law       Section 7306(a)(5) of title 38, United States Code,      requires that the Office of the Under Secretary for Health      include a Director of Nursing Service, responsible to the      Under Secretary for Health.       Section 7426 of title 38, United States Code, provides      retirement rights for, among others, nurses, physician      assistants and expanded-function dental auxiliaries with      part-time appointments. These employees' retirement annuities      are calculated in a way that produces an unfair loss of      annuity for them compared to other Federal employees.      Congress has made a number of efforts since 1980 to provide      equity for this group, many members of whom are now retired.      These individuals, appointed to their part-time VA positions      prior to April 6, 1986, under the employment authority of      title 38, United States Code, have been penalized with lower      annuities by subsequent Acts of Congress that addressed      retirement annuity calculation rules for other part-time      Federal employees appointed under the authority of title 5,      United States Code.       Section 7251 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the directors of VA health care facilities to request      adjustments to the minimum rates of basic pay for nurses      based on local variations in the labor market.     Senate Bill       Section 131 would amend section 7306(a)(5) of title 38,      United States Code, to elevate the office of the VA Nurse      Executive by requiring that official to report directly to      the VA Under Secretary for Health.       Section 132 would amend section 7426 of title 38, United      States Code, to exempt registered nurses, physician      assistants, and expanded-function dental auxiliaries from the      requirement that part-time service performed prior to April      7, 1986, be prorated when calculating retirement annuities.       Section 133 would modify the nurse locality-pay authorities      and reporting requirements. The section would clarify and      simplify a VA medical center's use of Bureau of Labor      Statistics (BLS) information to facilitate locality-pay      decisions for VA nurses. Additionally, section 133 would      clarify the Committees' intent on steps VA facilities would      take when certain BLS data were unavailable, thus serving as      a trigger for the use of third-party survey information, and      thereby reducing current restrictions on the use of such      surveys.     House Bill       The House bill contains no comparable provisions.     Compromise Agreement       Sections 131, 132, and 133 follow the Senate bill.             Subtitle D--National Commission on VA Nursing     Current Law       None.     House Bill       Section 301 would establish a 12-member National Commission      on VA Nursing. The Secretary would appoint eleven members,      and the Nurse Executive of the Department would serve as the      twelfth, ex officio, member. Members would include three      recognized representatives of employees of the Department;      three representatives of professional associations of nurses      or similar organizations affiliated with the Department's      health care practitioners; two representatives of trade      associations representing the nursing profession; two would      be nurses from nursing schools affiliated with the      Department; and one member would represent veterans. The      Secretary would designate one member to serve as Chair of the      Commission.       Section 302 would authorize the Commission to assess      legislative and organizational policy changes to enhance the      recruitment and retention of nurses by the Department and the      future of the nursing profession within the Department. This      section would also provide for Commission recommendations on      legislation and policy changes to enhance recruitment and      retention of nurses by the Department.       Section 303 would require the Commission to submit to      Congress and the Secretary a report on its findings and      conclusions. The report would be due not later than 2 years      after the date of the first meeting of the Commission. The      Secretary would be required to promptly consider the      Commission's report and submit to Congress the Department's      views on the Commission's findings and conclusions, including      actions, if any, that the Department would take to implement      the recommendations.       Sections 304 and 305 would delineate the powers afforded to      the Commission, including powers to conduct hearings and      meetings, take testimony and obtain information from external      sources, employ staff, authorize rates of pay, detail other      Federal employees to the Commission staff, and address other      administrative matters.       Section 306 would terminate the Commission 90 days after      the date of the submission of its report to Congress.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill has no comparable provisions.     Compromise Agreement       Sections 141, 142, 143, 144, 145 and 146 follow the House      bill, with certain modifications to the membership of the      Commission.       The Committees expect the National Commission on VA Nursing      to concern itself with the full spectrum of occupations      involved in nursing care of veterans in the Veterans Health      Administration, with specific reference to registered      professional and licensed vocational nurses, clinical nurse      specialists, nurse practitioners, nurse managers and      executives, nursing assistants, and other technical and      ancillary personnel of the Department involved in direct      health care delivery to the nation's veterans. In addition to      statutory requirements, the Committees expect the Secretary      to appoint members to the Commission to reflect the wide      variety of occupations and disciplines that constitute the      nursing profession within the Department.                        TITLE II--OTHER MATTERS                       PROVISION OF SERVICE DOGS     Current Law       None.     House Bill       Section 101 would amend section 1714 of title 38, United      States Code, to authorize the Department to provide service      dogs to veterans suffering from spinal cord injury or      dysfunction, other diseases causing physical immobility, or      hearing loss (or other types of disabilities susceptible to      improvement or enhanced functioning) for which use of service      dogs is likely to improve or enhance their ability to perform      activities of daily living or other skills of independent      living. Under the provision, a veteran would be required to      be enrolled in VA care under section 1705 of title 38, United      States Code, as a prerequisite to eligibility. Service dogs      would be provided in accordance with existing priorities for      VA health care enrollment.     Senate Bill       Section 201 would authorize the Secretary to provide      service dogs to service-connected veterans with hearing      impairments and with spinal cord injuries.     Compromise Agreement       Section 201 follows the House provision.       Any travel expenses of the veteran in adjusting to the      service dog would be reimbursable on the same basis as such      expenses are reimbursed under Section 111, title 38, United      States Code, for blind veterans adjusting to a guide dog.       MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CARE FOR CERTAIN LOW-INCOME VETERANS     Current Law       Section 1722(a) of title 38, United States Code, places      veterans whose incomes are below a specified level--in      calendar year 2001, $23,688 for an individual without      dependents--within the definition of a person who is ``unable      to defray'' the cost of health care. The section includes two      other such indicators of inability to defray: evidence of      eligibility for Medicaid, and receipt of VA nonservice-     connected pension. Veterans in these circumstances are      adjudged equally unable to defray the costs of health care;      as such, they are eligible to receive comprehensive VA health      care without agreeing to make co-payments required from      veterans whose incomes are higher. Under current law, a      single-income threshold (with adjustments only for      dependents) is the standard used.     House Bill       Section 103 would amend section 1722(a) of title 38, United      States Code, to establish geographically adjusted income      thresholds for determining a non-service-connected veteran's      priority for VA care, and therefore, whether the veteran must      agree to make co-payments in order to receive VA care. The      section's purpose would be to address local variations in      cost of care, cost-of-living or other variables that, beyond      gross income, impinge on a veteran's relative economic status      and ability to defray the cost of care.       In section 103, low-income limits administered by the      Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its      subsidized housing programs would establish an adjusted      poverty-income threshold to be used in the ability-to-defray      determination. The actual threshold for determining an      individual veteran's ability to pay would be the greater of      the current-law income threshold in section 1722 of title 38,      United States Code, or the local low-income limits set by      HUD.       Section 103 also would include a 5-year limitation on the      effects of adoption of the HUD low-income limits policy on      system resource allocation within the Veterans Health      Administration. Such allocations would not be increased or      decreased during the period by more than 5 percent due to      this provision. The provision would take effect on October 1,      2002.     Senate Bill       Section 202 would amend section 1722 of title 38, United      States Code, to include the HUD income index in determining      eligibility for treatment as a low-income family based upon      the veteran's permanent residence. The current national      threshold would remain in place as the base figure if the HUD      formula determines the low-income rate for a particular area      is actually less than that amount. The effective date of this      change would be January 1, 2002, and would apply to all means      tests after December 31, 2001, using data from the HUD index      at the time the means test is given.     Compromise Agreement       Section 202 retains the current-law income threshold, but      would significantly reduce co-payments from veterans near the      threshold of poverty for acute VA hospital inpatient care.      The HUD low-income limits would be used to establish a family      income determination within the priority 7 group. Those      veterans with family incomes above the HUD income limits for      their primary residences would pay the co-payments as      otherwise required by law. Veterans whose family incomes      fall between the current income threshold level under      section 1722, title 38, United States Code, and the HUD      income limits level for the standard metropolitan      statistical area of their primary residences, would be      required to pay co-payments for inpatient care that are      reduced by 80 percent from co-payments required of      veterans with higher incomes. The effective date for this      change would be October 1, 2002. MAINTENANCE OF CAPACITY FOR SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE                        NEEDS OF DISABLED VETERANS     Current Law       Section 1706 of title 38, United States Code, requires VA      to maintain nationwide capacity to provide for specialized      treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans,      including those with amputations, spinal cord injury or      dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, and severe, chronic,      disabling mental illnesses. To validate VA's compliance with      capacity maintenance, section 1706 includes a requirement for      an annual report to Congress. The reporting requirement      expired on April 1, 2001.     House Bill       Section 102 would modify the mandate for VA to maintain      capacity in specialized medical programs for veterans by      requiring the Department and each of its Veterans Integrated      Service Networks to maintain capacity in certain specialized      health care programs for veterans (those with serious mental      illness, substance-use disorders, spinal cord injuries and      dysfunction, the brain injured and blinded, and those who      need prosthetics and sensory aids); and, would extend the      capacity reporting requirement for 3 years.     Senate Bill       S. 1598 similarly would modify current law with regard to      VA's capacity for specialized services, but would require      that medical centers maintain capacity, in addition to      geographic service areas; require that VA utilize uniform      standards in the documentation of patient care workload used      to construct reports under the authority; require the      Inspector General on an annual basis to audit each geographic      service area and each medical center in the Veterans Health      Administration to ensure compliance with capacity      limitations; and, prohibit VA from substituting health care      outcome data to satisfy the requirement for maintenance of      capacity.     Compromise Agreement       Section 203 is derived substantially from the House bill,      with addition of provisions from the Senate bill, including a      requirement that VA utilize uniform standards in     the documentation of workload; a clarification that ``mental      illness'' be defined to include post-traumatic stress      disorder (PTSD), substance-use disorder, and seriously and      chronically mentally ill services; a prohibition from      substituting outcome data to satisfy the requirement to      maintain capacity; and, a requirement that the IG audit and      certify to Congress as to the accuracy of VA's required      reports.PROGRAM FOR THE PROVISION OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE AND SERVICES TO VETERANS     Current Law       Public Law 106-117 requires the VA to establish a Veterans      Health Administration-wide policy regarding chiropractic      care. Veterans Health Administration Directive 2000-014,      dated May 5, 2000, established such a policy.     House Bill       Title II would establish a national VA chiropractic      services program, implemented over a 5-year period; authorize      VA to employ chiropractors as federal employees and obtain      chiropractic services through contracts; establish an      advisory committee on chiropractic care; authorize      chiropractors to function as VA primary care providers;      authorize the appointment of a director of chiropractic      service reporting to the Secretary with the same authority as      other service directors in the VA health care system; and      provide for training and materials relating to chiropractic      services to Department health care providers.     Senate Bill       Section 204 of the Senate Bill would establish a VA      chiropractic services program in VA health care facilities      and clinics in not less than 25 states. The chiropractic care      and services would be for neuro-musculoskeletal conditions,      including subluxation complex. The VA would carry out the      program through personal service contracts and appointments      of licensed chiropractors. Training and materials would be      provided to VA health care providers for the purpose of      familiarizing them with the benefits of chiropractic care and      services.     Compromise Agreement       Section 204 would follow the Senate bill but would replace      its reference to 25 states with a reference to VA's 22      Veterans Integrated Service Networks (referred to as      ``geographic service areas'' in the section). Also, the      agreement would include an advisory committee to assist the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs in implementation of the      chiropractic program. Under the agreement, the advisory      committee would expire 3 years from enactment.   FUNDS FOR FIELD OFFICES OF THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH COMPLIANCE AND                             ASSURANCE (ORCA)     Current Law       The Under Secretary for Health has provided funding for      ORCA field offices from funds appropriated for Medical and      Prosthetic Research.     Senate Bill       Since field offices of ORCA directly protect patient      safety, section 205 would authorize VA to fund them from the      Medical Care appropriation.     House Bill       The House bill has no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 205 follows the Senate bill.       The Committees are concerned about the need for ORCA to      maintain independence from the Office of Research and      Development. The Committees have concluded, on the strength      of hearings and reports on potential conflicts of interest,      that funding for ORCA field offices should be statutorily      separated from the Medical and Prosthetic Research      Appropriation and associated with the Medical Care      Appropriation. ORCA advises the Under Secretary for Health on      matters affecting the integrity of research, the safety of      human-subjects research and research personnel, and the      welfare of laboratory animals used in VA biomedical research      and development. ORCA field offices investigate allegations      of research impropriety, lack of compliance with rules for      protection of research participants and scientific      misconduct. The ORCA chief officer reports to the Under      Secretary for Health.                  MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION     Current Law       None.     Senate Bill       Fiscal year 2002 appropriations are available for an      emergency repair project at the VA Medical Center, Miami,      Florida. Section 205 of the Senate Bill authorizes $28.3      million for this project, in accordance with section 8104 of      title 38, United States Code.     House Bill       The House bill has no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 206 follows the Senate bill.      SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SPECIAL TELEPHONE SERVICES FOR VETERANS     Current Law       None.     House Bill       Section 104 would require the Secretary to assess special      telephone services for veterans (such as help lines and      ``hotlines'') provided by the Department. The assessment      would include the geographic coverage, availability,      utilization, effectiveness, management, coordination,      staffing, and cost of those services. It would require the      assessment to include a survey of veterans to measure      satisfaction with current special telephone services, as well      as the demand for additional services. The Secretary would be      required to submit a report to Congress on the assessment      within 1 year of enactment.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 207 contains a Sense of the Congress Resolution on      the Department's need to assess and report on special      telephone services for veterans. RECODIFICATION OF BEREAVEMENT COUNSELING AUTHORITY AND CERTAIN OTHER                        HEALTH-RELATED AUTHORITIES     Current Law       Chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, contains      various legal authorities under which VA provides services to      non-veterans. These provisions, that authorize bereavement      and mental health counseling, care for research subjects,      care for dependents and survivors of permanently and totally      disabled veterans, and emergency humanitarian care, are      intermingled with authorities for the care of veterans in      various sections of chapter 17.     House Bill       Section 105 of the House bill would in a new subchapter      consolidate and reorganize without substantive change all of      the legal authorities under which VA provides services to      non-veterans. It would reorganize section 1701 of title 38,      United States Code, by transferring one provision (pertaining      to sensori-neural aids) to section 1707.       Section 105 would create a new Subchapter VIII in Chapter      17 of title 38, United States Code, to incorporate provisions      concerning bereavement-counseling services for family members      of certain veterans and active duty personnel. A new section      1782 would provide counseling, training, and mental health      services for immediate family members.       Section 105 would place in the new subchapter the current      dependent health care authorities known as ``Civilian Health      and Medical Programs--Veterans Affairs'' (CHAMPVA),      transferred from current section 1713 to the new section      1781. A new provision would specify that a dependent or      survivor receiving such VA-sponsored care would be eligible      for bereavement and other counseling and training and mental      health services otherwise available to family members under      the subchapter.       The existing authority to provide hospital care or medical      services as a humanitarian service in emergency cases would      be moved to this new subchapter from its current location in      section 1711(b).       Section 105 would also make various technical changes to      accommodate the subchapter reorganization. These changes      would recodify the existing provisions, and consolidate and      clarify the existing statutory authority to provide care to      non-veterans.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill has no comparable provisions.     Compromise Agreement       Section 208 follows the House bill.             EXTENSION OF EXPIRING COLLECTIONS AUTHORITIES     Current Law       Section 1710(f)(2)(B) of title 38, United States Code,      authorizes VA until September 30, 2002, to collect nursing      home, hospital, and outpatient co-payments from certain      veterans. Section 1729(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States      Code, authorizes VA until October 1, 2002, to collect third-     party payments for the treatment of the nonservice-connected      disabilities of veterans with service-connected disabilities.     House Bill       Section 106 would extend until 2007 VA's authority to      collect means test co-payments and to collect third-party      payments.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 209 follows the House bill.PERSONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM FOR VETERANS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED                               DISABILITIES     Current Law       None.     House Bill       Section 107 of the House bill would require the Secretary      to carry out an evaluation and study of the feasibility and      desirability of providing a specialized personal emergency      response system for veterans with service-connected      disabilities. It would require a report to Congress on the      results of this evaluation.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 210 follows the House bill.               HEALTH CARE FOR PERSIAN GULF WAR VETERANS     Current Law       Section 1710 of title 38, United States Code, defines      eligible veterans for whom the Secretary is required to      furnish hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care. Section     1710(e)(1)(C) of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to provide      health care services on a priority basis to veterans who      served in the Southwest Asia Theater of operations during the      Persian Gulf War. Section 1710(e)(3)(B) of title 38 specifies      that this eligibility expires on December 31, 2001.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill would amend section 1710 of title 38,      United States Code, to extend health care eligibility for      veterans who served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War, to      December 31, 2011.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 211 follows the Senate bill but extends the health      care eligibility to December 31, 2002.                               ____________________
