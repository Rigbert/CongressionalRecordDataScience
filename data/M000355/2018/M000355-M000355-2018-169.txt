 President, earlier today, our 41st President George Herbert Walker Bush departed the Capitol Rotunda and was memorialized at the National Cathedral. Now his remains are on the way back to Houston for a funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church before he is laid torest right next to Barbara, his loving wife and partner of 73 years, and their daughter, Robin.  It has been reported that, some years ago, as the Bush family discussed funeral plans and the subject of lying in state came up, the former President joked in a self-deprecating way: ``Do you think anyone will come?''  Well, Mr. President, they sure did. Dignitaries, world leaders, and thousands of Americans from all walks of life waited for hours and streamed through this Capitol to pray for and pay tribute to the life and legacy of George Bush. I might add, in addition to that, on the way up to the National Cathedral, there were citizens on both sides of the road, all along the way, with their iPhones, taking photographs of this great American.  Today, at President's Trump's direction, the country is observing a national day of mourning. I know this body continues to stand with all Americans in appreciation for his inspiring example and in solidarity with the Bush family.                          ____________________
