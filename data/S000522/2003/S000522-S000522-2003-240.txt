Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, let me begin by thanking the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), our chairman, for the extraordinary job he as done in this legislation. This has been a work in progress as we all know for several months, over last year and into this year. This legislation, in the end, is something that will save millions of lives and something we can be proud of.  I have an amendment that is co-sponsored by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) that I think is a critical clarification needed to make sure that the many successful and compassionate organizations are not inadvertently disqualified from participating in our international HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment efforts.  The amendment is a one-phrase all-important clarification of the existing language in the bill. It will ensure that a qualified grantee that does not want to participate in all aspects of a treatment or prevention strategy is not disqualified from participating in our HIV/AIDS efforts. For example, if a Muslim or Catholic organization is excellent in abstinence education orAIDS testing, they should not be disqualified from U.S. funding because they have a moral objection to condoms.  The bill already says, I would point out, that organizations shall not be required as a condition of receiving the assistance to endorse or utilize a multi-sectorial approach to combatting HIV/AIDS. While this language is intended to protect organizations that are qualified in one phase of prevention or treatment from being disqualified if they have a moral or religious objection, the concern is that the language might be too vague. The word ``multi-sectorial'' has many meanings and might not protect organizations. That ambiguity--that infirmity--in the underlying bill is remedial by our amendment.  Thus the amendment which we are offering today would clarify, according to the original intent of the bill, that organizations should not be disqualified if they have moral or religious objections to one part of a treatment or prevention strategy. The one phrase that would be added is this: ``To endorse, utilize or participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the organization has a religious or moral objection.''                              {time}  1400  It could not be more clear. It could not be more transparent.  Some of my colleagues may say faith-based organizations do not need this protection, but I assure them that the problem is real. In one case, a Catholic doctor who worked in sub-Saharan Africa for 31 years, caring for thousands of young people suffering from AIDS, was approached by USAID in Uganda and asked to draw up a program to prevent HIV/AIDS. Her group presented a project proposal which involved AIDS awareness and behavior change programs. In the project proposal, the emphasis was on abstinence and faithfulness as a way of preventing the spread of HIV and was for people of all faiths. USAID, however, responded by asking them to put in a component of promoting and distributing condoms. When this organization said they were not prepared to do so because of a religious objection, they were denied funding.  This is one of many stories. And the ones who are harmed when this kind of action takes place are those who are suffering the most and are at greatest risk and need services. This provision would not require, I would say to my colleagues, a change in the overall strategy to fight HIV/AIDS. The overall strategy would stay the same even if certain groups only worked on parts of that strategy where they are qualified and successful.  Let me say, finally, the Catholic Church, today, cares for one out of every four AIDS patients. One out of every four. If the bill remains unclear, this could potentially prohibit, could proscribe the funding of many of the initiatives of the Church, and I said earlier Muslim groups or Catholic Relief Services, which today cares for about 2 million people who are at risk or perhaps have been affected by AIDS, mostly in Africa but around the world as well. Two million by one Catholic agency alone  We want inclusion. We want more people involved. I ask that this amendment be approved. This conscience protection is real and it would be impossible for anyone, at anytime to misconstrue Congressional intent.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
