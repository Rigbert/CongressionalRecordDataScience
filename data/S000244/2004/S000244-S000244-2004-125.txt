Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I regret that I must offer this amendment to S. 878, but its passage will avoid a problem highlighted by the Congressional Budget Office and its cost estimate for the bill.  Budget rules require us to stay within a 1-year and 5-year budget authority score for direct spending. The bill as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary comports with the 1-year spending threshold imposed by the budget rule. Unfortunately, however, the 5-year score exceeds the corresponding threshold by roughly $5.5 million.  To cure this defect, I was faced with choosing either deleting meritorious circuit and district judgeships from the bill or retaining all of the judgeships while staggering their implementation over a longer period of time. I have chosen the latter option as the better of the two, and this amendment reflects that.  While some judicial districts will have to wait longer for additional judges under this plan, at least those judges will have been authorized for the relatively near future.                              {time}  1145  Assuming S. 878 is enacted, it will also be possible for a future Congress, perhaps the 109th, to provide the additional funding necessary to change the statute and accelerate the implementation dates for those judgeships that cannot be created prior to fiscal year 2005.  That said, my amendment would implement 11 circuit judgeships and convert the four temporary district judgeships to permanent seats in fiscal year 2005. Existing temporary seats do not score at all, and the related costs of the 11 circuit judgeships easily comply with the first-year threshold requirement.  For the next 5 fiscal years, through fiscal year 2010, the figure staggers the implementation of the remaining district judgeships at the rate of eight per year. In other words, eight new district judgeships are added in fiscal 2006, eight more in fiscal 2007, and so on through 2010. In the last year, fiscal year 2011, the remaining seven district judgeships are officially authorized.  I am sure that each of us could develop a different priority list detailing which judgeships would be implemented in a given fiscal year. I have tried to be fair by arranging the list based on need as defined by the Judicial Conference criteria.  We have received an informal assurance from CBO that this amendment will lower the 5-year budget authority estimate for direct spending below the $34.5 million requirement imposed on the Committee on the Judiciary. My staff has also worked closely with the Committee on the Budget on this matter, and I understand this amendment will satisfy their concerns. I appreciate their contributions to this effort.  In conclusion, I urge the Members to adopt this amendment, a necessary change that will bring us closer to authorizing the first omnibus judgeship bill since 1990.
