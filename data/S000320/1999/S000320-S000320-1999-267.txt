 President, today I am introducing a bill to impose a moratorium on the foreign visitors program at the Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear laboratories. The bill prohibits the Secretary of Energy from admitting any person from a ``sensitive country'' to our national laboratories, unless the Secretary of Energy personally certifies to the Congress that the visit is necessary for the national security of the United States.  A ``sensitive country'' is a country that is considered dangerous to the United States and that may want to acquire our nuclear weapons secrets.  Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly ten years. Beginning in 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding and personnel dedicated to protecting our nation's nuclear secrets. Year after year, the Committee has provided additional funds and directed many reviews and studies in an effort to persuade the Department of Energy to take action. Unfortunately, this and prior administrations failed to heed our warnings. Consequently, a serious espionage threat at our national labs has gone virtually unabated and it appears that our nuclear weapons program may have suffered extremely grave damage.  Now, the administration has finally begun to take affirmative steps to address this problem. While I welcome their efforts, I am disappointed that it took a some bad press to motivate them rather than a known threat to our national security. Nevertheless, the Department of Energy has begun the process of repairing the damage caused by years of neglect, but it will take time to make the necessary changes. In fact, it may take years.  In the interim, we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our national labs. I understand that a moratorium on the foreign visitors program may be perceived as a draconian measure. Until the Department fully implements a comprehensive and sustained counterintelligence program, however, I believe that we must err on the side of caution. The stakes are too high.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 887       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Energy      Sensitive Country Foreign Visitors Moratorium Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. MORATORIUM ON FOREIGN VISITORS PROGRAM.       (a) Moratorium.--The Secretary of Energy may not admit to      any facility of a national laboratory any individual who is a      citizen of a nation that is named on the current Department      of Energy sensitive countries list.       (b) Waiver Authority.--(1) The Secretary of Energy may      waive the prohibition in subsection (a) on a case-by-case      basis with respect to specific individuals whose admission to      a national laboratory is determined by the Secretary to be      necessary for the national security of the United States.       (2) Before any such waiver takes effect, the Secretary      shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services and the      Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the      Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Select      Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives a      report in writing providing notice of the proposed waiver.      The report shall identify each individual for whom such a      waiver is proposed and, with respect to each such individual,      provide a detailed justification for the waiver and the      Secretary's certification that the admission of that      individual to a national laboratory is necessary for the      national security of the United States.       (3)(A) A waiver under paragraph (1) may not take effect      until a period of 10 days of continuous session of Congress      has expired after the date of the submission of the report      under paragraph (2) providing notice of that waiver.       (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)--       (i) the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only      by an adjournment of the Congress sine die; and       (ii) there shall be excluded from the computation of the      10-day period specified in that subparagraph Saturdays,      Sundays, legal public holidays, and any day on which either      House of Congress in not in session because of adjournment of      more than three days to a day certain.       (4) The authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1) may      not be delegated.     SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL FOREIGN VISITORS TO NATIONAL                    LABORATORIES.       Before an individual who is a citizen of a foreign nation      is allowed to enter a national laboratory, the Secretary of      Energy shall require that a security clearance investigation      (known as a ``background check'') be carried out on that      individual.
