Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mrs. Michaeleen Earle Crowell on her recent promotion from legislative director to chief of staff to Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). It is a well-deserved honor.  For eight years, Michaeleen served as my legislative director, managed my legislative staff, and strategized successful initiatives like health care reform, the Voting Rights Act reauthorization, and the crafting of the Voter Empowerment Act. When Michaeleen joined my staff in 2005, she brought balance, leadership, and practical experience to our Ways and Means Committee health care and Oversight Subcommittee work.  A native of Lowell, Massachusetts, Michaeleen is a seasoned policy expert and strategist. She grew up in a family engrained in progressive politics, and Capitol Hill was a natural fit. Nearly 20 years ago, she began her congressional career as a research assistant on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources to my good friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.  Michaeleen went on to earn undergraduate and law degrees from Boston University. She then gained first-hand experience with health care law in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, before moving to Atlanta to practice health care, business, and civil law. She also returned to her public service roots--providing counsel during the transition and inauguration of Mayor Shirley Franklin and serving as legislative director and counsel for the newly-elected Congresswoman Denise Majette (D-GA) who served the congressional district which neighbors the one I represent.  Although we miss Michaeleen and her beautiful family--her husband James and children Jac and Ellie--I wish them continued success and happiness, and I congratulate her from the bottom of my heart on her recent promotion.                          ____________________
