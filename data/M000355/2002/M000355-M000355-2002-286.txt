 President, I am certainly pleased to hear the chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, indicate that he is willing to accept the amendment.  I congratulate the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from New Hampshire. When this amendment was offered last year, there was a significant effort to derail it. I think that as a result of the hard work of the Senator from Colorado--I see the Senator from Kansas who is deeply interested in this issue is in the Chamber. They were all chagrined, as I recall, that it was lost in conference on the DOD authorization bill. I think as a result of their perseverance and coming back here today and pressing forward, it seems as if we are on the verge of having it accepted.  I think it is a tribute to the Senators from Colorado, Kansas, and New Hampshire. I thank all three of them.  I see the Senator from Kansas. He might want to address this issue before we wrap it up.
