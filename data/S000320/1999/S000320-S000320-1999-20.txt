 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jimmy E. Alexander, a prominent and respected lawyer from Athens, Limestone County, in northern Alabama. Mr. Alexander passed away last month after a long and distinguished career in law practice. His deep passion for his work took him on a journey from the smallest courtrooms in Alabama, to the great and hallowed halls of the U.S. Supreme Court. His dedication and heartfelt concern for the ``little guy'' was an inspiration. Jimmy will be missed by the many people whose lives he touched and affected.  Jimmy was born in Bear Creek, in Marion County, in 1939. After graduation from Russellville High School in 1957, Jimmy went on to continue his education at the University of Alabama, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1960, and his law degree in 1963. Jimmy's innate industriousness and work ethic were tailor-made for his chosen profession. Jimmy quickly developed a reputation as an outstanding criminal defense attorney and successful domestic relations lawyer. Joining the firm of Malone, Malone and Steel directly out of law school, he soon was made partner and ultimately became senior partner of the firm Alexander, Corder, Plunk, Baker, Shelly, and Shipman P.C., in Athens, AL. Jimmy was the city attorney for Athens and Ardmore for 17 years. He served on the city Board of Education for 5 years and was the Alabama Bar Association Commissioner for the 39th judicial circuit for 4 years.  It was through these professional forums that Jimmy was able to thrive in his work and gain a statewide reputation as a standout trial attorney. In private practice for 36 years, Jimmy has counseled businesses, commercial clients, and recently, had taken a strong interest in championing the cause of the ``little guy.'' Particularly for the last 15 years, he focused on representing the poor, under represented, physically injured, and financially cheated, many of whom had no where else to turn than Jimmy Alexander. Jimmy developed a particular fondness for taking on big business, insurance companies, and large industry. He represented many high profile cases, and in 1989, won the largest monetary judgment at the time in Limestone County and in another case, setting a precedent for the largest monetary judgement in the entire State of Alabama. His gifted ability even took him before the U.S. Supreme Court, where he argued a case against an insurance company.  Jimmy Alexander will be remembered as a dedicated attorney, who brought human compassion to his work. Many of his colleagues have expressed their respect and admiration for his approach to both his work and his life, and I join them in their prayers for him and his family. My thoughts and wishes extend to his wife Rose, and two children, Tonya and Eric, during this difficult time. Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
