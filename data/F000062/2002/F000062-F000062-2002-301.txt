  If American agriculture is to remain competitive, we must ensure that our farmers are given the same support that their foreign competitors receive.  Heavily subsidized foreign citrus entering the U.S. has quadrupled over the last five years, significantly lowering prices domestically for California growers. In the European Union alone, government subsidization of the fresh produce sector reaches upwards of $15 billion each year.  The Market Access Program provides new jobs--jobs for longshoremen, jobs in processing, jobs in transportation, and of course, jobs for growers.  The Market Access Program is an important tool in expanding markets for U.S. agricultural products.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that each dollar spent on the Market Access Program results in an increase in agricultural exports of between $2 and $7.  Small farmers especially benefit from this program because they would not be able to break into these foreign markets on their own.  The Market Access Program helps create and protect U.S. jobs, combat inequitable trade practices, improve the U.S. balance of trade, and improve farm income.  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this issue. I look forward to continuing our work together on increasing funding for this valuable program. To the distinguished Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, thank you for your continued help and support.
