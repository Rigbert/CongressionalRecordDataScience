 President, improving the campaign finance system is an important priority. Without a doubt constructive criticism works to help cleanse the system. More importantly, good debate helps reduce public cynicism. That is why I would like to commend my colleagues for the good discussions we have had in the past 2 weeks.  My goals for campaign finance reform have long included improved citizen participation, enhanced public discourse, full public disclosure and safeguarding the right of Americans to organize and petition their government. To accomplish these objectives, I want reform to give individuals a bigger role in the political process, increase up-front participation of political parties, protect corporate shareholders and union members from being forced to bankroll candidates they oppose, discourage misconduct by political campaigns with swift and sure punishment, and require full public disclosure of contribution sources.
