Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3929, the Dana Point Desalination Project Authorization Act. My legislation will authorize Federal participation in a relatively small ocean desalination project that could have an enormous impact on the future development of desalination projects.  As our country continues to look for new sources of water, particularly in the West, the expansion of our desalinated ocean water capability is essential. While extensively utilized in other parts of the world, most notably in the Middle East, the U.S. has only recently begun to consider large-scale ocean water desalination projects. There are a number of factors that have limited the viability of desalination projects. The major issues confronting ocean desalination are the cost of producing potable water and the potential negative impacts on ocean ecosystems.  The Dana Point Desalination Project is not a typical ocean desalination project. The project will use a unique subsurface ocean intake system that will collect water that naturally seeps through the ocean floor. The system provides a number of benefits over traditional intake systems, including removing the negative impacts on marine life as well as potentially reducing the need for extensive pretreatment filtration. If constructed and successful, the system would remove various concerns expressed by environmental advocates as well as improve the feasibility of future ocean desalination projects.  The Dana Point Desalination Project, to the best of my knowledge, is the only ocean desalination project supported by the Surfrider Foundation. Their support is a direct result of the unique subsurface intake technology that avoids negative impacts to the marine ecosystem. I would like to submit a letter form the Surfrider Foundation detailing their support for the Dana Point project for the record.  The Dana Point Desalination Project could have significant regional and national benefits. H.R. 3929 simply authorizes Federal participation in the project and limits the Federal obligation to $2.5 million to assist with preliminary engineering and environmental studies. No construction dollars are authorized in H.R. 3929.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Dana Point Desalination Project and passing H.R. 3929.                                         Surfrider Foundation,                                                 January 10, 2006.     Re Support for MWDOC Beach Well Feasibility Study.       To Whom it May Concern: I am writing on behalf of the      Surfrider Foundation in support of efforts by the Municipal      Water District of Orange County (MWDOC) to investigate the      feasibility of sub-surface beach wells to supply seawater for      ocean desalination.       The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit environmental      organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the      world's oceans, waves and beaches for all people, through      conservation, activism, research and education.       In general, Surfrider Foundation believes that future      demands for water supplies should first be met by fully      utilizing water conservation, wastewater reclamation, and      stormwater management that will capture runoff for beneficial      uses. We feel very strongly that these supply alternatives      combine the benefit of meeting our future water needs while      simultaneously reducing polluted runoff and ocean discharges.      Ocean desalination should be the lowest priority for water      supply choices and only employed using the most      environmentally protective methods and technology.       We are pleased to see this approach to water supply      alternatives reflected in MWDOC's 2005 Urban Water Management      Plan. Furthermore, we are very supportive of the measured      approach MWDOC is taking toward filling a limited role for      ocean desalination in their water supply portfolio. Sub-     surface ``feedwater'' intakes for desalination will avoid the      unnecessary destruction of marine life, and disruption of      healthy marine ecosystems, that accompanies open ocean      intakes.       We look forward to the results of the sub-surface beach      well feasibility study MWDOC is proposing in Dana Point.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Geever,                             Southern California Regional Manager.
