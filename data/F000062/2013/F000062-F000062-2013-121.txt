 I have that answer. It is dated March 7. It is a letter from the Attorney General Eric Holder. It is to Senator Rand Paul. This is what it says:  It has come to my attention that you have asked an additional question. ``Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?''       The answer to that question is no.  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         The Attorney General,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2013.     Hon. Rand Paul,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Paul: It has come to my attention that you      have now asked an additional question: ``Does the President      have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an      American not engaged in combat on American soil?'' The answer      to that question is no.           Sincerely,                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.
