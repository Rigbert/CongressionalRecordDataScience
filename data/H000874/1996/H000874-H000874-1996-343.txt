Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in recognition and celebration of the outstanding contributions of women to the history of this Nation and to society as a whole. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this special order and to add my voice to the chorus of praise for those women who have contributed so much.  In primary and secondary schools across the country, young women and young girls are being exposed to the accomplishments of notable women of history. While they can appreciate the heroism and the ingenuity of these women, they may not yet fully understand that many of these accomplishments came at great individual sacrifice, were not fully appreciated at the time they occurred, and were often the result of long struggles to gain the opportunity to excel at their chosen pursuit.  Women's History Month also provides an important lesson to our young men and young boys in those same classes. They learn to recognize that their classmates, their sisters, their mothers, and all women have dreams similar to their own of careers and contributions. These boys can then better appreciate that women are equally valuable and equally capable of leading society in the next breakthrough in whatever field one chooses to pursue.  At the same time, we adults are reminded that while great progress has been made, particularly within our lifetimes, sufficient progress remains illusive. Too often our wives, daughters, and friends share with us the frustrations of obstacles to their careers rarely faced by males. These challenges come in the form of harassment, doubting of ability, and unfair choices placed on women concerning family objectives as opposed to career objectives that are not similarly placed upon men.  The children in our classrooms today need to enter a work force that is free of harassment, free of bias, and full of respect, full of opportunity and full of challenge. As our children enter and succeed in the workplace they need to look back at the contributions of the women who broke ground in their particular field. In so doing, they will appreciate not only the contributions of these women but also the barriers that have been removed to women as a result of their persistence.  There are no career fields in which we, as a Nation, can afford to restrict the contributions of talented, motivated workers. Our society cannot afford the disruptions caused by the lack of respect shown towards successful women in the work place.  Similarly, our society can not afford to minimize the contribution of women who choose to interrupt, delay, or forego their careers in order to tend to the needs of their families. Whether single or married, women today bear a disproportional share of the work involved in keeping our families strong and on a positive track. The struggles of mothers today, who seek to raise their children in a safe and moral environment, are unlikely to be the subject of the history lessons but are of historic proportions.  As we consider and honor the notable figures of the distant and recent past, we should also go home today and honor the historical women of the future and encourage their pursuits.                          ____________________
