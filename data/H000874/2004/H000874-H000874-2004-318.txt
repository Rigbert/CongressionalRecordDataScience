Speaker, this week the American people will see that what our Republican friends lack in policy candor they more than make up for in chutzpah. Why do I say that? This week, as we have just heard, the Republican majority is expected to take up legislation that would permanently eliminate the marriage penalty. Everybody on this House floor is for that objective.  But do not be fooled. Democrats and Republicans both agree that married couples should not have to pay more in taxes than they would as unmarried individuals filing separately. That makes sense. That is fair. We are for it. Members in both parties agree that the so-called marriage penalty should be remedied.  However, here is the crucial difference between the Republican bill and our Democratic substitute. Our bill is paid for, theirs is not. What is the difference? The difference is that the penalty that we are eliminating in terms of marriages will be passed along to every young family in America, every young person in America. All of my children and my grandchildren will pay an additional penalty in the interest they will have to pay because of the irresponsible policies being pursued by the majority.  That is right. With a record budget deficit this year of more than half a trillion dollars, and with a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion inherited by this administration turned into a projected deficit of more than $4 trillion, an almost $10 trillion turnaround to the negative, our friends on the Republican side of the aisle plan to drive us even deeper into debt.  The chairman of the House Committee on the Budget, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), perhaps summed up the Republican fiscal policy best on March 17 when he said, and I am quoting, ``We don't believe that you should have to pay for tax cuts, period.'' Well, Mr. Nussle and my Republican friends, of course you do not; but our children and grandchildren will have to pay that bill. Somebody, sometime, sometime in the future will have to pay the piper.  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this Republican marriage penalty bill will cost $96 billion over the next 10 years. None of it is paid for. And to make matters worse, House Republicans intend to bring up bills in the next 3 weeks to make the 10 percent tax bracket and child tax credit permanent. We are for that. It ought to be paid for. And to temporarily fix the alternative minimum tax. We are for that. It ought to be paid for.  Again, Democrats support such legislation, but it must be paid for so that we do not simply say to our children,``You pay for it''; to our grandchildren, ``you pay for it, we don't want to.''  Democrats believe it is a serious failure to pay for these tax cuts, which not only threatens our economic future as these deficits grow and the American people become more concerned about rising interest rates, as Alan Greenspan last week said was a definite possibility, but we also have a responsibility.  We talk a lot about personal responsibility. We passed a bankruptcy bill, and we made it tougher for people to go into bankruptcy because we said they needed to be responsible. I voted for that bill. It was a bipartisanly supported bill. We need to be responsible on behalf of the public that sent us here and on behalf of future generations.  Meanwhile, as we debate this tax bill, Republicans on both sides of Capitol Hill are riven by internal conflict. They still have not produced a budget conference report for fiscal 2005 because of the intransigence of House Republicans to accept pay-as-you-go rules. That sounds very common sense. You pay as you go. You pay your bills. We talk about every American family having to do that. That may be the case; but we do not have to do it, and we are not doing it.  Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said applying pay-as-you-go to both expenditures and revenues is essential if we are to have fiscal responsibility. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle sent us a budget which says we are going to do that; but on this side of the Congress we have overwhelming, almost unanimous, support, if not unanimous support, for that proposition. It was in place from 1990 to 2002. But it was changed. Why? Because it would make us be responsible, and being responsible would not allow us to do some of the things the Republican majority wants to do.  Here is what the Bipartisan Concord Coalition said, headed up by, among others, Senator Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire, and three other budget watchdog groups have said about such pay-as-you-go rules: ``If Congress wants to pass particular tax cuts, it should either reduce mandatory programs or raise other revenues to offset the tax reduction measures, not simply give itself a free pass to enact tax cuts without financing them.''  It feels good for us to say, Hah-hah, we have cut your taxes. Hooray. But unless we cut spending at the same time, which is what pay-as-you-go says we need to do, then do not pass that debt along to future generations. That is all it says. Every responsible American with common sense would say, yes, that is what we ought to do.  They have turned the foreign sales corporation bill, another bill which requires that some $5 billion in export subsidies be repealed and replaced by modest tax breaks, into a $170 billion special-interest giveaway.                              {time}  1245  Not only are we creating greater tax liability by passing these tax bills without paying for them, we want to see them pass, we want to pay for them, but now they are talking about this Foreign Service Corporation bill which could cost us and we could fix for less than $10 billion, now they want to make it into a $170 billion tax giveaway. One business lobbyist even told the Washington Post that this bill ``has risen to new levels of sleaze.''  Is it any wonder pursuing those kinds of policies that we have now gone into a $10 trillion turnaround in terms of from black to red? We talk about blue States and red States. We have gone from black, having surpluses, $5.6 trillion, four surpluses in a row from 1997 to 2001, the first time that had happened in 80 years. In just months, that was turned into escalating deficits.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to come to their senses, to do what makes sense to the American families, to the American public. No married couple wants to have a marriage penalty but I do not think there is any married couple who wants to have their children saddled with the escalating debts incurred in their generation and passed to future generations.  For years, House Republicans preened as deficit hawks. Some even suggested that tax cuts are not, in fact, sacrosanct. My friend the majority leader spoke a little earlier. In 1997, the majority leader, Mr. DeLay, who just spoke, said of Jack Kemp, another Republican who ran for Vice President, a former Member of this body, an ardent proponent of supply-side tax cuts: ``Jack Kemp worships at the altar of tax cuts. Jack has always said that deficits don't matter. We think that deficits do matter.'' So said Tom DeLay with reference to Jack Kemp. If they matter, Mr. Leader, why are we not addressing them? Why do we make them worse? Why are we escalating the debt that our children will be confronted with?  With this vote on the marriage penalty relief this week, we will see whether Republicans still believe that deficits matter.                          ____________________
