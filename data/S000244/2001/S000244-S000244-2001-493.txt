Speaker, it is with sadness that I note the death of a former colleague and a great New Yorker, Mr. Gerald Solomon, who passed away last month.  Jerry grew up in Delmar, New York and attended Siena College and St. Lawrence University before enlisting in the Marines at the onset of the Korean War. After serving his country with honor as a member of the Armed Forces, Jerry continued working for the nation as a Member of Congress. But even as an elected representative, when you spoke with Jerry, you could easily guess his background. Like the motto says, ``once a Marine, always a Marine.''  First elected in 1978, Jerry and I were in the same freshman class of Congress as I too was elected that year. I got to know, and become very good friends with Jerry during the 20 years we served in the House together. He was perhaps the most ardent supporter of our nation's veterans. As the Ranking Member onthe House Veterans Affairs Committee, Jerry worked tirelessly on their behalf. In fact, it was largely through his work and dedication that the Veterans Administration was elevated to a cabinet-level department.  Jerry was a man who didn't mince words--he was fair and principled and called things as he saw them. We got along well because we were similar in many ways and agreed on a lot of things. But, sometimes, we disagreed. I never, for example, quite saw the merits of the Northeast Dairy Compact the way he did--but even when we disagreed, we disagreed like gentlemen.  It is a testament to his character as a legislator, and a reflection of his leadership, that during his final years in the House, he served as Chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. This is particularly noteworthy because as many of you know, he was the first Republican to have that position in four decades!  When Jerry spoke, people listened. Not because he was Chairman of the Rules Committee, but simply because if he took the time to tell you something, you could bet it was worth your while to pay attention to him.  It is with a heavy heart that I say good-bye to my friend Jerry. My wife Cheryl and I would like to express our condolences to Jerry's wife Freda, their five children, six grandchildren, and brother, in this time of sorrow and sadness. They will be in our prayers.                          ____________________
