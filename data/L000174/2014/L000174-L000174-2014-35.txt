President, one of Vermont's longest-serving journalists, Sam Hemingway, recently retired after a distinguished 37-year career with the Burlington Free Press. His career at the paper spans a period of our State's history filled with interesting stories, and Sam covered so many of them.  During the course of those many years Sam captured the pulse of Vermont, whether through his personalized columns or his probing reports. Sam's institutional memory was a rich and vital resource for the newspaper and for his readers. His writing talents, his reporting skills and his ability to make personal connections will be sorely missed.  Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in extending all best wishes to Sam and his family as they begin a new chapter in their lives.  I ask that this Burlington Free Press article sketching Sam's tenure and retirement plans be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 7, 2014]                   Hemingway To Retire After 37 Years              (By Adam Silverman, Free Press Staff Writer)       Sam Hemingway, a reporter, editor and columnist who is      among Vermont's most well-known journalists, will retire from      the Burlington Free Press after a career of more than 37      years.       ``You don't know how much this place means to me,'' he told      the staff in announcing his departure Tuesday afternoon,      ``and I will miss you, and I will miss this work, so much.''       A self-described ``generalist,'' Hemingway's award-winning      coverage stretched from the rejection of a controversial      shopping mall development in Williston in 1977, through the      illegal shipping of arms from a Vermont business to South      Africa in violation of the apartheid-era embargo, to a weeks-     long trip to embed with the Vermont National Guard in      Afghanistan in 2010, among numerous examples across portions      of five decades.       ``There's a great thrill, if you're into journalism, if      it's in your blood, to be present in moments of great      importance and to write stories that actually make a      difference,'' Hemingway said Tuesday in an interview before      addressing his colleagues.       ``When you work for a paper like this, in a state like      Vermont, if you do a story and do it well, with the idea that      this is going to turn the rock over and show something that      people need to know about, there will be results,'' he      continued. ``You can help make something happen. That's a      great feeling.''       Free Press Executive Editor Michael Townsend praised      Hemingway as a colleague and a journalist.       ``With his breadth of experience, Sam knew where to find      the information,'' Townsend said. ``He had a great eye for a      hard news story. He was dependable, productive and engaged.      We will miss his unique style.''       Hemingway, 66, wanted to be a newspaper reporter since      boyhood in New Haven, Conn. With the help of a ditto machine,      he produced a newspaper for his neighborhood. Coverage      included missing dogs, families' vacations plans and who      might have been suffering from the measles.       He edited his high-school newspaper and then studied      journalism at Syracuse University in New York before moving      to Vermont in 1971. He helped start the Lamoille County      Weekly in Johnson, spent a year teaching journalism at      Johnson State College, and then began freelancing for the      Burlington Free Press.       He joined the staff in 1977, when he was assigned to      provide full-time coverage of the debate over the Pyramid      Mall proposal percolating in Williston. Hemingway attended 54      night meetings regarding the Act 250 development-control law      over two years before the project was rejected.       Then came the story Space Research Corp., a North Troy      weapons manufacturer that was breaking an international      embargo to sell millions of dollars of artillery and shells      to South Africa--possibly with the backing of the CIA.      Hemingway recalled sneaking onto the military base at Camp      Lejune, N.C., with a colleague and knocking on the door of a      suspected CIA agent said to be involved--and then departing      in a hurry when the agent called base security. Eventually,      two company officials were convicted of related crimes.       As with his more recent coverage, including of teen girls      from the Burlington area lured into working as prostitutes in      New York, of the priest sex abuse claims against the Roman      Catholic Church, of the heroin epidemic sweeping Vermont,      Hemingway's reporting exposed a rarely seen underbelly of      Vermont.       ``If you didn't shine a light on it, the cases might or      might not have reached a point where people went to jail,''      Hemingway said. ``But there's more assurance that justice is      going to be meted out.''       Hemingway is perhaps best known for his column, which he      wrote from 1989 to 2005 (with a yearlong hiatus to cover the      presidential campaign of former Gov. Howard Dean).       ``It was wonderful to have a voice,'' Hemingway said. ``The      great thing about that column was it wasn't just a political      column, it wasn't just a crime column, it wasn't a slice of      life, it wasn't a feature--it was all of those things. And it      would change. Sometimes it was first-person. Sometimes it was      personal. Sometimes it was investigative. I broke stories in      the column. And it was very well-read.''       The column aimed to give a voice to the powerless,      Hemingway said.       ``It was average folks,'' he said, ``and that was the whole      point of the column: to be an outlet for people who weren't      newsmakers who maybe had trouble with government or a problem      or a personal issue, somebody who lost a kid in a traffic      accident.''       Hemingway's work earned him 11 Best of Gannett awards from      the Burlington Free Press' parent company, along with      citations for excellence from the New England Newspaper and      Press Association, the Vermont Press Association and others.       The time is right to step away, Hemingway said. He has been      thinking of stepping away for some time, and he's ready for a      change. He plans to write, travel and spend time with family:      his wife, Lee, his four adult children and his two      grandchildren--and a third on the way.       His announcement came as the Burlington Free Press shared      plans for a newsroom reorganization, a process other Gannett      properties also are undergoing. Hemingway said his departure      is unrelated.       ``It's very hard to walk away from this,'' Hemingway said.      ``I need to go. It's time for me to go.''       He has yet to decide on the timing of his last day.       ``I'll miss my colleagues in the newsroom,'' he said.      ``I'll miss the camaraderie of the journalism community at      large in Vermont, which, even though we sometimes compete, we      all for the most part respect each other.''       Hemingway ended with advice for his colleagues:       ``Don't just do the stories that you have to do. Try to      keep looking for the stories that need to be done. . . . You      have to push the limits, go after stories that are out there      but aren't waiting to be written, that you've got to go and      dig out.''       ``That's what I've tried to do.''                          ____________________
