 I find the President guilty, as charged, of high crimes and misdemeanors: lying under oath and obstructing justice. The President engaged in a deliberate and selfish pattern of conduct designed to thwart the civil rights of a fellow citizen. This conduct represents a serious breach of faith and trust. This conduct is incompatible with the solemn duties and moral responsibilities of the high office of President of the United States.  Similar conduct by others results in consequences: perjurers, witness tamperers and obstructors of justice go to jail; supervisors lose their jobs; military officers are court-martialed, imprisoned or forced out of the armed forces; judges are impeached and removed from office. Shall we embrace a lower standard for this President under these circumstances? I think not. I believe that the President of the United States should be held to the very highest of standards.  I believe that conviction and removal from office is justified in order (1) to preserve the integrity, honor and trust of the presidency; (2) to protect the sanctity of the witness oath in judicial proceedings; and (3) to uphold the fundamental principle of ``equal justice under law.''                              introduction  In accord with my sworn oath to do ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws,'' I have approached the trial of William Jefferson Clinton as a solemn constitutional duty. Voting on the Articles of Impeachment may be the most historically significant thing I will do in my entire career in public service. I have taken this obligation seriously, without concern for public opinion polls or for any partisan political advantage of consequence. This is a moment when one must put the longer-term interests of the country first.                          previous jury trial  As a political opponent of this President, I have made an extra effort to weigh the evidence and the arguments on both sides with a sense of detachment and fairness. Having served on a jury in a criminal trial some 24 years ago, I learned how important it is to listen and to exercise impartial judgment. During jury selection in a local murder trial, I found myself assigned to a murder case about which I had expressed a definite opinion. From press reports, I was already convinced the defendant was guilty. With that and since I was the author of the capital punishment bill in the legislature, I thought for sure they would never qualify me for the jury, but somehow they did. Five days later, I surprised even myself when I became the foreman of the jury that acquitted that very defendant.  I have approached the trial of the President with that experience in mind. I have also considered whether in good conscience, I would apply the same judgment I made here equally to a similar set of facts and circumstances if they applied to a Republican--and not a Democratic--president.  In 1990, I did not hesitate to publicly condemn a Republican President, George Bush, when he violated his ``read my lips'' campaign pledge. Politicians who deliberately violate public trust undermine good government and increase the level of cynicism in society.  Today, I have a clear conscience in rendering the judgment I believe is just, and in the best interests of the future of the country.                              conclusions  I have concluded that the President engaged in a deliberate and premeditated pattern of conduct which was corruptly designed to undermine the rights of a fellow citizen. That citizen was entitled under the law to obtain truth and justice in a duly constituted legal proceeding.  The President had a legal obligation, as a citizen, to comply with ordinary and proper legal procedure and to faithfully abide by the standard oath to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.''  I believe the President also had a moral obligation, as President, to refrain from engaging in any conduct which would, by example, undermine respect for the rule of law, the witness oath, or the dignity, honor, or public trust embodied in the presidency.  The President failed to fulfill these obligations. He lied under oath, obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses. He sought to undermine the judicial system for his own personal gain. In so doing, he set a perverse example for every school child, parent, teacher, employer, supervisor and citizen in America. He brought dishonor upon himself and his office.             president's supporters concede essential facts  White House lawyers went to great lengths to try to deny the specific charges, but common sense and the weight of the evidence leave no reasonable doubt in my mind that the charges are true. I believe there are few, if any, members of the Senate who do not believe the President lied under oath and obstructed justice. Even many of the President's most ardent supporters in and out of the Senate have openly stated their belief that the essential facts of the case are not in dispute.  Senator Robert Byrd pretty well summed it up in a recent TV appearance. He said of the President: ``I have no doubt that he has given false testimony under oath and . . . there are indications that he did indeed obstruct justice . . . It undermined the system of justice when he gave false testimony under oath. He lied under oath.''                         non-lawyer perspective  I have often said that one of the qualifications I have for the U.S. Senate is that I am not an attorney. So, when I read the Constitution, I know what it says. When I read the law, I know what it says. When I look at the evidence and apply common sense from a non-lawyer perspective, I know what it says. In this case, it says--without question--the President is guilty as charged.                        conduct warrants removal  The President's attorneys kept arguing that the President's conduct doesnot amount to the technical crimes of perjury or obstruction of justice, but that even if it does, it should not warrant his removal from office.  I have concluded the President's conduct does amount to the crimes of perjury and obstruction, but that even if it does not, it still warrants his removal from office because it is unacceptable behavior, incompatible with his duties and responsibilities as President.                            lying under oath  I was not persuaded by the hairsplitting argument that the President did not lie under oath. The President lawyers claim he did not lie or commit perjury before the grand jury and they imply that his conduct there should be deemed acceptable. As a non-lawyer, I find their arguments preposterous and an insult to the intelligence and moral sensibilities of the members of the Senate of both parties, not to mention the American people.  The President was afforded every opportunity to treat the grand jury with the respect it deserved. He was not blind-sided, tricked or trapped. He could anticipate all the key questions in advance. he had plenty of time to prepare. He was warned on numerous occasion by members of both parties in the Congress of the serious consequences of untruthful testimony. Yet he deliberately sought to continue weaving a self-serving and misleading web of deception and falsehood.                          obstructing justice  Similarly, I reject the argument that the President did not commit obstruction of justice in an improper and illegal effort to undermine the legitimate search for truth in the Paula Jones civil suit. To believe the President's defense is to stand common sense on its head.  Does anyone seriously believe the Lewinski job search would have proceeded to a successful conclusion in early January 1998--a critical moment in the Jones case--had her name not appeared on the Jones case witness list?  Does anyone seriously believe the President was suggesting to Ms. Lewinski that she file a truthful affidavit?  Does anyone seriously believe that the decision to conceal the gifts (evidence) was not blessed and ordered by the President?  Does anyone seriously believe the President was seeking to ``refresh his memory'' while planting false stories with Ms. Currie when his conversations took place after he had testified that the Jones lawyers should talk to Ms. Currie.  Does anyone seriously believe the President did not want and expect Mr. Blumenthal and other aides to repeat false stories to the grand jury?  I do not believe any of these things. I believe--and I suspect most Senators believe--the President is guilty as charged of obstruction of justice.                  the president knew what he was doing  The President's efforts to cover up his relationship with Ms. Lewinski, however understandable in a non-legal context, became textbook examples of obstruction of justice once her name appeared on a witness list and in a duly constituted legal proceeding.  The President, after all, is himself a lawyer. He was well aware that--orchestrating a job search to silence a potential hostile witness, suggesting the filing of a false affidavit, concealing relevant evidence, and coaching potential witnesses to give false testimony--all are improper and illegal.  Yet he chose to take these actions, not in some contorted belief that they were proper, but in the calculation that if successful, he could thwart the legal search for truth and justice in the Jones case.  To accept this behavior by the President without Constitutional consequence is to permit the setting of a precedent which will reverberate negatively for years throughout our legal justice system and beyond.             different standards for judges and presidents?  I am amazed that there is any debate whatsoever over whether lying under oath before a grand jury is an impeachable offense. The precedent is clear: Judge Walter Nixon and others have been rightly convicted and removed from office for lying under oath. Is there to be a different standard for a president, or for this particular president, or for this particular set of circumstances? Are we to make exceptions for lying under oath so long as it is lying about some things but not others? If so, what precedent will that set?  Our legal system depends of the sanctity of the witness oath. There can be no exceptions to the obligation every citizen incurs when he solemnly swears ``to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.'' Setting any other precedent would totally disrupt our system of jurisprudence by breeding disrespect for the rule of law.  The White House lawyers argued that since the President is elected and judges are appointed, a different standard should apply. The only conceivable way they might be right is if the President is held to a higher--not a lower--standard.  Important as each of a thousand judges is to our legal system, it is the President alone who stands at the pinnacle of our system of law and justice. He alone is constitutionally charged to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' He appointed the judges. He embodies the public trust to a degree far and above anyone else. He sets the example for the entire nation. His public conduct in abiding by the oath must be above reproach.                     young bill clinton's standard  In speaking about President Richard Nixon in 1974, a young Arkansas congressional candidate spoke to the need for high standards:  ``Yes, the President should resign. He has lied to the American people, time and time again, and betrayed their trust. Since he has admitted guilt, there is no reason to put the American people through an impeachment. He will serve absolutely no purpose in finishing out his term; the only possible solution is for the president to save some dignity and resign.''  The Candidate, Bill Clinton, set his own perfectly understandable standard:  ``If a President of the United States ever lied to the American people, he should resign.'' Arkansas, Democrat Gazette (8/6/74)                   what kind of lying is impeachable?  Recently, one of my Democrat colleagues, in a television interview, explained his standard for perjury as an impeachable offense: ``Perjury could be an impeachable offense,'' he said. ``If he lied about the national security interest of the United States, or if he did something else that had serious consequence for the country, or performing improperly in his official capacity, that's impeachable.'' But if he's ``not acting in his official capacity'' and only ``as an individual,'' that's different. That's not impeachable, he says.  I believe this kind of making exceptions for lies about certain subjects, and not others, is a dangerous and slippery slope. I believe any lying before a grand jury by a sitting president will have ``serious consequences for the country'' if it is deemed to be in some way acceptable.                     national security implications  Indeed, part of the reason this is so important is that if the President is capable of lying under oath about one thing, it reveals a predisposition and capability to lie about other more important things, while not under oath. For example, we already know this president has lied about the national security interest of the United States on numerous occasions. He lied to Congress in 1995 in pledging U.S. troops would not remain in Bosnia beyond one year. He lied or misled audiences over 130 times 1995 and 1996 in asserting that no nuclear missiles were aimed at American children. People know he has lied on numerous other public occasions. Such behavior eats away the public trust and the moral authority of the presidency, which are so vital to the national security.  In addition, it should not go unremarked that the President's underlying conduct in this matter showed astonishingly bad judgment and disregard for the national security implications of his own behavior. In the modern world, the President is always a potential target of foreign intrigue, blackmail and salacious propaganda.  Ms. Lewinski testified before the grand jury that the President himself speculated that his phone calls to her may have been monitored by a foreign embassy. In essence, he was admitting that he had exposed himself to potential blackmail. Such behavior by any president is not merely inappropriate. It is clearly dangerous and unacceptable.                        erosion of public trust  Economic-driven ``popularity'' polls are masking an unprecedented erosion of public trust in this President which has already caused serious damage to his ability to rally the country in time of national threat or crisis. His consistent and long-term pattern of untruthful and deceptive behavior, as exemplified in the Articles of Impeachment, has undermined his credibility to such an extent that he can longer be afforded the benefit of any public doubt about virtually any topic.  When the President took military action against overseas terrorists targets in August and when he ordered air strikes against Iraq in December, popular majorities (!)--in the polls--questioned his timing and motives--and rightly so. Suspicions about both of these actions linger to this day, draining the small reserves of trust the President may have left.  What happens if and when there is a much more serious international or domestic crisis, requiring timely public sacrifice mobilized through presidential leadership? Will the President be believed--even if he is telling the truth? In a world of many lurking dangers of which much of the public is only vaguely aware (from information warfare to weapons of mass destruction), such questions raise very serious concerns.             what do we say to previously convicted liars?  If we do not hold the President accountable in this case, what do we say to the over 100 people who are serving time in federal prison for committing perjury in legal proceedings? What do we say to Ms. Barbara Battalino, who was convicted of perjury, sentenced, and lost her right to practice her profession because she lied under oath . . . about sex . . . in a civil case . . . that was eventually dismissed by the judge? What do we say to others in similar situations? I was waiting for the President's lawyers to address these issues. But they never did in any remotely satisfactory way.what do we say to military officers disciplined for lying about sexual                               misconduct?  What do we say to the military officers whose careers and lives have been ruined over misconduct similar to the President's, including sexual misconduct, lying and obstructing justice?  Capt. Derrick Robinson, an Army officer caught up in the Aberdeen sex misconduct case, is serving time in Leavenworth prison for admitting to consensual sex with an enlisted person who was not his wife.  Drill Sgt. Delmar Simpson is serving 25 years in a military prison because a court martial found that, even though his relationship with a female recruit was consensual, the power granted him by his rank made such consensual sex with a subordinate unacceptable and--in the military--illegal.  Lt. Kelly Flinn was forced out of the Air Force for lying about an adulterous affair.  Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, the Army's top enlisted man, was tried for perjury, adultery and obstruction of justice concerning sexual misconduct. He was convicted of obstruction of justice, but not before his attorney asserted at trial how people in uniform rightly ask: ``How can you hold an enlisted man to a higher standard than the President of the United States,'' the Commander-in-Chief.                            double standard  When we establish a glaring double standard in the law, we diminish respect for all law. This is why we must uphold the highest of standards for officials in public office.                                censure  I will oppose any censure resolution that may be offered after the trial, as I opposed any so-called ``finding of fact'' during the trial, because it is little more than a thinly veiled effort to give people political cover. I believe some who might otherwise vote to convict look to censure as a way to justify or politically cover a vote to acquit. There is no precedent for censure in the Constitution or in an impeachment context. It would be dangerous and wrong to set such a precedent now. I believe it could threaten the separation of powers between the branches of government as Congresses start censuring Supreme Courts and Presidents for all manner of perceived misconduct.  Senators should vote on the Articles of Impeachment, explain their reasons, and live with the consequences.  I am struck that some of my colleagues who agree that the President did commit the serious offenses charged in the Articles of Impeachment, still believe Congress can render some effective consequence short of removal such as censure, which will uphold the presidency, the rule of law, and the sanctity of the oath. I believe they are wrong.  I fear that they are not properly considering the precedent they would establish. Nevermind what we think of this particular president. A thoroughly corrupt president in the future will not be inhibited by the empty words of a non-biding ``sense of the Senate'' resolution. However, such a corrupt president will think twice about certain conduct, if he knows without doubt, by precedent, that such conduct is removable.  If perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering are deemed--as a result of this trial--to be non-removal offenses in certain circumstances, then a corrupt future president may calculate them to be acceptable. We should not set that precedent.                               witnesses  From the beginning, I strongly supported efforts to allow both the House managers and the White House lawyers to call whatever live witnesses they deemed necessary to make their case. I favored a full and complete trial, believing that it was more important to insure fairness to both sides than it was to get the trial over by some arbitrary date. This was in keeping with normal procedures in all previous impeachment trials. It also seemed to me to be essential to fundamental fairness and a full airing of the facts and issues in dispute. A hundred years from now, no one will care whether the trial lasted two weeks or six months. They will care, we must hope, about the extent to which justice was done. Overall, I was disappointed in the unnecessarily tight procedural restrictions imposed on this trial, including the limits on witnesses, I fear that a bad precedent has been unnecessarily set for the future.                          closed deliberations  Throughout the trial, I opposed efforts to waive the time-honored rules of procedure which require that deliberations among senators be closed to the public. I am convinced this was the right decision. The closed meetings allowed for a more colleagial atmosphere among senators, limiting much of the posturing and grandstanding that often goes on before the cameras. The closed sessions also helped enhance a greater spirit of duty and cooperation concerning the tasks at hand. As with all jury trials going back for more than 2000 years in history, closed deliberations constitute proper procedure and I believe this tradition should be maintained.  This need not, and does not, diminish the accountability of senators to their constituents and the public at large. All roll call votes remain open and I believe every member maintains an obligation to inform his constituents of the reason for his votes.             constitutent letter raises key issue: the kids  I received a letter from Mr. Terrence Hogan of Owasso, Okla., an eighth grade civics teacher at the Cascia Hall Middle School in Tulsa for the past 22 years. He wrote last September saying he ``was greatly concerned about the moral direction of our nation'' in light of the President's ``willful and repeated lying.'' He said the nation ``cannot tolerate from our President actions and choices that we would not tolerate from the principal of our neighborhood school.''  And this is exactly the point that people across America are asking. Is the President subject to the same moral accountability as every other responsible citizen in the workplace, or in any other position of public trust? And what do we say to the kids about truth and justice, about honesty and integrity, about the political and governmental heritage they should admire and emulate?                          impeachable offenses  These acts, which were committed willfully and premediately by the President, are serious offenses which I believe clearly rise to the level of impeachable offenses.  I reject the White House lawyers' argument that the President's conductdoes not amount to the technical ``crimes'' of perjury and obstruction, but I'm content to allow a regular court of law to settle the issue. I also reject their argument that the President's conduct does not rise to the level of impeachable offenses.  I believe the President's conduct (however it is ultimately labeled) constitutes absolutely unacceptable behavior on the part of the President of the United States, the nation's chief law enforcement officer who is constitutionally charged to ``faithfully execute the laws,'' and who, by word and deed, sets an example for every citizen.  In finding the President guilty on both Articles of Impeachment, I believe the constitutional consequence of removal from office is warranted in order to uphold for future generations:  The integrity, honor, and trust which are indispensable to the moral authority of the presidency;  The sanctity of the oath which every citizen must take in any legal proceeding to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth;'' and  The viability of our judicial system, the rule of law, and the prinicple of ``equal justice under law.''                  a final note to my fellow oklahomans  Holding public office is a special privilege and I am continually grateful to the people of Oklahoma for the opportunity to serve in the United States Senate.  During the past weeks and months, I have received thousands of letters, e-mails, faxes, phone calls and other communications relative to the impeachment trial and all of the subject matters surrounding it. Many have expressed strongly held views on one side or the other, often urging me to vote in accord with their wishes and thinking. My overworked staff and I have done our best to digest and respond to these inquiries and comments as best we could. To those who may have not yet received a personal response, I want to express my appreciation for sharing your thoughts, your ideas, and your concerns.  Whether you agree or disagree, I want you to know that my votes for conviction on the two Articles of Impeachment represent my best judgment, based on my analysis of the facts, the law, the Constitution and what I believe is best for our country. They do not represent the results of any poll or political calculation about what may be popular, either in Oklahoma or elsewhere.  I have viewed the trial as a serious Constitutional duty and have listened and deliberated with profound sense of history and patriotism. I have sought to respect the process and preserve for future generations those wise procedural precedents, including the rule of law, that have served this nation so well for over 200 years.  I have stated my views and I accept the result of the trial. I harbor no personal bitterness or hatred toward the President. It is time to look to the future. I hope all of us on all sides of these issues can unite in a prayer for the future of our country and for the ideals of freedom and justice it stands for in the world. God Bless America.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
