A funeral service was held on April 22, 2008 at Pleasant Valley South Baptist Church in Silver Creek, GA.  William is survived by his wife Jennifer, their son Damien and stepson Jason ``Luke'' Johnson, his mother Donna Fortune, and his father William Allmon.  He loved his family and his children. ``We're going to miss his smile and his antics--he was a kid at heart. When we went to Chuck E. Cheese, he'd get as much out of it as the kids,'' said the soldier's father, William Allmon.  Today we remember Army SPC William E. Allmon, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                     Staff Sergeant Kevin R. Brown
