 Mr. McINTOSH. The gentleman from Maryland may not find this sufficient, but we did try to address that in an amendment that was, by voice vote, accepted earlier.  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) did not find it enough to satisfy his concerns, but we changed the wording in the bill that said if there is that potential to cause serious harm, we do not have to actually show that harm has been caused, then the agency could decide that the civil penalty would continue to apply in that circumstance.  So as author of the bill and author of that amendment, I would say it is certainly my intention that that type of regulation would continue to be subject to a fine where there is a potential for serious harm to the public, including our fire fighters.
