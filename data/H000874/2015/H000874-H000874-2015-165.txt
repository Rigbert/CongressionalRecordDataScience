Speaker, when the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 to invalidate the preclearance formula in the original Voting Rights Act, it issued a challenge to Congress to pass an updated one. That is a challenge Congress must accept. Until Congress acts, millions will continue to face barriers at the ballot box.  On April 18, The New York Times editorial board highlighted the disturbing and flawed argument that preclearance is no longer necessary. Obviously, the Congress of the United States found otherwise.  The editorial stated: ``This process . . . stopped hundreds of discriminatory new laws from taking effect, and deterred lawmakers from introducing countless more.''  The process to which they were referring was the preclearance process that the Supreme Court threw out. The editors cited a new study that analyzed more than 4,000 rights cases.  They write again: ``The study provides the most wide-ranging empirical evidence yet that Congress was amply justified in finding that voting discrimination remains concentrated in the covered States and regions.''  When we reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, Mr. Speaker, we did so with an overwhelming vote of 390-33 in the House. In the Senate, Mr. Speaker, it was 98-0. There was no confusion, there was no doubt in the minds of the Congress of the United States, and that bill was signed by President George Bush. It was an overwhelmingly bipartisan conclusion that preclearance was still necessary some 45 years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act.  This has traditionally been an issue that brings Democrats and Republicans together, and I am proud to have cosponsored a bipartisan compromise bill sponsored by Republican former chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Jim Sensenbrenner, who was the sponsor and chairman of the committee when the reauthorization was effected in 2006.  The bill that we have introduced, called the Voting Rights Amendments Act, with Republican former chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Jim Sensenbrenner, and Ranking Member John Conyers, as well as John Lewis--great hero of the civil rights movement--that would answer the Supreme Court with an updated preclearance formula, as they suggested. In fact, in the past 2 years since the Court's ruling, we have seen a resurgence of efforts to limit when and where minorities can vote.  The editorial goes on to say, Mr. Speaker: ``Voting discrimination no longer takes the form of literacy tests and poll taxes. Instead, it is embodied in voter-ID laws, the closing of polling places in minority neighborhoods, the elimination of early-voting days and hours, and much more.''  Mr. Speaker, I hope the House will take up a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act without delay and crack down on these discriminatory practices that only serve to weaken our democracy by excluding millions of voices that deserve to be heard.  2015 is the 50-year anniversary of the passing and signing of the Voting Rights Act. That act was achieved only after some died, many bled, and a large number participated in the march from Selma to Montgomery.  That galvanized American public opinion and led the Congress to pass one of the most significant civil rights and democratic rights bills of its history. Congress has the responsibility to act and act now.  As I close, Mr. Speaker, let me remind the Members of the Congress that I discussed this with the majority leader. The majority leader indicated that we would have discussions about bringing Voting Rights Act to the floor, as did I and Mr. Cantor, his predecessor as majority leader.  I look forward to those discussions to facilitate and to speed the bringing to the floor of the bipartisan restoration of the protections in the Voting Rights Act amendments.  Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record the editorial reference.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2015]                     Voting Rights, by the Numbers       When the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting      Rights Act in 2013, its main argument was that the law was      outdated.       Discrimination against minority voters may have been      pervasive in the 1960s when the law was passed, Chief Justice      John Roberts Jr. wrote, but ``nearly 50 years later, things      have changed dramatically.'' In this simplistic account, the      law was still punishing states and local governments for sins      they supposedly stopped committing years ago.       The chief justice's destructive cure for this was to throw      out the formula Congress devised in 1965 that required all or      parts of 16 states with long histories of overt racial      discrimination in voting, most in the South, to get approval      from the federal government for any proposed change to their      voting laws. This process, known as preclearance, stopped      hundreds of discriminatory new laws from taking effect, and      deterred lawmakers from introducing countless more.       But Chief Justice Roberts, writing for a 5-4 majority,      invalidated the formula because ``today's statistics tell an      entirely different story.''       Well, do they? A comprehensive new study by a historian of      the Voting Rights Act provides a fresh trove of empirical      evidence to refute that assertion. The study by J. Morgan      Kousser, a professor of history and social science at the      California Institute of Technology, examines more than 4,100      voting-rights cases, Justice Department inquiries,      settlements and changes to laws in response to the threat of      lawsuits around the country where the final result favored      minority voters.       It found that from 1957 until 2013, more than 90 percent of      these legal ``events'' occurred in jurisdictions that were      required to preclear their voting changes. The study also      provides evidence that the number of successful voting-rights      suits has gone down in recent years, not because there is      less discrimination, but because several Supreme Court      decisions have made them harder to win.       Mr. Kousser acknowledges that the law's formula, created      without the benefit of years of data, was a ``blunt tool''      that focused on voter turnout and clearly discriminatory      practices like literacy tests. Still, he says, the statistics      show that for almost a half century it ``succeeded in      accurately homing in on the counties where the vast majority      of violations would take place.''       Members of Congress had seen some of this data in 2006      when, by a near-unanimous vote, they reauthorized the Voting      Rights Act for 25 years. In fact, the legislative record      contained more than 15,000 pages of evidence documenting the      continuation of ever-evolving racially discriminatory voting      practices, particularly in the areas covered by the      preclearance requirement.       But the Roberts opinion showed no interest in actual data.      Nor did it seem to matter that the law was already adapting      to current conditions: Every one of the more than 200      jurisdictions that asked to be removed from the preclearance      list was successful, because each showed it was not      discriminating.       Instead, the court said the coverage formula had to be      struck down because it failed to target precisely all areas      with voting rights violations in the country.       Mr. Kousser's study does not solve this problem, in part      because there is no easy way to compare discrimination in      places that are under a federal microscope with those that      are not. But the study provides the most wide-ranging      empirical evidence yet that Congress was amply justified in      finding that voting discrimination remains concentrated in      the covered states and regions. In other words, the tactics      may have changed, but the story remains largely the same.      Voting discrimination no longer takes the form of literacy      tests and poll taxes. Instead, it is embodied in voter-ID      laws, the closing of polling places in minority      neighborhoods, the elimination of early-voting days and      hours, and much more.       The Supreme Court suggested that Congress could fix the law      by updating the coverage formula to more closely reflect      where violations are occurring today--and a bipartisan bill      introduced in 2014 and reintroduced this year has done just      that. So far it has gone nowhere because most Republicans      oppose it. Even if it were to pass, there is no guarantee it      would survive before a Supreme Court that is highly skeptical      of any race-conscious efforts to reduce discrimination.       Meanwhile, the Justice Department and private groups are      doing what they can to combat the flood of new discriminatory      laws with the surviving provisions of the Voting Rights Act.      But without preclearance requirements for places with the      worst records on racial discrimination, they will always be a      few steps behind.                          ____________________
