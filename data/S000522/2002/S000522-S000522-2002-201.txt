Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this motion.  I would remind my colleagues that this motion offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) is essentially the same as the one that was offered back in 1999, and it was defeated by this body 164 to 268. This motion again seeks to cut out the parent. And the parent, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) just pointed out--not the religious leader, not some grandparent, not a sibling that happens to be an adult--is the legal guardian. If there is a problem, if there is some kind of injury that results as a result of that abortion, who is responsible? It is not going to be the brother or the sister. It is certainly not going to be the grandparent. It will be the parent. We should not cut the parent out of parental involvement by refusing them consent or knowledge about an abortion.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation has been very carefully crafted by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and members of the Committee on the Judiciary. This is a killer motion, and I hope it will be defeated.
