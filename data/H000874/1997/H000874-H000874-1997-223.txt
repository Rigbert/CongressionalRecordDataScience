Chairman, I thank the ranking member, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dellums] for yielding time to me.  I understand the frustration the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich] had in trying to explain his position in 5 minutes. All of us are constrained by time, but we ought to be constrained by good judgment on this issue as well.  Yes, there was an issue as to whether or not we ought to deploy troops in Bosnia.
