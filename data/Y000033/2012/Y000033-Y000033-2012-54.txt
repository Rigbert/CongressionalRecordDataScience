I have no further speakers.  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.  And I misspoke a moment ago. Congressman Collin Peterson has been fighting this battle for years and years, and I'm glad to finally see that he has succeeded. He is the prime sponsor of this legislation, along with Mr. Cravaack and Mr. Paulsen. So we're on the right track. And I want to congratulate you. Perseverance overcomes many things, and you persevered this time.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time, and I urge the passage of this legislation.
