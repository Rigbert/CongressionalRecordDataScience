 I thank the Senator from Oregon for working with me on this amendment. It is my understanding that it is acceptable to him. It builds on the many positive provisions he has in his amendment. He is a cosponsor of the amendment. He has been a real leader on educational issues.  Shortly, I am going to ask that the amendment be adopted.                               Exhibit 1                               National Education Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.     Senator Susan Collins,     Senator John Warner,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National      Education Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we would      like to express our strong support for your legislation that      would increase, expand, and make permanent the tax deduction      for educators' out-of-pocket classroom supply expenses. We      thank you for your continued leadership and advocacy on this      important issue.       As you know, the educator tax deduction helps recognize the      financial sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals,      who often reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom      supplies such as books, pencils, paper, and art supplies.      Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own      funds each year to supply their classrooms, including      purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors,      and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report Status of      the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found that      teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom      supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and      Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators      spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for      supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials,      for a total of $1,752.       By increasing the current deduction and making it      permanent, your legislation will make a real difference for      many educators, who often must sacrifice other personal needs      in order to pay for classroom supplies.       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to extend the tax      deduction to cover out-of-pocket professional development      expenses. Teacher quality is the single most critical factor      in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional      development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare      students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your bill      will make a critical difference in helping educators access      quality training.       We thank you again for your work on this important      legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you      to support our nation's educators.           Sincerely,     Diane Shust,       Director of Government Relations.     Randall Moody,       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.
