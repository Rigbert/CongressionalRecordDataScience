Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this radical amendment because it will represent the death knell to 12,000 family farmers, including 350 in the State of Ohio, if passed, and what is really interesting is why would we want to be doing this when our sugar prices are lower than all of the other developed nations in the world that we do business with?  What this is really about is, it is a fight between the farmers of this country who produce good quality sugar and the multinational corporations who want to set the price. That is what it is really about; it is about pitting our beef farmers in Ohio against the low-wage, undemocratic labor down in Cuba, in China, in Brazil, every place else that wants to ship into this country.  This industry is going to go the way of TV's, apparel, VCR's. It is all written out there. I saw the offeror of the amendment eating a Snickers bar, or one of those candy bars. I thought that was a bit ironic here as we go into this debate, because that is really what it is about, multinational corporations setting the price of sugar because they are the largest users.  If we look at the last time that the Government got out of the business of regulating this industry, prices shot up, and I say to every homemaker in America, remember when sugar cost $3 for a 5-pound bag? That was the last time this kind of amendment was approved.
