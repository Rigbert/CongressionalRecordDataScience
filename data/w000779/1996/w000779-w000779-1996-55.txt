President, I have not seen the sense of the Senate, offered by Senator Kassebaum, but I would like to discuss this further with her. I also might say that as a new Member of the Senate, she has been especially helpful to me. We have worked on a variety of things, Food and Drug Administration issues and the like. I want her to understand that it has not been particularly pleasant to spend the afternoon taking different positions with somebody I admire. I want her to understand that.  Again, I have not seen a copy of the sense of the Senate offered by the chair of the committee. She seeks to offer a study of this issue involving gag rules on medical patients; is that correct?  We have my amendment which passed 51 to 48, but did not get 60 votes, on a proposal that keeps these health maintenance plans from imposing gag rules that keep their patients from getting a full range of information about medical services and treatments and their health care options.  My amendment does not deal with the abortion issue. Perhaps some may have thought it did. It simply deals with all of those physical and mental health services and the treatment options that patients need to make decisions.  The Senate passed my amendment 51 to 48. Of course, it needed 60 votes. I gather now that the Chair of the committee seeks a study of this particular issue. I yield to her to find out whether this, in fact, is a study, or is this legislation with some teeth in it that actually does ban these gag rules, these insidious, offensive, anticonsumer gag rules that keep patients from knowing about their rights?
