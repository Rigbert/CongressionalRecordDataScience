Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and salute La Salle Academy, an outstanding educational institution in Rhode Island that is celebrating its 125th anniversary.  Following in the tradition of the 17th century religious educator, John Baptist de La Salle, Rev. Michael Tierney established an institution in Providence, RI that espoused Catholic ideals and principles. In 1871, he invited the de La Salle Christian Brothers to teach at this parish school, and the Brothers' School was renamed La Salle Academy in 1876.  Over the years, many generations of young men, and for the past decade, women, have attended La Salle Academy. In addition to receiving a quality education, these young people have been inspired to make a commitment to others as part of their education. Today, La Salle alumni have gone on to make significant contributions to nearly every walk of life in Rhode Island and throughout the Nation. Many have made significant contributions to our community as leaders in medicine, business, law, politics, religion, and education. Others have chosen to work directly with the poor and underprivileged.  Many distinguished Rhode Islanders have graduated from La Salle, including two beloved Governors, Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy and the late Dennis J. Roberts, as well as two former Members of the U.S. Congress, Representative John E. Fogarty, class of 1930 and Representative Robert O. Tiernan, class of 1948. I am especially proud and honored to offer these words as a 1967 graduate of La Salle Academy.  I would respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this Rhode Island academic institution as it celebrates 125 years of commitment to education and to our community.                          ____________________
