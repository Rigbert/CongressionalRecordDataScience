Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his thought that there will not be anything in there that would make it a partisan bill. I think, as the President sent it down, it is, obviously, something that we need to do quickly and in a bipartisan way.  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader and I have talked about the Dream Act. Another week has gone by and, therefore, the 6-month deadline is closer, and the President has urged us to pass legislation.  Can the gentleman tell me what the expectations are to address the Dream Act?  As you know, Michelle Lujan Grisham, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, has filed a discharge petition on the bill sponsored by Lucille Roybal-Allard and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Can the gentleman tell me what progress we are making on that?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, we are dealing with the DACA situation and the situation along the border.  As you know, the Speaker has put together a task force. They have met numerous times. I have had dinner with the President just this week dealing with this issue, and you and I have talked, as well.  I think the best way to solve this problem, to make sure we get to the root cause, we have to secure the border, we have to deal with DACA, and, more importantly, I think we do it in a manner where we are all working together.  I am, as you know, not a fan of a discharge petition. I think the best way to handle this is continuing to work through the matter with the committees--and on your side of the aisle, as well--to solve this problem. The President gave us 6 months. I would like to get this done before then.
