Speaker, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) used the word ``disingenuous,'' and then she changed it. I know she did not mean to cast any aspersions, nor do I.  The gentlewoman from Ohio, like 109 of her colleagues who were here in 1993, voted for the motion to recommit that I will offer. She voted that one-third of the resources represented fairness.  I will tell the gentlewoman from Ohio that, notwithstanding the representations of the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), chairman of the committee, he and I disagree on the assertions. There is but one committee that provides one-third of the resources and control to the minority--just one. To his credit, it is the committee of the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas). No questions asked. As the gentleman from California has pointed out, it is really more than one-third of the resources, because we divided equally a staffer on the Joint Committee on Printing.  My friends, if we want fairness, we need to give fairness. It has been said that we did not do right. Let me accept that premise. Is it, therefore, to be like the Hatfields and McCoys--that you did not do right, so we are not going to do right, and we will continue to fight? We will continue to create a poisonous atmosphere, of which the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) spoke, and of which 30 other Republican leaders in their letter spoke, when they--not the Democrats--but the Republicans said ``one-third of the resources, not just staff, but of the resources available is fairness.''  I am offering a motion to recommit, which was offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) and Mr. Roberts. The gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) said, and I will not quote it all, for my colleagues can see it here on the chart, ``The American people have been clear about something else, as well, Mr. Speaker. They want fairness, bipartisanship, and responsibility in spending from their Congress.''  She went on to say, ``I want to use my time, Mr. Speaker, to talk about how, even at this 11th hour, the House could move toward fairness and reform taxpayers so earnestly desire.'' She said, therefore, among other things, ``that we achieve the goal by limiting the majority to a 2 to 1 staff advantage.'' One-third/two-thirds.                              {time}  1930  I am going to offer that motion to recommit. I will pass out a sheet that will show my colleagues how they voted on it before. Only one Republican voted against that, and that was the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  Mr. Roberts said in 1994, and I want all my colleagues to see this. This is Mr. Roberts. ``If lightning strikes, and the sun comes up in the west, and Republicans take over Congress, we are going to do that for you. You will at least get one-third.''  The Sun came up in the west, much to the chagrin of my side of the aisle, my colleagues. And my Republican colleagues said when it did, we would get one-third. It is time to redeem that promise. Vote for the motion to recommit that I offer, as previously offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jennifer Dunn) and Senator Pat Roberts, then Congressman Pat Roberts.
