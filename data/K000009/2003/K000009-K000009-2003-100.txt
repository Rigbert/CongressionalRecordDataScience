Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, let me just thank the chairman very much for his openness to these amendments and for working on this with us to perfect the legislation as it moves through the process. I am very grateful for that and grateful to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), and the Committee on Rules.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
