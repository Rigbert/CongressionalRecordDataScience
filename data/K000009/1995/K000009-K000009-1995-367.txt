Speaker, I rise today to recognize the longtime contributions the Rojek family has made in my district. Fran and Ray Rojek founded Rojek's Catering over 40 years ago in North Toledo. My family and I, along with many generations, have enjoyed Rojek's famous coffee cakes and other Polish specialties. It is a tradition that will be greatly missed as they close their doors.  When the Rojeks began their business in the mid 1950s, the catering business involved lugging heavy trays and dishes of food into homes and facilities that didn't have kitchens to accommodate serving large groups of guests. Currently, most catering businesses own their own halls, and serve to groups at these halls. The Rojeks' energy and spirit have been an inspiration to those who utilized their quality service for their special events. With a staff of 7 full-time employees and another 25 on-call employees, it was not uncommon to cater a complete wedding dinner for 500 guests.  I know my colleagues join me in saluting one of America's most industrious families, as they cater to themselves by taking time to enjoy their golden years. I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize the Rojek family's efforts as they move on to retirement.                          ____________________
