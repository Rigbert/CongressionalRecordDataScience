 President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Boxer in introducing the Channel Islands National Park Management Act of 2007.  This legislation seeks to clarify the future use and management of the park, and specifically protects Santa Rosa Island for the use of the public.  The taxpayers paid approximately $30 million to acquire Santa Rosa Island in 1986 to restore its native ecology and provide public access.  Unfortunately, late last year during conference negotiations a provision was slipped into the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization bill seeking to overturn a court-approved settlement agreement which requires the phasing out of private hunting on Santa Rosa Island.  Under a binding court settlement in the late 1990s, non-native deer and elk must be removed from Santa Rosa Island over a phased, 4-year period beginning in 2008.  Today, from mid-August through mid-November, a large portion of the island is closed to the public so that the island's prior owners can run a trophy hunting operation targeting the deer and elk on the island.  Under the settlement, this hunting operation was to end in 2011 allowing the island to be completely open to the public year round.  Now, under last year's provision, the prior owners will seek to continue charging $16,000 or more for their privately operated hunting trips.  Even though the Government purchased the island from them for $30 million in taxpayer money, the prior owners would seek to keep essentially everything they had before--and that's simply not in the public interest.  Some may be interested in learning a little history and background on this gem of an island: Santa Rosa Island is approximately 53,000 acres and lies about 50 miles west of Ventura Harbor. It is the second largest of the five islands making up the Channel Islands National Park. It is extremely rugged and pristine, with terrain ranging from grassy hills to steep, wind-carved canyons to white sandy beaches. Craggy, steep cliffs overlook rocky tide pools along its coast. Wildflowers cover many parts of the island during the spring and summer. It is ecologically sensitive and includes several endemic plants and species. For example, it is the only place in the world to see the island fox and spotted skunk in their natural habitat. A variety of shore birds--like the snowy plover--and sea mammals--such as seals and sea lions--breed on its beaches. It is seen by many scientists as one of the nation's most unique places. In addition to being the home of rare flora and fauna, it is an archaeological and paleontological treasure, with some sites dating back 11,000 years or to the Pleistocene-era. In fact, in 1994, the world's most complete skeleton of a pygmy mammoth was excavated on the island. It offers incredible recreational opportunities for the public, including hiking, camping, kayaking, fishing, sea sports, and wildlife watching.  The limitation of public access to the island to accommodate privately run hunting trips would be a tragedy. This is the public's land. It's a national park, and the public should be able to visit it and enjoy its breath-taking beauty and remoteness.  I also want to address one issue the provision in last year's Defense Authorization bill purportedly seeks to address: enhancing hunting opportunities for disabled veterans.  While no one opposes providing hunting opportunities for our veterans, it is clear that it is neither a practical nor viable option to use Santa Rosa Island as a hunting reserve for injured and disabled veterans.  This view is now supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA, an organization which previously expressed support for the provision overturning the settlement.  Notably, in July 2006, the PVA reached the conclusion following an investigative visit to Santa Rosa that the ``numerous obstacles inherent to the island, including ingress and egress, logistics, personal safety and cost, far outweigh the possible, limited benefit it could provide.''  Furthermore, it should be pointed out that in California today, there are already 9 military installations that permit hunting--five that can accommodate disabled servicemembers.  Two of these military installations, Camp Pendleton and Vandenberg Air Force Base, are relatively close to the Channel Islands National Park, and allow disabled veterans to hunt a variety of animals, including deer, waterfowl, quail, feral pigs, small game, and coyote.  Altogether there are over 100 U.S. military installations where hunting is permitted, over 70 of which are currently accessible to disabled servicemembers and veterans.  Naturally, the Park Service is firmly opposed to the provision seeking to overturn the settlement. But it is also important to note that neither the Department of Defense nor the Veterans Administration asked for the language.  Consequently, I strongly believe that the Park Service should continue managing this National Park for the benefit of the general public. To allow any less would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and wrongly limit the public's access to this national treasure.  I strongly believe that we must do everything to protect the island for the public and oppose any measures that could continue to restrict access to the island.  This legislation we are introducing today would safeguard the island in just this manner. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the text of this proposed legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1209       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Channel Islands National      Park Management Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) Channel Islands National Monument was designated in      1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the authority      of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 note);       (2) the Monument was expanded to include additional islands      and redesignated as Channel Islands National Park in 1980 to      protect the nationally significant natural, scenic, wildlife,      marine, ecological, archaeological, cultural, and scientific      values of the Channel Islands in California;       (3) Santa Rosa Island was acquired by the United States in      1986 for approximately $29,500,000 for the purpose of      restoring the native ecology of the Island and making the      Island available to the public for recreational uses;       (4) Santa Rosa Island contains numerous prehistoric and      historic artifacts and provides important habitat for several      threatened and endangered species;       (5) under a court-approved settlement, the nonnative elk      and deer populations are scheduled to be removed from the      Park by 2011 and the Island is to be restored to management      consistent with other National Parks; and       (6) there have been recent proposals to remove Santa Rosa      Island from the administration of the National Park Service      or to direct the management of the Island in a manner      inconsistent with existing legal requirements and the sound      management of Park resources.
