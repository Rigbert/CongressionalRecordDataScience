Speaker, it's over time for Wall Street megabanks, their CEOs, speculators, and sharpies to come and scrub the floors of homeless shelters across this country that are crammed with people who have lost their homes. Let's make those Wall Street bankers sign up to work with Habitat for Humanity to restore housing in neighborhoods across our Nation. Wouldn't that be sweet justice? Once they've paid back the billions that they owe the American people, whose homes they've raided of equity, let's put them to work.  Wouldn't it be great to see the CEO of Goldman Sachs, I think his name is Lloyd Blankfein, out there with buckets and scrub brushes? Come to Toledo; come to Cleveland; come to America, the part you've hurt so deeply. Wouldn't it be great? Let him be joined by Josh Bolten, who was there when the Bush administration handed the toxic mortgage paper to the people of the United States.  Well, come on down, Angelo Mozilo, from Countrywide. I think a little hard work would help you a whole lot. How about Bank of America? How about the CEO there? How about JPMorgan Chase? How about Jamie Dimon? I wonder when was the last time he scrubbed a floor. How about Jim Johnson, who headed up Fannie Mae, or Hank Paulson? Oh, I'd love to see this.  As I speak, coming to light are important developments in the much anticipated settlement between the individual State governments and the big Wall Street banks over the widespread use of fraudulent schemes and missing paperwork that fueled the foreclosure crisis. As the press has reported, we are seeing the possible imposition of $25 billion in penalties against Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Ally Financial and Citigroup. Given the extent of the damage they caused, it's a small start. Just in Ohio, the financing gap was $20 billion. That's what it would take to stabilize the housing market in just our State.  Most importantly, The New York Times is reporting that the deals will ``preserve the right to investigate past misdeeds by the bank.'' Not one, not even the titans of Wall Street, should be able to buy legal immunity for their criminal acts as millions of families lose their homes.  It is important that we do not forget how systemic mortgage fraud has become. In an interview given by a former executive vice president of Countrywide Financial, a giant player in the U.S. mortgage business, this executive who was in charge of fraud investigations at the company related how ``Countrywide loan officers were forging and manipulating borrowers' income and asset statements to help them get loans they weren't qualified for and couldn't afford.'' She went on to say that, whenever we looked through all of the recycle bins, they were full of signatures that they had cut off of one document and put on another and then photocopied or faxed. According to her, the fraud was systemic, taking place in Boston, Chicago, Miami, Detroit, Las Vegas, Phoenix and, I can tell you, Cleveland, Parma, Lorain, Elyria, Toledo, and Sandusky.  What we cannot forget is that these stories are not isolated. The FBI testified before Congress as early as 2004 that they were seeing an epidemic in white collar financial crimes, and they did not have anywhere near enough agents to go after the wrongdoers. Wasn't that convenient? While the number of agents has increased due to congressional pressure, the FBI needs to have more special agents and forensic experts to properly investigate the level of accounting corruption that is believed to exist.  This is the most basic, bipartisan concept I can think of, that criminals cannot be allowed to get away with their crimes because our law enforcement agencies lack the manpower to stop them.  I have a bill I hope my colleagues can support. It is H.R. 3050, the Financial Crisis Criminal Investigation Act, that would authorize an additional 1,000 FBI agents to take on the kinds of fraud that have destroyed the economic futures of countless American families and so gravely harmed our Republic. A good first step was the inclusion of more than 200 additional agents in the last appropriations cycle. This administration should use it to go after these Wall Street perpetrators.  The President announced during his State of the Union address a new working group to look into mortgage fraud. It will coordinate efforts between the FBI, the Justice Department, and various States to go after those on Wall Street who have perpetuated fraud in the markets, using mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and lots of other sophisticated financial tricks.  Given the seriousness of the fraud, the number of American families that have lost their homes and savings, and the drag that that foreclosure crisis continues to have on the economy means we need more vigilance and let's confront Wall Street, and put the perpetrators in jail. And let's have them scrub floors in this new year.                [From the New York Times, Feb. 5, 2012]           Deal Is Closer for a U.S. Plan on Mortgage Relief                (By Shaila DeWan and Nelson D. Schwartz)       With a deadline looming on Monday for state officials to      sign onto a landmark multibillion-dollar settlement to      address foreclosure abuses, the Obama administration is close      to winning support from a crucial state that would      significantly expand the breadth of the deal.       The biggest remaining holdout, California, has returned to      the negotiating table after a four-month absence, a change of      heart that could increase the pot for mortgage relief      nationwide to $25 billion from $19 billion.       Another important potential backer, Attorney General Eric      T. Schneiderman of New York, has also signaled that he sees      progress on provisions that prevented him from supporting it      in the past.       The potential support from California and New York comes in      exchange for tightening provisions of the settlement to      preserve the right to investigate past misdeeds by banks, and      stepping up oversight to ensure that the financial      institutions live up to the deal and distribute the money to      the hardest-hit homeowners.       The settlement would require banks to provide billions of      dollars in aid to homeowners who have lost their homes to      foreclosure or who are still at risk, after years of failed      attempts by the White House and other government officials to      alter the behavior of the biggest banks.       The banks--led by the five biggest mortgage servicers, Bank      of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally      Financial--want to settle an investigation into abuses set      off in 2010 by evidence that they foreclosed on borrowers      with only a cursory examination of the relevant documents, a      practice known as robo-signing. Four million families have      lost their homes to foreclosure since the beginning of 2007.       As recently as two weeks ago, with federal officials hoping      to complete a deal that President Obama could cite in his      State of the Union address, California's attorney general,      Kamala Harris, made it clear she was not on board, terming      the plan inadequate. But in the last few days, differences      have narrowed in negotiations that one participant described      as round the clock, with California officials in direct      communication with bank representatives for the first time in      months.       ``For the past 13 months we have been working for a      resolution that brings real relief to the hardest-hit      homeowners, is transparent about who benefits, and will      ensure accountability,'' Ms. Harris said in a statement. ``We      are closer now than we've been before but we're not there      yet.''       The settlement has been hamstrung by one delay after      another over the last year. Winning California's support now      would represent a major win for the White House in this      election year.       ``I am encouraged by the conversations we've had with many      states in the last few days,'' said Shaun Donovan, the      secretary of housing and urban development. ``This will be      one of the most significant steps in the recovery of      homeowners, neighborhoods and the broader housing market from      the worst collapse since the Depression.''       ``My fundamental point is that it's a first step,'' he      added, citing measures like Mr. Obama's proposal last week to      lower interest rates for homeowners who are still current on      their mortgages.       Officials involved in the negotiations cautioned that      broader state support could still be days away. And although      the timing of any announcement is subject to last-minute      maneuvering, as it stands now the deal would set aside up to      $17 billion specifically to pay for principal reductions and      other relief for up to one minion borrowers who are behind on      their payments but owe more than their houses are currently      worth. The deal would also provide checks for about $2,000 to      roughly 750,000 who lost homes to foreclosure.       Those figures are contingent upon the number who respond to      the offer, which is likely to go to people who lost their      homes between Jan. 1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2011. In addition,      said Patrick Madigan, the Iowa assistant attorney general,      homeowners who participate in the settlement will still have      the right to sue the banks for improper behavior in the      foreclosure process.       California has been focused on measures that would benefit      individual homeowners, while New York has been most      interested in preserving its ability to investigate the root      causes of the financial collapse.       Another critical issue for California is narrowing the      amnesty given to banks because under the state's False Claims      Act, state officials and huge pension funds like Calpers      would be able to collect sizable monetary damages from the      banks if they could prove mortgages were improperly packaged      into securities that later soured. What is more, California's      participation would result in having more money available for      many other states, including an estimated $500 million in      additional money for Florida.       But the agreement's terms do not guarantee minimum      allocations of mortgage relief by state.       Mr. Donovan added that there had been numerous discussions      with individual states that had specific concerns.       California officials and other veterans of the foreclosure      crisis are haunted by the failure of past attempts to alter      the behavior of the big banks, including a 2008 deal with      Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant now owned by Bank      of America, and a more recent agreement last April between      federal regulators and the biggest mortgage servicers.       The backers of the latest deal insist their plan has more      teeth, with a powerful outside monitor to oversee enforcement      and heavy monetary penalties if banks fail to live up to      commitments. While the past agreement with Countrywide gave      banks credit even if their offers to modify the interest rate      of the mortgage or write down principal were not accepted by      borrowers, this deal counts only what banks actually do for      homeowners.       If banks fall short of the multibillion-dollar benchmarks      set out for principal reduction and other benefits for      homeowners, they     will have to pay the difference plus a penalty of up to 40      percent directly to the federal government, according to Mr.      Madigan.       The depressed housing market continues to pose a drag on      the halting economic recovery. RealtyTrac, which analyzes      housing data, predicts two million more foreclosures over the      next two years. Some 11 million families owe more on their      houses than they are worth.       The settlement, if all states participate, will also      include $3 billion to lower the rates of mortgage holders who      are current. Banks will get more credit for reducing      principal owed and helping families keep their homes, and      less for short sales or taking losses on loans that were      likely to go bad, like those that were severely delinquent.                          ____________________
