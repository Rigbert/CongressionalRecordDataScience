President, might I note, I believe we are open for another amendment on the other side. I should note, Mr. President, for our colleagues that everybody has been very cooperative. A number of Senators have not used all their time. Things are moving forward. I almost hate to mention that as a compliment because it might spoil the rhythm of things.  I encourage Senators to keep coming forward. I know there are others on the floor now. But it is my intention on this side that whenever possible--whenever possible--on an amendment to yield back time. I would not do anything to cut off anybody's time, of course, that is allotted to them, because it is a relatively short amount of time on each amendment. But when we can, we can yield it back.
