Speaker, I rise to thank Ms. Juanita Campbell, who is retiring after more than forty-two years of outstanding service to the United States Congress.  Ms. Campbell retired in January as a Manager of Legislative Data, with more than four decades of service to the Library of Congress. She first started working for the Library in 1973 as a high school student, at which time she served as a Library Aide working on the National Union Catalog. Ms. Campbell went on to become a Clerk Typist in 1974 and, soon after, joined the Congressional Research Service's Economic Division as an Editorial Assistant. Three years later, she moved to the American Law Division, originally called the Bill Digest Section, where she helped track and summarize all pending public legislation. Since 1996, Ms. Campbell has served as a Manager of Legislative Data. Through the years, she has been a highly reliable and knowledgeable liaison to House and Senate staff, relaying bill status information and sharing her expertise on the interaction of the different legislative information management systems.  Ms. Campbell has been focused intently on improving access to legislative proceedings. She aided in the transition of where transcripts and details of legislative proceedings could be found: from only being available through a Library of Congress database, with a limited range of users, to their availability on the internet through the THOMAS website, which everyone can access. Ms. Campbell's knowledge was invaluable during the recent transition to the more modern Congress.gov.  Ms. Campbell has been instrumental at increasing legislative transparency and moving Congress into the digital age. The services she helped develop are invaluable to Congress, the public, and our democracy. The work of her unit, particularly on bill status information, has vastly increased accessibility to the legislative database as well as documentation. Her keen attention to detail has been largely responsible for the high quality of work the Library and CRS's legislative service provides.  Throughout her career, Ms. Campbell's thoughtfulness and positive attitude have earned her the respect and confidence of countless Congressional and CRS staff. As a manager responsible for much of what makes complex information not merely reliable but understandable, she has always demonstrated a passion for teamwork, learning, and problem-solving.  Although Ms. Campbell will be retiring, her many accomplishments will stand as a fitting tribute to her as a professional and as a patriot. Ms. Campbell's presence will be greatly missed. On behalf of this House, I congratulate Juanita Campbell on her retirement and thank her for her dedication and outstanding contributions to the institution. I wish her the best in all her future endeavors.                          ____________________
