 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of Kentucky's College of Pharmacy. Today at the Kennedy Center the college is being awarded the American Pharmacists Association's 2005 Pinnacle Award to recognize the success of UK's Diabetes Education and Management program in helping Kentuckians with diabetes.  Over the past 30 years, doctors have been able to treat more and more conditions with prescription medication. While this revolution in pharmaceuticals is overwhelmingly positive, the incorrect use of medication can result in harmful side effects, ineffective treatment, and unnecessary costs. This is of particular importance in Kentucky, where citizens use significantly more prescriptions than the national average.  The UK College of Pharmacy has created a comprehensive Center for Improving Medication Related Outcomes to educate physicians, pharmacists, and consumers about the appropriate use of medication. This is something I believe in, and since 2002, I have been proud to secure $3 million in Federal funding to help the center become a leader in promoting the safe use of prescription drugs throughout the Commonwealth and the Nation.  The Diabetes Education and Management Program is an important component of the UK Center for Improving Medication Related Outcomes that focuses on diabetes control. I am proud that the UK College of Pharmacy and the Diabetes Education and Management Program have become valuable resources for our Nation's healthcare system. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy for their exceptional work in the field of prescription medication safety.                          ____________________[Page S6469]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]      TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY'S COLLEGE OF PHARMACY  Mr. McCONNELL.
