President, it is interesting when you think of the debate we are in. Here we are as Americans in the richest and most powerful country the world has ever known. There is really no comparison to it. We have the most highly trained and capable health professionals of any nation. Our technology leads the way on the frontiers of medical science. People come from all over the world to train and to be educated in medical science. But at that same time, millions of American families in our Nation with its first-class medical expertise are subject to second-class treatment because of the policies and practices of our health insurance system.  I have to ask, is it really beyond the ability of this great Nation to ensure access and accountability to help these families? Of course it is not. Is this an important enough problem that solving it should be a high priority for this body, the Senate? Of course it is.  Although the President and many of the Senators have done their utmost for years to encourage the Congress to act, I am afraid that the Republican leadership long ago decided that protection for those Americans insured through private managed care plans was just not a priority for us--this despite the fact that we have had calls from nonpartisan groups from every corner of the Nation. The Republican leadership has refused to schedule a full and reasonable debate to consider the vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights.  Certainly from my experience in the Senate it is clear that the only step left is, of course, to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights directly to the floor. I believe we should keep it there until the Republicans, who are in the majority, agree that it merits the priority consideration that we--and I believe most of the American people, Republican and Democrat--strongly believe it does.  I applaud Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and many others for leading this vigilance to save the Patients' Bill of Rights. I commend the distinguished Senate Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, for continuing to insist on a reasonable time agreement as he attempts to negotiate with our friends on the other side of the aisle.  I urge our friends in the Republican Party to make the Patients' Bill of Rights a high priority. Let's get on with the debate, vote it up or vote it down, and then go on to the other matters, things such as the agriculture appropriations bill and other business before us.  The Patients' Bill of Rights that we Democrats have presented reflects a fundamental expectation that Americans have about their health care. That expectation is that doctors--not insurance companies--should practice medicine.  To really sum up our Patients' Bill of Rights, we are saying that doctors--not insurance companies--should be the first decisionmakers in your health care. The rights that we believe Americans should have in dealing with health insurers are not vague theories; they are practical, sensible safeguards. You can hear it if you talk to anybody who has sought health care. You can hear it if you talk to anybody who provides health care. I hear it from my wife, who is a registered nurse. I hear it from her experiences on the medical-surgical floors in the hospitals she has worked in. If you want to see how some of them would work in practice, come with me to Vermont. My state has already implemented a number of these protections for the Vermonters who are insured by managed care plans. I am proud Vermont has been recognized nationally for its innovation and achievements in protecting patients' rights.  I consistently hear from Vermonters who are thankful for the actions that the Vermont legislature has taken to ensure patients are protected. But I also hear from those who do not yet fall under these protections.  This Congress should waste not more time and instead make a commitment to the American people that we will fully debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We must protect those Vermonters who are not covered under current state law. And we must act now to cover every other American who expects fair treatment from their managed care plan.  I am one of many in this body who firmly believe in the importance of this bill. I hope the leadership is listening and I hope they hear what we are saying. It is what Americans are saying.  As I stated at the beginning of this message, millions of American families in this Nation of first-class medical expertise are subject to second-class treatment because of the policies and practices of our health insurance system.  We have heard a lot of ``our bill has this,'' and ``their bill doesn't have that.'' Here are some of the facts. Our Patients' Bill of Rights will protect every patient covered by private managed care plans. And it offers protections that make sense, such as ensuring a patient has access to emergency room services in any situation that a ``prudent layperson'' would regard as an emergency, guaranteeing access to specialists for patients with special conditions, and making sure that children's special needs are met, including access to pediatric specialists when they need it.  Our Patients' Bill of Rights provides strong protections for women. It will provide women with direct access to their ob/gyn for preventive care. Through successful research, we have learned that regular screening can prevent breast cancer and cervical cancer in women of all ages.  We stress the importance of regular visits to ob/gyns to the women in our lives: our mothers, our wives, our daughters, and our sisters. But we make it difficult for these women to receive care by requiring referrals and putting other obstacles in the way of their care. Let us make sure women have the direct access they need and deserve.  Our bill also will give women time to recover when they have undergone surgery. We should let doctors and patients determine if a lengthier hospital stay is necessary, and our bill would let them decide.  Health plans must be held accountable for their actions, just as doctors and hospitals are today. Out Patients Bill of Rights provides a variety of ways to achieve this goal.  First, patients must be able to appeal decisions made by their health plans. In our bill, any decision to deny, delay or otherwise overrule doctor-prescribed treatments could be appealed. And our bill says these appeals must be addressed in a timely manner, especially when the life of a patient is threatened. Patients must have the opportunity to question managed care decisions and insurance companies must be held accountable, especially when they decide to overrule the decisions of a trained health care providers.  Our bill would require an external appeals process through an independent body with the ability and the authority to resolve disputes in a variety of instances. We know this is often a successful way of mediating labor disputes. Why can't it work for our patients, too?  Finally, the Patients' Bill of Rights would allow patients to hold health plans liable for their decisions. This is essential. How can we justify holding our physicians responsible for decisions that they are not really making? Doctors must account for the decisions they make. Why shouldn't health insurers be responsible for theirs?  Differences between patients and their managed care plans can readily be resolved without going to court. But that will not and should not always be the case. We must extend this consumer protection to patients.  Mr. President, let us make the Patients' Bill of Rights the high priority that our families want it to be on our agenda.                          ____________________
