 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  First of all, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, I was a little bit amused at the use of the words ``blatant hypocrisy.'' I don't question his use of those words at all. But the fact is that this bill passed with 83 Senators voting for it. It passed the Senate and went to conference. Three-fourths of the members of his caucus voted for this legislation. If there is blatant hypocrisy, it is very bipartisan hypocrisy.
