President, I have had the privilege of attending performances by the Eagles, and I have enjoyed a long friendship with Don Henley and the members of the band.  I talked with Don recently about their new double-disc set ``Long Road Out of Eden'' and how they came about making it. We also talked about the last impromptu performance of the Eagles I attended, which was at Camp David at a farewell party for President Bill Clinton, who was leaving office within 48 hours. As always, they were superb.  I have listened so many times to their music while traveling, at my home in Vermont, and in my office, and I thought my colleagues may benefit from the transcript of an interview Don Henley recently had with CNN. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Nashville, Tennessee (CNN).--It may have been 28 years      since the last Eagles studio album--yes, ``The Long Run''      came out in 1979--but, in terms of sales, it's as if the      famed band has never left.       The group's new CD, the double-disc set ``Long Road Out of      Eden,'' debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album charts with      more than 700,000 copies sold in its first week. This--     despite its being available only at Wal-Mart.       That relationship with America's biggest merchant has also      raised eyebrows. Wal-Mart's reputation does not seem to      dovetail with the interests of the Eagles, particularly the      band's Don Henley, an outspoken environmentalist.       In a rare interview, Henley addressed those concerns, along      with the idea of patriotism, the changing music business, and      why ``Long Road'' may be the group's last album.       CNN's Denise Quan spoke to Henley at the Country Music      Association awards last week, and said that Henley was a      ``true Southern gentleman,'' ending the interview by sending      the crew on its way with plates of mashed potatoes, corn and      biscuits.       CNN. Don Henley, congratulations on the first-week sales of      this album. I think it exceeded everyone's expectations.       Henley. More than 700,000 in this country. And I'm told it      has sold 3 million worldwide. So we're delighted.       CNN. Somewhere, Kanye West is quaking in his boots, I would      imagine.       Henley. I doubt it. (Laughs)       CNN. You made us wait 28 years for this new CD.       Henley. Yeah. Well, we don't like to rush into things.       CNN. I was surprised when it was announced you had gone      with a Wal-Mart deal exclusively. Why did you do that?       Henley. Our deal with the major label expired several years      ago, and we just decided we wanted to try something new. . .      . Everybody's been calling for a new paradigm in the record      industry. Some people have gone to the Internet and haven't      had a lot of success with that.       Some people have decided to go with the indie labels, who      are mostly distributed by the major labels. Some people have      signed with major coffee companies with varying degrees of      success.       So Wal-Mart came to us, and they made us a really good      offer. And they told us about their green initiative, and how      they're trying to make their company more ecologically      responsible. And we were impressed by their programs in that      regard, and what they're trying to do. And a lot of our fans      are customers of Wal-Mart, so we thought it was a good fit.       CNN. There are two discs in ``Long Road Out of Eden.'' One      disc is full of romantic ballads with those harmonies the      Eagles are known for, and the other disc is full of      satirical, witty, kind of biting--       Henley. (Interrupts) Thank you. Thank you for not using the      word ``cynical.'' (Laugh) Which has become a real cliche.       Protest songs are an old tradition that seems to be coming      back now. People writing about government has been going on      since the Middle Ages. . . . But to hear some journalists      tell it, this is like it's never been done before, and it's      outrageous!       If people don't agree with us, they can hit the skip      button. We are ticked off about some things, but we also do      some of it with humor. People seem to miss our humor. A lot.      It seems to go (brushes side of his head with his hand).       CNN. The Eagles have long been associated with the country      sound--only you brought the rock element to it when you first      appeared on the scene.       Henley. Yeah, yeah.       CNN. But your politics are different than a lot of people      in Nashville, who are more conservative than I would say you      are.       Henley. Yeah. Well, Nashville is changing. Nashville is not      nearly as conservative as it used to be.       CNN. People just don't talk about it, perhaps.       Henley. It's just like you don't talk about religion and      politics. This country was founded on rebellion. We believe      that we are patriotic. We believe that everyone has the right      to speak out. In fact, we believe that it's unpatriotic not      to speak out.       Lord knows, we've been criticized enough during our career.      When we were younger, (adopts Bugs Bunny voice) it hurt our      widdle feewings. But now we have no feelings! We had them      removed. Surgically. This is probably the last Eagles album      that we'll ever make. So we decided to just say whatever we      felt like saying. And let the chips fall where they may.       CNN. But doesn't the success of this album spur you to make      more music? Obviously, people want to hear it.       Henley. I can't sit here and tell you for certain that      there will never be another Eagles album, but we got 20 songs      on this album. You know, we got a lot of things off our      chest, so to speak.       I don't know if everybody's going to want to do another      one. If we do a world tour, that'll take at least two years.      We're all pushing 60. Well, some of us are 60. . . .       Anyway, we'll see. But we all have some solo plans still. I      still have a contract with a major label for a couple of solo      albums. I think parenting is one of the highest things on our      agenda right now. We all have young children. So making      another album is not our first priority right now.       CNN. It seems like you've mellowed quite a bit. Is it      fatherhood that's changed you, or perhaps just turning 60?       Henley. I think we've all mellowed in this group. I think      having children was really good for all of us. And you      supposedly get mellower with age. However, as some of the      songs will indicate, we're not too mellow. (Pauses)       CNN. What are you thinking?       Henley. I hate that word ``mellow,'' actually. We've been      saddled with that word since the very beginning of our      career, you know. It has something to do with Southern      California. I wish they would find a new word. We're either      ``mellow'' or we're ``cynical.'' They can't make up their      minds. It's sort of a contradiction.       CNN. But I think you've been sort of a contradiction.      Certainly an enigma to a lot of people.       Henley. Well, good! (Laughs) Yeah, well, this band is a      contradiction. This album is. But life is a contradiction,      isn't it? There are good things, and there are bad things      going on in the world simultaneously. There's love and hate.      There's war and peace. There are all kinds of things      happening at the same time. And so that's reflected on this      album, I think.       CNN. So how are you guys all getting along these days?       Henley. The same. (Laughs)       CNN. For better or worse?       Henley. All that stuff has been exaggerated. You ask any      band if they get along all the time, and they will tell you,      ``Of course not.'' But we get along, I'd say, as well as any      band does.       There's something we've created called the Eagles that's      more important than any one of us individually. And we serve      that. You know, we call it ``The Mothership.'' We can all do      this, that and the other, but we always come back to the      Mothership. It's something that we all built together.       And all this stuff about fighting in the band, and      brawling, and fistfights and all that stuff has been grossly      exaggerated. When it gets reprinted, and our publicist says,      ``Well, where'd you get that information,'' they invariably      say, ``I read it on the Internet''--as if the Internet were      some source of truth! The Internet is no more accurate than      the New York Post, you know.       (Looks straight into the camera lens) Put that in! (Laughs)                          ____________________
