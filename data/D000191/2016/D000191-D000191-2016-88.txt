 First off, we have to give the chairman a report card, and I am going to give him an A-plus for persistence. This is the fifth time this legislation will have been on the floor of this House. Of course, it is threatened by a veto should it ever pass the Senate, but it won't, so A-plus for persistence.  I will give him an A for creativity because this is the same bill five times under four different guises. First it was for West Nile. Okay. Then it was the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act. So when we had West Nile, they called it a West Nile bill. When we were having a bad fire year, they called it a Fire Suppression Flexibility Act. Then they were honest, and they said it is the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, the piece of paper, the report you have to file after you apply the pesticides. So at least that was, from their side, honest. But then now it is the Zika Vector Control Act, renamed 2 weeks ago.  Zika is a serious problem. Of course, on their side, they are refusing to put forward an adequate budget to partner with communities who want to do mosquito reduction and control efforts, but that is a story for another day, and it is a different committee. But that would be a real thing we could do.  Here are a couple of points. Zika is very bad for pregnant women and is also implicated in Guillain-Barre syndrome in both males and females and other potential links to other diseases. Really, really bad stuff. We have to get ahead of it. We also know that pesticides and herbicides are bad for pregnant women.  So is the current state of affairs such that vector control districts can't go out right now today and apply pesticides to deal with a potential Zika with tiger mosquitoes and Aedes aegypti?  No. Actually, they can. Under the law, they can go out and apply whatever they think would be effective. They just need, within 30 days, to send a form--a form, a piece of paper--available online to the EPA saying what they applied and where they applied it.  Now, why would we care about that?  Well, because we are worried about loading up drinking water with stuff that is harmful to pregnant women and to babies and to other living things, just like the 90,000 steelhead that were killed in my district. All we are saying is we would like to keep track, and then when we see certain concentrations in certain areas, we will actually test the water.  Your local water authority does not routinely test--for the most part, very few--for pesticides and herbicides, but if they knew a bunch had been dumped upstream, they might want to do that, or the EPA might want to follow up and do some testing. So what we are saying is we don't want to know. We don't want to know what, where, how this stuff was applied.  Now, the horrible burden of submitting an online form, this horrible, horrible, horrible burden has led to: No, well, we heard last time there may have been an aerial applicator who didn't apply something because of this regulatory burden, or maybe because they had misapplied it, or maybe the wind was blowing too hard.  Who knows?  We don't know. That was one anecdotal report. But from the 50 States assembled and the EPA, there are no documented instances of delays or prevention of necessary application of pesticides or herbicides because of the reporting requirement to EPA so we will know what, when, where, and how this stuff was applied.  So the gentleman gets an A-plus for persistence, an A for creativity, but, unfortunately, a D for dangerous in terms of what this legislation would lead to.  I include in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy. I will put the whole thing in the Record, but the administration does not agree with that truncated quote talking about how important this is or something from someone at EPA. ``H.R. 897 would weaken environmental protections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide spraying from the currently required pesticide general permit.'' General permit. ``Creating a new statutory exemption to the permit is unnecessary'' because the permit itself ``was explicitly crafted to allow immediate responses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing vector control methods to be applied to the possible influx of disease-carrying mosquitoes.''                   Statement of Administration Policy H.R. 897--Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015--Rep. Gibbs, R-OH,                            and two cosponsors       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 897, Reducing      Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015, recently rebranded as the      Zika Vector Control Act. H.R. 897 would weaken environmental      protections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide      spraying from the currently required Pesticide General      Permit. Creating a new statutory exemption to the Permit is      unnecessary, as it was explicitly crafted to allow immediate      responses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing      vector control methods to be applied to the possible influx      of disease-carrying mosquitos.       In fact, most mosquito control districts and Federal and      State agencies already have authority under the Pesticide      General Permit to apply mosquitocides as needed to respond to      Zika virus concerns and do not require any additional      authorization under the Permit. In rare circumstances where a      mosquito control district did not seek prior coverage under      the Permit, emergency provisions of the Permit are available      that allow instant authorization to spray without the need      for prior notification.       The Administration is committed to taking necessary steps,      as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from      the Zika virus. Rebranding legislation that removes important      Clean Water Act protections for public health and water      quality is not an appropriate avenue for addressing the      serious threat to the Nation that the Zika virus poses.
