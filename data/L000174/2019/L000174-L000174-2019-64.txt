In 2002, Tom and his wife, Janet Fredericks, cofounded Magicians Without Borders and have since performed in more than 40 countries, for more than 1,000,000 of the world's most vulnerable people. Magicians Without Borders is one shining example of Vermonters thinking outside the box and using their creativity to make the world a better place. It is with pride and appreciation that I recognize Tom, Janet and the Magicians Without Borders organization for their achievements.  Tom was a professor of psychology in 2001 when he embarked on a trip through the Balkans, performing magic shows in the refugee camps of Kosovo and Macedonia. The performances were so well received that, upon returning to Vermont, Tom took a year off from his position at Burlington College to found Magicians Without Borders.  Since Tom's first trip, he and Janet have made six trips each year, continuing to use magic to transform the lives of youth in at risk situations around the globe. Tom, Janet, and Magicians Without Borders have performed everywhere from the Sudan, to Colombia, from Ukraine to Bangladesh. They traveled to Thailand and Burma for a month of performances in the wake of a tsunami and performed stateside throughout Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.  In 2004, a series of shows at rural schools in El Salvador was met with such positivity that Tom was asked to teach a few magic tricks to the students. These impromptu classes turned into a unique, long-term education program geared toward increasing self-confidence, discipline, focus, and self-esteem. Tom, Janet, and Magicians Without Borders have now returned to El Salvador more than 30 times to entertain and educate these children who find themselves surrounded by terrible gang violence and abject poverty. The program has inspired young Salvadoran magicians to perform their own magic shows in orphanages, hospitals, and disaster areas and aspire to teach magic to other young people.  Due to their success in El Salvador, Magicians Without Borders expanded these education programs to Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and the United States. Two additional education programs have been implemented in India.  I am proud to recognize the contributions that Tom, Janet, and Magicians Without Borders have made me so many communities across globe in the last 18 years. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an Addison Independent article titled ``Lincoln Magicians Bring Joy to Refugees at the Border.'' It describes how Tom and Janet use magic to connect with those suffering at our southern border and how they have expanded their mission to entertain, educate and empower across the world.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Addison Independent, July 3, 2019]         Lincoln Magicians Bring Joy to Refugees at the Border       Lincoln.--Tom Verner and Janet Fredericks performed magic      at the U.S.-Mexico border last December.       Not the kind of magic that allows tired, hungry and fearful      refugees to simply waltz across the border to new lives in      America. The Lincoln couple, working as Magicians Without      Borders, staged a show of sleights-of-hand and humor designed      to not only entertain, but also to provide a light of hope in      dark circumstances.       Since that December trip, U.S. Customs and Border      Protection has encountered more than half a million      additional migrants hoping to enter the U.S. The vast      majority of these refugees were arrested and detained by      Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in facilities that      a growing number of experts, including Holocaust scholars,      have compared to concentration camps.       Performing at the border last year, and again this past      March, has helped Verner and Fredericks better understand the      issues there.       ``These refugees didn't want to leave their homes,'' Verner      told the Independent this week. ``They're fleeing murderous      violence, political oppression and grinding poverty, and      they're coming to the closest place where, as the Statue of      Liberty says, they can `breathe free.' ''       During their March trip, Verner and Fredericks met a six-     year-old boy named Sebastian, whose family had fled Honduras.      Because Sebastian has cerebral palsy and cannot walk, his      father had carried him on his back--for more than 1,800      miles.       The conditions and political climate of the U.S. border are      nothing, however, compared with those in Honduras,      Sebastian's father told Verner.       It's the kind of story the Lincoln residents have      encountered over and over again--all over the world.       Since founding Magicians Without Borders in 2002, Verner      and Fredericks have traveled to more than 40 countries and      performed for ``over 1 million of the most forgotten people      in the world.''       Their mission is to entertain, educate and empower.                               BEGINNINGS       In 2001 Verner, then a professor of psychology at      Burlington College, was traveling through the Balkans,      performing magic shows in refugee camps in Kosovo and      Macedonia.       ``It was a transformative experience,'' he said.       In one Macedonian camp, which sheltered about 2,000 people,      mostly Roma, Verner met a little girl named Fatima who became      his ``assistant'' for the day.       ``We couldn't understand each other's languages, but we      understood each other,'' Verner said. When it came time for      Verner to move on to the next camp, however, he could not      find Fatima to say good-bye. Disappointed, he returned to his      car, only to find Fatima hiding in the back seat. She     begged Verner to take her with him, but he could not.       Verner's driver then suggested they visit Shutka,      Macedonia, which the driver said was ``swollen with      refugees.'' Within 10 minutes of their arrival in the main      square more than 300 people had gathered to watch him      perform, Verner said.       Afterward, he recalled, ``a Roma woman who'd seen me      multiplying things in my show, came up to me holding a five-     dinari Macedonian coin. `Make more money,' she said. She      thought if I could make things multiply, why not money?''       Verner performed a trick producing a 50-dinari coin--the      equivalent of about 80 cents at the time--and the woman was      genuinely thrilled.       After she walked away, two Roma men who'd been watching      asked Verner if he could produce visas to America.       ``They were completely serious,'' Verner said. ``As if I      could wave a magic wand and Condoleezza Rice would suddenly      sign the necessary paperwork.''       These and other encounters led to an epiphany for Verner,      which he distills into a quote from fellow magician Harry      Houdini--himself a refugee from Hungary:       ``In certain circumstances, magic not only amazes and      amuses but it has the power to awaken hope that the      impossible is possible.''       Upon his return to Vermont, Verner obtained a year's leave      from Burlington College to found Magicians Without Borders.       ``That one year has turned into 18,'' he said happily.                             TEACHING MAGIC       In 2004, Magicians Without Borders       (MWB) visited El Salvador, which was still reeling in the      aftermath of a 12-year civil war that had been fought in      large part by child soldiers.       The founder-director of the Salvadoran Rural Health      Association was so impressed with Verner's school      performances that she asked him to teach some magic tricks to      children participating in a program called ``Barefoot      Angels'' (so named because many of the children had been      working barefoot in a garbage dump). Verner readily agreed.       At the end of that daylong workshop, one of the students,      14-year-old Jaime Zumba, asked, ``When are you coming back?''      Verner, who had had no return plans, hesitated, then said,      ``How about May?''       That moment, Verner said, changed the course of MWB. Since      then he's visited El Salvador more than 30 times.       Soon, some of the children wanted to do more than just      learn a few magic tricks. They were aspiring to teach it to      other children. As a result, MWB now has programs in Brazil,      Colombia, El Salvador and Costa Rica.       Two more programs have evolved in India, as well--one at a      night-care shelter for the children of brothel workers who      are trapped in the sex trade.       ``These were children who had been sleeping under mom's bed      while she was working,'' Verner recalled soberly.       That program's Hindi name, Prerana, translates into English      as ``Inspiration.''                                 DREAMS       ``We're not trying to teach them to be magicians,'' Verner      said. ``We're trying to build their confidence in themselves.      What happens is that these kids start studying and      performing, and something starts to happen, you start to see      all these benefits. It awakens dreams.''       Verner spoke of children who've gone on to pursue studies      in nursing, culinary arts and social work.       None of this would have been possible, however, without the      generous support Verner and Fredericks have received over the      years, both abroad and at home.       In the coming weeks, for instance, allies of MWB have      scheduled two fundraising events at Bixby Library in      Vergennes, which they hope will help fund another trip to the      U.S.-Mexico border in August.       Magicians Without Borders will perform for children at the      Bixby on July 25, from 6:30 to 8 p.m., then give a brief talk      about their work.       An event on Aug. 1, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., will be geared      toward adults: travel stories and performance history, with      some magic woven in.       Verner hopes MWB can make multiple trips to the border in      the future, in part because he knows what's at stake. After      all, even his own sources of hope and inspiration have      emerged from deeply, shockingly tragic circumstances.       Jaime Zumba's enthusiasm in El Salvador 15 years ago may      have changed the course of MWB, but the young man's lived      experience, like that of so many thousands who have fled      their homes, is all too familiar in that part of the world      and often inspires too little notice.       ``It is not uncommon,'' he once told Verner, ``for me to      walk over a decapitated naked body on my way to school.''                          ____________________
