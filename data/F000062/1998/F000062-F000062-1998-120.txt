 I think that was an excellent explanation, if we all understood it. I don't know a lot about logarithms. I do know about per-pack cost. And I do know we have 5 million smokers, and almost a million juvenile smokers, in the State of California. And I do know that by all the testimony we had in the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, that if the price in 5 years is over $5 a pack, we have a whopping black market on our hands.  Would you agree with that?
