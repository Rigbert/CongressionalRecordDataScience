 President, there is a saying that success is the repetition of meaningful acts day after day. The most successful individuals identify a single purpose and work toward that cause in any capacity they can find.  An Iowan named Ed Johnston perfectly fits this definition of success. Mr. Johnston, of Humboldt, Iowa, tirelessly devotes his days to helping people with disabilities. He serves on the Governor's Developmental Disabilities Council, a position he earned after immersing himself in learning about the agencies that serve those with disabilities.  Several days a week, he volunteers at the Humboldt County Courthouse to help people with special needs in fivesurrounding counties. He interacts with legislators about the importance of providing proper job training to persons with disabilities. He offers his expertise when someone seeks a wheelchair ramp or assistive technology to accommodate a physical need.  Mr. Johnston brings the invaluable insight to his work of someone who has lived the life of the people he seeks to help. He himself has a physical disability, although no one would consider him limited in any way.  Those familiar with his work admire his compassion and persistence. He is able to navigate the layers of government agencies that sometimes appear impenetrable to those who need services.  Another impressive element of Mr. Johnston's advocacy work is that it is his second career. In the early 1990s, he retired after 38 years of running his own shoe repair business and devoted himself to his current vocation.  The Humboldt Independent newspaper called Mr. Johnston ``a man on the move.'' The description is accurate. He moves government agencies, legislators and his community to respond to the needs of persons with disabilities. At age 64, Mr. Johnston is the youngest of the Iowans I have honored during Older Americans Month. I wish him many more years of his priceless work.                           fred and fern robb
