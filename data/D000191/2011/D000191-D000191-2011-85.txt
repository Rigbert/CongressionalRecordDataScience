I just got an email--and I've got to go take a phone call in the Cloak Room--but they just announced that some heavy waves have come into the harbor at Coos Bay. This would be the third period of waves. They say the fourth or the fifth might be the worst. The port tells me the docks are breaking apart. Luckily--since we had ample warning because we still do have NOAA and we still do have buoys before these Republican cuts go into effect--there were no people on the docks. At this point we're not aware that anyone has been injured. But this is a serious and developing situation. And I would expect the gentleman's district just north of mine is probably having a similar experience in Newport or other areas.
