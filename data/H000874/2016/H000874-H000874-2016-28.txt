I presume that the majority--and I will say this, that for whatever reasons--and your party is in control of both the House and the Senate. Yes, we have the Presidency, the Democrats, but no bills have reached his desk. Whether they got out of committee or not, no bills have reached his desk.  You and I both know getting out of committee means nothing. Nothing happens because it gets out of committee, other than it is eligible to come to the floor. Beyond that, nothing happens with respect to funding government. And your party is in the majority. It is not a question of blame. It is a question of no bill has passed from the Congress to the President of the United States for signature. He hasn't vetoed any bills because they haven't gotten to him. So we need to adopt a CR.  I think the gentleman is correct that we are not going to go home, I presume, without passing a CR. The government was shut down for 16 days some years ago because we wouldn't repeal the Affordable Care Act. I don't presume that is going to happen this time.  I certainly hope that we address the CR. It is not scheduled for next week.  I am going to discuss another subject in just a second that should have been scheduled, in my view, this week. But we did bills that, frankly, aren't going to pass or be sent to the President. We spent a full week--otherwise known as 25 percent of the time--that is scheduled for us to be here before the election.  Next week, it will make it 50 percent of the time, and still no CR is being brought forward. We left town in July without passing the Senate bill--it passed 68-30, a bipartisan bill--to address the critical health crisis confronting the American people, Zika. You don't schedule that for next week either on your schedule, Mr. Leader.  I am very concerned. I think America is very concerned. Certainly, on this side of the aisle, we are very concerned.  I want to make a representation here publicly, so that America will know and you will know, that I am prepared to say that almost everybody in our caucus--I would say ``unanimous,'' but I haven't talked to everybody--is ready to pass the bipartisan Senate bill, which passed 68-30, which would appropriate $1.1 billion.  Tony Fauci was on the Hill, who is the director of NIH's NIAID, National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, which of course Zika falls within the ambit of his expertise and authority.                              {time}  1230  He has said as of October 1, he is going to have no money to deal with the development of a vaccine. I know the gentleman is as concerned as I am because we have talked about setting up funds for disasters; and this is a health crisis, obviously a disaster.  Let me ask the gentleman if he expects Zika funding to come to the floor either with the CR or as a separate bill, and again, I represent to him, I believe every Democrat--I haven't talked to every Democrat, but I believe every Democrat will support the bipartisan Senate bill which passed 68-30, which appropriates money and has the virtue, unlike the conference report, which the House added poison pill language that they knew neither the Democrats would support in the House nor the Senate nor would the President support, undermining, frankly, the ability to have health services delivered in Puerto Rico to women, the epicenter of the Zika crisis.  It should have been no surprise that that was not going to be supported, and the President made it very clear he was not going to support it. We need to reach a compromise. The Senate reached a compromise. I urge the majority leader to address this and bring it to the floor. I tell him, he will have my full support and engagement for the Senate bill, which was a bipartisan bill.  I yield to my friend to let us know when he expects to deal with this critical health crisis confronting the American people.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Before I begin, I want to thank the gentleman. At the very beginning of this crisis, you and I sat together. At the very beginning of this crisis, you and I compiled a group of Members on both sides of the aisle with the expertise to deal with it. $600 million quickly went out the door to fight it, to combat it. The Senate approved $1.1 billion.  I am somewhat excited to hear that all the Democrats will change their mind now and vote for the bill because I would like to remind the gentleman that in June this House took up this issue because we knew what would happen in the summer. We know what is transpiring in Florida because we predicted that it would because it was already happening in Puerto Rico, but that was not the case on this floor that night. Everyone on the other side said ``no.''  Well, you know what, in the Senate, they have taken this up three times. Your side of the aisle decided to leave without dealing with this issue. They could have dealt with this issue this week. This is the exact amount of money that the Senate voted for unanimously over there--maybe not unanimously, but bipartisanly. This is not one to play politics with. We did our job here.  It is quite ironic that in clarification on your past remark saying Republicans are in the majority here, yes, that is true, and you saw that happen. The rules in the Senate are much different, where it empowers the minority to stop. That is why we are talking about a CR. But this should not be the case. You could have challenged your colleagues in that Senate, in your party, to stop the filibuster, that the people should not have to wait.  We have been in those rooms together. I know your desire. When you and I talked about putting the emergency funding together, you know what, that is an appropriations issue. We need this to get done. They need the money. We need to combat it, and we need to continue to monitor it. That is why we dealt with this in June.  That is why I have the frustration that I have. Even when we came back this week, the Senate Democrats were in the exact same place they were before. This money goes to the community centers in Puerto Rico, exactly as the President requested.  So it is not a time to play politics. It is not a time to get frustrated about a different issue that you had that night so you couldn't vote ``yes.'' That is the truth behind this, and that is wrong.
