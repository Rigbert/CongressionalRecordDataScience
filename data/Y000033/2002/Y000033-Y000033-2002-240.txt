Mr. Speaker, with the passage of H.R. 3609 pipeline safety legislation, Congress has completed a critical step in improving the safety and reliability of the nation's interstate natural gas pipeline system. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), within the Department of Transportation has principal responsibility for developing, applying, and enforcing the pipeline safety rules that enhances the safety of the nation's pipelines and protects the public.  OPS is required to enforce these rules without regard to market conditions or commercial considerations. It must diligently seek to promote safety above any competing objectives. Among the most important of existing pipeline safety rules is the requirement that natural gas pipelines not exceed maximum allowable operating pressure, or MAOP. A pipeline's MAOP is established on the basis of engineering principles, testing, historical operations, and experience. Pipeline operators who exceed MAOP violate the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety regulations and may be fined for such violations.  No agency other than OPS should be allowed to re-interpret or water down pipeline safety regulations based on its view of market or commercial concerns. Allowing any other agency to usurp OPS's function will undermine the hard work the Congress has completed to enhance pipeline safety and minimize the risks of pipeline ruptures that may cause serious injury and death.                          ____________________
