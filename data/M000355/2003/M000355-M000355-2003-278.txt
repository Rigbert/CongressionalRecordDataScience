 President, I apologize to the Senator from Colorado. I misspoke earlier when I thought it was cleared on the other side. We are working on that now. Hopefully, we will be able to get it cleared. If the Senator from Colorado will agree to temporarily set it aside and go back to it before we finish the bill, we hope to get it cleared.
