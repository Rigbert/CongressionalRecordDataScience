 President, there are legitimate issues being raised about how adults are dealt with in this SCHIP bill. First of all, adding adults to SCHIP should have never been allowed. It was wrong when the Clinton administration started it. It was wrong when the Bush administration continued it. Stopping it is the right thing to do.  However, I think this amendment goes too far, too fast, and I encourage my colleagues to consider how the Finance Committee bill deals with adults. Let me be clear, in some States, the problem is extreme. Some States cover more adults than children.
