Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let me observe with respect to the gentleman's comment about we did send five bills, 75 percent of government spending, discretionary spending to the President. The President signed it. But when he says it is the best in 25 years, I will remind him that when I was majority leader in 2007, we passed all 12 bills through this House.  Mr. McCARTHY. Not into law.
