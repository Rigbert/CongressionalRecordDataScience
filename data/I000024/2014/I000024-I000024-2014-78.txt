President, I wish to pay tribute to a true American hero, Army 2LT Joe Cunningham of Kingston, OK who died on August 13, 2011 serving our Nation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Lieutenant Cunningham was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Army National Guard, Stillwater, OK.  Joe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2001 and joined the Army Reserves as a military policeman. He volunteered todeploy to Iraq in 2005 where he served as a team leader. After returning from Iraq, he served as a weapons instructor for deploying soldiers. In 2008, Joe switched to the Oklahoma National Guard, serving 18 months in the Air Guard before moving on to the Army Guard, where he was accepted to Officer Candidate School. In August 2010, Joe was commissioned as a second lieutenant and deployed in June 2011 to Afghanistan as the executive officer of B Co 1/179 Infantry.  Joe leaves behind his father Kirk Tucker, from Kingston, and siblings Tracy, Terri, Bethany, Ashton, Ricky and Taylor. He was preceded in death by his mother Dorothy Cunningham. He touched the lives of many as evidenced by comments written on his online guest book.       ``I knew Joe he was an inspiration to the soldiers of Bco.      1/179 he always put soldiers first he is what a soldier      wanted to be professional thru and thru in the short time I      had to work with him he truly opened my eyes and changed my      views on things he was and always will be a great friend and      a soldier that will be greatly missed. God Bless Joe      Cunningham may god watch and protect you thru ``through'' the      gates of heaven you shall be missed. ''       You will be missed by all. It was pleasure and an honor to      have you as troop under my supervision while assigned to the      138th Security Forces Squadron. RIP friend and brother.''  Joe lived a life of love for his family, friends, and country. He enjoyed hunting, fishing and sports. Joe was a big Oklahoma Sooners fan and held season tickets for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He loved kids, and one of his greatest joys was spending time with Korlee Cunningham.  Joe will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                       Sergeant Bret D. Isenhower  Mr. President, I now wish to pay tribute to a true American hero, Army SGT Bret D. Isenhower of Lamar, OK, who died on September 9, 2011, serving our nation in Paktya Province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Isenhower was assigned to 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Battalion, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.  Sergeant Isenhower was killed by enemy small arms fire when his team was attacked while conducting combat operations in Zurmat District. He was 26 years old.  Our prayers go out to those in his family he left behind: father Kevin Isenhower; mother Janet Dawsey; sisters Bridgette Hall and Krysten Isenhower; and nephew Jackson Hall.  Bret graduated from Seminole High School in 2003 and then attended East Central University and was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter. Determined to be a soldier, he joined the Oklahoma National Guard in 2006 as an infantryman. He deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for a yearlong deployment in 2007-08. He rose to the rank of sergeant and team leader.  Bret actively looked for ways to serve his community and his fellow citizens. On one occasion, he and a friend were enroute to school to take a final and noticed a woman pulled over on the side of the road with a flat tire. Bret pulled the car over and helped change the tire without regard to the time that it took. Needless to say, he missed his final exam, but didn't care because it was the ``right thing to do.'' Bret also served as a volunteer firefighter at the Seminole Fire Department and the Seminole County 911 dispatcher.  Bret cared deeply for his family and would often let his 3-year-old nephew Jackson use him as a human jungle gym. He was full of kindness and yet very brave under fire.  It is clearly evident how much this young man impacted his family, community and fellow citizens and soldiers by reading through some of the following quotes.  Laura Rose, a former teacher at Seminole High said, ``Not only did he give the ultimate sacrifice for his country, but he was a good person too. Some students go on their way and you never see them again, but Bret would come and visit and let me know how he was doing.''  Specialist Randen Allison credits Bret with saving his life in Afghanistan by reacting quickly and placing a tourniquet on his arm. When Specialist Allison thanked Bret for helping, Bret responded by saying, ``Don't worry about it. I'm just doing my job.''  A warrior indeed, Bret died in the heat of a firefight. These tough fights took the life of Bret from us prematurely, but make no mistake; it is a fight we will win. We must continue our unwavering support for the men and women protecting our Nation and allies.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Bret's family. He lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                    First Lieutenant Damon T. Leehan  Mr. President, I also pay tribute to a true American hero, Army 1LT Damon T. Leehan of Moore, OK, who died on August 14, 2011 serving our Nation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Lieutenant Leehan was assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.  Lieutenant Leehan died of injuries sustained when the vehicle in which he was riding was attacked with an improvised explosive device in the Alingar District while conducting combat operations. He was 30 years old.  Damon graduated from Edmond High School and enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 1998 at the age of 17. He had previously deployed to Afghanistan in 2003 as a combat medic. In 2008, he successfully completed Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.  In his civilian role, Damon served his community as an Xray technician since 2001 at the Integris Southwest Medical Center in Oklahoma City.  Damon consistently impressed and touched the lives of those around him. This is evident by reading through some quotes.  Ashely Hale, his supervisor at the hospital said, ``He was a hard-working, outgoing, well-known, well-liked co-worker . . . he had many friends here.''  Major General Myles Deering, the Adjutant General of Oklahoma said, ``LT Leehan served his nation and our state with great honor and distinction for more than a decade. His sacrifice will never be forgotten.''  Wendy Deatsch, of Edmond said, ``I was one of his high school teachers. He was one of my very favorite students. He always had a smile on his face and had a saying that always put one on mine. He would say, `Miss Wilks, turn that frown upside down!' It always worked!''  Curtis Meloy, of Cushing said, ``Damon was a great soldier, and a better man. I am truly better for having known him.''  Members of Damon's platoon posted, ``LT, we miss you and you were a true friend and leader. Our platoon will never be the same without you! Your leadership will be missed.''  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Damon's family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in his family he left behind: his wife Audrey, children, Emma and Ethan, father Dennis, and mother Marina Blevins.  Damon lived a life of love for his wife and two children, family, friends, and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.                 Private First Class Tony J. Potter Jr.  Mr. President, I pay tribute to a true American hero, Army PFC Tony J. ``TJ'' Potter Jr. of Okmulgee, OK, who died on September 9, 2011, serving our Nation in Paktya Province, Afghanistan. Private First Class Potter was assigned to 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Battalion, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.  TJ was killed by enemy small arms fire when his team was attacked while conducting combat operations in Zurmat District. He was 20 years old.  Born 3 months early, TJ wasn't the biggest kid growing up, but he more than compensated for it in drive and enthusiasm. TJ graduated fromOkmulgee High School in 2010 after leading his football team to a state championship. Determined to be a soldier and join the Oklahoma National Guard, even over his parents' reservations, TJ enlisted as an infantryman prior to graduation in April 2010.  In such a short time on this earth, TJ had an incredible impact on his family, his community and his brothers in arms.  TJ's friend Samuel Trout said, ``Everybody knew him, everybody got along with him, you could talk to him.''  Fellow co-worker Jon Skinner said, ``He was always a great guy, he was always a hard worker, down to earth, great guy to kick it with.''  Fellow high school student Earnest Woodruff said, ``He tried to help everybody at practice. He always wanted us to run harder so we would do better when we went out to the games. He was always going 100 percent. I just know that he's going to be in a better place.''  Football coach Shane Page said TJ could do anything that he put his mind to and ``Just every day we have to be thankful for the fact that we do have the soldiers out there fighting to protect us and everything. I mean it's an honor to know that he was a part of that but it's a very, very sad day.''  His mother, Yvonne said, ``He was the rock of our family. He held everything together.'' His father, Tony Sr. added, ``If he felt we were drifting apart, he would bring us back together. He was our glue. You could always count on him for everything.''  TJ lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to TJ's family, his wife and high school sweetheart Emily, his son Tony James `TJ' Potter who was born after his death, and parents Tony and Yvonne Potter. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                          ____________________
