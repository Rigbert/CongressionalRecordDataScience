 President, I would like to amend the amendment by removing the word ``likely.'' So that the amendment reads:       Information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the      manufacture of explosive materials, if the person intends and      knows that such explosive materials or information will be      used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes      a Federal criminal offense or a criminal purpose affecting      interstate commerce.
