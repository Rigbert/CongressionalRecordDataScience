President, I am pleased that we are finally turning our attention to this legislation and a debate over the best way to increase the number of H-1B visas, a policy goal that is shared widely in this body. The bill was reported from the Judiciary Committee more than six months ago. It has taken us a very long time to get from Point A to Point B, and it has often appeared that the majority has been more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually making this bill law.  The Democratic Leader has consistently said that we would be willing to accept very strict time limits on debating amendments, and would be willing to conduct the entire debate on S. 2045 in less than a day. Our Leader has also consistently said that it is critical that the Senate take up proposals to provide parity for refugees from right-wing regimes in Central America and to address an issue that has been ignored for far too long--how we should treat undocumented aliens who have lived here for decades, paying taxes and contributing to our economy. I joined in the call for action on H-1B and other critical immigration issues, but our efforts were rebuffed by the majority.  Indeed, months went by in which the majority made no attempt to negotiate these differences, time which many members of the majority instead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that the Democratic Party is hostile to this bill and that only Republicans are interested in solving the legitimate employment shortages faced by many sectors of American industry. Considering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator Lieberman, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face.  Finally, last week, the majority made a counteroffer that did not provide as many amendments as we would like, but which did allow amendments related to immigration generally. We responded enthusiastically to this proposal, but individual members of the majority objected, and there is still no agreement to allow immigration amendments. At least some members of the majority are apparently unwilling even to vote on issues that are critical to members of the Latino community. This is deeply unfortunate, and leaves those of us who are concerned about humanitarian immigration issues with an uncomfortable choice. We can either address the legitimate needs of the high-tech industry in the vacuum that the majority has imposed, or we can refuse to proceed on this bill until the majority affords us the opportunity to address other important immigration needs. I voted yesterday to proceed to S. 2045 because I believe it presents a good starting point for discussion, and because I believe we should make progress on immigration issues in this Congress. I still hope that an agreement can be reached with the majority that will allow votes on other important immigration matters as part of our consideration of this bill.  I believe there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, and a short-term increase in H-1B visas is an appropriate response. Due to the stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years, unemployment is lower than the best-case scenario envisioned by most economists. Increasing the number of available H-1B visas is particularly important for the high-tech industry, which has done so much to contribute to our strong economy. Although it is important that the high-tech industry ensure that it is making maximum possible use of American workers, it should also have access to highly-skilled workers from abroad, particularly workers who were educated at American universities. Under current law, however, which allowed for 115,000 visas for FY 2000, every visa was allotted by March, only halfway through the fiscal year.  So I support this bill's call for an increase in the number of visas. But I believe the legislation can be improved, and I look forward to the opportunity to make improvements through the amendment process. Most importantly, instead of including an open-ended provision exempting from the cap those foreign workers with graduate degrees from American universities, as S. 2045 does, I believe we should retain a concrete cap on the number of these visas. I believe we should increase the cap to 200,000, and then set aside a significant percentage of those visas for such workers. This should address employers' needs for highly-skilled workers, while also limiting the number of visas that go to foreign workers with less specialized skills.  I regret that we will likely be unable to offer other important amendments to this bill. For much of the summer, the majority implied that we were simply using the concerns of Latino voters as a smokescreen to avoid considering S. 2045. Speaking for myself, although I have had reservations about certain aspects of S. 2045, I voted to report it from the Judiciary Committee so that we could move forward in our discussions of the bill. I did not seek to offer immigration amendments on the Senate floor because I wanted to derail S. 2045. Nor did the White House urge Congress to consider other immigration issues as part of the H-1B debate because the President wanted to play politics with this issue, as the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee suggested on the floor last Friday. Rather, the majority's inaction on a range of immigration measures in this Congress forced those of us who were concerned about immigration issues to attempt to raise those issues. Under our current leadership, the opportunity to enact needed change in our immigration laws does not come around very often, to put it mildly.  It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration bills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, with only a few weeks remaining before we adjourn, this will be the first immigration bill to be debated on the floor in this Congress. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.  The bipartisan bills that have suffered from the majority's neglect include both modest bills designed to assist particular immigrant groups and larger bills designed to reform substantial portions of our immigration and asylum laws. Bills to assist Syrian Jews, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Liberians, Hondurans, Cubans, and Salvadorans all need attention. Bills to restore due process rights and limited public benefits to legal permanent residents have been ignored.  The Refugee Protection Act, a bipartisan bill with 10 sponsors that I introduced with Senator Brownback, has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, despite my request as Ranking Member. The Refugee Protection Act addresses the issue of expedited removal, the process under which aliens arriving in the United States can be returned immediately to their native lands at the say-so of a low-level INS officer. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in this Chamber in 1996, and the Senate voted to use it only during immigration emergencies. This Senate-passed restriction was removed in what was probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever witnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on that 1996 amendment, and I hope that it again gains the support of a majority of my colleagues.  As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a system where we are removing people who arrive here either without proper documentation or with facially valid documentation that an INS officer suspects is invalid. This policy ignores the fact that people fleeing despotic regimes are quite often unable to obtain travel documents before they go--they must move quickly and cannot depend upon the government that is persecuting them to provide them with the proper paperwork for departure. In the limited time that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were kicked out of our country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovar Albanian was summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers.  The majority has mishandled even those immigration bills that needed to be passed by a date certain to avoid significant humanitarian and diplomatic consequences. First, the Senate failed to pass a bill to make permanent the visa waiver program that allows Americans to travel to numerous other countries without a visa. The visa waiver pilot program expired on April 30, and the House passed legislation to make the program permanent in a timely manner, understanding the importance of not allowing this program--which our citizens and the citizens of many of our closest allies depend upon--to lapse. The Senate, however, simply ignored the deadline and has subsequently ignored numerous deadlines for administrative extensions of the program.  Second, the Senate has thus far refused to act on the bipartisan S. 2058, which would extend the deadline by one year for Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Haitians to apply for adjustment ofstatus under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, NACARA, and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, HRIFA. The original deadline expired on March 31. But the Senate did not extend the deadline--an action that the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved--by March 31. And the Senate has not acted to extend the deadline in the intervening five and a half months. No one has expressed any opposition to S. 2058, which counts Senators Mack and Helms among its sponsors; rather, the majority has simply allowed the bill to sit and fester, perhaps holding it hostage to the passage of S. 2045. As a result, we in the Congress have had to rely upon the Administration's assurances that it would not remove those who would be aided by the extension from the United States while this legislation was pending. As someone who has served for more than 25 years in the Senate, I find it profoundly disturbing that this body must rely on the Administration not to enforce the law because it has taken us so long to actually make good on our intention to change it. We should not need to rely on the good graces of the Administration--we should do our job and legislate.  I am well aware that immigration is just one of the many issues that Congress must address. Indeed, there may be some Congresses where immigration needs to be placed on the backburner so that we can address other issues. But this is not such a Congress. It was only four years ago that we passed two bills with far-reaching effects on immigration law--the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our careful review and rethinking. Among many others, Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, and Durbin have been actively involved in promoting necessary changes to those laws, in an attempt to rededicate the United States to its historic role as a leader in immigration policy. But their efforts too have been ignored by the majority.  When a bill such as S. 2045 comes to the floor, then, those of us who are concerned about immigration legislation would be abdicating our duty not to raise other potential immigration legislation. Most members of both parties want to see a significant increase in the number of H-1B visas. If there had been another avenue to obtain consideration of the rest of our immigration agenda, we would have taken it. But such an avenue was not offered.  I voted to proceed to consideration of this bill. I hold out hope that we can reach an agreement to discuss other critical immigration matters. If the majority truly wishes to display compassionate conservatism, and show concern for all Americans, such an agreement should be easy to reach.                          ____________________
