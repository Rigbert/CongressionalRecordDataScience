President, section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act expires in a matter of weeks. Senator Lee and I have a bipartisan bill, the USA FREEDOM Act, that would end the use of section 215 to authorize the bulk collection of Americans' phone records and replace it with a more targeted program. It also would enact other important reforms to bring more accountability and transparency to government surveillance. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is bringing that same bill for a vote in the House on Wednesday.  Last week, some opponents came to the floor to voice their opposition. They claimed that ending this bulk collection program would somehow put our national security at risk and that a bulk collection program like this could somehow have prevented the September 11 attacks. But the facts are not on their side. According to the headline of a recent National Journal story, these opponents of reform have made ``dubious claims in defense of NSA surveillance.''  I agree these claims are dubious, and I want to set the record straight. I ask unanimous consent that the National Journal story dated May 8, 2015, and an analysis by the Center for Democracy and Technology of similar claims be printed in the Record.  One Senator stated on the Senate floor last week, ``If this program had existed before 9/11, it is quite possible we would have known that 9/11 hijacker Khalid Al Mihdhar was living in San Diego and was making phone calls to an Al Qaeda safe house in Yemen.''  Another seemed to suggest that the bulk collection program would ``have prevented 9/11.''  When I was chairman in the last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee held six hearings to examine revelations about government surveillance activities. At one of those hearings, I asked former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke, who was working in the Bush administration on September 11, whether the NSA bulk collection program would have prevented those attacks. He testified that the government had the information it needed to prevent the attacks but failed to properly share that information among Federal agencies.  Senator Bob Graham, who investigated the September 11th attacks as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, likewise has said that ``there were plenty of opportunities without having to rely on this metadata system for the FBI and intelligence agencies to have located Mihdhar.''  The other claim that has been made repeatedly over the past few days is that, as one Senator put it, the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is ``very effective at keeping America safe.'' Another stated that the USA FREEDOM Act would ``eliminate the essential intelligence this program collects.''  But numerous national security experts also have concluded that the NSA's bulk collection program is not essential to national security. The President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, which included two former national security officials, stated:       The information contributed to terrorist investigations by      the use of section 215 telephony metadata was not essential      to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in      a timely manner using conventional section 215 orders.  Former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the review group's recommendation to end the government's collection of that data and instead allow the government to search phone records held by the telecommunications providers would not add a substantial burden to the government. That is precisely the approach of our bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act.  Last year, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General supported a prior version of the USA FREEDOM Act, which also ended bulk collection under section 215 and replaced it with a more targeted phone records program. The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence said that our bill ``preserve[d] essential Intelligence Community capabilities.''  These individuals are not newcomers to the issue of national security. They understand the threats to our Nation. They do not have a political motive. They have the best interests of our Nation and its values in mind when they tell us that we can end the dragnet collection of innocent Americans' phone records and keep our country safe.  The USA FREEDOM Act does not just end NSA's bulk collection program under section 215. It also fills other gaps in our intelligence capabilities. It ensures that the government can quickly obtain business records--including phone records--in emergency situations. It ensures that if a foreign terrorist who poses a serious threat comes into the United States, the government does not have to stop its surveillance while it seeks emergency wiretap authorization from the Attorney General. It ensures that the government need not terminate FISA surveillance on a foreigner who temporarily travels outside the United States. And it ensures that the FBI has the tools it needs to investigate individuals who are facilitating the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on behalf of a foreign government or terrorist organization. These provisions were requested by the FBI and by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. They were not part of the bill that was filibustered in the Senate in November.  As a final matter, it is notable that there has been not a single Senate committee hearing on surveillance reform or the expiring provisions in the 5 months of this new Congress under Republican leadership. There has been zero committee consideration on the bill that Senator McConnell has now brought directly to the Senate calendar that would simply extend theseexpiring provisions. I recall the promises that under new leadership the committees would work through regular order, but that has not occurred even though it was apparent to all last year that we would need to grapple with long-overdue reforms. This lack of leadership or any committee process is also despite the fact that the leader and chairmen of the relevant committees would not even let us debate the USA FREEDOM Act last year, in part because it had not gone through committee. As the process moves forward this year, we should not be hearing complaints about lack of process from those who did not provide it.  There is no question that the USA FREEDOM Act contains far-reaching surveillance reforms. But the most high-ranking intelligence officials in the country have endorsed its approach because it is a responsible bill. It protects Americans' privacy and keeps them safe. The Senate should take up the bill once the House passes it this week.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From National Journal, May 8, 2015]     Republicans Make Dubious Claims in Defense of NSA Surveillance   Mitch McConnell and his cohort of security hawks are stopping at nothing to renew the spy agency's phone dragnet. But how fair is their                                 defense?                            (By Dustin Volz)       One by one, several powerful Republican senators took to      the floor Thursday morning to offer one of the most full-     throated defenses of the National Security Agency's bulk      collection of billions of U.S. phone records since Edward      Snowden exposed the program nearly two years ago.       The crux of their argument is unmistakable: The NSA's      expansive surveillance powers need to remain intact and      unchanged to keep Americans safe from potential terrorist      threats--and if these powers existed before Sept. 11, 2001,      they may have assisted in preventing the attacks on the World      Trade Center and the Pentagon.       But some of the talking points used by Senate Majority      Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies appear to rely heavily      on assertions that are either dubious in their veracity or      elide important contextual details.       Here is a review of some of their declarations:       Claim: ``Not only have these tools kept us safe, there has      not been a single incident, not one, of intentional abuse of      them.''--McConnell       McConnell may have been referring specifically to the phone      records program here, but the NSA does not, as he implies,      have a spotless record.       According to a 2013 inspector general report, NSA analysts      intentionally misused foreign surveillance authorities at      least a dozen times in the past decade, sometimes for the      purpose of spying on their romantic interests. So-called      ``loveint''--short for ``love intelligence''--was revealed by      the inspector general in response to a letter sent from      Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who this year renewed a call      for the Justice Department to provide an update on how it was      handling its investigation into the alleged willful abuses      and to ``appropriate accountability for those few who violate      the trust placed in them.''       Additionally, a 2012 internal audit obtained by The      Washington Post found that the NSA has violated privacy      restrictions set in place for its surveillance programs      thousands of times each year since 2008. The audit found that      most--though not all--infractions were unintended.       Claim: ``The compromise legislation rolls us back to the      same thing we were doing pre-9/11.''--Senate Intelligence      Chairman Richard Burr       The USA Freedom Act referenced by Burr would reauthorize      three key surveillance provisions under the post-9/11 Patriot      Act. It would usher in several reforms related to      transparency and oversight, but it would keep those      authorities intact. Section 215 of the law would no longer      allow for the bulk collection of U.S. phone metadata by the      NSA, but the authority--created after 9/11--would still      exist.       Claim: ``The alternatives to the current program would not      come close to offering the capabilities that now enable us to      protect Americans.''--Sen. Tom Cotton       Cotton's claim does not align with the stance of Director      of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-Attorney      General Eric Holder, who sent a letter to lawmakers last year      expressing their support for an earlier iteration of the      Freedom Act. ``The intelligence community believes that your      bill preserves essential intelligence-community capabilities;      and the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director      of National Intelligence support your bill and believe that      it is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil      liberties and increases transparency,'' the letter read. That      version of the Freedom Act is widely considered more limiting      of surveillance powers than the one being debated in Congress      this year.       Claim: ``One alternative offered by opponents of this      program is to have phone companies retain control of all call      data and provide the NSA only the data responsive to searches      phone companies would run on the NSA's behalf. This is not      technologically feasible.''--Cotton       The reliance on phone companies to retain call data already      occurs, as they are the ones who turn the records over to the      government in bulk. Cotton, who voted for a pared down      iteration of the Freedom Act last year when he served in the      House, cites an 85-page study from the National Research      Council to support this assertion. But the Arkansas freshman      appears to be conflating its findings, which dealt with      whether software could fully replace bulk collection, with      what backers of the Freedom Act are attempting to do.      ``Although no software can fully replace bulk with targeted      information collection, software can be developed to more      effectively target collection and to control the usage of      collected data,'' the report concluded. Cotton's      reservations--that the new system may take longer than the      old--have more to do with process than technological      capabilities.       Claim: ``Here's the truth. If this program had existed      before 9/11, it is quite possible that we would have known      that the 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar was living in San      Diego and making phone calls to an al-Qaida safehouse in      Yemen. There's no guarantee we would have known. Theres no      way we can go back in time and prove it, but there is a      probability that we would have known and there's a      probability that American lives could have been saved.''--     Sen. Marco Rubio.       Rubio hedges his language several times with this claim,      but the statement still omits important context. As reported      by a 2013 ProPublica investigation, ``U.S. intelligence      agencies knew the identity of the hijacker in question, Saudi      national Khalid al-Mihdhar, long before 9/11 and had the      ability find him, but they failed to do so.'' Such missed      opportunities to disrupt Midhar's activities, which were      being monitored by at least as early as 1999, reflect a      failure of information sharing among intelligence agencies,      ProPublica notes, and are described in detail in the 9/11      Commission report.                                  ____        Senators' Questionable Claims About NSA Bulk Collection                   Center for Democracy & Technology       On May 7th, 2015, the Second Circuit issued a ruling that      declared the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone      records was clearly unlawful under the Section 215 of the      PATRIOT Act. The ruling provided another boost to supporters      of surveillance reform and the backers of the USA FREEDOM      Act. Hours after the ruling came down, several U.S.      Senators--Mitch McConnell, Richard Burr, Tom Cotton, Jeff      Sessions, and Marco Rubio--took to the Senate Floor to      forcefully defend the NSA's bulk collection program. The      Senators made some statements that merit a second look, and      serious skepticism.       Claim 1: The NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone      records is essential to national security. ``Under      consideration in the House and proposed in the Senate is the      socalled USA FREEDOM Act, which will eliminate the essential      intelligence this program collects.''--Senator Tom Cotton       The weight of public evidence contradicts this claim, based      on statements from experts with access to classified      intelligence:       The Attorney General and the Director of National      Intelligence stated that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014--which      is in all ways identical to or less restrictive of      surveillance than the 2014 bill--``preserves essential      Intelligence Community capabilities'' though the bill ``bans      bulk collection under a variety of authorities.''       The President's Review Group noted in 2014 that the bulk      collection program yielded information that was ``not      essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been      obtained in a timely manner using conventional section 215      orders.''       The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board stated in      2014: ``Based on the information provided to the Board,      including classified briefings and documentation, we have not      identified a single instance involving a threat to the United      States in which the program made a concrete difference in the      outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. Moreover, we are      aware of no instance in which the program directly      contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown      terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack.''       Senators Wyden, Heinrich, and Udall said in 2013 ``[We]      have reviewed this surveillance extensively and have seen no      evidence that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records      has provided any intelligence of value that could not have      been gathered through less intrusive means.''       It's important not to conflate the value of Sec. 215      overall with the effectiveness of the use of Section 215 for      bulk collection. Sec. 215 can be used for targeted--not just      bulk--data collection. The USA FREEDOM Act ends nationwide      bulk collection under Sec. 215, but preserves the      government's ability to use Sec. 215 for more targeted      collection. What is at stake with USA FREEDOM is not Sec. 215      itself, but its continued use for bulk domestic surveillance.       Claim 2: The bulk collection program could have stopped 9/     11. ``Here is the truth. If this program had existed before      9/11, it is quite possible we would have known that 9/11      hijacker Khalid Al Mihdhar was living in San Diego and was      making phone calls to an Al     Qaeda safe house in Yemen.''--Senator Marco Rubio       A bulk collection program was not necessary to find Al      Mihdhar prior to 9/11. As the PCLOB report details, the NSA      had already begun intercepting calls to and from the safe      house in Yemen in the late 1990s. Since the government knew      the number of the safe house, and Al Mihdhar was calling that      number, it would only be necessary to collect the phone      records of the safe house to discover Al Mihdhar in San      Diego. This is, in fact, an example of how targeted      surveillance would have been more effective than bulk      collection. The 9/11 Commission Report and other sources note      that the CIA was aware of Mihdhar well before the attack and      missed multiple opportunities to deny him entry to the U.S.      or intensify their surveillance of him.       Claim 3: Bulk collection of phone records is the same as a      subpoena. ``This is the way the system works and has worked      for the last 50 years--40 years at least. A crime occurs. A      prosecutor or the DEA agent investigates. They issue a      subpoena to the local phone company that has these telephone      toll records--the same thing you get in the mail--and they      send them in response to the subpoena.''--Senator Jeff      Sessions       The Second Circuit opinion, which held that the bulk      collection program is unlawful, included a lengthy comparison      of subpoenas and the bulk collection program. The bulk      collection program encompasses a vastly larger quantity of      records than could be obtained with a subpoena. The Second      Circuit notes that subpoenas typically seek records of      particular individuals or entities during particular time      periods, but the government claims Sec. 215 provides      authority to collect records connected to everyone--on an      ``ongoing daily basis''--for an indefinite period extending      into the future.       Claim 4: The government is only analyzing a few phone      records. ``The next time that any politician--Senator,      Congressman--talking head, whoever it may be, stands up and      says ``The U.S. Government is [. . .] going through your      phone records,'' they are lying. It is not true, except for      some very isolated instances--in the hundreds--of individuals      for whom there is reasonable suspicion that they could have      links to terrorism.''--Senator Marco Rubio       The NSA's telephony bulk collection program collects the      phone records of millions of Americans with no connection to      a crime or terrorism. These records are stored with the NSA      and they are analyzed scores of times each year when the NSA      queries the numbers' connection to the phone numbers of      suspects. Moreover, until 2014, when the NSA suspected a      phone number was connected to terrorism, the NSA analyzed the      phone records ``three hops'' out--querying those who called      those who called those who called the original suspect      number. As a result, the PCLOB estimated, a single query      could subject the full calling records of over 420,000 phone      numbers to deeper scrutiny. In 2014, the President limited      the query to ``two hops''--though this can still encompass      the full call records of thousands of phone numbers. The USA      FREEDOM Act (Sec. 101) would authorize the government to      obtain ``two hops'' worth of call records from telecom      companies.       Claim 5: The USA FREEDOM Act threatens privacy by leaving      phone records with telecom companies. ``[T]he opponents of      America's counterterror programs would rather trust      telecommunication companies to hold this data and search it      on behalf of our government. [. . .] In addition to making us      less safe, the USA FREEDOM Act would make our privacy less      secure.''--Senator Mitch McConnell       The telecom companies already have the phone records since      the records are created in the normal course of their      business. The USA FREEDOM Act does not shift control of data      from NSA to telecoms; the bill limits the volume of what the      government can collect from companies with a single 215      order. Keeping the records with the phone companies, as the      USA FREEDOM Act would require, does not create a new privacy      intrusion, or, according to the public record, pose new      security risks. In contrast, it is highly intrusive for the      government to demand companies provide a copy of the      communication records of millions of Americans on a daily      basis to a secretive military intelligence agency for data      mining.       One last important point: The discussion on the Senate      Floor centered exclusively on the bulk collection of phone      records. However, the debate and the legislation before      Congress are not just about one telephony metadata program.      The debate is over whether the government should have the      authority to collect a variety of records in bulk under the      PATRIOT Act. The government has claimed that its bulk      collection authority extends to any type of record that can      reveal hidden relationships among individuals--which could      include phone call, email, cell phone location, and financial      transaction records. Framing the issue in terms of phone      records makes the problem seem much smaller than it is,      especially as our society moves into a technology-enabled      future where each individual will create much more metadata      and digital records than the present. The stakes are high.                          ____________________
