President, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking member in a colloquy regarding the increasing demand for investigative work by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Rhode Island.  Neither the Bureau nor its predecessor, the U.S. Customs Service, has stationed a permanent investigator or special agent in Rhode Island. Several years ago, two special agents were designated to serve my State but were stationed in Boston, where they have frequently been pulled away to other duties.  Without a permanent investigative presence in Rhode Island, serious and growing challenges remain unaddressed, including financial crimes, money laundering, and the smuggling of narcotics and other contraband that enter by marine vessels and on international flights at Rhode Island's T.F. Green Airport.  The legislation before us includes an additional $20,300,000 to increase investigations staffing for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I applaud the chairman and ranking member for providing these funds and for including language in the committee report recognizing the need to devote additional resources to the core investigative missions of the Bureau. I would ask my colleagues, the Senators from Mississippi and West Virginia, to join me in urging the Bureau to ensure that Rhode Island and other underserved States receive a permanent investigative presence to meet these growing challenges.
