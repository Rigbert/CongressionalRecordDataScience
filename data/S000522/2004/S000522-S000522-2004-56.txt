Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 195) expressing the sense of Congress that a minute of silence should be observed annually at 11:00 a.m. on Veterans Day, November 11, in honor of the veterans of all United States wars and to memorialize those members of the Armed Forces who gave their lives in the defense of the United States.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 195       Whereas Reverend George Fox, Rabbi Alexander Goode,      Reverend Clark Poling, and Father John Washington served      aboard the USAT Dorchester during World War II;       Whereas Reverend Fox, Rabbi Goode, Reverend Poling, and      Father Washington were referred to as the ``Four Chaplains'';       Whereas, on February 3, 1943, the Dorchester was hit by an      enemy torpedo and began to sink;       Whereas in the face of grave danger the Four Chaplains      sought to calm and reassure the men on board;       Whereas the Four Chaplains handed out lifejackets and      directed the frightened men to lifeboats;       Whereas when the last lifejacket had been handed out, the      Four Chaplains removed their own lifejackets and gave them to      four men who had none;       Whereas the Dorchester sank and took with her 672 men and      the Four Chaplains, who stood arm in arm with their heads      bowed in prayer and went down with the ship;       Whereas none of the Four Chaplains inquired about whether      the young man to whom he gave his lifejacket was a member of      his own faith;       Whereas the Four Chaplains will remain forever in the      memories of Americans as an example of the kind of heroism      which has always characterized the best of the United States      Armed Forces;       Whereas the sacrifice of the Four Chaplains stand as a      testimony to all heroic veterans who have fought for the      United States;       Whereas each year on November 11 the United States pays      tribute to its war dead and veterans in a national observance      known as Veterans Day; and       Whereas a national minute of silence observed annually at      11:00 a.m. on Veterans Day, November 11, would provide the      people of the United States with an opportunity to honor the      veterans of all United States wars and memorialize those      members of the Armed Forces who gave their lives in defense      of the United States: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a minute      of silence should be observed annually at 11:00 a.m. on      Veterans Day, November 11, in honor of the veterans of all      United States wars and to memorialize those members of the      Armed Forces who gave their lives in the defense of the      United States.
