Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan resolution before the House which succinctly encapsulates the concerns of many in this Congress that deployment of United States troops to the former Yugoslavia is a presumed option in the quiver of United States negotiators. Before United States troops are committed to such a mission, the President must make his case to the American people and Congress.  Last August, the President decided to launch a United States peace initiative which was prompted by the sudden shifts caused by the Croatian military gains and by NATO bombing.  Let me remind my colleagues that it was not until Congress overwhelmingly and along bipartisan lines voted to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia that President Clinton finally began to engage on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Clinton vetoed that bill, depriving the Bosnians of the ability to defend themselves.  In recent weeks this same administration which has vacillated for nearly 3 years over what United States interests were at stake in Bosnia is now prepared to send some 25,000 troops to a country to enforce the peace that has yet to be written.  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly troubled by the comments by key members of the administration that all but promise that U.S. troops deployed to Bosnia would be home within a year. Such claims raise suspicions that the administration's full-court press for a peace settlement is indeed being driven by an electoral timetable. They also reveal the limits of the White House's commitment to its own plan even before it is fully negotiated. Assuming that the sides are able to reach a peace agreement, which is far from certain, the process of consolidating peace in Bosnia will take years, not months, to complete.  This is not a partisan debate. There are skeptics on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon the President to make a persuasive case to the American people and to Congress, which clearly defines the mission, mandate, and modalities for a force which would be placed in harm's way. Ambiguity, as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has noted, is dangerous and, in the end, self-defeating. The deployment of American troops to Bosnia, as he correctly points out, is a fateful decision requiring a full national debate led by the President. ``As a first step, the administration must answer these threshold questions: What exactly is the peacekeeping force supposed to protect? And how do we measure success?'' Kissinger has asked.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, I have cosponsored legislation, H.R. 2550, which would prohibit the use of DOD funds for placing ground troops in Bosnia for peacekeeping or peace implementation. The President has not made his case for deployment. And, considering proximity talks and negotiations begin on Wednesday, the White House and Clinton's negotiators need to clearly understand that they must not presume the deployment of U.S. troops is politically sustainable.  Prudence, Mr. Speaker, dictated deliberate and timely consideration of such fundamental points before a commitment of U.S. troops can or should be made. Thorough review and deliberation is prerequisite, rather than rushing into a decision that cannot be sustained over a period of time.                              {time}  1730
