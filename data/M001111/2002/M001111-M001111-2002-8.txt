 President, I rise today to express my condolences to the families and friends of men who lost their lives recently because of an accident aboard the Galaxy, which was fishing for cod in the Bering Sea.  Aboard the Galaxy were First Mate Jerry L. Stephens of Edmonds, Washington; Crewman Jose R. Rodas of Pasco, Washington; and Cook George Karn of Anchorage, Alaska. From the Clipper Express: Crewman Daniel Schmiedt of Arlington, Washington.  On October 20, 2002, an explosion occurred aboard the Galaxy, a 180-foot vessel fishing for cod off of Alaska's remote Pribilof Islands. Preliminary reports indicate that crew members were battling a small fire below deck when a hatch was opened to allow smoke to escape. This triggered an explosion which ignited multiple fires that quickly superheated its iron hull. With little time to act, the crew scrambled to don survival suits and release lifeboats as they tried to rescue shipmates who had been thrown overboard by the blast.  Captain Dave Shoemaker of Carnation, Washington, sustained burns and broken ribs as he struggled through the fire to make the crucial Mayday call alerting the Coast Guard and other fishing vessels to come to the Galaxy's assistance. The heroic efforts of Deck Boss Ryan Newhall of San Antonio, Texas, saved the life of National Marine Fisheries Service biologist Ann Weckback, who was thrown into the icy water without a survival suit. One of the fishing boats which responded to the Mayday call, the Clipper Express, was drawn into the tragedy when 24 year old crew member Daniel Schmiedt was swept overboard during the rescue operation.  It may be months until we know what caused the fatal explosion on the Galaxy. However, the immediate response of the Clipper Express and the other ships that came to the rescue of the Galaxy's crew is a testament to the industry. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the four men who died on October 20, 2002. I extend my deep appreciation to all those in the fishing industry and the Coast Guard who responded quickly to prevent even greater loss of life from this accident.                          ____________________
