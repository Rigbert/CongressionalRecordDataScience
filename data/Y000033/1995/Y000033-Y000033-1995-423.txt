Mr. Speaker, with pride and honor I acknowledge Walter McInnis, of Eagle River, AK, for his accomplishment of first place in the 1995 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary Voice of Democracy Broadcast Script-Writing Contest of the State of Alaska. Mr. McInnis will receive $1,000 in scholarship funds to apply toward his collegiate education.  The Voice of Democracy Scholarship Program was started 48 years ago with the endorsement of the U.S. Office of Education and National Association of Broadcaster, Electronic Industries Association, and State Association of Broadcasters. Over the past 35 years the number of annual national scholarships has risen to 47 totaling $109,000 with a $20,000 scholarship to the school of choice going to the first place winner.  Mr. McInnis, a junior at Chugiak High School, has not decided on where he would like to attend college. He plans on pursuing a career in law. His list of achievements include the American Legion's Scholastic Achievement Award and first and second year outstanding and honor cadet in the National Junior ROTC Unit.  It pleases me to enter Mr. McInnis' winning essay into the Congressional Record.                       ``My Vision for America''                          (By Walter McInnis)       My vision for America.       I see a place where Constitutional rights are more than      just words on paper, written long ago in an age of idealism.      Foremost among these rights must be education. Quality      education, which sees to it that the Nation's youth are ready      to assume the responsibilities of their parents.       I see a place where certain Constitutional guarantees are      unnecessary. A place where discrimination on the basis of      race, sex, or religion is not only unconstitutional, but      unthinkable.       I see an America whose citizens understand that ``honor''      and ``duty'' are more than just cliches that sound good; that      they are what sets leaders apart from followers. I see a      nation willing to pay the price of being a world leader;      willing to pay for a strong national defense, and I see a      nation willing to use its strength to stand up for what's      honorable. Because being a leader has nothing to do with      making the easy decisions, or even the popular decisions;      it's being able to make choices based on nothing more than      ``they're the right thing to do.''       I see a nation that has all but eliminated crime through      the equal application of mercy and justice. A society that      understands that to be merciful without justice is foolish,      and to be just without mercy is tyrannous. A society that      rewards sympathy only to those who are repentant, instead of      those with the most excuses.       I see a nation who has come to the realization that      resource management isn't such a difficult and confounding      thing after all. For in the interest of development now and      in the future, conservation is vital. A nation that also      realizes conserving a resource is pointless if not to develop      that resource for later generations.       I see a nation that readily assumes responsibility. Because      personal accountability is critical to success in all areas      of life; from basic person to person honesty all the way to a      national, political level.       I see a people who have risen above a cynical derision of      their government. I see a citizenry who have balanced their      democratic duty to critique their government, with a respect      for the same. After all if the voters are not responsible for      their government, then who is?       I see a people who also remember to respect their children      and senior citizens. Senior citizens have made the sacrifices      to get the country in the leadership role it now enjoys; and      the leaders of today must realize that they do not own the      country, but instead are holding it in trust for the      generations to come.       In conclusion, I envision America continuing its prominent      role in world affairs. America must also continue to set the      example for personal freedom and equality. It is crucial that      the country reassume dominance in education, second best      simply isn't good enough. Respect and responsibility must be      the axioms which the country strives toward because a leader      who does not respect other's opinions, and does not accept      responsibility for his actions, does not deserve to be a      leader.                               ____________________
