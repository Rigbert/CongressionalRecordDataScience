President, I was born in Montpelier, VT. A great friend I had in Montpelier, VT was Dr. George A. McIntyre. Dr. McIntyre left this world this month at the age of 85. I can truly say Dr. McIntyre knew me all of my life because he was the man who delivered me as a child. He was a good friend, as is his wife, Theresa. He was also the model of the smalltown country doctor. He was someone who knew everybody in the town, respected by everybody in the town, loved by everybody in the town, and was there to help.  My own memories, I recall as a child of about 12, becoming very ill with pneumonia, and Dr. McIntyre coming to our house, a doctor who always made house calls, bundling me up and bringing me to the hospital. Without his care, there is no question I would not have survived that bout of pneumonia.  So I have been privileged, as have members of my family, to know him for all these years. I send my condolences to his wife, his children, and the other members of his family. He was a truly remarkable person.  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. McIntyre's obituary which appeared in the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 16, 1995]                        George A. McIntyre, M.D.       Montpelier.--George A. McIntyre, M.D., 85, of Loomis      Street, and a longtime area practitioner, died Dec. 14, 1995,      in Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center of complications      due to Parkinson's disease.       Born on May 3, 1910, in Burlington, he was the son of James      C. McIntyre and Emma J. (Wakefield) McIntyre.       He received a bachelor of science degree from the      University of Vermont and an M.D. from UVM in 1935. Following      internship he opened a family practice in Montpelier.       On July 10, 1941, he married Theresa Wilkinson in      Montpelier and to that marriage four children were born.       From Sept. 2, 1942, until Feb. 3, 1946, he actively served      as a U.S. Army physician, principally in New Guinea and in      the southern Philippines. His military specialty was that of      chief of gastroenterology. His final rank promotion was that      of major. Postgraduate education was obtained at New York      Postgraduate Hospital, University of Chicago, Billings      General Hospital, and St. Luke's Hospital, also in Chicago.       Dr. McIntyre was an attending physician at Heaton Hospital      and its successor, Central Vermont Hospital, for a total of      46 years and a member of Washington County Medical Society,      Vermont State Medical Society, and American Medical      Association.       In addition to his regular practice, Dr. McIntyre was      medical consultant to Kinstead on upper Main Street in      Montpelier, a state-run institution; to New England Telephone      and Telegraph Co., IBM, Agway, and the Selective Service. For      several years, he was health officer for the City of      Montpelier and was attending physician at Vermont College for      31 years, serving under the administration of four presidents      and medical director of the former Heaton House.       On May 15, 1981, Dr. McIntyre was awarded a citation from      the Vermont Medical Alumni Association, ``in recognition of      his many years of exemplary medical practice and outstanding      community service which reflects credit upon the medical      profession and epitomizes the ideal physician.'' He retired      in November of that year.       Following retirement, he was director of the library at      Central Vermont Hospital for almost five years, president of      Washington County Cancer Society, newsletter editor of the      Lake Mansfield Trout Club, and a member of the club, a      Montpelier-based literary club. He also authored the history      of Christ Church (Episcopal) in Montpelier.       Norwich University of Vermont conveyed recognition on Dr.      McIntyre by conferring on him an honorary doctor of      humanities degree during commencement exercises at Vermont      College on May 22, 1988.       In a reading presented for inclusion in the Congressional      Record by Sen. Patrick Leahy in March 1989, Leahy stated,      ``Dr. McIntyre has been my family's doctor for as long as I      can remember. All the Leahys have come to depend on him for      his patience, caring, and advice. I have literally known him      all my life, as he is the physician who delivered me on March      31, 1940.''       Survivors include his wife of 54 years, Theresa      (Wilkinson), whom he married June 10, 1941, in Montpelier;      three sons, James C. McIntyre of Montpelier, William A.      McIntyre of Nashua, N.H., and John S. McIntyre of Barre; one      daughter, Anne M. McIntyre of Melrose, Mass.; and two      grandchildren, Matthew and Julia Anne McIntyre.       Services will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. in Christ Church      (Episcopal). Spring burial service will take place in Lake      View Cemetery in Burlington. Calling hours are scheduled      today from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. in Guare and Sons Funeral      Home, 80 School St., Montpelier. The family requests that      flowers be omitted.
