President, this week is the opening of the 101st Benton County Fair and Rodeo. For more than a century, the citizens of Benton County, OR, have come together to show off the literal and metaphorical fruits of their yearlong labor, display their talents, and enjoy a few diversions.  The roots of the Benton County Fair actually run as far back as those of the State of Oregon. Just 7 months after Oregon achieved statehood, the Benton Agricultural Society began holding small fairs. In the early 1900s, Benton County had an outstanding showing at the Oregon State Fair, handily winning the State fair's blue ribbon for its display of produce five times--in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1911, and 1912. In 1912, J.F. Yates, the mayor of Corvallis, announced a public holiday to celebrate Benton County's outstanding showing at the Oregon State Fair. The following year, the county had its own celebration on the grounds of the Oregon Agricultural College, later to become Oregon State University. That year, the county brought out its finest produce, livestock, and technology, starting a tradition that will be continued this week.  The Benton County Fair and Rodeo found its current home in 1957, when the county purchased 20 acres of land for the fair in Corvallis. In 1958, the Future Farmers of America and 4-H joined the thriving county fair in its longstanding practice of showcasing the region's rich agricultural tradition. The fair has matured beyond its roots to include carnival festivities, rides, and concession stands in addition to live music. I know that folks in Benton County will enjoy a wonderful week as they take in the region's storied culture.  I would like to recognize Betty Malone, the Benton County Fair and Rodeo's committee chair, for proposing a quilt to be sewn to commemorate the fair's centennial last year, an important date in the county's history. I would also like to congratulate Dawn Wunder and Donna Johnson for leading the charge to make Betty's proposal a reality. The centennial quilt will be presented to the region's residents in a ceremony today. Dozens of community members decorated the patches that make up the quilt, a collective celebration of the county's history. It is a fitting tribute to folks in Benton County who for more than 100 years have graced the region with their strong spirit and hard work.  It is my pleasure to submit this statement in recognition of the Benton County Fair and Rodeo's 101st year. I look forward to the Fair's continued success for many more years.                          ____________________
