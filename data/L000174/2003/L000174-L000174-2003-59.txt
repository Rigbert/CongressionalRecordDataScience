 Further, it was my experience that throughout all of these administrations, Republican and Democratic alike, there was not a restriction made because we were required to ask these questions. Is that the experience of the distinguished Senator from Illinois? Has the Senator had the same experience in both bodies--I am speaking now of appropriations but, of course, a lot of other committees are involved--if we asked questions about where the money went, we received the answers irrespective of whether one was a Republican or Democratic?
