 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The sides on this debate are very clear. One side are the credit card companies and the very large banks who are making huge profits from their consumers and, in some cases in our low-interest moment, right now, who are charging 25 or 29 percent a year interest rates. In other words, they are ripping off the American people.  On the other side of this debate and supporting this amendment, are virtually every major consumer organization in America that is saying enough is enough. If people pay their bills on time every month, they should not see their interest rates double or triple. The chairman mentioned that there was bipartisan opposition to my amendment. He was right. But as he knows, there was bipartisan support for this amendment, including the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), who was very articulate and supportive of this amendment as chairman of the relevant subcommittee.  Let me simply conclude by saying this: the American people are sick and tired of being ripped off by credit card companies. When they pay their bills every month on time, they should not see their interest rates soar. I would urge the Members of this body, in a bipartisan way, to support the American consumer and pass the Sanders amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
