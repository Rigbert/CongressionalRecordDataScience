 President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany H.R. 6157.  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:       Resolved, That the House disagree to the amendment of the      Senate to the bill (H.R. 6157) entitled ``An Act making      appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal      year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.'',      and ask a conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes      of the two Houses thereon.       Ordered, That Mr. Frelinghuysen, Ms. Granger, Messrs. Cole,      Calvert, Womack, Aderholt, Rogers of Kentucky, Mrs. Roby,      Mrs. Lowey, Mr. Visclosky, Mses. DeLauro, Roybal-Allard, and      McCollum, be the managers of the conference on the part of      the House.                            Compound Motion  Mr. McCONNELL. I move that the Senate insist on its amendment, agree to the request of the House for a conference, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate at a ratio of 4 to 3.  I know of no further debate on the motion.
