Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Tonko said this bill is not about a blame game. We are trying to fix a problem so it doesn't happen again anyplace.  I just might note that the House was out 2 weeks. We had Martin Luther King week, then we had the snowstorm, and we couldn't come back.  Our committee held a number of briefings. I expanded it to include certainly all of the members--Republican and Democrat--on the Energy and Commerce Committee, but I also extended that out to all of the members of the Michigan delegation, both our Senators, as well as the Oversight and Government Reform Committee majority and minority staff.  Mr. Kildee mentioned about Mr. Pallone not being here. His father died earlier this week, so he is where he should be. But he cares deeply about this legislation as well.  I know when I sat down with my friend Mr. Kildee last week to talk about the intent of this legislation and where he was, we were able to, I think, make some important, constructive changes that strengthen the bill. It was a no-brainer for us to get every Member on both sides of the aisle from Michigan to be an original cosponsor, and I congratulate him for that initiative.  But I must say, too, this is a first step. I know in the future our committee is going to be looking at how we can better expand flexibility, I think, of States as it relates to their safe drinking water fund, and the State revolving fund as well. We are looking to hear from the States what we might be able to do on the Federal response. Again, the primacy is at the State and local level, particularly when a State, like we have seen here, actually has been given an emergency declaration, as our Governor sought.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I commend Mr. Kildee.  I yield back the balance of my time.
