  Madam President, this has been my ninth Supreme Court nomination hearing, and I must say, I have never experienced anything like this.  Never before have we had a Supreme Court nominee where over 90 percent of his record has been hidden from the public and the Senate. Never before have we had a nominee display such flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing, and never before have we had a nominee facing allegations of sexual assault.
