President, I appreciate the remembrances of D-Day from Senator Blunt, the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri.  It is always memorable attending D-Day events. The first one I went to--and you just spoke of the distinguished Kansan, Dwight Eisenhower--was with Robert Dole for the 40th anniversary. President Reagan asked the two of us to represent him in Italy when we first landed, while President Reagan went to Normandy. Subsequently, I went with a delegation with President Clinton and then with President George W. Bush, and, lastly, with President Obama. I found the experience overwhelming each time.  Last year--it was actually on my birthday--Dick Shelby and I were there and laid a wreath in Normandy. Nobody can walk by there--first, seeing all the graves and realizing that they are only some of the remains--and then walking to the cliffs and looking down, and not wonder how anybody could have had the courage to face such withering fire. For some who survived, it seemed like the enemy was using a paint brush and just wiping people out. You would see them falling all around.  A well-respected doctor from our home town in Montpelier had never talked about it. On the 50th anniversary we asked him if he would join us there. He is not a wealthy man. He treated a lot of the poor Italian immigrants for nothing. My mother was a first generation Italian American, and she always talked with him. She and my father and others raised money for him to go, and after that for the first time he could talk about it.  He came back and talked about it. He was a medic and a little guy. He went off the boat with all of his gear and just sank. He would have drowned, but somebody pulled him up and brought him to the shore. He turned to say thank you, and the man who rescued him was shot dead.  He refused to leave the beach. He just treated one person after another, and his story is not unusual. So many did that. So I thank my friend from Missouri for what he said.                             Cuba Sanctions  Mr. President, there are foreign policies that are thoughtful, that reflect lessons learned from history, and that advance our national interests. Let me talk about others.  I have been here for a lot of years. I was fortunate to come here at the time of President Ford and have known and seen every President since. I have seen some dumb policies by administrations over the years, both by Republicans and Democrats. I want to speak briefly about one of them because it is not just dumb. It is an embarrassment. It is going to hurt a lot of Americans. It is going to hurt a lot of good people in Cuba, and there is no denying that.  I refer to the decision announced by the Treasury Department yesterday to severely restrict travel by Americans to Cuba. Why? Because Cuba supports Nicolas Maduro.  The administration has reinstituted the failed policy of the Cold War restrictions on the right of every American citizen to travel to Cuba, even though the overwhelming majority of Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, opposes such restrictions. It means cruise ships will stop sailing there. Educational and cultural exchanges will shut down. Sports teams will stay home. School trips will end. Trade missions will end. American farmers who could export products to Cuba are going to be shut out as well as other American companies.  I have to ask: What kind of government thinks it has a right to tell its citizens where they can travel and where they can spend their own money? Ironically, not the Cuban Government, despite its repressive policies. Cubans can travel to the United States if we grant them a visa.  Russia is kleptocracy with nuclear weapons pointed at us, that invades its neighbors, supports President Assad and Nicolas Maduro, interferes with our elections, and opposes the United States at every turn in the U.N. Security Council. But Americans can travel to Russia without restriction, just as Russians can travel here.  Iran has brutally repressive government, but it does not have laws and regulations to prevent its citizens from traveling to the United States or Americans from traveling there.  Nicaragua is led by a corrupt dictator, but Nicaraguans can travel to any country that will accept them, and Americans are free to travel there.  In fact, Americans can travel anywhere in the world without restriction, except to North Korea and now Cuba, whose people could not be more welcoming of Americans.  How do I know this? Because unlike the people in the White House and the Treasury Department who have never ever been to Cuba, I have been there. My wife Marcelle has been there. Our granddaughter Sophia has been there.  This administration's policy is being guided by a couple of hard-liners in the National Security Council who have never set foot in Cuba but are on a crusade to pressure the Cuban Government to change its policies. After 50 years of trying and failing to get Cuba to change its policies, they continue to believe that one way to do that is by preventing Americans who believe in democracy from traveling to Cuba and spending their own money there.  Of all the paternalistic, anachronistic, and hypocritical policies, that is beneath the world's oldest democracy. We tried it for 50 years, from the time I was in college. It failed. In fact, it backfired. As we blocked access to Cuba, the Cuban authorities solidified their control.  This will backfire, too. If past experience is any guide, it will cause them to intensify their support for Maduro.  We all want Maduro gone, but are we so blinded by arrogance, ideology and stupidity that we are destined to keep repeating our mistakes?  If this policy makes sense for Cuba, why not for other repressive governments whose policies we disagree with, like China? They have imprisoned a million of their Uyghur citizens. Their military is deeply involved in the economy. Yet millions of Americans go to China without restriction.  Egypt has destroyed what fragile democratic institutions existed there. They have locked up thousands of political opponents, as well as American citizens. Yet President Trump calls President al Sisi a great friend--a man who locks up Americans, locks up people who disagree with him.  Saudi Arabia commits war crimes in Yemen, they treat women as property, and they murdered Jamal Khashoggi and other dissidents. The Crown Prince, who we know was involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, is apparently untouchable, and our President and Secretary of State seem to prefer it that way. But Americans can still travel to Saudi Arabia without reservation.  These regulations are an insult to every American. They are a disgrace to a free society. Since when is it the role of the Federal Government to say where Americans can travel and spend their own money, absent some threat to national security or their own health and safety, neither of which exists in Cuba?  It is not going to hurt the leaders in Cuba. They are not going to submit to bullying. If anything, it will harden their attitude toward the United States.  I know who it will hurt. It will hurt the people who most deserve our help--the Cuban families who own small businesses, who rent out rooms in their apartments, who own their own taxis and restaurants. Artisans and musicians. People who otherwise subsist on meager government salaries and rations and benefit enormously when Americans visit Cuba.  Marcelle and I have met with many of these people--young people especially--who have Airb&bs, who have started their own small businesses. They work extremely hard within a system stacked against them, and they need American customers. The White House just slammed the door on them.  Of course we disagree with the Cuban Government. On many things we strongly disagree. But we disagree with many governments over Venezuela and other issues. Does that give the Treasury Department the right to tell Americans they can't travel there?  What if the Treasury Department imposed such restrictions on travel by Members of Congress? What if they said ``after today, Members of Congress can no longer travel to China or Russia''. There is not a single Senator, Republican or Democrat, who would stand for that. What hypocrisy.  Freedom to travel is a right. It is fundamental. It is part of who we are as Americans. We travel. We explore. We meet people. We share our values. We build relationships with people we agree with and disagree with. Are we willing to stand by and let the right of private Americans to travel be trampled this way?  I will have more to say about this self-defeatist policy when I introduce the bipartisan Freedom for Americans to Travel to Cuba Act.  I urge all Senators to not let the same old, worn out, Cold War, isolationist, fearmongering, failed arguments about Cuba stand in the way of common sense.  I see one of my very good friends on the floor, the Senator from Ohio.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cramer). The Senator from Ohio.
