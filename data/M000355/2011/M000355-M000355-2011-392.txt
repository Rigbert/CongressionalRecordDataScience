 President, I rise to congratulate a national championship team that makes its home in Pikeville, KY. This March 22, the Pikeville College Bears men's basketball team triumphed over the West Virginia Mountain State University Cougars in overtime, 83 to 76, to win the school's first NAIA men's basketball championship.  It has been a thrilling season for the Bears, who finish the year with a school-best 30-7 record. They tied for third place in the Mid-South Conference and entered the tournament unseeded and with something to prove. They certainly did that, becoming the first unseeded team in tournament history to defeat five seeded teams on the way to the championship.  The Bears beat defending national champ Oklahoma Baptist, defending national runner-up Azusa Pacific, and top-seeded Robert Morris to get to the semifinals. Facing No. 3-seed Martin Methodist College in the semifinals, the Bears clawed their way out of a 15-point deficit to win by 11 points.  Then it all came down to the final game, played in Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, MO, against the Cougars from West Virginia. The Bears trailed for most of the way, but by the end of the night it was ``My Old Kentucky Home'' being played as the Bears cut down the nets.  Trevor Setty of Maysville, KY, tied a career high for scoring in the game with 32 points, grabbed 17 rebounds and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. And Head Coach Kelly Wells was named NAIA National Coach of the Year.  The students and faculty of Pikeville College and the people of Pikeville, eastern Kentucky, and the whole Commonwealth couldn't be prouder of this winning team. They represent the very best of what the Bluegrass State has to offer, and we are honored for them to represent us to basketball fans from across the Nation. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the Pikeville College Bears men's basketball team for their exciting victory.  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article about the Pikeville College Bears' championship season and what it meant for the school and for eastern Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Kentucky.com, Mar. 24, 2011]      Pikeville Fans Happy To Lose Voices Cheering Team's NAIA Win                          (By Dori Hjalmarson)       Pikeville.--As the NAIA Division I Tournament championship      game inched to a close Tuesday night, the 200 spectators at a      viewing party on the floor of Pikeville's Expo Center rose to      their feet. They swelled and deflated with each basket,      chanting for ``defense'' and waving their fingers for free-     throws as their team fought for the win more than 580 miles      away at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Mo.       Ear-splitting screams rang through the hall as the game      went into overtime, and students crowded toward the big      screen.       After a slow first half on Tuesday, Pikeville's fans based      their hopes on Monday night's game, when the unseeded      Pikeville College Bears overcame a 15-point deficit to oust      its semifinal opponent, No. 3 seed Martin Methodist College.       ``We're down. but (Monday) night proves we're not out of      it,'' said Ravin Fields, director of the dorm that houses the      basketball and baseball teams.       And the Bears certainty weren't out of it, battling into      overtime for an 83-76 win over West Virginia's Mountain State      University and Pikeville College's first NAIA men's      basketball championship. The victory created a surge of      excitement throughout the crowd in Pikeville.       ``I lost my voice cheering,'' communications professor      Chandra Messner said. ``We're so proud of those boys.''       Said Massner's daughter, Amanda Arts: ``Amazing.      Unbelievable.''       The celebration on campus lasted until 4 a.m., Residence      Life Director Kayla Bandy said. On Wednesday. a caravan was      planned starting at 8 p.m., from the Mountain Arts Center in      Prestonsburg to the college gym, where a rally would welcome      the team home. A parade in downtown Pikeville was planned for      4 p.m. Thursday.       ``I hope a lot of people come out to support them.'' Bandy      said as she painted signs and hung streamers in the men's      locker room. She knows what she's talking about: Bandy was on      the 2008 national champion bowling team, the school's only      other title-winning sport. Now an assistant coach, she wears      her championship ring daily.       ``It's such a big deal for these guys,'' Bandy said. ``From      the kids texting from Kansas City it was not like anything      they were expecting.''                          ____________________
