Mr. Speaker, I can only say I am losing a good friend who will go to better and greater places.  You have been an ally to myself and to the feeling of working bipartisan work with the chairman on both sides of the aisle. We have always talked to one another, and we have recognized the importance of being ``the'' Congressman and of listening to the Congressman from that district. I have sponsored this bill every time it has come out of the committee--while I was chairman, before I was chairman, after I was chairman--and I will continue to do that.  I understand minority Member Doc Hastings and his position and why he opposes it; but as we talk about this politically, we have to think about the people whom we are affecting by our words. They have been patient, patient, patient, and it is time for us to take the step forward.  Is this bill perfect? No. I think it's better after the amendment is adopted. I think it does solve the problems. There is no Indian Country in Hawaii. Land cannot be taken into trusts. A Native Hawaiian governing entity may not exercise jurisdiction over non-Native Hawaiians. The State of Hawaii shall retain regulatory and taxation authority over Native Hawaiians.  Yet these are Native Hawaiians, and I can speak with a great deal of pride as to what happened in Alaska. In 1971, we passed the Alaska Native Lands Act where we recognized the natives of Alaska, Alaska natives--distinct and different from those natives in the lower 48--but Alaska natives.                              {time}  1815  And the progress they have made and the contribution they have made to the State is amazing. They are the number one, I would say, economic driving force in the State today. From a large group of people, 13 basic different tribes, regions, they are from a group that wasn't recognized other than the fact that they were natives, that they really did not fit well. But they were part of this State before we long came there, my State, and their contribution, because they were recognized, is just awesome. And I'm hoping this happens in the State of Hawaii.  For those in Hawaii that may oppose this, open your hearts. Open your minds. Maybe do a little something a little different in Hawaii, as we did in Alaska, and see the benefit to the individual, not only the natives but everybody else. This legislation is a step forward. Is it perfect? The Governor saysno. I think it's open for debate. But if we don't do something, if we don't move forward, those people will be neglected again.  So I ask my colleagues on my side and on the other side to consider moving on something that is humanely the right thing to do for a group of people that are Americans. They are aboriginals to the State of Hawaii. They are brothers to Alaska. We've worked together. We will continue to do that.  So I compliment, again, my good friend Neil for his work and his dedication to this House, representing his people. That's what we're here for. And thank God we do have people like that left.  I will miss you, Neil.
