Speaker, it gives me great honor to pay tribute to Neighborhoods Incorporated, a nonprofit organization that promotes and enhances neighborhoods through resident training, innovative lending programs and other community sponsored activities in Hammond, Indiana.  Through the efforts of Neighborhoods Incorporated and its executive director, Keith Speaks, Indiana's First Congressional District, and Hammond in particular has worked to improve their neighborhoods. Communities are transforming in Northwest Indiana due to an organized campaign to help revitalize neighborhoods and businesses along the Indiana and Illinois State Line.  The Neighborhood of Lights program is an example of how neighbors are actively working together to take their neighborhoods back. This program is a grassroots coalition of neighbors and businesses from Hammond and Calumet City working together to improve the quality of life in the State Line corridor. The purpose of the Neighborhood of Lights program is to unite the communities and to beautify the area. These goals are achieved by improving properties, promoting security measures, and most importantly by empowering neighbors and businesses to take an active role in their neighborhood. Businesses on both sides of the State Line are effected by what is happening in these neighborhoods just as much as the residents. Creating partnerships between the residents and businesses in the neighborhood truly creates a formidable force, which is effective in creating an improved atmosphere for both families and businesses to prosper.  Through the work of organizations like Neighborhood Incorporated, communities and lives are being transformed. Neighborhood Incorporated works to promote home ownership and to strengthen neighborhoods by helping to deliver improved affordable housing. Additionally, they offer a variety of services designed to address the demand of the local neighborhood. For example, they support the growth and development of resident leadership, rehabilitate homes, and collaborate with other organizations to improve the neighborhood image and restore pride and hope in the community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in thanking Mr. Speaks for his tireless dedication to improving the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District. Through the efforts of Neighborhoods Incorporated, individuals have come together at all levels to help their neighbors, their neighborhood schools, churches, block clubs, and their own families for the generations to come.                          ____________________
