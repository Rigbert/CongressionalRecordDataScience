President, I rise today to introduce the Professional Development Reform Act to strengthen and improve professional development for teachers and administrators.  I have long worked to improve the quality of teaching in America's classrooms for the simple reason that well-trained and well-prepared teachers are central to improving the academic performance and achievement of students.  Last Congress, I introduced the TEACH Act to reform the way our prospective teachers are trained. The TEACH Act sought to foster partnerships among teacher colleges, schools of arts and sciences, and elementary and secondary schools.  Such partnerships were a central recommendation of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future to reform teacher training, and I was pleased that my legislation was included in the renewed teacher training title of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the focus shifts to new teachers and teachers already in the classroom.  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today would reform professional development, which too often consists of fragmented, one-shot workshops, at which teachers passively listen to experts and are isolated from the practice of teaching.  We don't expect students to learn their ``ABCs'' after one day of lessons, and we shouldn't expect a one-day professional development workshop to yield the desired result.  Research shows that such professional development fails to improve or even impact teaching practice.  Moreover, a recent survey of teachers found that professional development is too short term and lacks intensity. In 1998, participation in professional development programs typically lasted from 1 to 8 hours--the equivalent of only a day or less.  As a consequence, only about 1 in 5 teachers felt very well prepared for addressing the needs of students withlimited English proficiency, those from culturally diverse backgrounds, and those with disabilities, or integrating educational technology into the curriculum.  Instead, research shows that effective professional development approaches are sustained, intensive activities that focus on deepening teachers knowledge of content; allow teachers to work collaboratively; provide opportunities for teachers to practice and reflect upon their teaching; are aligned with standards and embedded in the daily work of the school; and involve parents and other community members.  Such high-quality professional development improves student achievement. Indeed, a 1998 study in California found that the more teachers were engaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered professional development, holding school conditions and student characteristics constant, the higher their students' mathematics achievement on the state's assessment.  Community School District 2 in New York City is one district which has seen its investment in sustained, intensive professional development pay off with increases in student achievement. Professional development in District 2 is delivered in schools and classrooms and focused on system-wide instructional improvement, with intensive activities such as observation of exemplary teachers and classrooms both inside and outside the district, supervised practice, peer networks, and offsite training opportunities.  Unfortunately, a recent national evaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development program found that the majority of professional development activities in the six districts studied did not follow such a sustained and intensive approach.  And, in a recent article in the Providence Journal, some teachers noted that professional development for them has revolved around sitting and listening to experts talk about standards, rather than working closely with teachers and students to refine new methods of teaching those standards.  Unlike the bill passed last week in the other body which would do little to address these issues or change professional development, my legislation would create a new formula program for professional development that is sustained, collaborative, content-centered, embedded in the daily work of the school, and aligned with standards and school reform efforts.  To achieve this enhanced professional development, the legislation funds the following activities: mentoring; peer observation and coaching; curriculum-based content training; dedicated time for collaborative lesson planning; opportunities for teachers to visit other classrooms to model effective teaching practice; training on integrating technology into the curriculum, addressing the specific needs of diverse students, and involving parents; professional development networks to provide a forum for interaction and exchange of information among teachers and administrators; and release time and compensation for mentors and substitute teachers to make these activities possible.  The Professional Development Reform Act also requires partnerships between elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education for providing training opportunities, including advanced content area courses and training to address teacher shortages. In fact, preliminary U.S. Department of Education data show that the Eisenhower Professional Development activities sponsored by institutions of higher education are most effective.  My legislation will also provide funding for skills and leadership training for principals and superintendents, as well as mentors. Indeed, ensuring that our principals have the training and support to serve as instructional leaders is critical, as is ensuring that mentors have the skills necessary to help our newest teachers and other teachers who need assistance in the classroom.  Funding is targeted to Title I schools with the highest percentages of students living in poverty, where improvements in professional development are needed most.  My legislation does not eliminate the Eisenhower program, but it does require that Eisenhower and other federal, state, and local professional development funds be coordinated and used in the manner described in our bill--on professional development activities that research shows works.  In addition, the Professional Development Reform Act offers resources but it demands results. Strong accountability provisions require that school districts and schools which receive funding actually improve student performance and increase participation in sustained professional development in three years in order to secure additional funding.  In sum, my legislation seeks to ensure that new teachers have the support they need to be successful teachers, that all teachers have access to high quality professional development regardless of the content areas they teach, and that the professional development does not isolate teachers, but rather is part of a coordinated and comprehensive strategy aligned with standards.  Not only does the research bear this out as the way to improve teaching practice and student learning, but education leaders in my home state of Rhode Island, as well as witnesses at a recent Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing stressed the importance of this type of professional development.  Mr. President, the time for action is now as schools must hire an estimated 2.2 million new teachers over the next decade due to increasing enrollments, the retirement of approximately half of our current teaching force, and high attrition rates.  Ensuring that teachers have the training, assistance, and support to increase student achievement and sustain them throughout their careers is a great challenge. But we must meet and overcome this challenge if we are to reform education and prepare our children for the 21st Century.  The Professional Development Reform Act, by increasing our professional development investment and focusing it on the kind of activities and opportunities for teachers and administrators that research shows is effective, is critical to this effort.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by cosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1442       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
