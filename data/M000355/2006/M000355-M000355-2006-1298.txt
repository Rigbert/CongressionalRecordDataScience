 President, it is our hope that we will be able to invoke cloture today and start debate on the substance of this very important piece of legislation. If cloture is invoked, I believe the chairman would be ready tonight or early tomorrow to begin work on the bill, and we can discuss the timing of that later in the day.  As the leader announced, we expect to be on the asbestos bill for the remainder of this week. We would like to make progress on asbestos-related amendments throughout this current week.  I also remind our colleagues that we will continue to work on executive nominations this week.
