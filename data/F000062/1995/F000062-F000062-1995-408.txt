 President, as always when it comes to matters of copyright law, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has spoken well and to the point as to why extending the basic term of copyright protection by 20 years is both the right and the economically desirable thing to do, and to do without delay. As the bill's coauthor, I'd like to add just a few thoughts about our proposal to extend the length of copyright protection for only the fourth time since the Founding Fathers established such rights more than 200 years ago.  First principles come first. The fundamental animating principle of copyright protection was--and remains--assuring that the Nation's most creative individuals have and retain a sufficient economic incentive to continue to craft, work by copyrightable work, the incomparable mosaic of our Nation's cultural life. For many years now, such incentive has been considered to be the right to profit from licensing one's work during one's lifetime and to take pride and comfort in knowing that one's children--and perhaps their children--might also benefit from one's posthumous popularity. Indeed, it was to preserve that incentive that Congress adopted the current life plus 50 years term that is now the law.  Human longevity, however, is increasingly undermining this fundamental precept of copyright law, Mr. President, and with it the economic incentive deemed essential by the authors of the Constitution. We all had the great good fortune, for example, to have the incomparable Irving Berlin among us until 1989, when he died at the age of 101. By that time, however, Mr. Berlin had outlived the period in which he was entitled to royalties from the immortal ``Alexander's Ragtime Band.'' Although not every American copyright owner will reach the century mark, Mr. President, it's clear that we as a Nation are living longer and more active lives.  Copyright law has in the past--and should now again--reflect that central fact of life. Accordingly, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995 uniformly extends the life of copyright protection in this country by 20 years, a modest extension relative to past adjustments, as Chairman Hatch points out. Writers, artists, filmmakers, composers, photographers, sculptors, and cartographers alike--and their children, all will benefit from this overdue adjustment. Perhaps more importantly, as the ultimate beneficiaries of the creativity that copyright protection is intended to assure, so will we all.  Second, Mr. President, as important as America's cultural enrichment is, the United States also stands to benefit dramatically on the world economic stage from extension of the current copyright term. As the tense and protracted negotiations with China just concluded underscored, intellectual property--the collective copyrightable output of America's creators of movies, music, art and other works--is an enormous asset to the Nation's balance of trade.  Indeed, in a recent Billboard magazine commentary, Prof. Arthur Miller of the Harvard Law School noted that, ``In 1990, America's `copyright industries' recorded $34 billion in foreign sales * * *.'' It's no wonder, Mr. President, that the Chinese preferred to appropriate American film and music for resale--two great exports from my State of California--rather than license American works.  By extending to life plus 70 years the basic copyright protection afforded in the United States for new works, Congress will assure comparable protection for American authors in the countries of the European Union, which will formally adopt the life-plus-70 standard this summer. If we do not act, Mr. President, those nations quite simply will not be required to provide American authors, artists and other copyright holders with more than the protection we afford their intellectual property holders here at home. Simply put, Mr. President, conforming our intellectual property laws with those of our trading partners in the service of American competitiveness is critical.  As Professor Miller aptly put it: ``Unless Congress matches the copyright extension adopted by the European Union, we will lost 20 years of valuable protection against rip-off artists around the world.'' I'm certain that the tired, but successful team from the United States Trade Representative's office just returned from China will testify if asked, Mr. President, that the stronger our copyright laws here at home, the better the deal they can negotiate for American copyright holders abroad. Since America is--and is likely to remain--the world's principal exporter of popular culture, extension of the basic copyright term makes international dollars and sense.  Third, and finally, Mr. President, I want to note for the record the extraordinary support for this legislation within the intellectual property community. Not only do movie and music companies strongly back this bill as written, as one would expect, but book and music publishers, performing rights societies representing America's premier songwriters and composers, and major software producing firms all concur that Congress can and must pass this important legislation.  I want to thank Chairman Hatch and his staff once again, Mr. President, for another--to my mind--successful collaboration to protect and encourage the production of American intellectual property. Just as was the case with the digital performance rights legislation which we first introduced in the last Congress and jointly offered again recently, it is equity and economics which make the Copyright [[Page S3394]] Term Extension Act of 1995 an important and worthwhile bill.  I commend it to my colleagues, and look forward to working with them and the copyright community at large to put it--as well as digital performance rights legislation--before the President by the end of this session of Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From Billboard magazine, January 14, 1995]              Extending Copyrights Preserves U.S. Culture                         (By Arthur R. Miller)       Beginning this summer, all member nations of the European      Union will extend the length of copyright protection to the      life of the author plus 70 years. Should we in America      provide the same protection for our own writers, musicians,      artists, computer programmers, and other creators of      copyrighted items?       Some feel that we should not tamper with existing U.S. law,      which provides copyright protection for life plus 50 years.      But this status-quoism ignores some fundamental changes that      have occurred in the 20th century.       One of the major reasons Congress originally adopted life-     plus-50-years was to offer protection not only to the creator      of the copyrighted works, but to his or her children and      grandchildren--that is, to three generations in all. With      people living longer today, an extension of the copyright      term by 20 years would roughly correspond to the increase in      longevity that has occurred during the 20th century.       In addition, Congress has already recognized the wisdom of      extending copyright protection to match the terms guaranteed      by other nations. That is exactly what Congress did in 1976      when it extended the copyright term to life-plus-50-years, in      order to bring American law into line with the term then      commonly recognized by other nations.       But beyond this, the main arguments for term extension are      equity and economics.       If Congress does not extend to Americans the same copyright      protection afforded Europeans, American creators will have 20      years less protection than their European counterparts--20      years during which Europeans will not be paying Americans for      our copyrighted products. This situation would not only be      unfair to creators of copyrighted works, but would be harmful      economically to the country as a whole.       The export of intellectual property is growing at a      tremendous rate because America dominates popular culture the      world over. In 1990, America's ``copyright industries''      recorded $34 billion in foreign sales of records, CDs,      computer software, motion pictures, music, books, scientific      journals, periodicals, photographs, designs, and pictorial      and sculptural works. Because the world is so eager for the      products of America's copyright industries, they are one of      the few bright spots in our balance-of-trade picture.       The question of copyright extension should be viewed in the      larger context of bilateral and multilateral trade talks--     including the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights      (TRIPS) negotiations under GATT. U.S. trade representatives      have found that shortcomings in our own copyright law are      used against us when we call for stronger protection for      American works overseas. One can just hear the Europeans      objecting in future negotiations: ``How can you ask for      better protection in Europe when you do not even grant the      same term of protection we do?''       The need for strong copyright protection becomes more      important every year as a weapon with which to fight the      piracy of intellectual property. Overseas piracy of American      copyrighted material has grown dramatically in recent years      due to the      availability of equipment that can make cheap copies of      movies, videotapes, sound recordings, and computer      programs. As more and more digital technology arrives on      the scene, the problem will only become worse.       Indeed, China alone produced an estimated $2 billion worth      of counterfeit recordings and computer discs last year.      According to the International Federation of the Phonographic      Industry, China now has as many as 26 factories capable of      producing 62 million compact discs. China's domestic market      accounts for only about 3 million discs, so the dimension of      the loss to copyright owners is obvious. Unless Congress      matches the copyright extension adopted by the European      Union, we will lose 20 years of valuable protection against      rip-off artists around the world.       It would not take long to see what harm can come from not      changing our laws to match those of Europeans. America may be      a young nation, but we have the world's oldest popular      culture. Many wonderful motion pictures and songs--including      Irving Berlin's ``Alexander's Rag Time Band''--already have      lost their copyright protection. Dozens, if not hundreds, of      other valuable songs and motion pictures--the legacy of      American culture--also will lose their protection in the next      few years. For example, if Congress does not act soon, such      classics as ``After You've Gone,'' ``I'm Always Chasing      Rainbows,'' ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' ``Swanee,''      and ``The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise'' will fall into      the public domain, and that is only the beginning.       Commentary writer Professor Lewis Kurlantzick (Billboard,      Oct. 29, 1994) asserted that when copyrighted works lose      their protection, they become more widely available. At first      blush, this appears logical. But, paradoxically, works of art      become less available to the public when they enter the      public domain--at least in a form that does credit to the      original. This is because few businesses will invest the      money necessary to reproduce and distribute products that      have lost their copyright protection and can therefore be      reproduced by anyone. The only products that do tend to be      made available after a copyright expires are ``down and      dirty'' reproductions of such poor quality that they degrade      the original copyrighted work. And there is very little      evidence that the consumer really benefits economically from      works falling into the public domain.       Kurlantzick also denigrates the importance of long-term      copyright protection by stating that ``a dollar to be      received 75 years from now is worth a small fraction of one      cent.'' But, he fails to see that the dollar value placed on      future copyright advantages will increase more or less in      proportion with the inflation rate. That is to say, if the      dollar loses 90% of its value over the next 75 years, then      the cost of goods and services will be roughly 90% higher in      75 years than it is today.       For all these reasons, it's clear why Congress should act.      America can reap valuable benefits, at no cost to itself, if      Congress enacts legislation to extend our copyright      protection by 20 years. By harmonizing our laws with the EU,      we can reduce our balance-of-trade deficit, encourage      economic investment, strengthen our hand in dealing with      intellectual piracy, and see to it that America's authors,      composers, artists, and computer programmers receive the same      level of protection afforded the creative people of other      nations. Thus, copyright term extension makes economic sense,      and it's equitable.                                 ______      By
