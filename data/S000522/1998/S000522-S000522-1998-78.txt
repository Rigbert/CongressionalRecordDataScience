Mr. Speaker, there is no question about the issue before agriculture in America. We must normalize trade with China. It is $2 billion today for trade with China for agriculture in America. And with the largest population of any country in the world, of course it is a great opportunity for agriculture.  It is no secret that when China is in the business of buying wheat, we have $6 wheat in America. When China is not buying wheat, as they are not today, we have $2.50 per bushel wheat. If we block China from ever buying wheat, we will continue to have $2.50 wheat.  A month ago I joined with the Speaker and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm) in a bipartisan effort to help solve the crisis of agricultural prices in America today. We joined by suggesting that we have a square deal for agriculture, the four corners of which are as follows: Lift sanctions for Pakistan and India; pass the International Monetary Fund funding; normalize trade with China; and pass fast track so that we can be again competitors in the international market.  That is the square deal that we propose for agriculture, and this is one more step to improving the crisis in agriculture in America.
