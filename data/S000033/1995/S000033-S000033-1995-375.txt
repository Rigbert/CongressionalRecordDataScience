 Speaker, you and I or the President of the United States and I may disagree with the wisdom of the Mexican bailout, but I think very clearly the American people are wondering about what is happening to our Constitution and to the ability of Members of Congress to represent them.  Mr. Speaker, every single day Members come up here and they question this appropriation, whether this $50,000 is well spent, whether this $200 million is well spent. It seems to me that the people of Vermont and the people all across this country are wondering about the Constitution when we are talking about putting at risk $40 billion of taxpayers' money without serious discussion and debate on the floor of the House.  It seems to me what the Constitution is about is that if the Members of the House and if the Members of the Senate want to approve this $40 billion bailout, OK. But it is incomprehensible, and it seems to me unconstitutional, that that bailout can take place without debate, without discussions, and without a vote.  So, Mr. Speaker, I very much support this privileged resolution, and hope that the Members will vote for it.
