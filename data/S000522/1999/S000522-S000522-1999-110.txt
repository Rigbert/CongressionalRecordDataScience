Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Just let me make a couple of points. In reading over this amendment again, I have great empathy for it. I have had hearings in my subcommittee about human rights abuses and have gone down to Lima, Peru to meet with President Fujimori to express my own concerns, especially in light of the ``Fuji coup'' that took place some years back. But again my position comports with that of the administration and the State Department. And the human rights organizations like Amnesty International, are not saying release her, they are saying give her a fair trial. I think that is where our efforts ought to be put. We do not have the capability or the competence or the information--because I have looked at the reams of information--to make a definitive decision as to whether or not she should be freed.                              {time}  1445  There are very serious charges of terrorism with a group that has a despicable track record on the use of violence against individuals and innocentpeople. Whether or not she is a part of it, I do not know, but there are serious allegations. She was given a sham trial, no doubt about it.  I would be willing to ask unanimous consent, if the gentlewoman would change the wording in her amendment from ``the release of'' Lori Berenson to ``a fair trial for'' Lori Berenson. We could all support that amendment.  But again, to say we should release somebody?  Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent if the gentlewoman could accept that kind of change in the amendment.
