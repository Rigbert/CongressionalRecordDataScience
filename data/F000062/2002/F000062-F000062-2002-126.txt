 President, this past February Senator Gordon Smith and I introduced the National Cancer Act of 2002 with a bipartisan group of 28 cosponsors. This comprehensive bill, based largely on the recommendations of an advisory committee of cancer experts, is meant to update and reinvigorate the nation's war on cancer; a war President Nixon launched in 1971.  The need for our bill is greater and more urgent than ever before. Last week, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute on Aging collectively released their joint Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1973-1999.  The bottom line is that cancer death rates are declining--that's the good news. People are living longer with cancer; we are increasing the ranks of ``cancer survivors.'' In 1997, we had approximately 8.9 million cancer survivors. This number continues to increase. But the incidence of cancer is increasing. That is the bad news. As our population ages, more and more people are being diagnosed with the disease. Researchers suggest that if this pattern continues, by the year 2050 there could be twice as many people being diagnosed with cancer each year as there are now. This year, about 1.3 million people will be diagnosed with cancer. By 2050, this number could reach 2.6 million.  That is why I introduced the National Cancer Act of 2002. It is a new battle plan for conquering cancer. My legislation focuses on finding better treatments and a cure for cancer by investing more funding in cancer research and clinical trials, and ensuring access to early detection and prevention measures. The challenges are plenty. But I believe, now more than ever, that a cure is within our reach.  This report being released today represents the fifth report of its kind, but it is the first report issued that documents a decline in cancer death rates. This is good news. While routine screening has improved the prognosis for cancer patients, and more people are getting screened, cancer still occurs disproportionately among older persons. As baby boomers age, the incidence of cancer will undoubtedly increase among this population. This population presents us with certain challenges and an increased burden on the system. More people will require cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, home health services, general medical attention, and nursing services.  Finding cures and better treatments for cancers will demand more attention to be placed on the biology of older persons. For example, older persons are less likely to be enrolled in a clinical trial. There is also limited knowledge of drug interactions. Will a person's cancer medication interact with that person's heart medication? These are just a few of the challenges. Finding a cure is within our reach. We must continue to focus funding on this goal. At the same time, there is an increased need for developing new strategies for prevention and early detection, looking in particular at age-specific interventions.  For 8 years I have co-chaired the Senate Cancer Coalition. We have held eight hearings on cancer. With each hearing, I become more and more convinced that with adequate resources we can find a cure. Polls by Research America show that the public wants their tax dollars spent on medical research. In fact, people will pay more in taxes for more medical research.  Cancer affects everyone. Everyone knows someone who has had cancer or will have cancer. I am thoroughly convinced that if we just marshal the resources, we can conquer cancer in the 21st century. The report released today is a clarion call for making the effort.                          ____________________
