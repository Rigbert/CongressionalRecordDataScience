 President, I am pleased to join Senator Biden in offering the Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Strategy Act of 1997. As the recent State Department report on international narcotics control makes clear, the criminal activities of major Asian organized crime groups directly affects the United States. Whether we are talking about alien smuggling, heroin trafficking, or spreading corruption, major Asian-based gangs, many operating from Hong Kong, daily affect the quality of life of many of our citizens. Their activities to launder their illegal incomes threatens the integrity of our banking and financial systems.  With the transfer of Hong Kong to China, much of the current expertise on these criminal organizations now based in the Royal Hong Kong Police will be lost. What this legislation will do, and it is only a first step, is to give us the opportunity to examine ways of retaining that expertise, of putting it to use in our efforts to stop a despicable trade in human beings and to improve our capability to stop the flow of dangerous drugs that do so much to make our neighborhoods and streets unsafe. The proposal is innovative and timely. While only authorizing a study, the present proposal will give us the opportunity to explore ways to ensure the effectiveness of our international narcotics control efforts.                                 ______                                       By
