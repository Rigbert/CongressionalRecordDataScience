 President, I rise before you today to honor a great humanitarian and fellow Kentuckian, Eula Hall.  Over 30 years ago Ms. Hall opened a medical clinic in Pike County, KY, at a time when very few people had medical insurance. Such is her dedication to the people of eastern Kentucky she soon gave up her home to house the expanding clinic, moving herself and her young family into much smaller housing.  At 78 years old Ms. Hall continues to work in the clinic every day, usually starting at 8 in the morning and going late into the evening.  Recently the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution to rename Kentucky highway 979 the Eula Hall Highway. On October 24, 2006 The Pike County News Express profiled Eula Hall and her accomplishments and sacrifices for the people of Kentucky.  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Pike County News Express, Oct. 24, 2006]      KY 979 Through Mud Creek To Be Renamed ``Eula Hall Highway''       Friday, October 27, at 1:30 in the afternoon, friends and      colleagues of Eula Hall are invited to gather at the Mud      Creek Clinic on KY 979 at Grethel to celebrate the life and      accomplishments of a brave mountain woman. As a result of a      resolution passed unanimously by the Kentucky General      Assembly the entire road KY 979 from Harold to Hi Hat--will      be re-named Eula Hall Highway. The resolution was introduced      by State Rep. Chuck Meade and State Senator Johnny Ray      Turner.       For the past 40 years, Eula Hall had probably traveled Mud      Creek--Kentucky Route 979--more than anyone else. She was a      woman with a mission to bring quality health care to people      who had no medical insurance and not enough money to pay for      things like visits to the doctor, shots, prescription      medicine, much less surgery, physical therapy, and other more      expensive treatments and procedures. She's made it her life's      work to make sure that no one within her reach goes without      the basic health care they need to live full productive      lives.       And now that road where it all started, the two-lane state      highway that runs through Mud Creek from Harold to Hi Hat,      will be renamed Eula Hall highway in honor of the woman who      brought hope and healing to thousands. ``She had little      education. She had no financial resources of her own. She had      five children to raise by herself. By all accounts her life      should have barely been noticed outside of the family and      close friends,'' said Sara George, Information Officer for      Highway District 12. ``But if you think like that, you don't      think like Eula Hall. She never met a problem she couldn't      face head on, never met a person she couldn't relate to, and      never took `no' for an answer when it came to the health and      well being of the people of her neck of the woods. She is      humble, yet tough; gracious yet tenacious; and she is      probably the most revered, respected, and loved person in Mud      Creek, and rightly so.''       Eula looks at her life from a practical viewpoint.      ``Nothing won't happen if you sit back and watch the      suffering of other people.'' It's a simple motto and one that      she lives by.       More than 30 years ago, Hall opened the Mud Creek Clinic in      Floyd County to serve the needs of people without health      insurance or money to pay their doctors' bills. ``I seen so      much suffering, since I was a little girl. There was no      affordable health care at all for people without health      insurance, people without money. We just stayed home, sick or      whatever. People died for lack of a tetanus shot or      something,'' she told the Courier Journal last year.       The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet's Executive Director      for Highway District 12, Danl Hall, will emcee a ceremony      that will feature speakers such as Senator Turner, Rep.      Meade, Social Security Administration Area District Manager      Jim Kelly and Big Sandy Health Care CEO Ancil Lewis. U.S.      Congressman Hal Rogers will be represented by Tonya Conn.       Born in Greasy Creek in Pike County, Eula didn't start      school until she was nine years old. She remembers crying on      her last day of the eighth grade because she knew she      couldn't continue her education. The closest high school was      about 20 miles away, and there was no school bus that came      that far out in the county. She had six brothers and sisters;      her parents didn't have a car; and as farm workers they      certainly didn't have the money for boarding school or      college.       Years later, as a young mother raising five children on her      own, she realized anew the terrible toll that lack of proper      health care took on people without money or insurance. She      organized screening using medical students from UK and      Vanderbilt as well as volunteer nurses and physicians. They      found undiagnosed tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis (black lung),      diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. In 1973 she      managed to get a clinic licensed to operate on Mud Creek in      Floyd County. The Mud Creek Clinic opened in a rented house      on Tinker Fork, which it quickly outgrew. Hall moved the      facility to her own home on Mink Branch. Her house was bigger      and easier to get to. But it meant moving her family into a      mobile home.       Eula Hall picked up patients and took them home because      many of them had no transportation, or at least none that was      reliable. She delivered food and medicine. Now she even works      to get people their rightful Social Security and other      benefits, winning more cases than some attorneys, according      to many observers.       By 1977 the clinic merged with Big Sandy Health Care, which      remains its parent organization today.       Five years later, the clinic burned to the ground. ``We      didn't miss a day,'' Hall recalled. ``We set up shop on a      picnic table under the trees.''       The new Mud Creek Clinic opened in 1984, thanks to $320,000      from the Appalachian Regional Commission and dozens of quilt      raffles, chicken and dumpling dinners, a radio-thon, and      other local fundraising efforts.       Now there are 24 employees, including two full-time      physicians, a full-time certified physician assistant, and a      part-time doctor. The clinic is housed in a modern brick      building with another facility behind it that houses a dental      clinic and food pantry. Eula Hall is 78 years old, but still      goes to work at 8 o'clock every morning.       Last year Eula was presented an honorary doctorate from      Berea College at the same ceremony which honored Archbishop      Desmond Tutu, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. She also      holds an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Harford,      Connecticut, and one from the Pikeville College School of      Osteopathic Medicine.       ``I appreciate (the awards),'' she said. ``But I never done      anything to get awards. I do it because I need to. Somebody      needs to.''       Clinic patients, neighbors and friends, and many local      elected and appointed government officials will come together      on Friday     to honor Eula Hall once again, this time by naming in her      honor the road she's traveled so many years. The public is      invited to attend and join Eula afterwards for a reception      hosted by Big Sandy Health Care.                          ____________________[Pages S11040-S11041]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          TRIBUTE TO EULA HALL  Mr. McCONNELL.
