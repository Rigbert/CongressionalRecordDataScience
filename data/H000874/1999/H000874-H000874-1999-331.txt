Speaker, I rise to mark the occasion of the Third Annual Caucus for the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail to be held October 22 at Oxon Hill Manor, in my District.  Since Congress designated the Potomac River corridor as a National Scenic Trail in legislation enacted in 1983, grassroots organizations have joined forces with federal, state and local government agencies to identify new opportunities to provide for public enjoyment of a trail that follows ``Our Nation's River.'' Protection of our river--which is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed--and its historic sites and natural areas must be a top priority for our region in the years ahead.  The National Park Service requires sufficient tools to help facilitate public involvement withthis National Scenic Trail, which is why I support full funding of this effort under the Service's budget.  I congratulate the community of grassroots supporters of the Potomac Heritage Trail including the Potomac Heritage Partnership, Prince George's County government, the Accokeek Foundation and many other local groups and individuals. They are leading the regional effort to encourage conservation, historic preservation and sustainable commerce along the Potomac River corridor. They deserve our full support for their efforts.                          ____________________
