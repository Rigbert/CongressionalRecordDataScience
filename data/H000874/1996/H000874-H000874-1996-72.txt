Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I would just briefly say that the chairman is correct in his point of order. I am glad that he reserved it.  I rise to say that the gentleman's objective is one that I strongly support. I lamented last year's policy to shut down the Government and the consequences that it had. I think the gentleman's effort to preclude that from happening again is a very positive one for every American, not just the Federal employees or the Federal Government. I thank him for his efforts.
