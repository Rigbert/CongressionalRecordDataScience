 President, we have had a brief chance to take a look at this amendment. We have not seen it before 10 minutes ago. We are looking at the language now.  The Senator from Arkansas says that he wants 95 percent of the money to goto classrooms. I don't think anybody disagrees with that. In fact, it is my understanding that much more than that--in fact, 98 percent of Federal funds actually go to school districts and classrooms. So what he is asking for currently is in place.  We go back to why I originally put this amendment before us, which is the fact that we have classrooms that are overcrowded, classrooms where children are not learning. We have classrooms where we as elected officials are demanding that our students learn math, reading, and language skills but simply do not have the ability to do it because of overcrowded classrooms.  Mr. President, we will continue to take a look at this language. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a comment.
