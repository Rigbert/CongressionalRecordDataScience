President, the distinguished Senator from Utah--if I might have his attention for one moment--the distinguished Senator from Utah and I have tried very hard to have speakers pro and con. It is my understanding that the distinguished majority leader wants this debate to go on for a few days, and as well it should.  Also, I understand the distinguished Senator from Utah wanted an opportunity for some of the new Members of the Senate to speak on this, as well they should. It is an important issue.  I urge those who do wish to speak to cooperate with the floor leaders, as they have. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have been trying to do this informally--not through an order, but informally--to have one Member speak in favor of the amendment, one Member speak in opposition to the amendment, and go back and forth so the debate will bear relevance to the issue. I hope that all Senators will understand that and will work and cooperate with the two of us to make that possible.
