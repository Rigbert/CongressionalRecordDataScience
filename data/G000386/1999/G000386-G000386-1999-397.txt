 President, I rise today in strong opposition to both cloture on the steel quota bill, and to the bill itself.  I oppose this dangerous and misguided legislation for three reasons.  First, the steel quota bill is really a phony bill of goods. It does not do what it promises. It will not restore the vitality of troubled elements of the U.S. steel industry. That's because foreign imports have little to do with the problems facing the American steel industry.  Why? Because the American steel industry is much more efficient than at almost any time in our past history. Fewer steel workers are producing more steel today than they were 10 years ago. In 1987, when the domestic industry produced 77 million short tons, 163,000 workers were employed in the steel industry. In 1997, 10 years later, when the domestic industry produced 106 million tons, employment was 112,000 workers. During that 10 year span, our steel mills made 29 million more tons with 51,000 fewer workers.  Using the logic behind this quota legislation, the more efficient our steel industry becomes, the more it requires protection from foreign imports. But in fact, the opposite is true. The more protection an industry gets, the more inefficient it becomes. That is not good for our economy, or for American consumers. During the next few years, we may see steel employment fall even further, perhaps by as much of 5,000 workers per year, as inefficient integrated mills are closed. New, more efficient minimills will take up any slack. All of this will happen whether or not steel quotas are imposed.  Who will really benefit from the quota bill?  According to the Institute For International Economics, one of this country's most distinguished and highly regarded think tanks, few steel workers will benefit. But steel importers and profitable, efficient steel makers will win big.  The Institute's report states:       The annual costs to American households for each steel job      saved would exceed $800,000. But steel workers would receive      less than 20 percent of this huge sum; lucky firms would      collect more than 80 percent of the jackpot. . . . Quotas      will enrich lucky steel importers (often those with the best      political connections) and efficient steel producers (they      are doing well enough already--11 of the 13 largest mills      earned more than $1 billion in 1998). . . .  The United States Senate should not help enrich a few lucky importers. It should not give windfalls to companies earning a billion dollars a year.  I have the deepest concern for any American who loses his or her job for any reason. It is a terrible, wrenching thing to lose a job. It affects families as well as communities. We must help where we can, through programs like trade adjustment assistance, that help displaced workers through job retraining and placement assistance. But the one thing we must not do is react in haste, in a way that will kill far more jobs than it will ever save, and in a way that will reward healthy companies with windfall profits.  The second reason I oppose the steel quota bill is that it flat-out violates our WTO international trade obligations.  There are some who claim this is not the case. But, I want to read the exact words of Article 11 of the GATT. This rule is part of the WTO rules that we and 133 other nations are committed to observe:       No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes,      or other charges, whether made effective through quotas,      import or export licenses or other measures, shall be      instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the      importation of any product of the territory of any other      contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of      any product destined for the territory of any other      contracting party.  We helped write that law. We demand that our trading partners observe it. We defend it when other countries try to keep our goods out of their markets. And most of the time, we win these cases.  Now, I'm not a lawyer. Maybe that's my problem. Perhaps I'm not clever enough to figure out where Article 11 says that quotas are OK. It seems pretty clear to me. It says that you can't have restrictions other than duties, taxes, or other charges. But Article 11 goes even farther than banning quotas. It says that you can't have any type of government measure that leads to the imposition of a quota.  One important panel decision, the GATT panel on Semiconductors, affirmed this broad interpretation in 1988. It said that Article 11, unlike other GATT provisions, does not refer solely to laws or regulations. It has an even broader application, and refers to all ``measures'' that restrict exports.  There are some exceptions to Article 11's broad ban on any measures restricting exports. But the most relevant of these exceptions, the so-called Safeguard exception, does not apply because there is no proof that our domestic steel industry has suffered serious injury from import competition. Moreover, safeguard actions usually involve imposing increased customs duties, rather than quotas. Yes, there has been illegal dumping of steel by some countries into the United States. But the surge of that dumped steel has largely been stopped. And even during the highest point last year of the so-calledsteel crisis, 11 of the 13 largest steel mills were profitable, earning collective profits of more than $1 billion. So much for serious injury.  The final reason I oppose the quote bill--and the most important reason--is that it will invite retaliation and perhaps spark a trade war that no one would win, and in which everyone would lose.  We are approaching the 69th anniversary of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930. This legislation, which was enacted in July 1930, was one of the major mistakes of the Hoover Administration and the Seventy-first Congress.  The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act also started out with good intentions. Its aim was to help the American farmer with a limited, upward revision of tariffs on foreign produce. But it had the opposite result. It strangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Depression. Other countries faced with a deficit of exports to pay for their imports responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods.  I went back to the historical record to see what happened to United States agricultural exports when other countries stopped buying our agricultural products after we enacted that tariff. I was shocked by the depth and the severity of the retaliation.  In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of agricultural goods. By 1932, that amount had been cut almost in half, to $589 million. Barley exports dropped by half. So did exports of soybean oil. Pork exports fell 15 percent. Almost every American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation, but particularly agriculture. As United States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of many rural banks. Their weakened condition undermined depositor confidence, leading to depositor runs, bank failures, and ultimately, a contraction in the money supply.  Farm prices for many agricultural products are already at rock-bottom levels. Can we in good conscience put so much of our economy at risk?  In 1998 the United States exported agricultural products worth more than $53 billion dollars, accounting for one-third of America's total agricultural production, and nearly one million jobs. Agriculture is perhaps the most vulnerable sector of our economy to foreign retaliation, and our trading partners know it.  If you think the Depression is ancient history, and that retaliation against agriculture is a thing of the past, just look at our recent history.  In 1995, when the United States threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars, Japan appealed the case to the WTO and stated that it might retaliate imposing duties on U.S. exports of agriculture products.  In 1983, China temporarily stopped buying U.S. wheat in retaliation for the Reagan Administration's unilateral imposition of quotas on its textile and apparel exports after negotiations to renew a bilateral agreement under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement broke down.  In 1985, the European Community raised tariffs on U.S. lemons and walnuts in response to U.S. retaliation against subsidized EC pasta exports.  Even though we have made vast progress in managing our trade relationships since the passage of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, in many ways the world is still just one trade war away from a global economic crisis.  In 1930, 1,000 of the nation's leading economists signed a letter urging the President and the Congress to not enact the infamous legislation we now know as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. They were ignored. Politics carried the day. American paid a steep price. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the Seventy-first Congress. The quota bill is bad trade policy. It is bad for agriculture. It is bad for America.                          ____________________
