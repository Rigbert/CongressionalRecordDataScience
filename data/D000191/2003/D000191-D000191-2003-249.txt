Speaker, I regret the congressional schedule keeps me from attending the deployment ceremony to honor members of the 41st Brigade. This ceremony marks just a portion of the honor and debt of gratitude that our state and our nation owe you for your service. We also owe a debt of gratitude to your family and friends for their understanding, support, and sacrifice.  The media talks so much of high tech and secret weapons, but the enduring strength and real secret behind the military power of the United States is men and women like you who have volunteered to serve as the new citizen soldiers, highly trained and motivated. You constitute the key to the success of our total force--a military second to none in the world. You and the other 8,000 Members of the Oregon National Guard continue a long and honored tradition of service to Oregon's citizens in times of disaster, crisis, or strife, while training and preparing to defend our nation in time of need.  The mission ahead of you will be both difficult and dangerous--to bring stability and order to a ravaged nation in the midst of one of the most volatile regions on Earth. All Americans and our allies around the world will be more safe and secure if this region can be moved toward peace, but this course is not easy or certain.  I pledge to do all I can in Congress to ensure that you have the best training and equipment necessary to accomplish your mission and return home safely. I further pledge that your service and sacrifice will not be forgotten and will be reflected in the treatment and benefits you and your family receive.  From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of all the citizens of Oregon's 4th Congressional District, thank you and Godspeed.                          ____________________
