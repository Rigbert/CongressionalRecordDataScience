 President, I fully support this landmark agreement negotiated by the Sierra Club's Cascade Checkerboard Project, the Weyerhaeuser Company, and the Forest Service. I particularly applaud the Weyerhaeuser Company's donation of approximately 1,900 acres of land, 900 acres of which will become part of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area.  This exchange will give Weyerhaeuser 7,200 acres of 80- to 100-year-old trees within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Pierce County, WA, in exchange for 33,000 acres of company's land. Essentially, the company gets timber to cut now, and the public gets much more land upon which future forests will be grown. Both Weyerhaeuser and the Forest Service will also be better able to manage their lands as ecosystems and reduce costs and administrative burdens of checkerboard management.  I strongly support such negotiated trades. I believe it is in all of our interests to reduce the checkerboard pattern of ownership--which Congress created through a massive land grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1864. I will continue to encourage cooperation between public and private landowner, and environmental and timber interests. Such agreements provide models for resolution of natural resources disputes and other environmental issues.  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to take expeditious action on this bill, which simply alters the boundary of Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The boundary change is needed before the exchange can occur. I thank my colleagues for any support they can give to their bipartisan, non-controversial bill.                                 ______      By
