President, we have agreed to go back and forth. I know Senator Akaka has been waiting for a while. Certainly it is all right to go to him. I wish to make one point first.  It is a little unfair and unrealistic--and I want to make sure everyone interested in this issue understands, we have had the McCain-Lieberman bill for months now, and we have all had a chance to study it. The fact they changed this bill and they are saying you are not talking about the bill before you now, that did not happen until 11:53 this morning. We have not had a chance to see it.  The bottom line is this: As was stated by the Senator from Connecticut, this is just a start. So if their bill is just a start, what it does is recognize CO2 as a pollutant, and that changes the policy for America. I think the debate from this point forward should go on as if we are talking about the original McCain-Lieberman bill. That is what we will be doing.  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.
