 President, the Senate is now debating the Violence Against Women Act.  We began debate on this legislation by consent, and we would like to complete action on this legislation also by consent. We have been working to enter into an efficient consent agreement with only a couple of relevant amendments and with very short time agreements for processing them.  This approach is in keeping with how Republicans have handled VAWA in the past. This approach would also allow us to complete the bill today.
