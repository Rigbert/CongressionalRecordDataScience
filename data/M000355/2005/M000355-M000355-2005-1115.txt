 DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. My concern was not the words of the FBI agent, but the words of the Senator from Illinois. I believe I heard the Senator repeat today--let me ask the Senator if in fact this is what he meant to say--because it was the quote I had from the Senator, not from the FBI agent, earlier yesterday or the day before, which I believe the Senator repeated today. Iwas curious if the Senator does stand by his own words, not the words of the FBI agent, which I believe were:       If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was a      FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in      their control, you would almost certainly believe that this      must have been done by the Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or      some mad regime, Pol Pot or others, that had no concern for      human beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the      action of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners.  So my question of the Senator is not the words of the FBI agent but the words of the Senator from Illinois. Does the Senator from Illinois stand by these words, comparing the action of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners to the Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or Pol Pot or others?
