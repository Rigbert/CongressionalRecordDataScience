 President, I rise today to introduce a measure that will assist the President of the United States in carrying out a promise he made to the people of Wisconsin that he would approve the Wisconsin Works program. There have been some problems getting welfare actually acted on. I had a very nice letter from the President last year for the work that we did on the welfare reform bill. But that measure got vetoed and so did a subsequent measure.  Now, the President has said that he supports the welfare reform demonstration project in Wisconsin, known as Wisconsin Works. Well, today, on behalf of myself, Senators Coats, Abraham, Gramm of Texas, Ashcroft, Craig, Coverdell, Grassley, Gregg, Santorum, Faircloth, and Nickles, I am submitting a very brief bill, which, in substance, says that when waivers are submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Services to conduct a demonstration project known as Wisconsin Works, those waivers shall be deemed approved.  We have heard many stories about the need to reform welfare, Mr. President, and one of those stories that has been repeated recently is that of an experiment in Sedalia, MO, where applicants for food stamps were sent to an employer. Many of them took jobs, which is good. It moved them off public assistance. Those who were turned down because they were not capable could stay on public assistance. Those who refused to show up were taken off of the food stamp rolls. So there was an incentive for those who did not want to work. Two people went for the job, but they were turned down because they tested positive for drugs.  Under existing Federal law, the State of Missouri could not sanction those people, even though they were turned down for a job because they tested positive for drugs. The simple point of that is that that creates the most perverse of incentives--the incentive for people who are on public assistance and who do not want to have to take a job to get on drugs and they can stay on the public assistance rolls.  That is the kind of thing that needs to be changed. That is why we need welfare reform. Today, Mr. President, I am simply acting to expedite one of the many waivers now pending from the States, which has been delayed, I understand from the Governors, an average of 210 days. This measure, if and when adopted, will deem the waivers submitted by the State of Wisconsin to be approved.                                 ______      By
