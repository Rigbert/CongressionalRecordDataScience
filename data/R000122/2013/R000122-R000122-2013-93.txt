President, I am prepared to make a request for consent.  I believe the Republican leader will respond, and at the conclusion of his response I wish to be recognized to make additional comments.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act, the text of which is at the desk, the bill be read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
