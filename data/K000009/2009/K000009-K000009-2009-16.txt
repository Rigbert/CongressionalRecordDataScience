Companies like Xunlight, Innovative Greenfields, Solar Fields, Calyxo, Willard & Kelsey--these were born because of an innovative incubation strategy that helped our researchers make the leap from science to manufacturing.  Mr. Chairman, the base bill and this amendment provide the direction to transform our solar industry and breathe life into our idle industrial economy to produce the advanced energy products of tomorrow and to restore America's energy independence.  I again compliment the gentlelady from Arizona for her leadership, and I thank both Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall so very much for their time today.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment and the base bill.             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 18, 2007]               Toledo Finds the Energy To Reinvent Itself                            (By Jim Carlton)       Toledo, Ohio.--This city became famous in the last century      for being one of North America's leading glass centers. The      industry has been in decline since the 1980s, but Toledo      hopes to be known for its glass again. This time, though, the      glass is being coated with thin layers of chemicals to      produce ecofriendly ``solar cells.''       Toledo is among several old-line industrial cities trying      to reinvent themselves--sometimes based on their older      industries--to cash in on the demand for alternative energy.      In 2006, solar start-up United Solar Inc. said it would open      thin-film factories in Auburn Hills and Greenville, two      Michigan towns hit hard by the automotive decline. And last      year, a wind-generation plant began construction on the      grounds of a shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna,      N.Y.       Industry officials say older industrial cities offer the      clean-tech industry some advantages, including less community      opposition to new plants. ``The good thing about the Rust      Belt is they want factories there,'' says Ron Kenedi, vice      president of Sharp Corp.'s Solar Energy Solutions Group,      which is based in Huntington Beach, Calif.       Recently, Norm Johnston, a former executive at Toledo glass      companies, showed how Solar Fields LLC, a start-up he runs,      was leveraging the old glass industry. Walking to the back of      a 22,000-square-foot former machine shop in the nearby suburb      of Perrysburg, he patted the blue metal casing on a 100-foot-     long production line, which his company has designed to coat      sheets of glass heated to more than 1,100 degrees with      chemicals to make solar cells.       ``I started in glass, and now I'm back in glass,'' says Mr.      Johnston, whose start-up has recently been acquired by German      solar-panel maker Q-Cells AG.       There is similar activity at several other sites in this      metropolitan area of 600,000. Companies from Phoenix-based      First Solar Inc. to Xunlight Corp. are opening factories in      and around Toledo to create electricity-producing ``thin-     film'' solar panels on glass and other materials. While not      rated as efficient as the more prevalent silicon-based solar      cells, thin film has taken off in the last year because of      soaring demand for alternative energy and a world-wide      silicon shortage. It is also cheaper to make than silicon      cells.       In addition to First Solar, which in 1999 built a factory      in Perrysburg that now employs about 600, the University of      Toledo is receiving state grants to expand its solar research      and incubate thin-film spinoffs. So far, the university has      incubated four solar start-ups, including Solar Fields,      Xunlight, Innovative Thin Films Ltd. and Advanced Distributed      Generation LLC. Toledo's Regional Growth Partnership, a      nonprofit economic development group, is also using state      grants to help fund solar and other alternative energy start-     ups.       ``I think alternative energy is one of the major hopes for      northwest Ohio,'' says John Szuch, chairman of Fifth Third      Bank of Northwestern Ohio.       In Toledo, the repercussions of the new solar activity are      already being felt. Pilkington North America Inc., a Toledo-     based unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass Co., has become a      major supplier to First Solar, offsetting some of the      business it lost in the traditional glass industry.      Pilkington officials estimate thin-film sales have grown to      about 10% of revenue for its American building products      division, prompting the company to beef up a research      division that had been undergoing cuts. ``It's the biggest      thing going for us right now in terms of glass,'' says Todd      Huffman, vice president of strategic planning for Pilkington.       But clean tech isn't necessarily a panacea. Only about      5,000 solar jobs have been created in the last five years in      Toledo. Meanwhile, the number of manufacturing jobs lost      since the 1980s is in the tens of thousands.       Cities like Toledo may also have trouble competing with      domestic clean-tech hot spots like Silicon Valley, which are      in closer proximity to venture capital sources. In addition,      Toledo is competing against cheaper overseas locales. First      Solar, for instance, is building four manufacturing plants in      Malaysia. Company officials say the Perrysburg plant remains      ``critical'' to the firm's future success.       Still, Toledo has come a long way. Stricken by      manufacturing declines in the automotive and other big glass-     consuming sectors, the city has been in an economic malaise      for much of two decades. Its population loss in the 1990s was      one of the fastest in the U.S.       Toledo acquired its Glass City moniker because of a long      history of innovation in all aspects of the glass business.      Owens-Illinois, Owens Corning, Glasstech and Tempglass have      extensive ties here. As the traditional glass industry      slowed, executives explored other uses for the material.       In 1989, local inventor and glass entrepreneur Harold      McMaster invested some of his millions to launch one of the      city's first solar start-ups. ``He knew that sooner or later      we would have to come up with a clean source of energy,''      says Alan McMaster, son of the now-deceased Mr. McMaster, an      icon in the industry. Mr. McMaster's company, Glasstech      Solar, became Solar Cells Inc., with research facilities at      the University of Toledo and in a nearby city. In 1999, Solar      Cells was acquired by a private-equity firm and became First      Solar.       At the time, there was little demand in the thin-film      industry. In 2002, British oil giant BP PLC pulled the plug      on two thin-film plants it had had in the works for more than      10 years, amid issues including technical problems, according      to a January report by the Department of Energy's National      Renewable Energy Laboratory.       But rising energy costs and other events--including the      blackout in the Northeast in August 2003--brought thin-film      and other alternative energies back into favor. ``We said,      `There's a business opportunity here if we had solar',''      recalls Solar Fields's Mr. Johnston. The university boosted      its emphasis on thin-film research in 2001, and this year it      shared in an $18.6 million state grant to fund the solar      industry.       The school is now using the money to beef up solar research      in its McMaster Hall, where some labs have been packed with      equipment like a magnetron gun, which is used to spray thin-     film chemicals on glass and other surfaces.       Civic leaders in Toledo now say they have the ingredients      in place to turn solar into a thriving industry. In a seafood      restaurant overlooking the Maumee River one recent evening,      business and academic leaders discussed the city's rising      solar industry and traced back its roots. ``How in the hell      would we be in this business in the first place if it weren't      for glass?'' asked Harlan Reichle, a local real-estate      executive.                                  ____             Toledo's Makeover: Glass City to Solar Valley                            (By Chris Bury)       In Toledo, once the glass-making capital of the country,      most of the city's output over the years has gone into making      everything from windshields to windows for cars and      buildings.       But as the auto and construction industries have declined,      so too, has Toledo's manufacturing sector.       For Glen Eason, a manufacturing worker, supplying the auto      industry meant waiting for the ax to fall.       ``I've been scared to death for the past 10 years, to tell      you the truth,'' said Eason, a Toledo native and 30-year auto      supply industry veteran.       Marty Vick, 58, also spent 30 years working at an auto      supplier, making seats and dashboards, only to see his job      disappear. His company laid off 117 people in January.       ``I never thought I'd see the day that GM, Ford and      Chrysler would be at the brink of bankruptcy,'' Vick said.       That has left entire cities, including Toledo, on the      brink. With its smokestack industries dying out, Toledo saw      the writing on the wall and did something about it.         Watch the story tonight on ``World News'' at 6:30 p.m.       To secure its future, Toledo, once known as the Glass City,      embraced its past; Toledo is where glass was first mass-     produced for bottles, buildings, and cars. Now, the city is      turning those skills--and that tradition--to the sun.       New solar energy-related businesses are taking hold in what      city officials and local executives hope will become Ohio's      ``solar valley.''       ``We didn't envision there would be some bailout of Toledo,      so we had to do it ourselves,'' said Norm Johnston, CEO of      Solar Fields, a solar startup company. ``We want to move from      being the `rust belt' to being the `renewable energy belt.'      ''       Solar Fields is on the forefront of the fast-growing      ``green industry,'' supplying panels that help power a      National Guard base. It is one of dozens of new companies in      Toledo that now make rivers of glass into solar cells, panels      and coatings.       ``Our goal is to create jobs. What we like and what our      favorite color is--is green. But it's the green of cash that      gives you good jobs,'' Johnston said.               Town Has Brighter Mission With Solar Power       In Ohio's ``solar valley,'' 10,000 new jobs have taken      root. Companies, like Xunlight, founded by researchers at the      University of Toledo, are growing fast, working with experts      to manufacture solar products and hiring new employees to      become ``green collar'' workers.       ``Last year, we grew 300 percent--from 20 employees to 80      employees today,'' said Xunming Deng, a physics professor-     turned CEO of Xunlight Corp.       Executives hired from rust-belt companies, who are      accustomed to downsizing, have a brighter mission in the      solar business.       ``In the last position, it was about how do we get rid of      people,'' said Matt Longthorne, vice president of Xunlight.      ``And in this position, it's how do we hire people and get      bigger.''       Many of Xunlight's workers once made auto parts: everything      from windshields to vinyl seats. Now they turn out thin,      flexible solar modules that power homes and businesses.       What Vick gave up in hourly wages working for an auto      supplier, he's gained in a brighter future--working in the      solar industry, he has more job security than ever before.       ``This is really high tech, cutting edge for me,'' Vick      said. ``It's really, really challenging and I like it.''       Eason, who has also gone to a job in green technology, is      enthusiastic, seeing his native Toledo switching gears.      ``Just to be part of something that's growing and something      that's good for the planet and good for the people,'' Eason      said. ``Solar is going to be so immense. Solar is the new      oil.''       Toledo is bailing itself out from the faded glory of the      Glass City to the shiny promise of the Solar Valley.       ``You have all this wonderful energy that the sun is      sending to us for free and we're devising ways to capture it      and put it to use,'' Eason said. ``In this area, we're in the      forefront and everybody else is going to have to catch up      with us.''                                  ____                  [From the Economist, Aug. 13, 2009]                         Greening the Rustbelt       Xunlight Corporation, a small manufacturer of solar panels,      sits on a quiet street in Toledo. It has a professor as its      president, about 100 employees on its payroll--and a lot of      bigwig visitors. In October 2008 Sarah Palin, then the      Republican vice-presidential candidate, used Xunlight as the      setting for a speech on energy policy. Other guests have      included Ohio's governor, two senators and a congresswoman.      And no wonder: the firm provided evidence to support a      seductive hope, that the green economy can help to revive the      suffering rustbelt.       As the battle over a cap-and-trade bill continues in      Congress, the industrial Midwest finds itself playing an      awkward role. The climate bill offers two big opportunities,      to reduce global warming and boost the green economy in the      process. And nowhere are green jobs more loudly promoted than      in the rustbelt. On August 5th Barack Obama and Joe Biden,      his vice-president, travelled to Indiana and Michigan, two      ailing swing states, to announce new grants to develop      electric cars. But hopes for those new green jobs are matched      by fears that traditional ones will be lost. With the Senate      due to debate a cap-and-trade bill next month, the rustbelt      and its politicians are at the heart of the battle.       The industrial Midwest has long been in need of a      renaissance. Its factories have been losing jobs for decades,      since long before the recession hit. Michigan, home to      America's biggest carmakers, had a 15.2% unemployment rate in      June, compared with a national average of 9.5%.       Green investment presents new hope. The University of      Massachusetts, Amherst, and the Centre for American Progress,      a think-tank, estimated in June that the federal stimulus      package and a climate bill would spur about $150 billion in      spending on clean energy each year for the next decade. That      spending, in turn, would create an estimated 2.5m jobs, from      academic researchers to factory workers making wind turbines.      ``This is an opportunity for American ingenuity to renew the      manufacturing base,'' argues Phyllis Cuttino of the      Environment Group at the Pew Charitable Trusts.       There are already signs of activity. The Great Lakes Wind      Network, based in Ohio, helps local firms sell goods to the      wind business. Toledo remains one of the best examples of a      town moving from the old economy     to a newer one. It has been a hub for the glass manufacturing      since the 19th century. Thanks to innovations in solar      technology at the University of Toledo, it is now home to a      cluster of firms such as Xunlight. State grants continue to      help the university hatch companies. The Regional Growth      Partnership, a local business group, provides venture      capital.       In Michigan despair has bred particularly bold action. In      the past five years Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic      governor, has dangled more than $1 billion to attract      alternative-energy firms, with about $700m in tax credits to      develop electric-car batteries. Impressively, Michigan had      the third-highest number of clean-tech patents from 1999 to      2008, behind only California and New York, reckons Pew. That      number may rise. Last year Michigan passed a requirement for      power companies to boost efficiency, along with an order that      renewable sources account for 10% of the state's electricity      by 2015. Investments from the federal stimulus will help too.      In the share-out on August 5th, Michigan won more grants for      electric cars than any other state.       Nevertheless, the clean-energy economy remains small.      Though green jobs are increasing in number, they accounted      for only 0.6% of jobs in Ohio in 2007, according to Pew. The      shares in Michigan and Indiana were even smaller, at 0.4% and      0.5% respectively. Manufacturing, for all its troubles, is a      behemoth in comparison, accounting for 14% of employment in      Ohio, 15% in Michigan and 18% in Indiana in 2007. And it is a      dirty giant, dependent on cheap coal. The Midwest emits an      outsize share of carbon, according to a report from the      Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Indiana is one of the      worst offenders, spewing out 4% of America's carbon emissions      in 2007 though it is home to only 2% of its population.       The fear is that a cap-and-trade bill may expand a      promising new sector but devastate a struggling, larger one.      Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana, has worked      hard to maintain his state's manufacturing base. A price on      carbon, he argues, would threaten it.       The version of cap-and-trade passed in June by the House      was meant to appease such critics. It includes help for      manufacturers eager to retool for new industries. Allowances      would be given away, not auctioned. And at the urging of a      congressman from Michigan, the bill would, from 2020, tax      imports from countries that do not restrict emissions. But      some Democrats are still wary. Three of Indiana's five House      Democrats voted against the bill.       Now a tough battle looms in the Senate. A new report from      the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that      the House bill would depress industrial shipments by 1%      between 2012 and 2030 (see chart). But that assumes a quick      expansion of nuclear plants, which is unlikely. In the EIA's      worst-case scenario, shipments would drop 3.2%. ``They're      huxtering,'' huffs George Voinovich, Ohio's Republican      senator, of the green enthusiasts. He wants more support for      nuclear power and fears the House bill will transfer wealth      from the heartland. On August 6th, ten of Mr Voinovich's      Democratic colleagues, including six from the Midwest, wrote      to Mr Obama fretting that a bill would cripple manufacturing      industry.       But in Toledo Xunlight's president, Xunming Deng, looks      forward to a cap-and-trade bill. ``Of course there is a cost,      but this is an investment for our economy, for our future,''      he says. There remains a danger, however, that compromise      will produce a clunker of a bill--one that does little to      slow climate change, little to revive the old economy and      little to boost a new one. Much now depends on a handful of      the states in the heartland.
