President, I too wish to commend the Senator from Virginia for offering this amendment in conjunction with the Senator from Maryland. I wrote to OPM in July of last year about this very issue. I was very concerned about reports in my own State and from the Washington Post about the tremendous backlog at OPM in processing the retirement applications of Federal and postal workers, and this is just wrong.  As the Senator's statement shows, it has caused some real hardship to individuals. So I was pleased the chairman and I could work with the Senator to modify his amendment so it would be germane to this bill. I look forward, at the appropriate time, to working with the chairman to accept the amendment.
