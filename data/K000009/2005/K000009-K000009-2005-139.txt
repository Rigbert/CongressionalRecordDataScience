Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  If the gentleman and my colleagues could read the amendment, it does not prescribe any format for the Secretaries of Energy or Interior to use in creating this reserve. In fact, the reserve could actually be stored in the form of the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is on line.  So it literally could be the type of Commodity Credit Corporation booking that we use for other grains in our country and other material that we use in refining of alcohol-based fuels. So it does not say to the Secretary that they have to buy it in this form or store it in a given form.
