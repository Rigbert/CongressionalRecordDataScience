Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, because as I turned around, I saw the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Baird), and it was an oversight that I did not mention his extraordinary leadership in bringing this matter to not only the attention of all the Members and pressing for attention of this matter, but also to the country. And I want to congratulate the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) for his singular focus on this critical issue.
