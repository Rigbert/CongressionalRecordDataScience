 Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, in one word, in one word, this Republican reconciliation bill can be described as a fraud. Nothing more, nothing less, a fraud. What kind of sense does it make to ask senior citizens to pay $312 a year more for a weekend Medicare Program while the Republicans give a $14,000-a-year tax break to people making $300,000 a year?                              {time}  1545  Why should we ask low-income workers to pay more in taxes, while we cut and do away with taxes for some of the largest and most profitable corporations in America?  Why do we throw 20,000 Vermonters off of Medicaid, low-income, disabled people, children, senior citizens off of Medicaid, while we retain and not cut $800 billion in corporate welfare for the privileged and the wealthy?  Mr. Chairman, this Republican proposal is a fraud and it must be returned to sender. Let us defeat it today.
