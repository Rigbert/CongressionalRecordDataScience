 President, I want to take a brief moment to share with my colleagues the tremendous effort to craft an agreement which preserves section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act while permitting Azerbaijan to assist with America's war on terrorism. In the closing minutes of the Senate's debate on the FY 2002 Foreign Operations bill yesterday, Senators Sarbanes, Brownback, and I reached agreement on my amendment which strikes a balance between our counter terrorism needs and vital ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan with respect to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  I want to thank my colleagues for their constructive input into my amendment. In addition, the Administration deserves our gratitude for their willingness to work with Congress on finding a compromise which addressed the concerns of all sides of this complicated issue. It is no secret in the halls of Congress that there was serious consideration of a certification under section 907 as a means of securing the legal authority to provide counter terrorism assistance to Azerbaijan. Such a certification would have permanently eliminated section 907 as a means to support the sensitive ongoing negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite some carveouts over the years, this was the most serious challenge to section 907 since its inception. Senator Sarbanes and I, in particular, strongly believe that section 907 is vital to ongoing peace efforts and that such a certification was an unacceptable option.  I also want to recognize the invaluable input and encouragement of patriotic Armenian-Americans who understand the importance of supporting America's efforts to fight terrorism on every front. But, cooperating with Azerbaijan should not mean that the negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh should be disrupted. Here again, the amendment provides protection. Counter terrorism assistance to Azerbaijan will not be forthcoming unless the President determines and certifies to Congress that the assistance ``will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia.'' The Administration has assured us that they support peaceful negotiations and that none of our counter-terrorism efforts will disrupt these talks.  In addition to the amendment preserving section 907, I sponsored an amendment to provide assistance to Armenia under the Foreign Military Financing and the International Military Education and Training programs. This historic amendment will for the first time provide Armenia with valuable military assistance. The IMET funding will allow the U.S. to work with and train with the Armenian military thereby improving America's ability to work with Armenia on a host of security issues. This will ensure that Armenia remains a strong ally and coalition partner in the war against terrorism.  We will have an opportunity to revisit issues relating to Armenian and Azeri relations on the FY 2003 Foreign Operations bill, and I want to make clear to my colleagues and the Administration that I will be closely following developments in Azerbaijan and Turkey to lift the blockades against Armenia. I encourage these countries to fully understand the importance and necessity of lifting their blockades.                          ____________________
