President, I wish to tell my friends in the Senate about the Vermont Frost Heaves, the bumps in the road that we Vermonters are actually proud to claim as our own. Unlike the frost heaves New Englanders have come to know too well under the dented rims of our cars and trucks, these basketball-playing Vermont Frost Heaves are pioneers, superb athletes, role models, and as of this spring, champions of the American Basketball Association.  The Frost Heaves' motto, ``we're going to be their bumps in the road,'' rang true many a winter's evening this year. With an overall record of 34-6 and a league record of 30-6, the Frost Heaves quickly became unfamiliar with losing, energizing Bump the moose, the team's mascot, and thousands of cowbell-ringing fans. Then, on March 29, 2007, while the sap was still running out of sugar bushes, the Frost Heaves charged their way to a triumphant 143-to-95 title victory over the Texas Tycoons, adding an exclamation point to the success of their inaugural season.  From the birth of the Vermont Frost Heaves, founder and owner Alex Wolff found a way to tie Vermonters into the team, captivating fans near and far and promising to be sustainable, local, built to scale, of the community, and embracing the Internet revolution. As a professional journalist found in the pages of Sports Illustrated, Wolff documented his journey growing a championship team with fan participation along the way. The result--a team beloved by Vermont.  Under Wolff's ambitious leadership, and with the permission of his wife Vanessa, the Wolffs created a family-friendly, affordable source of entertainment in central and northern Vermont. With a home schedule split between two of the most historic gymnasiums in the State, the Barre Auditorium and Memorial Auditorium, fans from throughout Vermont had the opportunity to support their team. As the Wolffs explain, ``we wanted to create a legacy for Vermont,'' and that is just what they have done.  After Wolff put the selection of their coach to a worldwide vote, the fans chose coach Will Voigt, a native of Cabot, VT, to be their skipper. Voigt, a three-star athlete before embarking upon a successful coaching career, left a coaching position in Norway to return to the Green Mountains.  The team starred three Vermonters, Kerry Lyons of Milton, Dana Martin of Stowe, and B.J. Robertson of Burlington. Lyons led the Milton High School Yellow Jackets to four Vermont State final fours. He was named Conference Player of the Year and was chosen as an All-State selection. He then attended Lyndon State College where he served as the team captain for 3 years. Lyons returned to Lyndon State after graduation serving as the assistant coach for both the men's and women's basketball teams during the 2000 to 2001 season.  Dana Martin attended Stowe High School and Proctor Academy in New Hampshire and continued on to play basketball for Skidmore College. Martin was the first basketball player from Skidmore to enter the professional ranks, playing in Germany after graduation, where he led his team in scoring with more than 22 points a game. Martin has offered a basketball camp for the past six summers in his hometown of Stowe for elementary school students aspiring to follow in Martin's Frost Heave footsteps.  B.J. Robertson is a graduate of Burlington High School and St. Michael's College, entertaining Vermonters with his pizzazz at both the high school and college levels. He is the all-time leading scorer at Burlington High, a record his brother owned prior to his arrival on the scene. Well known by high school sports aficionados, Robertson was named ``Mr. Basketball'' by the Burlington Free Press his senior year. At St. Michael's, Robertson played in 104 games at the collegiate level, starting 91 of them in 4 years. He consistently was among the leaders on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball for the Purple Knights  Other Frost Heaves players came by way of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and even as far as Senegal. Aaron Cook led the Frost Heaves in scoring and minutes played for the inaugural season, averaging 16.3 points on 22 minutes. Kelvin Parker led the team in field goal percentage. Antonio Burks led the team in free throw percentage, completing nearly 83 percent of shots from the foul line. John Bryant led the team in rebounding, with 246 for the season, also leading the team in blocks.Travarus Bennett led the team in steals, his quick hands averaged 2.6 per game. Markus Austin, Johann Collins, Kevin Mickens, Antoine Hyman, Tyrone Levett, Issa Konare, Melvin Creddle, and Tyrone Barley round out the roster of the championship squad.  The extended Frost Heaves coaching staff includes assistant coaches Wayne Lafley and Marvin Safford; strength and conditioning coach Scott Caulfield; assistant coach and statistician Mark Saltus; and athletic trainer Meggan Robinson. The Frost Heaves staff worked to establish a balance of physical strength and mental toughness in each player.  Today, the sounds of cowbells echoing off the necks of Holsteins grazing in the fields of Vermont instills a bit of excitement in Frost Heaves' fans eagerly awaiting another winter of basketball. I hope my friends in the Senate will joining me in congratulating the Vermont Frost Heaves for a great season and wishing them even more success next winter.                          ____________________
