 President, for the leader, I have a unanimous consent request.  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 1. I further ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to a cloture vote on H.R. 2415, the bankruptcy legislation, as under the previous order.
