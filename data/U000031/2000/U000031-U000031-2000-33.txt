Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to restore funding for the Legal Services Corporation. Justice for some is no justice at all. As my colleagues may recall, the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 to provide financial support for legal assistance in civil proceedings to persons unable to afford legal services. Legal services for people who cannot afford it.  The Legal Services Corporation is the Government's vital and often only link between our disadvantaged constituents and meaningful access to the courts and our legal system. Too many in our Nation lack real access to our justice system. Access to the justice system and righting a wrong should not be a privilege of the wealthy but instead a right for all.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Commerce, I am among the first to go after fraud and abuse. However, we must remember that it is also our job to correct the mismanagements within government programs to ensure that these programs continue to fulfill their obligation.  A number of years ago, yes, there were problems with the Legal Services. But with Congress' help, the Committee on the Judiciary adopted a number of significant restrictions and restructuring; and in fact now the Legal Services Corporation has become an institution that the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, can be proud of. We must continue to invest in this important program that continues to fulfill the American principle of equal justice under the law.  I welcome this opportunity to highlight a few of the examples of how the Legal Services Corporation has benefited my district in Michigan. The Legal Aid Bureau of Southwest Michigan helped a mother of three keep her home and avoid eviction after a corrupt landlord alleged nonpayment of rent. In fact, the family's rent was paid up to date. However, the landlord applied the rent to the cost of water repairs that were actually his fault, not the family's. Through the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau, the court dismissed the fraudulent claim and awarded the family enough money to relocate. Without this assistance, who knows where they would be today?  Two mentally disabled constituents rented a condemned apartment and their slumlord threatened to physically throw them out. Through court action, the Legal Aid Bureau retrieved all of the money which my constituents had paid to the slumlord. I ask who would represent these people if it were not for Legal Services?  The governor of the State of Michigan, John Engler, understands the importance of providing legal assistance to low-income residents. I have a letter from the Michigan governor in support of providing long-term stable financial support for civil legal aid. He recognizes that in Michigan only 20 percent of the civil legal needs of low-income residents are being met. In Michigan, there is one lawyer for every 340 folks. However, there is only one civil aid lawyer for every 6,500 citizens with low income.  I encourage my colleagues to remember that access to the justice system and righting a wrong should not be a privilege of the wealthy but a right to all. Please support this amendment to ensure that all Americans have access to our justice system. Justice for some is no justice at all.                                                State of Michigan,                                       Office of the Governor,     Lansing, MI, October 4, 1999.       Dear Friends: As Governor and a Michigan attorney, I      endorse the State Bar of Michigan's Access to Justice for All      (ATJ) Development Campaign. I have delivered my pledge to the      ATJ Campaign and am writing today to encourage all members of      the State Bar to do so as well.       Only 20 percent of the civil legal needs of Michigan low-     income residents are being met, despite the volunteer service      of many lawyers and the civil legal aid programs in our      communities. Although there is one lawyer for every 340      people in Michigan, there is only one civil legal aid lawyer      for every 6,500 citizens with low-income. This affects 1.5      million Michigan residents who qualify for civil legal aid.       These low-income families need legal assistance on      essential family, housing and consumer issues. We expect all      Michigan residents to use our institutions to resolve their      disputes, and we must make certain that everyone has      meaningful access to our justice system.       Across Michigan, lawyers are taking the lead to address      this important issue. The ATJ Development Campaign, a      permanent endowment using private funds, has been established      by the State Bar to ameliorate this societal problem.      Earnings from the endowment will be distributed to our      community legal aid programs, allowing the principal to grow.      The State Bar is underwriting the costs of this bold      development campaign for the first three years.       The ATJ Development Campaign will provide long term, stable      financial support for civil legal aid. Additionally, the      State Bar is undertaking other unique initiatives to give      Michigan a stronger, more efficient and effective legal aid      system.       That State Bar's ATJ Campaign is historic. No other state      bar has undertaken a comparable development campaign. In      recognition, the American Bar Association awarded the      prestigious Harrison Tweed Award to the State Bar of      Michigan.       Please join me and deliver your pledge to the ATJ Campaign.      Justice for some is no justice at all.           Sincerely,                                                      John Engler,                                                         Governor.                              {time}  1545
