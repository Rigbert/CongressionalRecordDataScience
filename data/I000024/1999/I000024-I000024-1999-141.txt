 First of all, I don't disagree with many of the things the Senator from Iowa is saying. The only thing I disagree with is, we have much betterproof than he is implying in terms of mismanagement.  I find something very interesting, and that is a letter that went out last night over the web site from one of the prominent members, named Cameron Warner, to all his fellow members. In this letter he makes it very specific that we at CAP have problems--problems at the top--and they are going to have to be addressed. He goes on to say that if we don't do something about it, those things that we said yesterday on the floor of the Senate as to ``60 Minutes'' coming in and looking at all these abuses could actually be a reality. So here is a request from members of the CAP saying they want to clean up this act.  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            A Sad Commentary                         (By Cameron F. Warner)       Dear CAP Membership: Folks, today as I watched the debate      about CAP v. USAF take place on the Senate floor. I couldn't      help but think how sad all of this truly is. Just listen to      the subject matter. All this dirty laundry about CAP being      aired out on the Senate Floor in front of the American      public. Today, the image of CAP took a giant step in the      wrong direction relative to public perception. How      embarrassing to say the least! Years of good work and      wonderful acts by members being tarnished by the actions of a      few. Indeed, this is a dark day in the history of CAP.       It is a personal heartbreak to see just where the      leadership of Bobick and Albano have taken CAP. Here is CAP,      center stage on the United States Senate floor for all to      see, but not for all it's good deeds or accomplishments.      Quite the contrary! Rather, we have United States Senators on      the Senate floor talking about all the wrong doings of      leadership and the bad management of CAP. Sen. Inhofe talks      about FBI investigations of CAP. Ask yourself, how bad does      that sound to the American public? How does that really sound      to you?       The Allard amendment was not resolved as earlier thought,      so the debate will continue early tomorrow morning with a      vote to follow. For those of you who are interested, live      Senate coverage will air on CSPAN2 first thing in the      morning. No matter what the outcome, it will only get worse      for CAP and CAP will end up the big loser. Tomorrow is but      one battle, not the entire war. The longer this goes on and      the more public this becomes, the worse CAP will look in the      public eye no matter how you cut it. Don't be surprised if      Sen. Warner's concerns about the 60 Minutes bad press      possibility becomes a reality. CAP will not be portrayed in a      positive light at all.       How sad that this is right where Bobick, Albano, the NEC      and NB have lead CAP at the end of this century! Today is      tomorrow's history. Good work, guys!
