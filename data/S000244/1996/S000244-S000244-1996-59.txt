Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished representative from Indiana, the Honorable John Myers. For the past 30 years, John has faithfully represented the people of Indiana's Seventh District.  John's service began not in Congress but in the Army during World War II. He was a private citizen for 20 years before being elected to Congress in 1966.  John's service has been marked by his civility and cooperation with Members. John's skills enabled differing sides often to reach a reasonable consensus on difficult issues. He has been a bipartisan Member whose efforts ensured the completion of many water and energy projects. In short, John Myers will be missed here in Congress.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank the Honorable John T. Myers for his service to the House of Representatives and the United States.                          ____________________
