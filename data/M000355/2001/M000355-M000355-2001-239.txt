 President, for the information of our colleagues, on this side of the aisle, I am aware of about eight amendments, some of which I hope will disappear. I hope by announcing this I do not encourage the proliferation of more. Also, it is my understanding that a discussion is underway to water down or mitigate the coordination language in the underlying bill at the request of organized labor. I assume we will see that amendment at some point during the process. I don't know whether Senator Dodd has any idea how many amendments may be left on his side.
