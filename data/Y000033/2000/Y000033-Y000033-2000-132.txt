Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4148) to make technical amendments to the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to contract support costs, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4148       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Contract Support Cost      Technical Amendments of 2000''.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT DETAILING CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF                    CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS.       The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act      (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) is amended by adding after section      106 the following new section:     ``SEC. 106A. CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS.       ``(a) Other Federal Agencies.--Except as otherwise provided      by statute, an Indian tribe or tribal organization      administering a contract or compact under this Act shall be      entitled to recover its full indirect costs associated with      any other Federal funding received by such tribe or tribal      organization (other than funds paid under this Act),      consistent with the tribe's or tribal organization's indirect      cost rate agreement with its cognizant Federal agency. This      subsection shall not independently entitle such tribe or      tribal organization to be paid additional amounts associated      with such other Federal funding.       ``(b) Allowable Uses of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law (including regulation or circular), an      Indian tribe or tribal organization (1) administering a      contract or compact under this Act, and (2) employing an      indirect cost pool that includes both funds paid under this      Act and other Federal funds, shall be entitled to use or      expend all Federal funds in such tribe's or tribal      organization's indirect cost pool in the same manner as      permitted in section 106(j) (relating to allowable uses of      funds without approval of the Secretary), and for such      purposes only the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of any      Federal agency providing funds to such tribe or tribal      organization.       ``(c) Negotiation of Contract Support Cost Amounts.--Within      the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health and      Human Services, tribal contract support cost entitlements      shall be the responsibility of the Office of Tribal Programs,      subject to the tribe's or tribal organization's indirect cost      rate agreement with the tribe's or tribal organization's      cognizant Federal agency.       ``(d) Direct Contract Support Costs and Federal      Employees.--The contract support costs that are eligible      costs for the purposes of receiving funding under this Act      shall include direct contract support costs associated with      all Federal employees employed in connection with the      program, service, function, or activity that is the subject      of the contract, including all Federal employees paid with      funds generated from third-party collections.''.
