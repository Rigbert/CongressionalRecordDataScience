President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Reed, as the chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as the cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute to a great leader, an exceptional officer, and a senior executive of the U.S. Army, Mr. Bernard P. Ingold. Mr. Ingold is the principle deputy chief of legislative liaison for the Office of the Secretary of the Army, and as he prepares to leave this position for a well-deserved retirement, we commend him for his outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and this Nation.  Bernie Ingold has served our Army and our Nation for more than 40 years as an Army officer and a Department of the Army civilian. A native of Michigan, Mr. Ingold was commissioned in 1979 as a judge advocate general officer upon earning a degree in law from the University of Arkansas. His service to the Nation included roles as a deputy staff judge advocate for U.S. Army Berlin, as a legislative counsel for the office of the chief oflegislative liaison, and as the deputy director for legal policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  After serving 20 years on Active Duty, Mr. Ingold retired and continued his service as a civilian in the Department of the Army. From 1999 to 2010, he served as the deputy chief legislative counsel for the Army's office of the chief of legislative liaison. In 2010, he entered into the senior executive service and began his role as the principle deputy for the office of the chief of legislative liaison. For the past 10 years, Mr. Ingold has implemented and enhanced strategic partnerships with Congress. He has assisted seven Army chiefs of legislative liaison and helped the Army significantly advance its relationships with both legislative Chambers and improved and broadened congressional support for Army priorities. Mr. Ingold managed complex issues through multiple legislative cycles, enabling the Army to receive the necessary resources to improve readiness, accelerate modernization, and reform processes to support combat operations, sustain the all-volunteer force, and improve the quality of life for soldiers, Army civilians, and their families. Throughout his career, he has been a true professional, dedicated soldier, leader, officer, and senior executive.  On behalf of the Senate, we thank Bernard P. Ingold, his wife Lolita, and their entire family for their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. We join our colleagues in wishing him future success as he transitions into retirement.                          ____________________
