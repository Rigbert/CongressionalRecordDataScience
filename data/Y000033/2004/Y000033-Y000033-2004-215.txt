Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a most distinguished public servant, Mr. David E. Schaffer, Senior Counsel on the Transportation Committee's Aviation Subcommittee. Mr. Schaffer is retiring after twenty-six years of Federal service, including the past 20 years with the Committee. His unmatched knowledge in the field of aviation, as well as his engaging personality, will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress. David's work stands as a prime example of the good that can be accomplished through public service. The American people have been quite fortunate to have Mr. Schaffer's expertise and guidance throughout his career. Every single aviation law passed in the last two decades is marked with David's creative ideas and approaches. As an attachment to my remarks, a list of all aviation laws passed during David's tenure is included.  David's ability to work with people on both sides of the aisle serves as a major reason for the overwhelming bipartisan support aviation legislation has gathered over the last twenty years. His evenhanded and steady demeanor, as well as his thoughtful approach to a matter ensures that all ideas are heard, and that every opinion is considered. The relationships that David has cultivated among both government and industry officials has allowed for a free exchange of ideas on a wide variety of issues. Such exchanges have helped foster the growth of our nation's aviation industry. He has earned an immeasurable amount of respect from everyone with whom he has worked, including Members of Congress, staff, and those in the transportation community.  David began his career in public service in 1978, when he joined the Office of General Counsel of the Civil Aeronautics Board as an attorney, specializing in rules, legislation, and litigation involving small community air service, international air service, consumer protection, and charters. In 1984, he began work with the Aviation Subcommittee as an Assistant Minority Counsel, becoming the Chief Minority Counsel in 1992, and Majority Counsel in 1995. Throughout his tenure with the Aviation Subcommittee, he has been involved in all aspects of aviation legislation, including safety, security, airline competition, international air service, the Airport Improvement Program, air traffic control modernization, Federal Aviation Administration reform, and oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board.  David's leadership proved critical in the weeks following the events of September 11, 2001. His experience played an essential role in creating the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which helped restore confidence to the flying public. In a most precarious time for our nation, we were extremely fortunate to have someone like David Schaffer assisting us. Most recently, his assistance led to the successful passage of Vision 100, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which will have a lasting effect on the aviation industry for years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating the retirement of David Schaffer, and wish him well in whatever venture he seeks next. I would also like to offer an extended note of gratitude on behalf of the previous Chairmen of the Transportation Committee and Aviation Subcommittee whom David has served with great distinction. We wish you good luck and again say thank you for all you have done for both the Congress as well as the American people.
