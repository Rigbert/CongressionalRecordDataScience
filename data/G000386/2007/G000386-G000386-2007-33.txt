 President, today, I am introducing a Senate resolution to honor the life and work of Congressman Henry John Hyde of Illinois. I authored this resolution because I knew Henry Hyde for over 20 years. In fact, he and I were 2 of 16 Republicans who were first elected to the House of Representatives in 1974.  Congressman Hyde was a true leader in the House of Representatives. He proved his leadership by authoring the ``Hyde Amendment'' to help protect the lives of unborn children. Because of this long-standing policy, innocent lives have been saved and taxpayers have not been forced to fund abortions.  Henry Hyde was intelligent, as was proved during his tenure as chairman of two different committees--the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on International Relations. In his 32 years in the House of Representatives, he was dedicated to the rule of law as well as the expansion of freedom around the world.  He was a great Representative for the people of his district, and he leaves an important legacy for our Nation. It is with great respect that I introduce this resolution in his honor.                          ____________________
