President, if I might ask a further question of my friend, he is familiar with normal court procedures. I spent years as a prosecutor. I think, from my own judgment, if any assistant prosecutor in my office had gone on an expensive witch hunt like this, and a grand jury for all this, the foreman of the grand jury would be calling me as district attorney and saying, ``Hey, you better come down and answer what in Heaven's name you are answering to for our time and money.''  Would that be the experience of my friend from Maryland? At some point, the grand jury or the judge would be saying, ``Why are you wasting our time and money?''
