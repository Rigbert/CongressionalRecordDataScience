Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Maryland's most informative and well respected newspapers, ``The Bowie Blade-News.'' The Blade-News was recently named Newspaper of the Year for its division, by the Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association. In addition, Editor John Rouse and five other members of the editorial staff were recognized for their work in various categories for a total of 14 awards.  Blade-News photographer Sharon Tazelaar received a first-place award for the division in the category of Spot News Photo, beating out photojournalists from daily newspapers such as the Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun. Other Blade-News staff receiving awards were Sports Editor Christine Krapf, and staff writers Cheryl Allison, David Emanuel and Donna Reifsnider.  Having been involved in public service in Maryland for much of my life, I have had the distinct honor of working with John Rouse and his staff of reporters and photographers. Rouse, who has held the title of Editor at the Blade-News for 27 years has worked hard to ensure that the Bowie Blade-News upholds the Capital-Gazette Newspapers philosophy which is, ``Every issue of every newspaper represents a battle for excellence.'' Under Rouse's leadership, the Bowie Blade-News has become a vital source of information for the community.  Mr. Speaker, the Capital-Gazette Newspapers, which owns and publishes the Bowie Blade-News, has a long and rich history of informing the people of Maryland and is one of the oldest newspaper publishers in the country. The company's original newspaper, the Maryland Gazette, was first published in 1727 and many of the reports published in the Gazette were copied by Benjamin Franklin and other Colonial editors for their own newspapers. This newspaper also has the distinction of having had the first woman editor and publisher of a newspaper in the American Colonies.  The Maryland Gazette also survived strong local sympathies for the Confederacy, all the while sharply criticizing the movement to dissolve the Union. In fact, the newspaper was saved by President Abraham Lincoln when he appointed the publisher as the federal paymaster for the state of Maryland, helping the publisher to subsidize his newspaper.  Under the guidance of John Rouse, the Bowie Blade-News is upholding this tradition of seeking out the truth and providing the information to the surrounding community. It plays a vital role in the daily lives of the people who rely on it for news and information about their neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have such an honorable news organization in my Congressional District and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bowie Blade-News on being named the 1998 Newspaper of the Year by the Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association.                          ____________________
