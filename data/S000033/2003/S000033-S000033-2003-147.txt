 Speaker, I want to share with you some remarks that I made on March 3 when I introduced the Freedom to Read Protection Act. This legislation now has 28 co-sponsors and has been endorsed by the American Library Association, the American Booksellers Association and newspapers throughout the country. Yes, we must do all that we can to U-1 protect the American people from terrorism, but we can do it in a way that protects the basic constitutional rights of our citizens. Statement of Representative Bernie Sanders on the Introduction of the                      Freedom To Read Protection Act       Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us here today to      announce the introduction of the Freedom to Read Protection      Act--legislation which will protect libraries, bookstores and      their patrons from unjustified government surveillance into      what books Americans are reading and buying, and what      websites they may be visiting when using a library computer.       Let me begin by thanking the Members of Congress who have      joined me here today. I also want to thank Chris Finan of the      American Booksellers Association and Emily Sheketoff--     Executive Director of the American Library Association's      Washington Office--for joining us. I am also delighted that      Trina Magi--a librarian from the University of Vermont--and      Linda Ramsdell, a bookstore owner from Hardwick, Vermont, who      is the President of the New England Booksellers Association,      are here with us today.       Let me also congratulate the 62 cities and towns all across      this country who have passed resolutions on this issue--and      that number is growing rapidly. That effort is being      coordinated by the Bill of Rights Defense Committee which      understands that civil liberties and constitutional rights      are not only a national issue, but a local issue. I also want      to thank the editorial boards of the many newspapers all over      this country who have spoken out on this freedom to read      issue--including the Los Angeles Times, the Detroit Free      Press, the Honolulu Observer, the Providence Journal-     Bulletin, the Caledonia Record, and the Valley News.       The tri-partisan legislation we are introducing today--     called the Freedom to Read Protection Act--would protect the      privacy and First Amendment rights of American citizens      against unnecessary government intrusion. Specifically, this      legislation will exempt libraries and bookstores from Section      215 of the so-called ``Patriot Act.'' The Freedom to Read      Protection Act is being introduced by 24 members of Congress      including Republican Ron Paul of Texas, and Congressman John      Conyers, the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee.      They are both unable to join us today but I do want to      recognize their support and leadership in protecting civil      liberties. I am confident that in the days and weeks to come      we will add many more cosponsors.       One of the cornerstones of our democracy is our right of      Americans to criticize their government, and to read printed      materials without fear of government monitoring and      intrusion.       Yes, all of us concerned about terrorism and all of us are      determined to do all that we can to protect the American      people from another terrorist attack. But, the threat of      terrorism must not be used as an excuse by the government to      intrude on our basic constitutional rights. We can fight      terrorism, but we can do it at the same time as we protect      the civil liberties that have made our country great.       Unfortunately, the Patriot Act has changed all that.      Section 215 of the Patriot Act greatly expanded the FBI's      ability to get records from all businesses, including      libraries and booksellers, without meeting the traditional      standard needed to get a search warrant in the United States.       This is a very dangerous situation. Today, all the FBI has      to claim is that the information they want is somehow      relevant to an investigation to protect against international      terrorism. This is an extremely low threshold for government      intrusion and average Americans should be extremely      concerned.       The reason they should care is that Section 215 does not      just apply to terrorists or even foreigners or agents of      foreign powers. Under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the      person whose records are being searched by the FBI can be      anyone. The FBI doesn't even have to say that it believes the      person is involved in criminal activity or that the person is      connected to a foreign power.       Even more frightening, the FBI can investigate American      citizens based in part on an American's exercise of his or      her First Amendment Rights, such as writing a letter to the      editor of a newspaper or reading books the government may not      approve of.       And the traditional legal protections, that have been      embodied in our Constitution for hundreds of years, no longer      apply. The government can gain access to our reading records      through the secret FISA court which was created by the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 and which is      off limits to the public. There's no way to know how many      times the FBI has spied on library or bookseller records or      whose records they have reviewed.       In fact, Section 215 prevents librarians and booksellers      from telling their customers that their privacy has been      violated. Who would have thought that in 21st Century      America, the government could gain access to library      circulation records and bookseller customer records with no      evidence that the person whose records they are getting is      involved in any wrongdoing, that all of this would be handled      through a secret government court, and that the librarians      and booksellers would be compelled by the law not to let      anyone know that the government had swooped in to get their      records?       Now some may ask how the federal government is using this      new power. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are      also interested in that question and have pressured the      Justice Department to show how     they are using these new powers. The information they have      received after months of badgering the Department is      inadequate. The Justice Department claimed most of the      information regarding libraries and bookstores was      ``confidential,'' and could not be provided. This past      October, several national organizations, including the      American Booksellers Association, filed a Freedom of      Information Act request to get statistical information, such      as how many times the government has used its expanded      surveillance authority under the Patriot Act. In January, a      very limited amount of information was released to these      groups and they are continuing to push for a more complete      disclosure.       Importantly, an anonymous survey done by the University of      Illinois found that over 175 libraries across the country      have been visited by federal authorities since the September      11th attacks. How is the Congress and the public supposed to      make sure that these new powers are not being abused when we      do not even know how often they are being invoked and the      types of institutions that are being investigated?       For many people who can not afford to buy books or have the      Internet at home the library is critical to their ability to      access to information. Many librarians and booksellers now      fear that patrons have begun to self-censor their library use      and book purchases due to fears of government surveillance.      We need to remove libraries and booksellers from Section 215      so that Americans know their freedom to access information      won't be improperly scrutinized by federal agents.       Let us be clear. The FBI would still be able to gain access      to library or bookseller records as part of an investigation      into illegal activity. All our bill does is restore the      traditional protections that Americans expect and deserve. If      the FBI has probable cause to believe that information in a      library or bookseller's records or computers is connected to      an ongoing criminal investigation or terrorism investigation,      they can go to court and get a search warrant.       In addition, the bill requires that the Justice Department      provide more detailed information about its activities under      Section 215 so we can determine how the FBI is using its new      powers under Section 215.       Let me conclude by saying that all of us support protecting      Americans from terrorism. But we do not win against      terrorists by abandoning our most basic civil liberties. We      cannot be an example of freedom for the world when our own      government is spying on what Americans are reading.                          ____________________
