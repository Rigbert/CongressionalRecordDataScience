 President, yesterday we welcomed the President, the Vice President, and the family of the late Reverend Billy Graham as he lay in honor in the Capitol. This is a very rare tribute--even rarer for an American without government or military service--but it perfectly suits the remarkable man whose preaching inspired millions worldwide, who counseled Presidents and world leaders across generations, and whom an entire nation came to know as America's pastor.  Billy Graham's powerful preaching and his historic revivals brought so many closer to God because his work was not ultimately about him. ``The secret of my work,'' he explained, ``is God. I would be nothing without him.'' His personal strengths and talents were mighty, but it was his kindness, his humility, and his total fidelity to faith and family that defined his life and his ministry.  I am glad that Congress could honor the great Reverend Graham in this way. Yesterday, thousands--thousands--of Americans packed the Rotunda down the hall to pay their respects. All across the country, people are giving thanks for the extraordinary contributions of this good and faithful servant.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, on another matter, it has been just over 2 months since the united Republican government delivered historic tax reform to middle-class families all across the country. How is it working? We have all seen the national news. Walmart is giving raises or new benefits to more than 1 million hourly workers. Boeing is investing $300 million in workforce development and corporate giving. Apple is bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back home. But no less important are the stories making front-page news in hometown newspapers all across our country.  Thanks to tax reform in North Lima, OH, Sheely's Furniture & Appliance is planning to issue $1,000 bonuses to full-time workers and expand the sales floor by 4,500 square feet.  In Cushing, OH--population of 220 people--tax reform is allowing John Anfinson to give $1,000 bonuses and 5 percent pay raises to all of his employees at the farm store that his grandfather founded in 1918, 100 years ago.  ``I work every day shoulder to shoulder with everyone,'' Mr. Anfinson explained. ``When you work every day with a group of people, you know them and their family. . . . They are the most valuable asset in any business.''  His customers will also likely be breathing easier. Tax reform is enabling farmers and ranchers across America to immediately expense the cost of important investments, and it is taking a big bite--a big bite--out of the death tax.  Senators heard stories just like these during last week's State work period. Just ask Senator Toomey what tax reform is doing in Pennsylvania. He stopped by New Hudson Facades, a manufacturer in Linwood. Tax reform enabled them to increase wages by 5 percent, and a partner company is contributing $3,000 to every factory worker's 401(k).  How about in Montana? Senator Daines' trip across his State took him to Pacific Steel in Great Falls, where sales are up 25 percent--sales are up 25 percent--since tax reform passed.  In West Virginia, Senator Capito joined a roundtable at the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce. She heard from local business leaders about ``increased optimism.''  In Nevada, 90 percent of the small business owners Senator Heller recently spoke with said they plan to raise wages, increase benefits, award bonuses, hire more workers, or invest in their operations.  It is a shame our Democratic colleagues still haven't been able to extract themselves from their lockstep opposition to this historic law. If they had gotten their way, none of this good news would have happened--none of it. Only one of the Senators from Pennsylvania voted for the law that is allowing that Linwood manufacturer to expand. Only one Senator from Ohio voted for the new law that is helping those workers in North Lima. Only one Senator from Nevada voted to give small businesses the flexibility to invest more in their employees. Only one Senator from West Virginia and one Senator from Montana voted to take money out of Washington's pocket and put it back in the pockets of the middle class.  Every single Senate Democrat--every one of them--did all they could to block tax reform. Fortunately, every Republican voted to pass it. And because Congress passed tax reform and the President signed it into law, workers and small business owners are already reaping the benefits.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
