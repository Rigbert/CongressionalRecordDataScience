I would like to say before he speaks that after he has spoken, I am going to ask for a unanimous consent which renews an earlier request but expands it, and the request is going to be that we call up three amendments, two of which have been objected to already, and a third one, Senator Hatch's amendment.  For my colleagues who are following this debate in their office, the three amendments we are talking about are amendment No. 740, offered by Senators Pryor and Blunt, a bipartisan amendment that relates to the Internet Freedom Act, a 10-year extension, which was objected to yesterday; and then I will ask for consent that we go from that, after an agreed to time for debate, to amendment No. 771, offered by Senators Collins and King, another bipartisan amendment that relates to the effective date of the underlying legislation; and then, to Senator Hatch, I would say that we are going to include in this unanimous consent request his amendment No. 754, which I believe he is going to speak to now on the floor, which relates to the substance of the underlying bill, S. 743.  I am not asking for the consent at this moment but giving notice to my colleagues that this is a request that will be made after Senator Hatch has spoken.  I yield the floor.
