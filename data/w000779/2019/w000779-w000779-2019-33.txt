I have long been concerned that the Trump administration was going to let Huawei off the hook in order to get a politically useful trade deal. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters, that concerns me greatly. In addition, I am concerned that the resolution being offered does not go far enough to protect America's national security and hold the Trump administration accountable.  Tomorrow there will be another bipartisan measure offered that, in my view, will better address the concerns I have just mentioned, and therefore I must object this afternoon.
