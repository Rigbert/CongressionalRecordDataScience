 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on the today's Executive Calendar: Calendar Nos. 285, 312, 313, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
