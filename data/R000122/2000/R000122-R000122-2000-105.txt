President, I stand in opposition to this amendment. As a graduate of the United States Military Academy and a former officer in the Army, I view the American flag with a special reverence borne by experience. I am deeply offended when people burn or otherwise abuse this precious national symbol, and I believe that we should teach young people to respect the flag.  I also feel, however, that the values and beliefs that the American flag represents are more important than the cloth from which the symbol is made. Prominent among these beliefs are the right to voice views that are unpopular and the right to protest. It is these fundamental values, reflected in our Constitution, that have distinguished our Nation for more than 200 years. It is these beliefs that give our flag its great symbolic power.  Flag burning is despicable. However, the issue before us is whether our great charter document, the Constitution, should be amended so that the Federal Government can prosecute the handful of Americans who show contempt for the flag. To quote James Madison, is this a ``great and extraordinary occasion'' justifying the use of a constitutional amendment?  I would argue no, this is not such an occasion. This is an answer in search of a problem. According to Professor Robert Justin Goldstein, a noted author on this topic, there have been only 200 reported incidents of flag burning during the entire history of our country--that is less than one a year. There is no epidemic of flag burnings plaguing our nation.  Others have said that flag burning is representative of a general decay of American values and patriotism, and something needs to be done about it before it is too late. I would argue the way to encourage patriotism is through encouraging civic involvement, not constitutional amendments. It almost goes without saying that people who are proud of their country will be proud of their flag.  I am still moved by the statement made by James Warner, a decorated Marine flyer who was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese from 1967 to 1973, about flag burning:       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph      of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag.      ``There'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest      against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''       ``No,'' I said, ``that proves that I am right. In my      country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that      people disagree with us.''  And I think that is the essence of this debate for me. We live in a democracy, not a dictatorship. The flag symbolizes a political system that allows its people, through their actions and words, to express what they think and feel, even when the government or a vast majority of others disagree with them. I oppose this amendment because I believe that while attempting to preserve the symbol of the freedoms we enjoy in this country, it actually would harm the substance of these freedoms.  Finally, this amendment to the Constitution is technically problematic. The language of the amendment is vague and fails to offer a clear statement of just what conduct the supporters of the amendment propose to prohibit, or to advise the American people of the actions for which they may be imprisoned. There is no definition of what a ``flag'' is for purposes of this amendment, or any consensus regarding the meaning of ``desecration.'' This leaves the Supreme Court to clarify these meanings, the same court that supporters believe erred in protecting flag burning as freedom of speech in the first place.                          ____________________
