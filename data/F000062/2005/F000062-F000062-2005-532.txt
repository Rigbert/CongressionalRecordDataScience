  Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, submitted by myself and Senators Kyl, Hutchison, Cornyn, Schumer, and Clinton, having to do with the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.  As we all know, illegal immigration is the responsibility of the Federal Government. Since early 1990, the Federal Government has provided some reimbursement to States. That authorization has run out. We have just passed it out of the Judiciary Committee this morning.
