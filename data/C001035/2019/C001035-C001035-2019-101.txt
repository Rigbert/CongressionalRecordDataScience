At that time, it was a small operation using old machinery to produce components for turbines that powered only 7,000 homes. Today, 50 years later, the skilled workers at GE Power manufacture equipment that powers more than 1 million homes. I am delighted to congratulate this outstanding company and its dedicated workforce on their golden anniversary.  GE Power is a center of excellence for steam turbine rotors and blading. It specializes in gas turbine component manufacturing, which is especially important as natural gas has become an essential contributor to America's growing energy independence and has helped reduce harmful emissions. As this facility has grown, so has its global reputation for innovation and problem solving.  That reputation is earned every day by the nearly 400 employees at GE Power. Their ingenuity and dedication have made their plant one of Bangor's most significant employers. They have embraced GE's companywide ethic of philanthropy and service to others, and they contribute to their community in countless ways.  The General Electric Company was founded in 1892 by Thomas Alva Edison. The famed inventor and electricity pioneer could well have had Bangor in mind when he said, ``The three great essentials to achieve anything are hard work, stick-to-itiveness, and common sense.'' The men and women of GE Power demonstrate those essentials every day, creating opportunity for themselves and our city, and I congratulate them on this landmark anniversary.                          ____________________
