Let me agree with you that motor voter is good, and it is necessary to open up the political process. As you well know, in our own State hundreds and thousands of people have been registered during the past 3 months. I think in Georgia more than 3,000 people every single day are being registered because of motor voter.  Ms. McKINNEY. And we do not even have all of the counties on line yet. Just imagine what it would be like if we had all of the counties, 159 counties in Georgia, on line for motor voter. When that happens, Georgia will not be last anymore. I am so sick and tired of Georgia being last in most things. Georgia can become first, and it will also be first in democracy.
