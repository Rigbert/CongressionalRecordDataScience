 Speaker, I was unavoidably delayed during rollcall vote 504 on October 14, 1999. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no''.  In addition, I was unavoidably delayed on November 1, 1999 during rollcall votes 550, 551, and 552. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall votes 550 and 551 and ``no'' on rollcall vote 552.                          ____________________
