Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's desire to show support for robust funding for the National Estuary Program. The FY19 bill provides $26.7 billion for the National Estuary Program, which is equalto the FY18 enacted level. This is an amendment I can accept.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
