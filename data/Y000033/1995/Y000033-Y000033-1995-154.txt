If the gentleman will yield, I am pleased to restate my commitment to the gentleman from Guam in support of his efforts to allow some development of the territory's fisheries resources and allow any benefits from the licensing of foreign fishing vessels to accrue to the territories for conservation and management of the fisheries resources. I understand this amendment is being worked through the committee, with my staff and your staff, and, hopefully, we will arrive at a conclusion that will be beneficial to both of them. The merits of his amendment are strongly supported by the chairman.  The one reservation we have, we will have to make sure of how the license fees will be utilized for the territory, and we are attempting now to work it out where it goes to the fisheries improvement area.  I have been in your area, and I have seen some of the actions by some of the foreign countries which you get no benefit from. I think that goes totally contrary to the Magnuson Act. I would support it with work on the amendment.
