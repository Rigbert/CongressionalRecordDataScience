 President, I thank the Senator from California for very clearly outlining, for all of us to hear, why this was not a search for truth on an issue that affects so many people in this country, the victims of sexual assault who often, as she just described, do not talk about it, do not speak about it, do not ever tell anyone until there is a reason to, which is what Dr. Ford did.  While the Senator from California is here, you said this was not a search for truth. When it comes to victims of sexual assault--and you have dealt with them time and again as a district attorney and attorney general in the State of California--what message does this send when they see the U.S. Senate?
