Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, we have debated this issue extensively and the venue for these types of personal injury cases are, one, the district where the plaintiff resides; two, the district where the injury occurred; or three, where the principal place of business of the defendant is located. Any one of these three criteria would trigger the venue.  Now, it is elemental under the corporation law of all 50 States that if a corporation that is incorporated elsewhere and that includes in any one of the other 49 States or in a foreign country, wants to do business in a State, it has to get a certificate of authority and appoint an agent for the service of process. And that is what is done with practically every multinational corporation or interstate corporation that does bills in the United States.  If they do not do that, then they do not have limited liability protection of the corporation law that applies. So the entire argument that is made by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Turner) is a complete red herring.  Now, the two gentlemen have quoted extensively from a Congressional Research Service memorandum that was dated today. And it begins, ``This rushed memorandum discusses this issue.'' Well, the CRS is wrong upon occasion. And in yesterday's extension of remarks in the Congressional Record, I inserted into the Record correspondence that indicated that a similar rushed memorandum of the Congressional Research Service on the Marriage Protection Act was erroneous in nature. Wrong once, maybe wrong again.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
