The gentleman is undoubtedly aware, as all of us are, that we are 15 weeks away from the last day of campaigning in this election. Many of us are counting the days as they approach. I am sure many ordinary American citizens are counting for those days to end as well, but it is a significant election we now face in 1996.  I think, despite the fact that I am a candidate in the election, as all of us are, I think it is significant far beyond our personal involvement. I really believe this may be the starkest contrast, the clearest choice that American voters have faced since Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran against Herbert Hoover in 1932. I do not think there has been a time in our history beyond that year that we have had such a sharp contrast.  It is curious that 4 years ago, when there was a choice at the Presidential level, the American people were told they could continue the policies of George Bush or take a chance with the policies of Bill Clinton. Certainly Mr. Perot was in the race, but those were the two major candidates. There was a bit of risk-taking involved because those voting for Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas, really had to accept his platform and his promise. They did not know what he would actually do as President of the United States.  It took a leap of faith for them to elect Bill Clinton as President of the United States and give him a chance to govern as the highest elected leader in this great Nation.  But it is a much different choice we face in 15 weeks. There is no leap of faith involved. We know exactly what the choices will be. We know what Bill Clinton and Al Gore have fought for. We know what the Democratic Party stands for. And we know very clearly on the issue of Medicare what the Republican leadership stands for.  If Bob Dole ends up being the nominee of his party, and there is some speculation he may not be, but I suspect he will be, if he ends up being the nominee of his party, can the voters trust Medicare with Bob Dole? Well, look back 31 years ago when Bob Dole sat on this very floor as a Member of the House of Representatives and in his judgment decided that the enactment of Medicare was a bad idea.  Now, many of us cast votes years ago that we would like to have over again and perhaps change, but Bob Dole is consistent. He recently said, when asked, it was the right vote to vote against Medicare. He knew it was not going to work.  So, here we have an unrepentant Bob Dole, voted against Medicare, who is seeking to become President of the United States and have the primary responsibility as President for the future of Medicare. Should this cause some concern and caution and pause among voters who worry about the future of Medicare? Well, I think so.  Let us assume for a moment that the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Newt Gingrich, continues to be the putative leader of the Republican Party and asks to be Speaker again, if he has that opportunity at the 1996 election. Is there any question in anyone's mind on what he will do to Medicare? Well, we already know his game plan. He was totally unrepentant and said it was wither on the vine. He would cut $270 billion out of Medicare in order to provide tax breaks for wealthy American people.  So those who are looking for a protector of Medicare in Newt Gingrich and the House Republicans had better keep looking. Unfortunately, on the other side of the rotunda, in the Senate, the Republican leadership is in lockstep with Mr. Gingrich and his thinking.  So in 15 weeks the voters will have their last night and their last day and hour of deliberation before making what I think will be the most important choice, political choice in this half century, in this 1996 election. They will know what they can choose from: Bill Clinton, running for President, who vetoed the Gingrich-Dole cuts in Medicare, or the Gingrich-Dole team, which will come in and change Medicare and allow it to wither on the vine, as Mr. Gingrich has said.  They will have a choice between Bill Clinton and his support for Medicaid, which is so important for poor children, disabled people, and elderly folks in nursing homes, or they can turn to the Dole and Gingrich team which wanted to make massive cuts in Medicaid, cuts that really would have endangered the future of a lot of young people and elderly alike.  They can vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who have supported college student loans, who are talking now about creative ways to help working families pay for college education, talking about the opportunities of education and training, or the Dole-Gingrich team.  And what did they propose? They continue to suggest cutting college student loans, making them more expensive for kids from middle-income families, make it more difficult for kids from families like my own to ever have a chance to go to college.  And finally they can look at the environmental protection. They know what Bill Clinton's record has been. They know what the Democrats have stood for in Congress. And they know very clearly what we are going to have if it is a Dole-Gingrich leadership on Capitol Hill and in Washington, DC, the same Newt Gingrich who proposed eliminating 14 environmental protection laws endangering the safety of the air we breathe and the water that we drink.                              {time}  2015  This is a stark contrast. Republicans are very proud of what they stand for. I admire their tenacity. They are going to stick with this no matter what. But I think the voters, and particularly moderate Republicans and independent voters, see through the Dole-Gingrich agenda.  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for bringing up the issue of Medicare tonight. I think he focuses us on what our decision as a Nation will be in 15 weeks. It will be the most important decision of my lifetime, and I sincerely hope that the people of this country will stick the Clinton-Gore leadership and the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill, to bring about the right kind of change, to not go too far, as Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich have gone in their last year and a half together as a team here on Capitol Hill. I thank the gentleman for yielding this time.
