President, today I am joining Senator Harkin in introducing legislation that will clarify the United States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards in meat and poultry products. I am pleased to join in this very important effort.  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do better. While food may never be completely free of risk, we must strive to make our food as safe as possible. Foodborne illnesses and hazards are still a significant problem that cannot be passively dismissed.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimate that as many as 76 million people suffer from foodborne illnesses each year. Of those individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more than 5,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. In terms of medical costs and productivity losses, foodborne illnesses cost the nation billions of dollars annually, and the situation is not likely to improve without decisive action. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Servicespredicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-15 percent over the next decade.  In an age where our Nation's food supply is facing tremendous pressures, from emerging pathogens to an ever-growing volume of food imports, from changing food consumption patterns to an aging population susceptible to food-related illnesses, and from age-old bacterial threats to new potential food security risks, we must have a stronger system in place to ensure the safety of our food.  A key tool for addressing foodborne illness in this country has been USDA's Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, PR/HACCP, regulations that were phased in beginning in January 1998. Under these regulations, USDA developed a scientific approach aimed at protecting consumers from foodborne pathogens. Instead of a system based on sight, smell and touch, USDA moved to a system that would successfully detect harmful pathogens whether visible or not and keep them from entering the food supply. A major part of this system included testing for Salmonella, which is not only one of the most common foodborne pathogens, but also one of the easiest to detect. USDA used this testing data to determine if meat and poultry plants were producing products that were safe for human health.  Research indicates that USDA's system was working well. According to former Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, the testing techniques were successful in controlling Salmonella and other deadly pathogens. In less than three years, the Salmonella standard was working, cutting the incidence of Salmonella in ground beef by a third.  USDA's pathogen testing regulations provided consumers with much needed confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products. However, that confidence has been shattered by a recent court decision. Last December, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that USDA could not close down the meat processor Supreme Beef, Inc., a supplier providing products to our Nation's school children through the Federal school lunch program, even after USDA inspectors tested and found the presence of potentially harmful levels of Salmonella at the plant on three separate occasions. The result of this court case is that USDA can no longer ensure that meat and poultry plants comply with pathogen standards. This creates a significant risk that meat and poultry products contaminated with common but potentially deadly foodborne pathogens will be sold to unsuspecting consumers.  The legislation we are introducing today will clarify USDA's authority to enforce strong safety standards for contamination in meat and poultry products. Specifically, this legislation will provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the clear authority to control for pathogens and enforce pathogen performance standards for meat and poultry products. Only with this authority will the Secretary of Agriculture be able to ensure the safety of the meat and poultry products sold in this country.  The court's decision in the Supreme Beef case is a step back for food safety. We must work together to ensure that USDA has the necessary authority to enforce pathogen performance standards that will protect public health. Let's not turn our back on food safety and consumer protection at such a critical time for food safety and security. I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort to protect our food supply and public health.                                 ______                                       By
