 President, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center recently marked the end of an era with the retirement of its visionary president and director, Dr. Robert W. Day.  In 1981, Dr. Day took over leadership of the center from its founding director, Dr. Bill Hutchinson. It was a time of painful transition for the young research facility. In Dr. Day, the center had a new leader who possessed the administrative skills, broad scientific perspective, ambitious vision and fiery passion needed to guide the center through this critical period. During Dr. Day's 16 year tenure, the center transformed from a local medical facility to one of the world's most respected cancer research facilities.  There are many legacies of Dr. Day's remarkable leadership. Perhaps the most visible is the magnificent South Lake Union research facility. Other prominent reminders are the many biotechnology firms that have been spawned by research conducted at the Hutchinson Center.  Among Dr. Day's most important legacies are his contributions to cancer policy. He is credited with pioneering the integration of public health and cancer research, which had primarily focused on basic and clinical research. He played a key role in launching and expanding the preventive program at the Centers for Disease Control. He is largely responsible for the Hutchinson Center being awarded the Nation's first cancer prevention research unit. Public education was also an important priority for Dr. Day, and he undertook the strengthening of the Cancer Information Service.  Because of his tremendous experience, Dr. Day has been widely sought out to fill advisory roles. In addition to his duties at Fred Hutchinson, Dr. Day has served on a number of influential national boards, including the National Cancer Advisory Board, the President's Cancer Advisory Council and countless peer-review committees. He is also a past president of the national Coalition for Cancer Research and of the American Association of Cancer Institutes.  Dr. Day has become a much respected figure on Capitol Hill. I appreciate the insight he has given me on legislative matters and his role in educating Members of this body on the issues surrounding cancer research. His influence and respect in the business community has helped to make the business community an important partner in cancer research efforts.  Dr. Day is regarded as not only an outstanding administrator and scientist, but as an outstanding human being. There can be no doubt that his passion for fighting cancer comes from the fact that he is a man who genuinely cares about people.  Dr. Day's well-deserved retirement will leave him time to devote to other personal interests. However, even in retirement he will continue to lend his considerable talent as a senior adviser to the center.  While the war against cancer has yet to be won, thanks to Dr. Day's remarkable efforts, much progress has been made. He has my lasting appreciation for his passionate leadership and his unending faith that one day we will win the battle against this terrible disease. He will continue to be an inspiration to those who seek to make his vision a reality.                          ____________________
