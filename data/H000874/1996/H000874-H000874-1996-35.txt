Chairman, I rise in opposition to this legislation. For over a decade I have chaired the Helsinki Commission. That commission is dedicated to the principles set forth in the Helsinki Final Act that we will treat diversity in all our nations with respect and integrity.  The fact of the matter is we passed a resolution on this floor unanimously regarding Kosova in which we urged and asked the Serbians to make sure that in Kosova they would be taught in the language that they knew, not Serbian, that they knew. So that on the one hand we urge nations of the world to be respecters of differences while in our own Nation we retreat from that principle. We ought not to do that.  The language of America is English. Indeed, my friends, the language of the world is fast becoming English. The tide is not against English or America; the tide is for us. We do not need to act in fear or in chauvinism or in jingoism. Reject this legislation.
