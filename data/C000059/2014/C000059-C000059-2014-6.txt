Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Judy Guglielmana is one of these individuals. On Tuesday, November 25, 2014, Judy was honored for her service with the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors.  Judy's passion for Riverside County began long before her service with the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors. After making Lake Elsinore her home in 1972, she enrolled both of her sons in Elsinore schools. Judy then advocated for the Elsinore High School District as the Community Liaison and as a member of the High School Board of Trustees.  In 2006, Judy was first elected to the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District Board of Directors. She extended her leadership in 2008 to hold the position of Board Treasurer and continued her service as Vice President in 2009. Following her reelection in 2010, Judy assumed the role of President in that same year, Board Treasurer in 2013 and finally as Vice President in 2014. Throughout her tenure Judy advocated for the highest quality water through her work on the Legislative, Conservation and Outreach Committee and the Groundwater Advisory Committee. Judy emphasized the importance of providing water and sewer services at the lowest possible rates and strived to maximize water resources through planning, management and conservation.  In light of all that Judy Guglielmana has done for the community of Lake Elsinore, it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Judy's tireless passion for conservation and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she moves on to her next challenge.                          ____________________
