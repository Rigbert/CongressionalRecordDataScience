President, I have been circulating drafts of bills designed to provide WIC benefits to military personnel and to certain civilian personnel, stationed overseas, for a few weeks. I know that Senator Harkin and other Senators on both sides of the aisle have also been working on this matter as have members of the other body.  I have received valuable input regarding my drafts from Members, national organizations and even personnel stationed overseas and I appreciate all who have helped. This bill introduction does not mean that I am no longer seeking input. On the contrary, as I have always handled nutrition legislation, I want to work with all Members on this important legislation, which I hope can be unanimously passed.  Basically, the Strengthening Families in the Military Service Act mandates that the Secretary of Defense offer a program similar to the WIC program--the Supplemental NutritionProgram for Women, Infants and Children--to military and associated civilian personnel stationed on bases overseas. If it makes sense to allow those stationed in the United States to participate in WIC, it makes sense to allow those stationed overseas to have the important nutritional benefits of that program. Why should families lose their benefits when they are moved overseas?  This bill provides that the Secretary of Defense will administer the program under rules similar to the WIC program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture within the United States.  WIC is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I joined Senators Lugar and Torricelli, the National Association of WIC Directors' Executive Director Doug Greenaway, as well as others, in celebrating this accomplishment.  For 25 years the WIC program has provided nutritious foods to low-income pregnant, post-partum and breast-feeding women, infants, and children who are judged to be at a nutritional risk.  It has proven itself to be a great investment--for every dollar invested in the WIC program, an estimated $3 is saved in future medical expenses. WIC has helped to prevent low birth weight babies and associated risks such as developmental disabilities, birth defects, and other complications. Participation in the WIC program has also been linked to reductions in infant mortality.  This program has worked extremely well in Vermont, and throughout the nation.  However, despite the successes of this program, there continues to be an otherwise eligible population who cannot receive these benefits--women and children in military families stationed outside of the United States.  These are families who are serving our country, living miles from their homes on a military base in a foreign land, and whose nutritional health is at risk. If they were stationed within our borders, their diets would be supplemented by the WIC program, and they would receive vouchers or packages of healthy foods, such as fortified cereals and juices, high protein products, and other foods especially rich in needed minerals and vitamins. If they receive orders stationing them at a U.S. base located in another country, they lose this needed support.  I know that I am not alone in my desire to establish WIC benefits for our women and children of military families stationed overseas. I look forward to working with all members of Congress in making a program that benefits nutritionally at risk women, infants and children serving America from abroad. I know there are other approaches being considered and I want to work out a good solution.  I have been informed of situations where this nutrition assistance is desperately needed by military and civilian personnel overseas. I do not see how we can turn our backs on these Americans stationed abroad. I am willing to work with other ways of providing this assistance but I believe that my bill has advantages over other suggestions. First, this bill guarantees this assistance for the next three years and mandates a study to determine if improvements or other changes are needed.  This bill also disregards the value of in kind housing assistance in calculating eligibility which increases the number of women, infants and children that can participate and makes the program more similar to the program in the United States. The CBO has estimated that the average monthly food cost would be about $28 for each participant based on a Department of Defense estimate of the cost of an average WIC food package in military commissaries. Administration costs which include health and nutrition assessments are likely to be about $7 per month per participant, according to CBO.  I am advised that counting the value of in kind housing assistance as though it were cash assistance would reduce the cost of this program to $2 million per year and that 5,100 women and children would participate in an average month under such an approach. This will be an issue which I look forward to discussing with my colleagues.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S.--       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Families in      the Military Service Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) prenatal care and proper nutrition for pregnant women      reduces the incidence of birth abnormalities and low birth      weight among infants;       (2) proper nutrition for infants and young children has      very positive health and growth benefits; and       (3) women, infants, and children of military families      stationed outside the United States are potentially at      nutritional risk.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that      women, infants, and children of military families stationed      outside the United States receive supplemental foods and      nutrition education if they generally would be eligible to      receive supplemental foods and nutrition education provided      in the United States under the special supplemental nutrition      program for women, infants, and children established under      section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C.      1786).     SEC. 3. SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFITS FOR WOMEN,                    INFANTS, AND CHILDREN OF MILITARY FAMILIES                    STATIONED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.
