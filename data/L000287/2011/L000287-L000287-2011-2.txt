Mr. Speaker, we should stay here, stay here, don't go home until we can meet their expectations. We must come together and do what is right, and do it now. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this bad bill and come together, pass a long-term, clean extension of unemployment benefits. That's the thing to do.
