 President, today, Senators Breaux, McCain, and I introduce the Turkish-Israeli Economic Enhancement Act of 2002.  This legislation will allow qualified products from Turkey to be eligible for duty-free entry into the United States under the Qualified Industrial Zone program. Congress first established the Qualified Industrial Zone program in 1996 to facilitate economic cooperation between Israel, Egypt and Jordan. The impetus behind this program was to help create the economic basis for sustained peace in the region. While peace still eludes us today, there is little doubt that the program has helped to foster greater economic cooperation in the region. Allowing Turkey to participate in the program will foster even greater economic growth and stability in the region.  The Israeli-Turkish Economic Enhancement Act would amend Section 9(e)(1) of the United States Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985, as amended, the ``FTA Act, by expanding the definition of ``qualifying industrial zones'' to include portions of the territory of Israel and Turkey. Under the FTA Act, the President may proclaim duty-free benefits for certain products produced within the qualifying industrial zones. The bill would allow the President to proclaim duty-free benefits for certain products, excluding certain import sensitive products, of qualifying industrial zones established jointly by Israel and Turkey. The bill would foster cooperation between Israel and Turkey and help promote economic growth, opportunity and development in Turkey, a vital security partner in NATO and a key ally in the war against terrorism.  I am committed to working with my colleagues and the President to enact the legislation as soon as practicable. Enabling Turkey to participate in the Qualified Industrial Zone program can help attract foreign investment to Turkey and build greater regional stability.  I understand that there is strong interest in supporting high-technology investment in Turkey. The investment potential for high technology products and services in Turkey has not gone unnoticed by major U.S. investors. Microsoft has installed a subsidiary in Istanbul responsible for sales and support to all of the Middle East, Central Asia and Northern Africa. By creating a qualified industrial zone, Turkey may be able to attract even more foreign investment in this important sector.  Turkey has been a staunch, long-time ally of the United States. American and Turkish troops fought together in Korea. Today we are fighting a different war on a different front in Afghanistan. But our friendship and joint commitment to freedom and democracy remains the same.  By enacting this legislation, the U.S. Congress can send a strong message to the people of Turkey that we appreciate and value their friendship and support and that we will continue to work with them to promote freedom and prosperity for all of our people.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation with Senators Breaux and Grassley that would expand the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement to recognize Turkey's critical role as a key American partner in the Middle East conflict, the war on terrorism, and the NATO alliance.  Turkey has a deepening strategic relationship with Israel, with which it has enjoyed military cooperation since 1994. It is a force for stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Today, it assumed command of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan. It is one of our best NATO allies. Turkish troops have fought alongside U.S. forces from Korea to Kabul. Turkey's support was instrumental during the 1991 gulf war; it hosts operation Northern Watch, in which American and British aircraft patrol the no-fly zone over northern Iraq; and it will be central to any American military campaign againstIraq. As a Muslim nation and a secular democracy that has embraced modernity, Turkey puts to rest the myth that America's war on terror is a war on Islam.  Turkey's economy shrank by over 8 percent last year. Its ability to contribute to the war effort in Afghanistan and elsewhere faces serious economic constraints. Turkey has shown a strong commitment to economic reform and to working with the International Monetary Fund. A Qualified Industrial Zone for Turkey, under the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, would help Turkey attract foreign investment, diversify its exports, and boost trade. It would also help Israel and Turkey develop the economic dimension of their strong security relationship, which is unique in the region.  I know this issue is important to the administration and to the Governments of Turkey and Israel. I am sorry we were unable to pass legislation authorizing a QIZ for Turkey as part of the TPA package last month. I am confident that the measure we have introduced today will enjoy wide bipartisan support and will make a tangible, substantive contribution to Israeli-Turkish cooperation and to American interests in the region.                                 ______                                      By
