Shouldn't we all agree on that? If we are going to reduce the incidence of abortion, one of the things we should do is make sure young people are aware of consequences. We should stress abstinence. The Lautenberg amendment put that as the highest priority. But then have family planning information available so young people know that there are ways to protect themselves. I think that was a reasonable starting point. We had a few from the other side of the aisle join us with that amendment but clearly not enough.
