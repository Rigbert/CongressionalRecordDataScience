 President, I wish to say to my good friend from Pennsylvania, before he leaves the floor, what an extraordinary 16 years he has had representing the people of his State and what a truly outstanding Member of the Senate he has been and what a moving farewell address I had an opportunity to witness. Good luck, good friend, and Godspeed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending nomination occur at 5:45 today and that prior to the vote, Senator Grassley be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, Senator Enzi for up to 5 minutes, and Senator Kennedy for up to 5 minutes.
