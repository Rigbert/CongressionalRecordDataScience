President, as chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, we have had about 40 hours of hearings on this subject, on global warming as well as ambient air quality standard changes that have been proposed by this administration. I think it is unrealistic to try to condense that into 2 minutes. There is not any way it can be done.  I will just say, Mr. President, that as 1 of the 66 cosponsors of this resolution, I support it, although I would say also it doesn't go far enough. And I would also say that regardless of what happens--this is going to pass, but regardless of that, I am still going to oppose the ratification of this treaty. I am going to do so for two reasons. First, is that the science is not there. This is analogous to the proposal by the administration to lower the ambient air standards in both particulate matter and in ozone, unrealistically costing the American people billions and billions of dollars a year without any science to back it up.  Mr. President, I am going to read real quickly and enter the entire statement in the Record, but before my committee, Dr. John Christy of the Department of Atmospheric Science and Earth System Science Laboratory, University of Alabama, Huntsville, said--I don't think there is anyone who is considered to be a greater authority than he is--       The satellite data show that catastrophic warming is not      now occurring. The detection of human effects on climate has      not been convincingly proven because the variations we have      observed are not outside of the natural variations of the      climate system.
