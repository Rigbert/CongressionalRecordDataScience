Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. today, and we reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicacy of liberty. Dr. King's life, and unfortunately his vicious murder, remind us that we must continually work and, if necessary, fight, to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in that battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in many of the citizens in communities throughout our Naiton. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirt of resolve and achievement that will help move our county into the future. In particular, I would like to recognize several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District, who, in the past year and in their own ways have, have acted with courage, met challenges, and used their abilities to reach goals and enhance their communities.  Mr. Jack Parton, director of the United Steelworkers of America, District 7, Mr. Eric Mason and Mr. Michael Krueger, both graduates of Portage High School, led a prodiversity rally in Portage, IN, last May to peacefully, but forcefully, counter a march by the Ku Klux Klan. Their efforts sent a strong and clear message to members of the KKK, as well as members of our communities and citizens throughout the country, that ethnic, racial, and religious hatred will not be tolerated. The counter-rally that they developed and carried out was an overwhelming success. It generated enormous support from religious, labor, business, and civic groups throughout the region. The courage of these men should be held up as an example to all that, through thoughtful, united action, the values of human rights that we all cherish can--and must--be maintained, even in the face of ignorance and hatred.  I would also like to recognize Janee Bryant, Brandon Crayton, Brandie Frifth, LaKisha Girder, Damara Hamlin, Markika Harris, Rasheedah Jackson, Leah Johnson, Jacleen Joiner, Ayashia Muhammad, Clinton Pearson, Kala Simmons, Sheria Smith, David Suggs, DeKeyur Summer, Jennifer Thompson, Stephanie Thompson, Courtney Williams, and Joey Willis.  These outstanding individuals are the members of the Tolleston Junior High School team, which won the Indiana State Bowl Championship in spelling. This wonderful accomplishment is a reflection of their hard work and dedication to study. Their scholastic effort and rigorous approach to learning have made them the best in the State. They have brought pride to themselves, their families, their school, and their communities. Their success is also a credit to the outstanding ability and leadership of their teacher-coaches, Mrs. Margaret Hymes, Mrs. Paula Thompson, Mrs. Sandra V. Alfred, Ms. Dionne Moore, Mrs. Janice L. Williams, and Mrs. Juanita Vincent. The Tolleston students, who won the State Bowl Championship in spelling, as well as their gifted teachers, deserve recognition as true role models in our State.  Though very different in nature, the achievement of all of these individuals reflects many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed and the values he espoused. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. They had goals and worked to achieve them. Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other colleagues to join me in commending their initiative, resolve, and dedication.                          ____________________
