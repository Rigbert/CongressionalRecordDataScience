Speaker, I rise to recognize the long and influential career of Ms. Cynthia Leighton.  For twenty years, I have had the distinct honor of serving as co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. During this time I have met so many dedicated men and women from outside the traditional ranks of the fire service who are passionate about the health and safety of our Nation's firefighters and first responders. Cynthia Leighton is among those individuals, and truly strives to assist and protect those who keep our communities safe and secure.  As a fire service liaison from Motorola and Motorola Solutions for the past twenty-eight years, Cynthia has been the company's go-to person on issues facing first responders, always willing and able to hear concerns, answer questions, and provide assistance--whether the inquiry comes from a local firefighter or a national fire organization, such as the Congressional Fire Services Institute or the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. Each year at both the annual National Fire and Emergency Services Dinner and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service, she is often behind the scenes making sure that the event organizers have the proper resources they needed for a successful program.  Going above and beyond her job description at Motorola, Cynthia has demonstrated an enormous capacity for helping others and doing whatever she can to support the work of our first responders. On behalf of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I thank Cynthia for her dedication and outstanding contributions to the safety of our Nation's firefighters. I wish her the best in all her future endeavors.                          ____________________
