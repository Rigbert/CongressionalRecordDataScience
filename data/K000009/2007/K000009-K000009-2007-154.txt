'  Joyce Mahaney was born January 31st, 1947 on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota of Chippewa parents, Alexander and Mary Frederick. Joyce was given the Indian Name ``Snowfeather''' as she was born during a snowstorm. Her father died when she was a toddler and her mother and other tribal members raised her. Inquisitive and always proud of her American Indian heritage, Joyce was well-schooled in the Tribal Customs and Laws. After completing high school on the Reservation, she attended Minot State College where she completed a Baccalaureate Degree in Education with a Minor in Library Science and Sociology. While in college, she met Russell Mahaney whom she later married, and they eventually moved to Toledo, Ohio, where she remained for over 30 years and raised her family.  Although Joyce moved from the Reservation, she didn't leave it. She continued to have close contact with elders, relatives and friends. Throughout her life she supported her Native American heritage, becoming a spokesperson for all tribes of Native Americans in the State of Ohio and in Michigan and Indiana, in preserving the culture and traditions. Joyce was designated as a Pipe Carrier from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota which gave her permission from the elders of the tribe to conduct special religious and cultural services, including praying with Native Americans on death row. It is one of the highest honors provided to a member of a tribe.  In an effort to preserve all tribal cultures, Joyce established the American Indian Intertribal Association (AIIA) of Toledo in 1988. It was the first organization of its kind in Ohio and the Midwest, and she served as the Director until her death. Her daughter then assumed leadership. The primary mission of the organization is to preserve the Indian culture by conducting traditional pow-wows, presenting programs and educational opportunities, providing culturally sensitive awareness in drug and alcohol prevention and participating in cultural events within the community as well as training through workshops and seminars. A further goal is to educate the general public about Native American cultural traditions, the desecration of Indian burial sites, and the exploitation of sacred ceremonies and cultural identities. In addition, the AIIA provides workshops in the schools and with local community organizations to maintain open contact with social service agencies and participate in the community. Joyce worked with social service agencies in applying the Indian Child Welfare Act by ensuring that Indian children were placed in homes where they would be exposed to their culture.  Joyce was later instrumental in assisting in the expansion of the American Indian Intertribal Association's branch office in Cleveland as well as other Indian centers in Akron, Michigan and Indiana. Although she was Chippewa, she was an advocate for all members of all Tribes and Nations. Throughout her life, Joyce served as an activist in the preservation of her cultural heritage and traditions. She was active in the preservation of sacred Indian burial grounds in Maumee, Ohio in the 1990's and frequently battled with archeologists and museums throughout Ohio regarding the application of NAGPRA (Native American Graves Repatriation Act) laws and the handling of Native American remains. Joyce was instrumental in the development of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Fallen Timbers in which a stone monument was placed in remembrance of the warriors who lost their lives in the battle of 1794. There is currently activity underway by the City of Maumee to name a bridge in her honor at the sight of the Fallen Timbers Monument in which the Annual Summer Solstice Ceremony is held.  Joyce is a published author of two books and was working on a third at the time of herdeath. She received an award for her poetry at the Multicultural Arts Show in Toledo in 1997. The books include Prairie Winds (1995) and Spirit of Dakota (1999), a collection of prose and poetry about Native American culture, spirituality, and life on an Indian reservation.  Joyce was held in high esteem by community and elected leaders, and throughout the years her efforts were recognized. In 1989, she received a proclamation from Governor Celeste declaring May 1-7, 1989 as American Indian Week. Additional recognition came for her establishment of the American Indian Intertribal Association; assisting in the preservation of the Indian burial mounds, the lands and the culture; the assistance in the erection of a historical marker at the site of Fallen Timbers National Park site in which she was also instrumental in the purchase of the battle sight; and her service to the Native American Advisory Council. She was honored by the City of Maumee when she led the presentation as a Native American representative in the ``All American City'' competition in Anaheim California in June 2006, which was 2 weeks before her death.  As a result of her work, Joyce has left a legacy for Ohio and the Midwest in the preservation of the Native Culture. The annual Pow Wow which will be celebrating it's 20th year this year, has attracted several thousand Native American and non-Native Americans to teach and remind us of the importance of the Native American heritage. It's 20th anniversary year with its theme ``Honoring the Elders'' seems a fitting time to memorialize its Founding Mother.  Joyce Snowfeather Mahaney-- Activist, Teacher, Warrior, and Pioneer--will long be remembered for the contributions and legacy she left. Throughout her life, she walked the Red Road. Her own words echo in fitting tribute to this extraordinary woman.                             Walk Beside Me     You are the warrior and the hunter and I am the humble power            behind the spear who will always guide your shield to            defend you. And you are the sister I met near the            stream.     We sat on the rocks facing the morning sun and cleansed our            garments together.     When you look into my soul, you will find the existence of a            very quiet and gentle spirit.     Listen to my footsteps. If you hear the sound of refined            pebbles falling softly on Mother Earth, it is I.     My spirit can always be found traveling north and south. I            follow Grandfather and travel the red road.     The wind blows strong, but my steps never falter, as the            sacred pipe protects me.     Come--Walk beside me. Together we have the power to change            the world. For I am not your enemy, I am your strength.                          ____________________
