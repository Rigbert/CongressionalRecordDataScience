President, I rise in support of the passage of HR 5294--the ``John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2004.'' As Chairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, I am pleased that, working closely with the Kennedy Center, we were able to reach an agreement with the House of Representatives. This legislation authorizes funding for the maintenance, repair and security, as well as capital projects through Fiscal Year 2007. Additionally, the legislation revises the John F. Kennedy Center Plaza Authorization Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Center PlazaProject Team consisting of the Secretary, the Administrator of General Services, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, or their designees, and other individuals the Project Team considers appropriate. The Board is required to consult with the Project Team on specified matters, including construction of buildings.  I wish to recognize Marty Hall and Andrew Wheeler of my Committee staff for their work on this legislation. I also wish thank Michael Kaiser, President of the Kennedy Center for his support for this bill. Mr. Kaiser has done an outstanding job of making the Kennedy Center a world class operation and center for the performing arts. Mr. Kaiser is responsible not only for the artistic programming, he is also the person charged with ensuring its financial health. By any measure, he has been very successful in both ventures. I would also like to express my appreciation to Kennedy Center staff, specifically Jared Barlage and Ann Stock, who have worked very closely with my staff in developing this legislation.  From its very beginnings, the Kennedy Center has represented a unique public/private partnership. Because the Center is the Nation's living memorial to President Kennedy, it receives federal funding each year to pay for maintenance and operation of the building, a federal facility. However, the Center's artistic programs and education and outreach initiatives are paid for almost entirely through ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations. I am pleased that we can send this legislation to President Bush and continue the good work of this valued institution.                          ____________________
