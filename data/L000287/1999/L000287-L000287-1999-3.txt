Mr. Speaker, the Republican budget deal is a do-nothing bill, nothing for Social Security, nothing for Medicare. It hurts every family. The Republican budget bill does nothing to extend the life of Social Security, even by one single day. It fails to provide one penny for Medicare prescription drug benefits. The only thing it does do is hurt every family, every American family, every family, in a very real way.  When it comes to Social Security and Medicare, the Republican budget deal is not right, it is not fair, it is not just; it is dead wrong.                          ____________________
