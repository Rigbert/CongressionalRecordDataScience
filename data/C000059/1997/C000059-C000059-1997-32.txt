Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for yielding me this time.  I also thank the chairman of the Committee on Science and the ranking member, Mr. Brown, for their support in expediting passage of this bill.  As Chairman Sensenbrenner has pointed out, this bill will allow the Electric and Magnetic Fields research program to complete its original 5-year authorization. At the same time, we will save the taxpayers money by reducing the authorization some $19 million to the $46-million-agreed-upon budget for the program. I should add that 50 percent of this budget is cost-shared by industry.  Mr. Speaker, at the time of the markup of this bill in the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, the distinguished vice-chairman of the full Science Committee, Mr. Ehlers, made the point that all the research to date on this issue has failed to find a significant link between electric and magnetic fields and serious health problems. I agree and I doubt that will change.  Nevertheless, this program was agreed to by both Government and industry to put to rest public concern and, once started, I think it's worth finishing.  Finally, I want to particularly thank my friend from Indiana, our ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Mr. Roemer, for cosponsoring this bill and working closely with us to expedite the process. Mr. Speaker, this bill has strong bipartisan support and I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time.
