 President, I rise today to commend members of the American and international business communities who are providing resources and technical expertise to help the United Nations and other international relief organizations alleviate the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees.  Today, as we embark on the initial stages of a peace agreement, hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees remain scattered across the globe. Slobodan Milosevic and his troops have driven these victims out of their country, separated families, destroyed homes, and stripped the refugees of their personal identification papers. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that over 800,000 people have been forced to flee Kosovo since the Serb Army intensified ethnic purges two and a half months ago.  Refugee situations are always difficult. The Kosovar situation, however, has been exacerbated and complicated greatly by Milosevic's attempts at ``identity erasure.'' Servian soldiers have stripped the Kosovars of all identification documents and systematically destroyed civil records. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the refugees are spread over 30 different countries.  Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Microsoft, Securit World, Ericsson, and ScreenCheck are partnering with the Red Cross, UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration and other international organizations on projects that will register the refugees, provide them with identification documents, and reunite them with their families. These companies are providing technical expertise, equipment, personnel and other resources that are allowing the refugees to be registered and located much more efficiently and effectively than ever before.  We are certainly witnessing a situation where the Internet and other recent technological innovations are providing solutions for real life problems. For example, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Securit have developed and provided systems that allow refugees to be registered, added to an international database, and to obtain identification cards--all within minutes. Further, the Red Cross is working with Compaq and Ericsson to launch the Family News Network, which is the first Internet-based refugee tracing system.  These companies are to be commended for their contributions to help restore the Kosovar community. It is my hope that in the future more members of the business community will enter into such beneficial partnerships to help address problems facing our country and our world.                          ____________________
