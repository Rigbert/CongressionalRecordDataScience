 President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about our departing colleagues. I am going to start with the senior Senator from South Carolina, the senior Senator after many years of waiting in the wings, and that is Senator Fritz Hollings.  I first got to know Fritz Hollings after I came to the Senate in 1986. My wife Annette and I have worked with Fritz and his wife Peatsy. We have traveled around the United States with them. We have been with them in their home. We visited them in Charleston. We traveled around the world with them.  He is a unique individual, to say the least, but he has had, as the Presiding Officer knows, a distinguished career as a State Senator in his native South Carolina and then lieutenant governorand Governor of his State before he came to the Senate I believe in 1966.  He has had a distinguished career as chairman of the Commerce Committee for many years and as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and chairman for many years, and ranking member now, of the Appropriations subcommittee dealing with State-Justice.  Fritz, we are going to miss you. We are going to miss your humor. We are going to miss your frankness. We are going to miss your wisdom. And we are going to miss your wife Peatsy about whom we all care and love. You have invited a lot of us to visit you in Charleston. I hope you add some more rooms to that house there because a lot of us will be coming to see you. You have been a great American.  In addition to public service to his State and to the Nation, Fritz Hollings was a young graduate of the Citadel in his hometown of Charleston before the Second World War, and he served with distinction as an officer in Europe for a long time through many battles.  I respect you, Fritz. I commend you for your service, and I look forward to visiting you both here and in Charleston in the years to come.                              Don Nickles  One of my other colleagues we all care about and work with is Don Nickles of Oklahoma. He came here as a very young man in 1980. He has been here 24 years. He was the whip, assistant majority leader. He was right here on this floor. He spent many days, many hours trying to herd us together as one of our leaders. He is now at the moment the chairman of the Budget Committee, and that is a feat in itself. He is a senior member of the Finance Committee.  We wish you had stayed around, but you chose to leave the Senate on your own volition. Don, we will see you, we will miss you, and I commend you for your service to the Nation and to your great State of Oklahoma.                              John Breaux  John Breaux was just on the floor a few minutes ago. I first met John Breaux when I came to the House of Representatives in 1978. He had preceded me, although he is a little younger. He was a young man in the House of Representatives. He was very involved and was one of the first people I met there.  He tried to work with both sides, the Democrats and Republicans. He has been involved in the forging of a lot of compromises--meaningful ones--over the years. He has represented his State of Louisiana both as a Congressman and as a Senator well, I believe, for many years. John, we wish you and your wife Lois the best. We know you are not going to go very far, but you have a lot of friends in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, and you know that.                              Tom Daschle  Tom Daschle will be leaving us. He served this Nation well. He served in the U.S. Air Force as an intelligence officer. He served as a staffer, and then he was in my class in 1978 as a member of the House of Representatives. That is where I first met Tom and worked with him and respected him. Sometimes we would be on other sides of the issues, but nevertheless, I always thought in his dealings with me and others he was a very honorable, decent person.  He is a relatively young man. He served us well, I thought, as majority leader. He was always fair and up front with us. He will go on to good things, I am sure. I wish Tom and his wife Linda the best.                               Bob Graham  Senator Bob Graham is a friend of mine, a Democrat, a former Governor of Florida for two terms. He came to the Senate in 1986 when I did. We worked together on many committees, but we worked closely together on the committee you serve on today, Mr. President, and that is the Intelligence Committee.  I was the chairman of the committee and then he became the chairman when the Democrats got control of the Senate, and I was the vice chairman. I found Bob Graham to be working day in and day out, to be a very upfront man, a very honorable man, a man of his word. I certainly wish him well in whatever he does in the future.                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell  My friend Senator Campbell, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, you talk about somebody unique. He is a unique American. He is a Native American. He is proud of who he is. He has represented the State of Colorado, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, very well. I wish him the very best. He will certainly not go away in the future.                              Zell Miller  Senator Zell Miller, the colleague of the Presiding Officer, is a distinguished Senator from Georgia. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, I believe, State senator, and then Governor of Georgia for at least two terms. He came to the Senate and distinguished himself. He is someone for whom I have a lot of respect, for his integrity, for his forthrightness, for his grit, for his perseverance, and also his foresight.  Zell, we will miss you in the Senate. But we will see a lot of you. I hope to visit you in north Georgia. You tell me what a beautiful place it is, and it is not too far from my State of Alabama, so I hope you have a room for us there. We will come see you, especially when the apples are ready to pick and you are ready to show us around.                              John Edwards  We have also Senator Edwards from North Carolina. I first met John Edwards 6 years ago when he came to the Senate. He is a very accomplished lawyer, a very engaging person. He was the Democratic nominee, as we all know, for Vice President of the United States. John Edwards is a young man, a man with a lot of talent, and I am sure we will hear from him in some respect, political or otherwise, in the future as life goes on.                            Peter Fitzgerald  Senator Peter Fitzgerald from Illinois is a very young man, one of the youngest men to come to the Senate. He chose to serve only one term. I think he has been involved in some of the big issues of the day. He is a man of integrity. He is a man who wants to do the right thing. He is always going to be involved in the issues of the day, as he has been.  Peter, we wish you and your family the best as you go back into the private sector where you have excelled and done things so well and for so long.  We are going to miss all these Senators, on both sides of the aisle, because collectively they bring a lot of experience and a lot of wisdom to the Senate. They have served, as I said, with distinction and honor here.                              TOM DASCHLE
