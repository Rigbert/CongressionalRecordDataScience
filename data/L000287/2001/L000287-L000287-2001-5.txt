Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3129. This bill threatens to violate the civil rights of international travelers. The Customs Service's poor record of racially profiling passengers has been well documented. While I appreciate the attempts that they have made to address the problem, now is not the time to grant immunity to Customs officers conducting personal searches.  For more than 2 years, I have been examining allegations of racial profiling by Customs inspectors throughout the country, and mistreatment of international travelers, especially African Americans and Hispanics, in the Customs Service personal search process. I will not support any legislation that will grant Customs officers immunity before we have seen significant improvement in their record on racial profiling.  As public officials, Customs agents already have qualified immunity which is more than adequate to protect them if acting within the scope of their official authority. Civil lawsuits against government officials and agents are an important deterrent to racial profiling and unconstitutional and unlawful searches. Without the possibility of a lawsuit, individuals who have been treated in an unconstitutional manner by a government agency will have no redress, and the government agents will have less incentive to comply with the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to protect the basic civil rights and civil liberties of international travelers and oppose this bill.
