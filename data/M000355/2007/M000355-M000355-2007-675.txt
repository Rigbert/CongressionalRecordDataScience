 President, I will be consulting with my colleagues on the Republican side throughout the morning and at lunch on the issues raised by the majority leader with regard to the disposition of the pending amendments. As he indicated, some of them will be germane postcloture. I will be able to inform the majorityleader after lunch what other amendments we would hope to have an opportunity to vote on. I share his view that we ought to wrap this bill up as soon as reasonably possible. We will be working toward that end throughout the day.                          ____________________
