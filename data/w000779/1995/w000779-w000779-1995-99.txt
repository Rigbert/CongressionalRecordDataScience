Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation and would like to briefly address title I of the bill that deals with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I and a number of other Members on both sides of the aisle were troubled with the original language in the Contract With America with respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  That original language would have applied the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to big business as well as the country's small businesses. We felt that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was supposed to respond to the kinds of problems the majority has been talking about. A lot of our small businesses do go through bureaucratic water torture when they run up against some of these regulations, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is supposed to be a fast-track process for adjusting regulation to the needs of small entrepreneurs. But the Contract With America would have changed all that. We want what amounts to an HOV lane for entrepreneurs so that the Federal Government responds to their concerns.  So fortunately, on a bipartisan basis, working with the chairman of the committee, the gentlewoman from Kansas [Mrs. Meyers], the gentleman from New York [Mr. LaFalce], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Sisisky], the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Skelton], and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Poshard], there has now been a bipartisan agreement worked out with all the relevant committees that regulatory flexibility provisions will apply just to small business. In my view, this is the way to ensure that the Federal bureaucracy is sensitive to America's entrepreneurs. That is what is in the public interest.
