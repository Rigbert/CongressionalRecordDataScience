President, pending before the Senate now is consideration of a bill that would dramatically change the way we regulate tobacco and tobacco products in America. This is an issue which has meant a lot to me during the course of my time in the House and in the Senate.  Many years ago--over 20 years ago--I offered an amendment which was the first successful attempt to regulate tobacco. I should say, earlier efforts at warning labels go back many years. But this was the first successful attempt to regulate the use of tobacco product.  What we did 20 years ago was suggest that the old days and the old ways of allowing people to smoke on airplanes had to change. Some of us are old enough to remember those days when you would make a reservation to fly on an airplane and you would tell them whether you wanted to sit in the smoking on nonsmoking section--as if there was any difference. For the most part, if you happen to be seated, at least, in the last seat of the nonsmoking section, you might as well be smack dab in the middle of the smoking section.  So we decided to eliminate smoking on airplanes. That was an amendment I offered in the House of Representatives over 20 years ago. It had the opposition of the tobacco lobby and the opposition of all the political leadership in the House of Representatives--Democrats and Republicans.
