of Sylvania Township, Ohio. Professor Danziger passed from this life at the age of eighty years on January 8, 2019. He was memorialized at Epworth United Methodist Church in Toledo on February 16, 2019.  Edmund Danziger was born in Newark, New Jersey and spent his childhood with brother Doug tramping through the outdoors near their Hillside home. After graduating from high school in 1956, he felt a call to ministry. However, he found a different call to history and research while a student at the College of Wooster, graduating in 1960. He went on to receive his doctorate from the University of Illinois. Along the way he married his wife, Margaret, and together they raised two children, John and Anne. They moved to Bowling Green Ohio, where he began his 46 year teaching career at Bowling Green State University.  A noted researcher and expert on Ohio and Native American history, Professor Danziger's work led to the publication of books including Indians and Bureaucrats: Administering the Reservation Policy during the Civil War and Regeneration: Detroit's American Indian Community along with many scholarly articles. He became chair of the BGSU History Department, receiving teaching and faculty excellence awards and a special university achievement award for excellence. In 1995, BGSU Trustees named him ``distinguished teaching professor,'' only the seventh in the school's history.  Admired and respected by colleagues and students, Edmund Danziger explained, ``A master teacher will ignite a flame with his or her students--a flame which will guide them in further academic studies and more generally along life's challenging path.'' This philosophy sums up Professor Danziger's career. He took students on field trips to Fort Meigs, Walpole Island First Nation, and hiking the Appalachian Trail. He guided graduate students through theses and dissertations. A former student now an assistant professor of history himself said, ``He was the kind of person who elevated everybody he was around. He genuinely cared about humanity. He cared about students.'' What better reflection of a life well lived?  We send our heartfelt sympathy to the Danziger family. We hope they find some comfort in the gift of his life, those he touched and those who were made better by knowing Edmund Jefferson Danziger. Godspeed.                          ____________________
