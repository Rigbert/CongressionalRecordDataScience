 I listened carefully to what the Senator from Florida had to say. It reminds me of the prediction many of us made when it was passed: It would be the single worst piece of legislation in modern times.  Everything the President predicted would happen has not happened. Premiums have gone up; jobs have been destroyed. The single biggest step in the direction of Europeanizing our country that we could possibly have taken we took with ObamaCare.  So I just wanted to commend the Senator from Florida for his comments. They are right on the mark.  I also want to thank Senator Cruz for offering this amendment. I offered it in the last Congress myself. There is no way to fix this thing, no way to fix it. It needs to be pulled out by its roots. The Senator from Florida pointed out it is also destroying jobs.  I was on a tele-townhall the other night. A restaurant manager called in and said exactly what the Senator from Florida just said, that they were moving to lower their employment and to have more part-time workers in order to try to deal with the impending ObamaCare explosion.  So I am sure the Senator from Florida is running into that in his State as well.
