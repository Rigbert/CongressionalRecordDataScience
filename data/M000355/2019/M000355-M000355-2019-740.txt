 President, I welcome my colleagues back to the Senate. I hope all of us took advantage of the past weeks that we spent in our home States and with our constituents. Washington is where we come to work. We come here to fight for our neighbors and for the places we love and are proud to hail from.  The American people know this is a highly charged political moment. They haven't sent us here to stage pitched battles or score political points. They elected us to make a difference for them and their families. We do that by taking care of the people's business and by collaborating in good faith to complete our work and attend to the pressing matters that are before us.  While we were spread out across the country, we heard an unwelcome announcement from our dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia. Senator Johnny Isakson has determined that his health challenges will lead him to conclude his distinguished 15-year Senate career at the end of December, putting Georgians first, like always.  His departure will be a significant loss for the people of Georgia and for the 99 of us here in this Chamber. Senator Isakson is a tireless legislator. In particular, he is a dogged advocate for our Nation's veterans. But he is even more than that. Johnny is universally seen as one of the warmest, friendliest, most respectful, and most collaborative Members of this body. He has strong views and solid principles, but he knows that broad, often bipartisan cooperation is the way to advance those very goals.                          ____________________
