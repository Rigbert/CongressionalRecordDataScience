Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a legendary leader of my community. Tom Hart of Toledo, Ohio, died on the morning of August 25, 1998 at the age of 62 after waging a battle of courage and grace against cancer.  A veteran, Tom was born and raised in Toledo, graduating from Central Catholic High School and the University of Toledo, and establishing a successful marketing and public relations firm in his hometown. As his business grew, he earned a solid reputation for his marketing expertise, his connection to the community, and his creativity. Tom Hart was, in fact, the mastermind behind many of the Toledo area's successful political ad campaigns. From 1967 through 1987, his ads were part of eleven mayoral election victories. Long-time Toledo Mayor and elder statesman Harry Kessler noted, ``He could put more in a 22 second commercial than any man I ever knew.'' His style in advertising became a fixture in our regional landscape, as Tom won many awards over the years for his creativity and achievement. His ads have become part of Northwest Ohio's political and financial history.  Strongly committed to his community, Tom gave freely and often of his time and talents. He was frequently a gifted master of ceremonies for many community functions. One prominent businessman described, ``The guy was into giving back to the community. That was his ethic. He wasn't afraid to put his time and effort into helping people.''  Feted as both a business and community leader, nonetheless family was first and foremost to Tom Hart. To his wife, Kathleen, his children Sheila, Mary Lynn, Michael, and Timothy, and nine grandchildren, he leaves a legacy of love and commitment. May their memories of this strong, self-willed, self-made man, devoted husband, father, and grandfather, shine through to sustain them.                          ____________________
