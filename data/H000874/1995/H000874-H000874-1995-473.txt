Speaker, tomorrow I will be offering an amendment to the American Overseas Interests Act to lift the arms embargo that has tied the hands of the people of Bosnia for over 3 years in their efforts at self defense.  Last year, with bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly to lift the arms embargo, yet one year later, what has it brought the Bosnians? Nothing other than more deaths. We have seen time and time again Bosnians say yes to peace, only to have the aggressors, the Bosnian Serbs, say ``No, only on our terms.'' Time and time again we have backed down from our threats, only to allow the aggressors more time to kill and destroy a nation recognized by the international community.  Mr. Speaker, appeasement of aggression in Bosnia resonates throughout the world. We cannot continue taking a middle course in which we espouse noble principles and yet tolerate their continued violation.  At the funeral of two slain peacekeepers, France's President Chirac declared, ad I quote, ``We will not accept the return of ethnic hatred and barbarism to the continent.'' Yet, Mr. Speaker, if we fail to assist the sovereign nation of Bosnia, then we shall have facilitated their return.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and allow the Bosnians to exercise their right to defend themselves.                          ____________________
