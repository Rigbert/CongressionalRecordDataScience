Speaker, I would like to thank my chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), for introducing this visionary piece of legislation. It was passed out of the Committee on Science with unanimous bipartisan support.  I would also like to honor our former colleague, the Honorable George Brown, who put a lot of work into this bill, and the continuation of George's work by the gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Hall), our ranking member.  The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act, H.R. 2086, is truly a visionary piece of legislation. I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues as an original cosponsor.  H.R. 2086 is about one simple thing, access to information. A major component of access to information is the continued development and expansion of information-technology.                              {time}  1300  I find it distressing today that we are forced to bring people in from outside of the United States to fill the employment needs of our IT companies. The average annual wage of technology workers in the Silicon Valley is $72,000 a year.  Quite simply, our work force pool lacks the experience and knowledge to fill a lot of these high-paying jobs. We must begin to focus on this problem, and this IT bill does just that.  The businesses in my home State of California exported $105 billion in products in 1998. Twenty-eight percent of those exports were in the electrical and electronics realm alone.  Mr. Speaker, in 1999 California had the largest State economy with an estimated gross State product of over $1 trillion.  The importance of H.R. 2086 to California alone is enormous. This bill ensures the United States and California continue to lead the way in information technology way into the 21st century.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our future in the global economy, support the generation's participation and the information technology community.
