Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Rohrabacher-Brown amendment as someone who loves liberty and believes in free trade among free people.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to enter into the Record as part of this debate a wonderful article by Lawrence Kaplan in a recent edition of The New Republic where he talks about why trade will not bring democracy to China. He talks about the relationship between profit and freedom and looks at the long history of nation states, talks about foreign trade and the penetration of multinational corporations having no significant effect on the correlation between economic development and democracy.  Capitalism does not bring democracy. 100 years ago in Germany and Japan, 30 years ago in countries such as Argentina and Brazil, and today in places like Singapore and Malaysia, capitalist development has buttressed rather than undermined authoritarian regimes.  In none of these cautionary examples did the free market do the three things business people say it does: weaken the coercive power of the state, create a democratically minded middle class, or expose the populist to liberal ideas from abroad. It is not doing that in China either.  In fact, capitalism in the People's Republic of China, a Communist state, still operates within the confines of an arbitrary legal order and a party-controlled system where the emerging bourgeoisie consist overwhelmingly of state officials, their friends and their business partners. And who is benefiting from all of this? The authoritarian, repressive regimes that are imprisoning Catholic bishops, that are not allowing U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage to go back into that country, and the very same people who took our surveillance aircraft and held our troops all those weeks and now are asking us to pay for the time that they held American citizens on their territory.  Mr. Speaker, is something wrong with this picture?  Vote in support of the Rohrabacher-Brown resolution.  The May 1, 2001, report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom links the deterioration of rights to receipt of normal trade relations. ``China has concluded that trade trumps all.'' Torture of believers increased, the government confiscated and destroyed as many as 3,000 unregistered religious buildings, and has continued to interfere with the selection of religious leaders.  Since passage, persecution and execution have increased.              [From the New Republic, July 9 and 16, 2001]        Why Trade Won't Bring Democracy to China.--Trade Barrier                        (By Lawrence F. Kaplan)       On February 25, business professor and writer Li Shaomin      left his home in Hong Kong to visit a friend in the mainland      city of Shenzhen. His wife and nine-year-old daughter haven't      heard from him since. That's because, for four months now, Li      has been rotting in a Chinese prison, where he stands accused      of spying for Taiwan. Never mind that Li is an American      citizen. And never mind that the theme of his writings,      published in subversive organs like the U.S.-China Business      Council's China Business Review, is optimism about China's      investment climate. Li, it turns out, proved too optimistic      for his own good. In addition to rewarding foreign investors,      he believed that China's economic growth would create, as he      put it in a 1999 article, a ``rule-based governance system.''      But, as Li has since discovered, China's leaders have other      plans.       Will American officials ever make the same discovery? Like      Li, Washington's most influential commentators, politicians,      and China hands claim we can rely on the market to transform      China. According to this new orthodoxy, what counts is not      China's political choices but rather its economic      orientation, particularly its degree of integration into the      global economy. The cliche has had a narcotic effect on      President Bush, who, nearly every time he's asked about      China, suggests that trade will accomplish the broader aims      of American policy.       Bush hasn't revived Bill Clinton's recklessly ahistorical      claim that the United States can build ``peace through trade,      investment, and commerce.'' He has, however, latched onto      another of his predecessor's high-minded rationales for      selling Big Macs to Beijing--namely, that commerce will act,      in Clinton's words, as ``a force for change in China,      exposing China to our ideas and our ideals.'' In this      telling, capitalism isn't merely a necessary precondition for      democracy in China. It's a sufficient one. Or, as Bush puts      it, ``Trade freely with China, and time is on our side.'' As      Congress prepares to vote for the last time on renewing      China's normal trading relations (Beijing's impending entry      into the World Trade Organization will put an end to the      annual ritual), you'll be hearing the argument a lot: To      promote democracy, the United States needn't apply more      political pressure to China. All we need to do is more      business there.       Alas, the historical record isn't quite so clear. Tolerant      cultural traditions, British colonization, a strong civil      society, international pressure, American military occupation      and political influence--these are just a few of the      explanations scholars credit as the source of freedom in      various parts of the world. And even when economic conditions      do hasten the arrival of democracy, it's not always obvious      which ones. After all, if economic factors can be said to      account for democracy's most dramatic advance--the implosion      of the Soviet Union and its Communist satellites--surely the      most important factor was economic collapse.       And if not every democracy emerged through capitalism, it's      also true that not every capitalist economy has produced a      democratic government. One hundred years ago in Germany and      Japan, 30 years ago in countries such as Argentina and      Brazil, and today in places like Singapore and Malaysis,      capitalist development has buttressed, rather than      undermined, authoritarian regimes. And these models are      beginning to look a lot more like contemporary China than the      more optimistic cases cited by Beijing's American      enthusiasts. In none of these cautionary examples did the      free market do the three things businessmen say it always      does: weaken the coercive power of the state, create a      democratically minded middle class, or expose the populace to      liberal ideals from abroad. It isn't doing them in China      either.       One of the most important ways capitalism should foster      democracy is by diminishing the power of the state. Or, as      Milton Friedman put it in Capitalism and Freedom, ``[t]he      kind of economic organization that provides economic freedom      directly, namely, competitive capitalism, also promotes      political freedom because it separates economic power from      political power and in this way enables the one to offset the      other.'' In his own way, Bush makes the same point about      China: ``I believe a whiff of freedom in the marketplace will      cause there to be more demand for democracy.'' But the theory      isn't working so well in the People's Republic, whose brand      of capitalism isn't quite what Adam Smith had in mind.       China's market system derives, instead, from a pathological      model of economic development. Reeling from the economic      devastation of the Mao era, Deng Xiaoping and his fellow      party leaders in the late 1970s set China on a course toward      ``market socialism.'' The idea was essentially the same one      that guided the New Economic Policy in Soviet Russia 50 years      before: a mix of economic liberalization and political      repression, which would boost China's economy without      weakening the Communist Party. And so, while leaving the      party in control of China's political life, Deng junked many      of the economy's command mechanisms--granting state-owned      enterprises more autonomy, opening the country to limited      investment, and replacing aging commissars with a      semiprofessional bureaucracy. The recipe worked well: China      has racked up astronomical growth rates ever since. And      democracy seems as far away as ever.       The reason isn't simply that government repression keeps      economic freedom from yielding political freedom. It's that      China's brand of economic reform contains ingredients that      hinder--and were consciously devised to hinder--political      reform. The most obvious is that, just as the state retains a      monopoly on the levers of coercion, it also remains perched      atop the commanding heights of China's economy. True, China      has been gradually divesting itself of state-owned      enterprises, and the process should quicken once China enters      the World Trade Organization (WTO). But Beijing's leaders      have said they will continue to support China's most      competitive and critical industries. Taking a cue from      authoritarian South     Korea during the 1980s, China's leaders have proposed      sponsoring industrial conglomerates in crucial sectors of the      economy, transformed industrial ministries into ``general      associations,'' merged failing state-owned firms with more      successful ones, and established organizations to, as Chinese      economist Xue Muqiao has put it, ``serve as a bridge between      the state and the enterprises.''       But that's where any similarities with South Korea end.      Unlike South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan, which      evolved from authoritarianism (and did so, significantly, as      de facto protectorates of the United States), China even      today has no effective system of property rights--a signature      trait that distinguishes its Communist regime from      traditional authoritarian ones. The absence of a private-     property regime in China means that, at the end of the day,      the state controls nearly the entire edifice on which China's      ``free'' markets rest. It also means that China's brand of      capitalism blurs, rather than clarifies, the distinction      between the public and the private realms on which political      liberty depends. Nor is that the only requisite for democracy      that China's markets lack. As the imprisonment of Li Shaomin      and thousands of other political prisoners attests,      capitalism in the PRC still operates within the confines of      an arbitrary legal order and a party-controlled court system.      ``China is still a lawless environment,'' says University of      Pennsylvania sinologist Arthur Waldron. ``Whether in terms of      individual rights or the rights of entrepreneurs, interests      are protected not by institutions but by special      relationships with those in power.       Before he was arrested, Li diagnosed this condition as      ``relation-based capitalism.'' What he meant was that      relations with government officials, not property rights or      the rule of law, underpin the Chinese market. Because the      political foundations of China's economy remain the exclusive      property of the state, China's entrepreneurs operate with a      few degrees of separation, but without true autonomy, from      the government. Hence, capital, licenses, and contracts flow      to those with connections to officials and to their friends      and relatives, who, in turn, maintain close relations with,      and remain beholden to, the regime. Their firms operate, in      the words of Hong Kong-based China specialist David Zweig,      ``[l]ike barnacles on ships, . . . draw[ing] their sustenance      from their parastatal relationships with the ministries from      which they were spun off.''       Helping to keep all these distortions in place are Deng's      functionaries, who now constitute the world's largest      bureaucracy and still control the everyday levers of the      Chinese economy. Today, they function as the engines and      administrators of a market increasingly driven by skimming      off the top. The foreign-trade sector offers particularly      easy pickings. In 1995, for instance, the World Bank found      that while China's nominal tariff rate was 32 percent, only a      6 percent rate was officially collected. Presumably, much of      the difference went into the pockets of Chinese officials.      And even though WTO accession will reduce opportunities for      rent seeking from inflated trade tariffs, China's bureaucracy      will be able to continue siphoning funds from distorted      interest rates, the foreign exchange markets, and virtually      any business transaction that requires its involvement--which      is to say, nearly every business transaction. Nor is the      problem merely the corrupting influence these bureaucrats      wield over China's markets. The larger problem is that,      whereas in the United States the private sector wields      enormous influence over the political class, in China the      reverse is true.       For precisely this reason, Washington's celebrations of the      democratic potential of the new Chinese ``middle class'' may      be premature ``Entrepreneurs, once condemned as `counter      revolutionaries,' are now the instruments of reform. . . .      [T]his middle class will eventually demand broad acceptance      of democratic values,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay      insisted last year. Reading from the same script, President      Bush declares that trade with China will ``help an      entrepreneurial class and a freedom-loving class grow and      burgeon and become viable,'' Neither DeLay nor Bush, needless      to say, invented the theory that middle classes have nothing      to lose but their chains. In the first serious attempt to      subject the ties between economic and political      liberalization to empirical scrutiny, Seymour Martin Lipset      published a study in 1959, Some Social Requisites of      Democracy, which found that economic development led to,      among other things, higher levels of income equality,      education and, most important, the emergence of a socially      moderate middle class--all factors that promote      democratization. More recent studies have found that rising      incomes also tend to correlate with participation in      voluntary organizations and other institutions of ``civil      society,'' which further weakens the coercive power of the      state.       But middle classes aren't always socially moderate, and      they don't always oppose the state. Under certain conditions      late modernizing economies breed middle classes that actively      oppose political change. In each of these cases, a strong      state, not the market, dictates the terms of economic      modernization. And, in each case, an emerging entrepreneurial      class too weak to govern on its own allies itself--     economically and, more importantly, politically--with a      reactionary government and against threats to the established      order. In his now-classic study Social Origins of      Dictatorship and Democracy, sociologist Barrington Moore      famously revealed that, in these ``revolutions from above,''      capitalist transformations weakened rather than strengthened      liberalism. In the case of nineteenth-century Japan Moore      writes that the aim of those in power was to ``preserve as      much as possible of the advantages the rule class had enjoyed      under the ancient regime, cutting away just enough . . . to      preserve the state, since they would otherwise lose      everything.'' Japan's rulers could do this only with the aid      of a commercial class, which eagerly complied, exchanging its      political aspirations for profits. On this point, at least      Marx and Engels had things right. Describing the 1848      revolution in Germany, they traced its failure partly to the      fact that, at the end of the day, entrepreneurs threw their      support not behind the liberal insurrectionists but behind      the state that was the source of their enrichment.       Much the same process is unfolding in China, where economic      and political power remain deeply entwined. In fact, China's      case is even more worrisome than its historical antecedents.      In Germany and Japan, after all, an entrepreneurial class      predated the state's modernization efforts, enjoyed property      rights, and, as a result, possessed at least some autonomous      identity. In China, which killed off its commercial class in      the 1950s, the state had to create a new one. Thus China's      emerging bourgeoisie consists overwhelmingly of state      officials, their friends and business partners, and--to the      extent they climbed the economic ladder independently--     entrepreneurs who rely on connections with the official      bureaucracy for their livelihoods. ``It is improbable, to say      the least,'' historian Maurice Meisner writes in The Deng      Xiaoping Era: An Inquiry Into the Fate of Chinese Socialism,      ``that a bourgeoisie whose economic fortunes are so dependent      on the political fortunes of the Communist state is likely to      mount a serious challenge to the authority of the state . . .      the members of China's new bourgeoisie emerge more as agents      of the state than as potential antagonists.''       A steady diet of chauvinistic nationalism hasn't helped. In      the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre, party leaders      launched a ``patriotism'' campaign, a sentiment they defined      as ``loving the state'' as well as the Communist Party. As      the Shanghai-based scholar and party apologist Xiao Gongqin      explains, ``[T]he overriding issue of China's modernization      is how, under new historical circumstances, to find new      resources of legitimacy so as to achieve social and moral      integration in the process of social transition.'' To Xiao      and others like him, the answer is nationalism. And, as      anyone who turned on a television during the recent EP-3      episode may have noticed, it's working. Indeed, independent      opinion polling conducted by the Public Opinion Research      Institute of People's University (in association with Western      researchers, who published their findings in 1997), indicate      greater public support for China's Communist regime than      similar surveys found a decade earlier. And, contrary to what      development theory might suggest, the new nationalism appears      to have infected the middle class--particularly university      students and intellectuals--more acutely than it has China's      workers and farmers. ``The [closeness of the] relationship      between the party and intellectuals is as bad as in the      Cultural Revolution,'' a former official in the party's      propaganda arm noted in 1997. Even many of China's exiled      dissidents have fallen under its spell.       In addition to being independent of the regime and      predisposed toward liberal values, China's commercial class      is supposed to be busily erecting an independent civil      society. But, just as China's Communist system restricts      private property, it prohibits independent churches and labor      unions, truly autonomous social organizations, and any other      civic institutions that might plausibly compete with the      state. Indeed, China's leaders seem to have read Robert      Putnam's Bowling Alone and the rest of the civil-society      canon--and decided to do exactly the reverse of what the      literature recommends. ``Peasants will establish peasants'      organizations as well, then China will become another      Poland,'' senior party official Yao Yilin reportedly warned      during the Tiananmen protests. To make sure this fear never      comes true, China's leaders have dealt with any hint of an      emerging civil society in one of two ways: repression or co-     optation. Some forbidden organizations--such as Falun Gong,      the Roman Catholic church, independent labor unions, and      organizations associated with the 1989 democracy movement--     find their members routinely imprisoned and tortured. Others,      such as the Association of Urban Unemployed, are merely      monitored and harassed. And as for the officially sanctioned      organizations that impress so many Western observers, they      mostly constitute a Potemkin facade. ``[A]lmost every      ostensibly independent organization--institutes, foundations,      consultancies--is linked into the party-state network,'' says      Columbia University sinologist Andrew Nathan. Hence, Beijings      Ministry of Civil Affairs monitors even sports clubs and      business associations and requires all such groups to      register with the government.       The same kind of misreading often characterizes      celebrations of rural China's ``village committees,'' whose      democratic potential the engagement lobby routinely touts.      Business Week discerns in them evidence ``of the grassroots      democracy beginning to take hold in China.'' But that's not      quite right. China's leaders restrict committee elections to      the countryside and, even there, to the most     local level. Nor, having been legally sanctioned 14 years      ago, do they constitute a recent development. More important,      China's leaders don't see the elections the way their      American interpreters do. In proposing them, says Jude      Howell, co-author of In Search of Civil Society: Market      Reform and Social Change in Contemporary China, party elites      argued that elected village leaders ``would find it easier to      implement central government policy and in particular      persuade villagers to deliver grain and taxes and abide by      family planning policy. Village self-governance would thus      foster social stability and order and facilitate the      implementation of national policy. By recruiting newly      elected popular and entrepreneurial village leaders, the      Party could strengthen its roots at the grassroots level and      bolster its legitimacy in the eyes of rural residents.''      Which is exactly what it has done. In races for village      committee chairs, the Ministry of Civil Affairs allows only      two candidates to stand for office, and until recently many      townships nominated only one. Local party secretaries and      officials often push their favored choice, and most committee      members are also members of the Communist Party, to which      they remain accountable. Should a nonparty member be elected,      he must accept the guidance of the Communist Party, which, in      any case, immediately sets about recruiting him. As for those      rare committee members who challenge local party officials,      their success may be gleaned from the fate of elected      committee members from a village in Shandong province who in      1999 accused a local party secretary of corruption. All were      promptly arrested.       Still, the very fact that China's leaders feel compelled to      bolster their legitimacy in the countryside is telling. Last      month Beijing took the unusual step of releasing a report,      ``Studies of Contradictions Within the People Under New      Conditions'' which detailed a catalogue of ``collective      protests and group incidents.'' What the report makes clear      is that Beijing's leaders think China's growing pool of      overtaxed farmers and unemployed workers, more than its newly      moneyed elite could become a threat to the regime.      Fortunately for the authorities, with no political opposition      to channel labor unrest into a coherent movement, protests      tend to be narrow in purpose and poorly coordinated. And the      wheels of repression have already begun to grind, with      Beijing launching ``strike hard'' campaign to quell any      trouble. In any case, what these formerly state-employed      workers have been demonstrating for is not less communism,      but more--a return to the salad days of central planning.       Which brings us to the final tenent of the engagement      lobby: that commerce exposes China to the ideals of its      trading partners, particularly those of the United States. As      House Majority Leader Dick Armey has put it, ``Freedom to      trade is the great subversive and liberating force in human      history.'' Or, as Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy      Berger burbled in 1997, ``The fellow travelers of the new      global economy--computers and modems, faxes and photocopiers,      increased contacts and binding contacts--carry with them the      seeds of change.'' But the Chinese disagree. To begin with,      they don't import much. And economists predict that won't      change dramatically once they've joined the WTO, since      China's leaders have committed themselves to the kind of      export-oriented, merchantilist growth model that South Korea,      Japan, and Taiwan pursued in decades past. Last year, for      instance, China exported $100 billion in goods and services      to the United States and only imported $16 billion worth.      Hence, for every six modems it sent to America, Sandy Berger      sent back only one.       To be sure, that one modem may carry with it seeds of      change. Bush, for instance, says, ``If the Internet were to      take hold in China, freedom's genie will be out of the      bottle.'' Alas, through links to Chinese service providers,      Beijing tightly controls all access to the Web. and Western      investors in China's information networks have eagerly      pitched in. One Chinese Internet portal, bankrolled by Intel      and Goldman Sachs, greets users with a helpful reminder to      avoid ``topics which damage the reputation of the state'' and      warns that it will be ``obliged to report you to the Public      Security Bureau'' if you don't. But Goldman Sachs needn't      worry. If anything, China's recent experience lends credence      to the pessimistic theories of an earlier era, which held      that nations shape the uses of technology rather than the      other way around. Thus Beijing blocks access to damaging      ``topics'' and to Western news sources like The New York      Times, The Washington Post, and this magazine. It also      monitors e-mail exchanges and has arrested Internet users who      have tried to elude state restrictions. And, in ways that      would make Joseph Goebbels blush, the government uses      websites--and, of course, television, newspapers, and radio--     to dominate the circuits with its own propaganda. ``Much as      many people might like to think the Internet is part of a      bottom-up explosion of individualism in China, it is not,''      writes Peter Lovelock, a Hong Kong-based academic who studies      the Internet's effect in the PRC. Instead, it provides ``an      extraordinarily beneficial tool in the administration of      China.'' And that tool was on vivid display during the EP-3      crisis, when China blocked access to Western news sources and      censored chat rooms.       American politicians describe foreign direct investment,      too, as a potent agent of democratization. But, in this case,      they're not even paraphrasing political science literature      they haven't read, because the literature makes no such      claim. In fact, a 1983 study by the University of North      Carolina's Kenneth Bollen found that levels of foreign trade      concentration and penetration by multinational corporations      have no significant effect on the correlation between      economic development and democracy. In China's case, it's      easy to understand why. Beijing requires foreign investors in      may industries to cooperate in joint ventures with Chinese      partners, most of whom enjoy close ties to the government.      These firms remain insulated mainly in three coastal enclaves      and in ``special economic zones'' set apart from the larger      Chinese economy. Moreover, they export a majority of their      goods--which is to say, they send most of their ``seeds of      change'' abroad. At the same time, their capital largely      substitutes for domestic capital (foreign-owned firms      generate half of all Chinese exports), providing a much-     needed blood transfusion for China's rulers, who use it to      accumulate reserves of hard currency, meet social welfare      obligation, and otherwise strengthen their rule. Nor is it      clear that U.S. companies even want China to change. If      anything, growing levels of U.S. investment have created an      American interest in maintaining China's status quo. Hence,      far from criticizing China's rulers, Western captains of      industry routinely parade through Beijing singing the praises      of the Communist regime (and often inveighing against its      detractors), while they admonish America's leaders to take no      action that might upset the exquisite sensibilities of      China's politburo Business first, democracy later.       But ultimately the best measure of whether economic ties to      the West have contributed to democratization may be gleaned      from China's human rights record. Colin Powell insists,      ``Trade with China is not only good economic policy; it is      good human rights policy.'' Yet, rather than improve that      record, the rapid expansion of China's trade ties to the      outside world over the past decade has coincided with a      worsening of political repression at home. Beijing launched      its latest crackdown on dissent in 1999, and it continues to      this day. The government has tortured, ``reeducated through      labor,'' and otherwise persecuted thousands of people for      times no greater than practicing breathing exercises,      peacefully championing reforms, and exercising freedom of      expression, association, or worship. It has arrested Chinese-     American scholars like Li Shaominn on trumped-up charges,      closed down newspapers, and intimidated and threatened      dissidents. Nor is it true that linking trade and human      rights will necessarily prove counterproductive. When      Congress approved trade sanctions against Beijing in the      aftermath of Tiananmen, China's leaders responded by      releasing more than 800 political prisoner, lifting martial      law in Beijing, entering into talks with the United States,      and even debating among themselves the proper role of human      rights. As soon as American pressure eased, so did China's      reciprocal gestures.       Turning a blind eye to Beijing's depredations may make      economic sense. But to pretend we can democratize China by      means of economics is, finally, a self-serving conceit.      Democracy is a political choice, an act of will. Someone, not      something, must create it. Often that someone is a single      leader--a Mikhail Gorbachev, a King Juna Carlos, or a Vaclav      Havel. But such a man won't be found in China's current      leadership. Other times, the pressure for democracy comes      from a political opposition--the African National Congress in      South Africa, Solidarity in Poland, or the marchers in      Tiananmen Square. But there are no more marchers in Tiananmen      Square.       Pressure for democratization, however, can also come from      abroad. And usually it comes from the United States or from      nowhere at all. During the 1980s America applied diplomatic      and economic pressure to repressive regimes from Poland to      South Africa; intervened to prevent military coups in the      Philippines, Peru, El Salvador, Honduras, and Bolivia; and      loudly enshrined human rights and democracy in official      policy. The United States played a pivotal and direct role in      democratizing even countries like South Korea and Taiwan,      which many China-engagers now tout as evidence that the      market alone creates political freedom. Appropriately enough,      the decade closed with democracy activists erecting a      facsimile of the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.       The commercialist view of China, by contrast, rests on no      historical foundation; it is a libertarian fantasy. ``The      linkage between development and rights is too loose, the      threshold too high, the time frame too long, and the results      too uncertain to make economic engagement a substitute for      direct policy intervention,'' writes Columbia's Nathan. Yet      make it a substitute is precisely what the United States has      done. And, far from creating democracy, this subordination of      political principle has created the justified impression of      American hypocrisy and, worse, given U.S. policymakers an      excuse to do nothing.       Maybe the claim that we can bring liberty to China by      chasing its markets will prove valid in the long run. But      exactly how long is the long run? A political scientist at      Stanford University says it ends in 2015, when, he predicts,      China will be transformed into a democracy. Others say China      will democratize before that. Still others say it may take a      half-century or more. The answer matters. After all, while      capitalist Germany and Japan eventually became democracies,      it     wasn't capitalism that democratized them, and it certainly      wasn't worth the wait. In China's case, too, no on really      knows what might happen as we wait for politics to catch up      with economies. With the exception, perhaps, of Li Shaomin,      who tested the link between economic and political      liberalization in China for himself. He's still in jail.
