Speaker, I rise today to mark the opening of the 14th annual congressional high school arts exhibition, entitled ``An Artistic Discovery.'' This competition, which is held in congressional districts throughout the country, with the winning entry being displayed in the U.S. Capitol, is designed to recognize the creative talents of young Americans.  This event is an inspiration to many young artists, Mr. Speaker. I recently received a letter from the parents of Dan Sutherland, the winner of the arts competition in the Fifth Congressional District of Maryland in 1984. In this letter, which I would like to share with my colleagues, Ann and Doug Sutherland of Greenbelt write:       Our son Dan was your district's selection in 1984. This      recognition from outside his realm of family, friends, and      school helped give him the assurance to decide to pursue art      as a career. He won art scholarships as an undergraduate at      James Madison University and as a graduate student at      Syracuse University. Dan moved to Texas with his wife, and      began as an adjunct instructor at the University of Texas,      Austin. This month (May, 1995) Dan was selected from among      400 applicants for a teaching and painting/drawing position      on the University of Texas faculty.       Encouragement from this type of competition is important,      particularly in a field like art where so many people tell      youngsters, ``You can't make a living in art.'' Be assured      that this program and your contribution to it was an      important stepping stone in our son's evolving career as an      artist.  Mr. Speaker, the artistic heritage of our country is dependent upon our young artists and I would like to congratulate this year's arts competition winners from the Fifth Congressional District: First place--Rina Wiedenhoeft, a student at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, for her winning watercolor entry entitled, ``Self-portrait.''  Second place (tie)--Erik Minter, a student at Thomas Stone High School in Waldorf, for his oil painting entitled, ``Mason Dixon Door,'' and Alicia Pirner of Northern High School in Calvert County for her colored pencil drawing entitled, ``Mediterranean Villa.''  Third place (tie)--Greg Paterno, a student at Leonardtown High School for his acrylic painting of football players in action entitled, ``4th and 1;'' and Khalise Holmes of Laurel High School in Prince Georges County for a linoleum block print entitled, ``Still Life With Flowers.''  I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting these talented individuals. These young artists enrich our cultural traditions, and through this competition we continue to encourage their creative energies.                          ____________________
