President, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which receives 25 percent of its budget from the U.S., has used U.S. taxpayer money in turn to encourage and support higher taxes on the U.S. taxpayer, in addition to its support of U.N. global tax schemes.  The OECD has endorsed and encouraged higher taxes, new taxes, and global taxes no fewer than 24 times in reports with titles such as ``Towards Global Tax Cooperation,'' in which the OECD identifies 35 nations guilty of ``harmful tax competition.''  They have advocated that the U.S. adopt a costly and bureaucratic value added tax, a 40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a fertilizer tax, ending the deductibility of State and local taxes from Federal taxes, new taxes at the State level, and a host of other new and innovative taxes on U.S. citizens.  It is not only the recommending of higher taxes which concerns us; the ultimate concern is the movement towards undermining U.S. sovereignty. Ecogroups such as the Friends of the Earth want the OECD to declare that dam-building for flood control and electronic power is unacceptable as ``sustainable energy.'' In May, 2005 the OECD ministers endorsed a proposal at the U.N. to create a system of global taxes.  The OECD has stated explicitly that low-tax policies ``unfairly erode the tax bases of other countries and distort the location of capital and services.'' What we have here are Paris-based bureaucrats seeking to protect high-tax welfare states from the free market.  That is why the OECD goes on to say that free-market tax competition ``may hamper the application of progressive tax rates and the achievement of redistributive goals.'' Clearly, free market tax competition makes it harder to implement socialistic welfare states. The free market evidently hasn't been fair to socialistic welfare states. Well, it's a good thing that they have the OECD and nearly $100 million in U.S. taxpayer money to protect them.  Noted economist Walter Williams clearly sees the direction in which this is headed when he says that ``the bottom line agenda for the OECD is to establish a tax cartel where nations get together and collude on taxes.'' Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill seconded that when he said that he was ``troubled by the underlying premise that low tax rates are somehow suspect and by the notion that any country should interfere in any other country's'' tax policy. And John Bolton argues that the OECD's approach ``represents a kind of worldwide centralization of governments and interest groups.'' Who do you think bears the costs for all this? Mr. Bolton answers and you probably guessed it--the United States.  America's proud history of independence was driven in no small part by the desire for sovereignty over taxation powers. In this context, it makes no sense to relegate our sovereignty over tax policy, in any way, to international bureaucrats.  It is very simple. U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund a bunch of international bureaucrats who write, speak, organize, and advocate in support of higher taxes, global taxes, and the gradual erosion of American sovereignty over its domestic fiscal policies. I think that most Americans would be outraged to learn that they are forced to subsidize these types of activities with their tax dollars. I think that they shouldn't have to any longer. That's why I am introducing legislation today to remove the United State's contributions to the OECD.
