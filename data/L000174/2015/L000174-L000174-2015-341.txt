President, for generations, Vermonters have contributed to the global culture of winter sports. Whether the sport is snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling orsnowboarding, Vermonters never pass up an opportunity to claim the first run of the day.  Almost four decades ago, Jake Burton's passion for winter sports led to the creation of Burton Snowboards, one of the leading snowboard manufacturers in the world. Jake at a young age enjoyed ``snurfing''--surfing on snow--but he never anticipated the path he would eventually take, becoming one of the pioneers in snowboard manufacturing.  In the late 1970s, Jake started exploring the idea of manufacturing snowboards, building prototypes from a barn in Londonderry, VT. At the time, most ski resorts did not allow snowboarders, as snowboarding was not yet considered a sport, and gaining recognition as a sport proved to be harder than one might expect. Jake didn't let his optimism or passion wane, and interest in the fledgling sport finally spread. Jake and his wife Donna explored the European market, eventually opening a distribution center in Austria, while maintaining their national headquarters in Burlington, VT. For a little-known sport, it quickly gained international notoriety and stature. In 1998, snowboarding debuted at the winter Olympics in Nagano.  Jake is now one of the most successful business leaders Vermont has ever known. His commitment and passion allow him to remain one with the pulse of his company, with consumers, and, most of all, with the sport, on a level unique to Burton Snowboards.  The Wall Street Journal recently chronicled the multiple ways in which Jake keeps himself healthy, in shape, and on the slopes. Jake's lifestyle is one that truly speaks to the Vermont spirit. Marcelle and I are proud to have Jake and Donna as friends.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article from The Wall Street Journal.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 22, 2014]    Jake Burton, Snowboard King, Sets Multiple Goals for His Workout                            (By Jen Murphy)       The founder and chairman of Burton Snowboards, finds      multiple ways to keep his lower body in shape for      snowboarding and surfing.       Jake Burton sets an annual goal of snowboarding 100 days a      year. A snowboard pioneer, and founder and chairman of Burton      Snowboards Inc. in Burlington, Vt., has hit that goal nearly      every year during the past 19 years, with the exception of      2011, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Mr.      Burton went through three months of chemotherapy. In January      2012, his doctors gave him a cancer-free bill of health and      he slowly began regaining his strength in the pool and at the      gym. Today, at age 60, he is charging harder than ever on the      mountain.       ``I got in 114 days this season,'' he says. And when the      snow is gone, he takes to the ocean for his other obsession,      surfing.       Mr. Burton relies on four regular activities--hiking, yoga,      swimming, and biking--to keep him fit enough to snowboard and      surf. He thinks of his workouts on a point system, awarding      himself one point per workout, with 10 being his target each      week. ``I usually manage six.'' Some days he tries to double      up on workouts by mixing business with an activity. He might      bike with a colleague and discuss new snowboard gear.       Mr. Burton includes his family in as many activities as      possible. He and his wife, Donna Carpenter, who is president      of Burton Snowboards, have trails within minutes of their      Vermont home in Stowe. They often set out together on hikes,      but ``hiking with Jake is a solo sport,'' jokes Ms.      Carpenter. ``He recently had a minor knee surgery and still      beat me up the mountain.''       He takes about six surf trips a year. This year he brought      his three sons, ages 18, 21, and 25, on a surf trip to the      Maldives. Recently, he and his wife started booking bike      tours when they visit cities such as Florence and Paris.                              The Workout       Hiking is Mr. Burton's main form of cardio. ``I have to      keep it up to keep my weight in check,'' he says. One of his      favorite hikes is up the Pinnacle Trail, which is 10 minutes      from his home. It takes him about 50 minutes to hike up and      another 50 minutes to hike down. He will also drive to Mount      Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak, and hike the Long Trail,      which is nearly 5 miles round trip. Mr. Burton always takes a      watch when he hikes. ``My watch is like a heart rate monitor.      The times tell me how hard I'm working,'' he says.       In the winter he often hikes up the mountain with his dogs      and snowboards down four or five times before the ski resort      is officially open. Bigger trips, most recently to Japan,      allow him to have full days snowboarding in the backcountry.       While attending New York University, he was the captain of      the swim team and he continues to get in the pool every other      day when he is home. He swims intervals, warming up with 800      meters and then doing a few intervals of 500 meters and 50-     meter intervals for speed.       Two days a week, Mr. Burton uses weight machines at the      Swimming Hole, a nonprofit pool and gym facility in Stowe      that he and his wife helped fund. He does an all-body workout      with a focus on legs. ``The stronger my legs, the better my      snowboarding,'' he says. He says he used to lift more but      scaled back when he began practicing yoga. ``I might not be      as strong as I once was but I feel better doing yoga,'' he      says. ``It makes surfing easier and every day things easier,      like standing on one leg when you're drying your feet after      you get out of the shower.''       He takes a private Ashtanga-style yoga lesson in his home      once a week.                                The Diet       Mr. Burton is pescetarian and tries to eat mostly organic.      He and his wife hire someone to help prepare meals, which are      left in the fridge. ``We're spoiled,'' he says. In the      morning Mr. Burton has a smoothie made from frozen mangos and      frozen peaches or frozen berries and bananas. Lunch might be      vegetable soup and an avocado and tomato sandwich with a tiny      bit of mayo on whole wheat bread. They might have a squash      soup with some cheese or lentils and a salad with avocado.      ``I average more than two avocados a day,'' he says. His      wife's vegetable garden provides many of the ingredients that      go into meals. They freeze vegetables to use during the      winter. His splurge is pizza.                                The Gear       Mr. Burton estimates he has about 30 different snowboards      at home. His favorites are the Burton Namedropper (retail      $419.95) and the Burton Barracuda (retail $519.95). Right now      he is riding with Burton EST Genesis bindings (retail      $329.95) and wearing Burton Ion leather boots (retail      $499.95). Mr. Burton likes to hike in Adidas trail running      sneakers. In 2006, Burton purchased Channel Islands      Surfboards and Mr. Burton is constantly trying out new      boards. He has recently been riding the Average Joe short      board (retail about $1,500) and a Waterhog longboard (retail      $765) from Channel Islands.                              The Playlist       ``I'm hooked on hip hop,'' he says. ``It drives Donna nuts      so I try not to listen to it at home but I'll put on my      headphones when I hike. The music is so clean and raw. It      really motivates me.'' He says he'll listen to the classics      from Biggie [The Notorious B.I.G.], Tupac, and 2 Chainz or      he'll put on the hip-hop channel on Sirius XM Radio. ``I also      love classic rock so much that my kids now like it.''                          ____________________
