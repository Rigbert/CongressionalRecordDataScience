President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of an outstanding young woman. On October 8, 2003, Jennifer Jacques of Chelsea, VT, received an award from the Vision, Strength and Artistic Expression Arts Program's national contest for students with disabilities: Roadtrip: A Journey of Discovery. National recognition alone is deserving of applause and praise, but Jennifer's represents a very special and unique achievement that reaches far beyond her accomplishments in art.  Born with severe cerebral palsy, Jennifer is confined to her wheelchair. Able to control only her head and neck, she controls her wheelchair and computer, as well as her communication device, through a switch placed under her chin. A bright young woman of 18, Jennifer attends public school in Chelsea, where she is enrolled in classes with her peers.  Jennifer's art is not only a reflection of her talents, but also of her great ability to overcome the disabilities that have faced her. Working with her teachers and instructors, Jennifer directed the placement of paint on paper placed on the floor. By repeatedly driving her wheelchair over the paint, she was able to create textured paintings with striking color and design. Jennifer recently sold all of her abstract pieces that were displayed at an art show in Montpelier.  These accomplishments are a tribute to this exceptional young woman, her family and friends, her educators and instructors. Jennifer Jacques embodies what Vermont has done, what it can do, and what the future holds.                          ____________________
