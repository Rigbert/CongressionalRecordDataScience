Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  ``The right of suffrage is certainly one of the'' most ``fundamental articles of republican government, and ought not to be regulated by the legislature. A gradual abridgment of this right has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruins of popular forms.'' That was said by James Madison on August 7, 1787, to the Constitutional Convention; and the very proposal that is offered by opponents of this bill, a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to require that vacant House seats be filled by appointment, even temporarily, was explicitly rejected by the founders as antithetical to republican government.  My committee had a hearing in 2002 on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird). There was not very much support for it; and I imagine that when this House debates the Baird amendment, it will be voted down. It will go far short of the two-thirds necessary to propose a constitutional amendment because there are enough Members of this House that believe that the principle of having an elected House of Representatives is paramount.  I will get my colleague his vote and his debate for him with the cooperation of my friend from California, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, who is the cosponsor of my bill; but what I would like to know is those of my colleagues who criticize the Sensenbrenner-Dreier bill, what is their alternative if the constitutional amendment gets voted down? They have not stated what alternative they have, and that is why this bill is important.  On September 11, 2001, the fourth hijacked plane was headed for this building. If it had not been for the heroic actions of the passengers of United Flight 93 who forced the plane down over Pennsylvania, Congress' ability to function may have been severely disrupted. While the 17th amendment allows Governors immediately to appoint replacement Senators, currently there are no mechanisms to quickly replace House Members. However, we can act today to enact such a mechanism through the legislative process, just as the founders intended. The Continuity of Representation Act of 2004 will, unlike other proposals, preserve the people's constitutional right to elect directly their representatives.  The bill provides for the expedited special election of new Members to fill seats left vacant in extraordinary circumstances, which the bill defines as occurring when the Speaker announces that there are more than 100 vacancies in the representation from the States. Within 10 days after such an announcement, the political parties of the States with House vacancies, as provided by State law, may nominate candidates to run in a special election to be held within 45 days.  While some may argue for the adoption of a constitutional amendment allowing the appointment of replacement House Members if a terrorist attack leaves large numbers of vacancies, such an amendment would destroy the uninterrupted tradition that only Members duly and directly elected by their local constituents should serve in the House, while ignoring the current mechanism for preserving continuity in government, the founders, in their wisdom, included in the Constitution and which is the basis for this bill.  Madison used the strongest terms when stating the House must be composed of only those elected by the people. Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers that direct elections are ``unquestionably the only policy'' by which the House can have ``an intimate sympathy with the people.''  The House, uniquely among all branches and bodies of the entire Federal Government, is rooted in democratic principles, and those principlesmust be preserved at all costs. Current Federal law allows the Presidency and the Senate to consist entirely of the unelected. Without an elected House, the entire Federal Government would be run without a single branch reflecting the popular will. Think about it. If we have an appointed House and an appointed Senate and an appointed President, our democracy will end up being run by appointed people. That is not what James Madison and the others who were in that convention envisioned ever happening.  Congress has the clear constitutional authority to enact H.R. 2844 under article I, section 4, of the Constitution, which states that ``the Congress may at any time by law make or alter'' State election laws. Consistent with the right to chosen representation, the founders explicitly considered Congress' power to require expedited special elections the solution to potential discontinuity in government in extraordinary situations. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, the Constitution gives the Congress ``a right to interpose'' its special election rules on the States ``whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its safety.'' The Supreme Court has unanimously approved such clear-cut constitutional authority.  While some take a pessimistic view of the resiliency of the electoral process following an attack on the Nation's Capitol, I have a different view.  In England during the Second World War, many members of the House of Commons were killed in battle. Our friends across the Atlantic never devolved to appointed rule, and special elections were held within 42 days after the date of death to fill the vast majority of seats left vacant, even when the Nazis were bombing England during the Blitz. I have no doubt that here today in the United States the boundless spirit of the American people will ensure that democracy prevails in the most pressing conditions. Just as the recovery of the Pentagon and the World Trade Center sites were accomplished far quicker than imagined, I have the greatest confidence in the people of this great country that State and local election authorities would expeditiously work to restore the people's House in time of emergency.  R. Doug Lewis, executive director of the Elections Center, a nonpartisan organization representing the Nation's election officials, has testified that elections administrators from combined responses nationwide feel that they can conduct an election in as few as 45 days. While others assert that it would be too burdensome for special elections to be required within 45 days of a catastrophic attack, 10 States, as the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out, already require special elections within 45 days in normal, nonemergency situations. Vacancies in the Virginia General Assembly during the session have been filled in as few as 12 days after the vacancy has occurred, and no one has complained that those elections were unfair or unrepresentative.  One does not have to look far for examples of the resiliency of the voting process and our State and local election officials' dedication to the cause of democracy. Take, for example, last year's gubernatorial recall election in California that involved 135 candidates and an election that was certified 54 days after the certificate was issued. Voters were also asked to consider two constitutional amendment propositions. The election proceeded smoothly amidst unprecedentedly high voter turnout and 10,000 fewer polling places in the State of California than normal.  While some imagine horrific scenarios regarding catastrophic attacks on the Capitol, more inspiring scenarios can be imagined that resonate more closely with the American spirit. Should such a terrible situation occur, millions of people around the country might fill schools and gymnasiums, churches and meeting halls and freely exercise, in the wake of a vigorous attack by haters of freedom and democracy, their right to directly chosen representation, a right that has served uninterrupted in the history of our country.                              {time}  1345  Indeed, while some argue that adopting an amendment to the Constitution authorizing appointed Members is necessary in the light of a potential terrorist attack, the very adoption of such an amendment itself would accomplish what no terrorist could ever do, namely striking a fatal blow to what otherwise has been called the people's House. H.R. 2844, on the other hand, is founded on clear, existing constitutional authority that preserves the vital, time-tested constitutional value of directly elected representation that has made this country the most successful experiment in representative government the world has ever known.  The issue here in this debate has been if there is a catastrophe whether this House should stay elected or whether we should amend the Constitution to allow successors to be appointed in some manner or another. It is vitally important that in a time of crisis, whomever enters the doors to the Chambers where the House of Representatives meet enters the door with a mandate from the people, because if an appointed representative enters this door, the mandate would come from whomever appointed them.  Pass the bill. Do the right thing.
