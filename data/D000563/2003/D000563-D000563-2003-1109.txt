President, I conclude briefly by saying there are many people in this world who do not understand the United States of America. There are many people in this world who hate the United States of America. They do not understand who we are. They do not understand our values.  Tonight, the Senate, with this small effort, is trying to say to the world that we care, we are part of this global community that wants to make this a better Earth, better for everyone to live on. I hope that some who judge us will judge us by what we have done tonight.  I express my gratitude to all the Senators who have joined me in this effort, particularly Senator DeWine, in passing this important amendment. I urge adoption of the amendment.
