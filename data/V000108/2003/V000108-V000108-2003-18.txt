Chairman, I would to add my remarks to the chairman's, and I pointed out in full committee when we marked this bill up, and, again, it is not a failure of the subcommittee that the high-priority Operation and Maintenance budget for the Corps during the current fiscal year is $884 million behind. For this coming fiscal year that is going to climb to $1 billion. Additionally, non-high-priority Operation and Maintenance backlog is $1.9 billion and more clearly has to be done, and we will do our best in conference.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank both the gentleman for their efforts, and I will do all I can to support those enhancements.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
