There has been a lot of discussion in the Senate about the fact there is no exception for gun dealers who sell their guns to people who turn out to be on the FBI's Most Wanted list or those who may be involved in terrorism.  As the Senator from Rhode Island is undoubtedly aware, immediately after September 11, we raided one of the al-Qaida headquarters in Afghanistan and discovered one of their training manuals in which they gave advice to terrorists coming to the United States about buying their firearms in the United States because it was easy to buy a gun in this country.  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, when it comes to the exceptions in this bill, is there any exception such as the one suggested by Senator Kennedy that would put gun dealers on notice not to sell guns to people who are on the FBI's Most Wanted list so that we would say, you cannot get off the hook and be held, that you are not liable, not responsible for wrongdoing with a weapon if you did not take the time to check the FBI's Most Wanted list when you made that sale.
