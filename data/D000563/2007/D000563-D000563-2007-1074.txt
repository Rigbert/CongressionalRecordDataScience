President, this debate is long overdue. It is time for us to let them know we are coming home. It is time for them to understand in Iraq that they have received more from the United States than any nation should ever ask or hope for. We have offered up our best and bravest men in uniform. We have brought home those broken in body and spirit and said we will stand by them the rest of their lives, knowing in the process the sacrifices that have been made by them and their families.  We have spent $500 billion, which might have been spent in this country for a lot of things we desperately need--health care, paying for No Child Left Behind, medical research, basic investments in this country's future. We have given up on them because we had to spend the money in Iraq, and we continue to.  When it comes to this bill, which we hope to send to the President, he has already dismissed it with a wave of the hand. I am going to veto this bill, he says. Well, he is going to be vetoing a bill which is critically important. It is important to tell the Iraqis they have to accept responsibility for their own future. It is important because it adds billions of dollars for medical care for our veterans, billions of dollars we need so we don't face that shameful situation at Walter Reed that was reported a few weeks ago, billions of dollars so our veterans hospitals can truly take care of these soldiers who are coming home with injuries that were unimaginable just years ago; a billion dollars for the National Guard to buy more equipment which has been destroyed or left behind in Iraq so they can keep America safe while they prepare for their next redeployment.
