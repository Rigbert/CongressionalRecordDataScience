Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to serve with the gentleman on the National Security Caucus, and the gentleman does an outstanding job in that. I am going to join the gentleman and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the chairman of the committee in the effort he speaks of, but I believe we ought to perceive this on a bipartisan basis.  I will be speaking about what I think the President's role has been and what Congress' role has been, both parties, in terms of under funding our defense. We have not passed bills that were adequate to the task. The President has not vetoed any bills. We simply have not passed them. I want to work with the gentleman, and I appreciate his comments.
