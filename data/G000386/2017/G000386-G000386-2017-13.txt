 President, I have been doing oversight of the executive branch for a very long time. I have done it as ranking member, I have done it as chairman, I have done it when my party held the White House, and I have done it when the other party held the White House.  Earlier this year, I stood up for the rights of my Democratic colleagues to do oversight of the Trump administration, even while they are in the minority. I did it because it was the right thing to do. Lots of people give lip service to the notion of bipartisan oversight, but very few actually practice it. It is tough. You have to be willing to work with colleagues in the other party to ask tough questions of your own political allies.  You can't just ask. If you actually want answers, you have to follow through. True bipartisan oversight is impossible unless it is a two-way street. If Democrats are unwilling to ask hard questions and force answers from their own political allies, then there is simply no way to move forward together in good faith. Both sides need to be committed to getting the whole story--not just the half they think helps their side. Regardless of whether my Democratic colleagues join me, I am interested in that whole story.  There are two major controversies plaguing the credibility of the Justice Department and the FBI right now. On the one hand, the Trump-Russia investigation, and then on the other hand, the handling of the Clinton investigation. Any congressional oversight related to either one of these topics is not credible without also examining the other.  Both cases were active during last year's campaign. Both cases have been linked to the firing of the FBI Director. I have been trying to explain this to my Democratic colleagues for months. The political reality is, half of the country thinks our law enforcement establishment gave Hillary Clinton and her aides a pass. These questions go to the heart of the integrity of our Federal law enforcement and justice system.  They are not going to go away just because Clinton lost the election. The independent inspector general at the Justice Department certainly isn't ignoring that issue. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have asked the inspector general to look into a host of issues involving the handling of the Clinton investigation during the campaign. His hard work has already uncovered some pretty disturbing information.  Over the past week, the press has reported that an FBI agent was removed from the special counsel's team and demoted at the FBI due to--what do you think--political bias. The agent was at the very center of both of these high-profile investigations. High-ranking FBI agent Peter Strzok reportedly used his work phone to send anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages to another FBI agent with whom he was having an illicit and immoral relationship.  This man was the Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. He worked on the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private server to conduct--what do you think--official business.  According to news reports and according to documents, it looks like he also helped draft Comey's controversial public statement ending that case of Hillary Clinton and emails. Specifically, he apparently edited out language that suggested legal jeopardy for Clinton. Press reports state he opened the FBI's investigation of allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. It has been reported that he was one of the two FBI agents who interviewed former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.  Can you imagine if the shoe were on the other foot? What if a high-ranking FBI official got caught expressing pro-Trump political bias on his work phone while leading what is supposed to be a professional, objective, and nonpartisan search for the truth? Why, of course, if that were happening, Democrats would go ballistic, and they would have every right to go ballistic.  This man held a crucial position of public trust, charged with protecting this country from counterintelligence threats. He was a key part of Director Comey's Clinton investigation and his Russia investigation. I have been saying for months that these two cases are forever linked. You cannot separate them.  The same people in the same agency handled both cases at the same time, and now a huge segment of the American people have no faith that these cases were treated, as they should be, impartially. I don't blame the American people.  It is interesting that before he was fired, FBI Director Comey lectured our Judiciary Committee and lectured the public about how the men and women of the FBI ``don't give a rip about politics.''  I believe that for most of the hard-working, rank-and-file FBI agents, that is absolutely true. Their jobs normally don't involve controversial political questions, and their own political views aren't relevant because they are professionals.  But no human is perfect, and no organization is immune from error. It does no good for the leaders of the FBI to pretend that its senior management is above all reproach, that they would never show any improper political bias, and that they would never make mistakes.  The only way to protect against bias or misconduct is to recognize that it exists and to confront it, not to hide it from Congress and the American people.  The law and the facts, whatever they are, should guide the work of the FBI and the Justice Department. If politics infected the Department's decisions during a hotly contested national political campaign, we would have to look at it. That is true whether it occurred in the Clinton case, or in the Trump-Russia case, or if it included both.  Anyone claiming to do bipartisan oversight of the executive branch has to examine both. Ignoring either half of this story simply will not be credible with the other half of the country.  Everyone thought Hillary Clinton was going to be President--everyone. The perception of a huge segment of the public is that the whole Washington establishment worked overtime to get her name cleared before the Democratic Convention last summer. The FBI even called its case ``Mid Year Exam.''  Director Comey testified that the former Attorney General refused even to name the FBI's work and investigation. That is how political it became. It was really the Attorney General who was at that time insisting on calling it not an investigation but ``a matter''--m-a-t-t-e-r--whatever that means.  We have learned that Director Comey started drafting his exoneration statement long before the investigation was done. It looks like there was a rush to clear her. It looks like the fix was in. I know Democrats don't want to hear that. They only want to talk about Trump.  There is a double standard here in the way they desperately want to go after the President but ignore all other potential wrongdoing in the previous administration. It stinks to high heaven.  But Democrats have visions of impeachment dancing in their heads. Rather than reserve judgment and carefully examine the facts--all of the facts--they are jumping to all sorts of conclusions.  The Judiciary Committee has an obligation to do a deep dive into the firing of James Comey and both of the two controversial political investigations that preceded it. Unfortunately, the Democrats are preventing any truly bipartisan path forward. They appear to be assuming the conclusion at the outset.  They complain publicly, and they complain privately that I am not doing enough to investigate ``obstruction of justice,'' but ``obstruction of justice'' is a legal term of art. It is a conclusion, not evidence. That is not how I conduct my investigations.  I do not make my conclusions first and try to shoehorn the facts to fit my conclusions. I try to get the facts and then go where those facts lead.  Let's consider examples of where investigations have uncovered facts that point to ``obstruction.''  Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon both lied to investigators. That is obstruction, and that behavior got one of them impeached and forced the other to resign.  We also recently learned that Hillary Clinton's lawyers used a program called BleachBit to delete 33,000 emails under subpoena by the House of Representatives.  Now, those government records--and they are government records--can never be recovered. Those facts certainly look like obstruction, but we don't have all of the facts here yet.  So far, I have seen no credible evidence that President Trump has told anyone to lie. I also have seen no credible evidence that he or his aides have destroyed records being sought by investigators.  Many people firmly believe that the President fired the FBI Director in order to improperly halt an investigation of Lieutenant General Flynn.  Now, I am not only willing but I am eager to delve deeply into all of the circumstances surrounding Director Comey's removal, but to claim at the outset that his removal was obstruction of justice puts the cart before the horse.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by the well-known liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From The Boston Globe, Dec. 5, 2017]  Senator Dianne Feinstein may be provoking a constitutional conflict                        (By Alan M. Dershowitz)       Senator Dianne Feinstein may be provoking a constitutional      conflict between the legislative and executive branches of      our government. The California Democrat has said that      Congress is investigating whether President Trump engaged in      obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey and      taking other actions to halt the Russian investigation.       Feinstein said: ``I think what we're beginning to see is      the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice, I      think we see this in the indictments--the four indictments      and pleas that have just taken place.       ``And I see it, most importantly, in what happened with the      firing of Director Comey, and it is my belief that that is      directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the      Russia investigation, that's obstruction of justice.''       No, it isn't.       Feinstein does not seem to understand that under our      constitutional system of separation of powers, the president      cannot be charged with a crime for merely exercising his      authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. This authority      includes firing the director of the FBI, for whatever reason      or no reason. It also includes the authority to tell      prosecutors who to prosecute and who not to. A president's      motives may not be the basis for a criminal charge. Nor is it      proper to psychoanalyze the president in a search for      possible evil motives. All presidents act out of mixed      motives, including self-aggrandizement, political advantage,      partisan benefit, and personal pique.       Consider, for example, President Barack Obama's benighted      decision, as a lame duck, to tie the hands of his successor      by unilaterally changing the longstanding American policy      with regard to the United Nations condemnation of Israel. The      president, over the objection of many members of Congress and      most Americans, instructed his UN ambassador not to veto a      Security Council Resolution that declared the Western Wall,      the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, and the access roads to      Hebrew University and Hadassah Medical Center hospital, to be      illegally occupied territory. Why did Obama exercise his      authority in so pernicious a manner? I believe, and many      Americans believe, that he did it out of spite and pique: to      get even with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If I am      right, and I am sure that this was at least one of his      motivating considerations, could he be charged with a crime      for abusing his authority for personal vengeance? Of course      not. We can condemn him, as I and others have. But we must      all acknowledge that he had the authority to do what he did,      regardless of his bad motives.       Ironically, it was the effort of the Trump administration      to prevent the lame-duck president from tying the hands of      the president-elect, by not vetoing the UN resolution, that      formed the basis for the lying charge levied against General      Michael Flynn. For whatever reason, Flynn lied--but what he      lied about was entirely lawful.       Trump would have been within his constitutional authority      to pardon Flynn, as Flynn hoped he would do. That would have      kept him from cooperating with the special counsel and      becoming a government witness. Had the president done that,      he would have acted entirely lawfully, as President George      H.W. Bush did when he pardoned Caspar Weinberger in order to      stop the Iran-Contra investigation. Although special      prosecutor Lawrence Walsh complained bitterly that the Bush      presidential pardon had the intent and effect of completely      closing down his investigation, no one suggested that Bush      had committed the crime of obstruction of justice. Why?      Because that was Bush and this is Trump--a pure ad hominem      distinction that should be given no weight by the law.       It would do violence to our constitutional separation of      powers if a president could be charged with a crime simply      for exercising his constitutional authority. Checks and      balances do not include the power to criminalize--through the      vague obstruction of justice statute--presidential actions      authorized by Article 2. Both Presidents Richard Nixon and      Bill Clinton were accused of obstruction of justice, but in      both cases they were accused of going well beyond the mere      exercise of their constitutional authority. Nixon was accused      of telling subordinates to lie to the FBI, paying hush money      to potential witnesses, and destroying evidence. Clinton was      accused of trying to get witnesses, such as Monica Lewinsky,      to lie. These charges constitute acts--independent crimes--     that go well beyond a presidential authority. Trump has not      been accused of any acts that would independently constitute      crimes. The entire case against him, as outlined by      Feinstein, consists of constitutionally authorized acts that      were well within the president's authority under Article 2.      That is an enormous and consequential difference under our      system of separation of powers.       So, until and unless there is proof that Trump has      committed an independent criminal act--beyond acts that are      within his constitutional prerogative--it would be      unconstitutional to charge him with obstruction of justice,      regardless of what Feinstein and others believe his motive      may have been.
