Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I have a lengthy statement that I will not read in full, but will insert in the Record. But let me state that a significant part of this amendment deals with the agreement that we have reached with the appropriators that was discussed in the colloquy which I had earlier today with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations.  Let me also state that the amendment contains various provisions that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) and I have agreed upon relative to our previous differences over the treatment of small entities under this bill. And pursuant to this agreement, my amendment applies a 50 percent discount to all searches for small entities, prohibits commercial searches that apply to classified matters, prevents commercial entities from performing searches when they have a financial interest or other conflict at stake, caps the search fee after the 6th year, and requires a joint PTO and Small Business Administration study regarding the effects of the fee structure on small entities.                              {time}  1730  This, I believe, meets the objections that members of the Committee on Small Business had relative to the cost to small business of applying for and hopefully obtaining a patent. I hope that this amendment clears the way for the other body to consider this bill and bring real reform to the PTO.  Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to report that this amendment reflects a thoughtful compromise between myself and Mr. Wolf, chairman of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, as well as a fair deal between the Judiciary Committee and the chairman of the Small Business Committee, the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Manzullo. I want to thank both of them for working so steadfastly and productively on this important issue.  Mr. Chairman, the heart of my amendment creates a ``refund'' program to eliminate the potential incentive for diverting PTO revenue to non-PTO programs. Briefly, if fee collections in a given fiscal year exceed the amount appropriated to the agency, the excess or overage shall be deposited in a PTO ``Reserve Fund.'' At the end of the fiscal year the Director determines if there are sufficient funds to make payments to persons who paid fees during that year.  The Director is empowered to determine which recipients qualify and in what amounts, except that the payments in aggregate must equal the amount of revenue in the Reserve Fund during that fiscal year, less the cost of administering the program.  This text is crucial to the bill before us. We have been at loggerheads with the Appropriations committee on this matter for nearly a decade, so I am glad to say that we have struck an acceptable compromise that serves the interests of both committees. I am grateful to the appropriators and the majority leader for working with us on this point. I emphasize that without this language, support for the bill dissipates.  In addition, the bill as reported contains a pilot program to determine the efficacy of allowing commercial entities to perform the search function, thereby relieving the agency of the burden and freeing up examiners to do other work. The amendment specifies that participation in the pilot program will be restricted to American businesses and American citizens. We have worked closely with Chairman wolf's staff on this point.  Also, in furtherance of the ongoing modernization efforts at PTO, the Director is required to reduce the filing fee for any small entity, independent inventor, or nonprofit organization by 75 percent provided those so qualified file their applications electronically.  As I noted a moment ago, Mr. Manzullo, and I have resolve dour differences over the treatment of small entities under H.R. 1561. Pursuant to recently agreed-upon changes, my amendment: Applies a 50 percent discount to all searches for small entities; prohibits commercial searches that apply to classified matters; prevents commercial entities from performing searches when they have a financial interest or other conflict at stake; caps the search fee after the sixth year; and requires a joint PTO-SBA study regarding the effects of the fee structure on small entities.  Mr. Chairman, by addressing the fee diversion and other issues, this amendment clears the way for the other body to consider H.R. 1561 and bring real reform to the PTO. I urge its adoption.
