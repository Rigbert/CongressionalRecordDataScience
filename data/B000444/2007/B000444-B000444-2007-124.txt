 Grassley) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 225       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are      extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when      used properly, but the abuse and recreational use of these      medicines can be extremely dangerous and produce serious side      effects;       Whereas 6,400,000 individuals who are age 12 or older      reported using prescription medicines non-medically in a      recently sampled month, and abuse of prescription medications      such as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and      sedatives is second only to marijuana, the number 1 illegal      drug of abuse in the United States;       Whereas, recent studies indicate that 1 in 10 youth ages 12      through 17, or 2,400,000 children, has intentionally abused      cough medicine to get high from its dextromethorphan      ingredient, and 1 in 5 young adults (4,500,000) has used      prescription medicines non-medically;       Whereas, according to research from the Partnership for a      Drug-Free America, more than \1/3\ of teens mistakenly      believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not      prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street      drugs;       Whereas teens' and parents' lack of understanding of the      potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it more      critical than ever to raise public awareness about the      dangers of their misuse;       Whereas, when prescription drugs are misused, they are most      often obtained through friends and relatives, but are also      obtained through rogue Internet pharmacies;       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives      teens access to websites that promote medicine misuse;       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes      the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines      are to be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and when used      recreationally or in large doses can have serious and life-     threatening consequences;       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will      encourage parents to educate themselves about this problem      and talk to their teens about all types of substance abuse;       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness      Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local      levels to increase awareness of the rising misuse of      medicines;       Whereas some groups, such as the Consumer Healthcare      Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of      America, have taken important proactive steps like creating      educational toolkits, such as ``A Dose of Prevention:      Stopping Cough Medicine Abuse Before it Starts'', which      includes guides to educate parents, teachers, law enforcement      officials, doctors and healthcare professionals, and      retailers about the potential harms of cough and cold      medicines and over-the-counter drug abuse;       Whereas the nonprofit Partnership for a Drug-Free America      and its community alliance and affiliate partners have      undertaken a nationwide prevention campaign utilizing      research-based educational advertisements, public relations      and news media, and the Internet to inform parents about the      negative teen behavior of intentional abuse of medicines so      that parents are empowered to effectively communicate the      facts of this dangerous trend with their teens and to take      necessary steps to safeguard prescription and over-the-     counter medicines in their homes; and       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine      abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of      what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb this disturbing      rise in over-the-counter and cough medicine misuse: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the month of August 2007 as ``National      Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and      activities to educate parents and youth of the potential      dangers associated with medicine abuse.
