Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We are going to meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour on Monday and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules, including, and every Member ought to pay attention closely to this announcement, to the important bill, I think frankly it is going to pass with every Member's vote; we will consider several bills under suspension, but including legislation regarding Members' pension accountability.  I think everybody in this House believes that we ought to have legislation, we have had it; when the minority was the majority they pushed for this legislation, we agreed with them, we are pushing it as well. We think there will be agreement on making sure that if you commit a crime while a Member of Congress that is contrary to your duties that you are going to lose your pension. We think the American public believes that is fair.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning hour and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those suspension bills, as is the practice, will be available by the end of today.  On Tuesday, obviously we will receive the President for the delivery of the State of the Union message. So we will vacate the Chamber about 5 o'clock to give the opportunity for the security forces to make sure the Chamber is secure.  On Wednesday, we will meet at 10. We will consider a resolution to restore to the Delegates and Resident Commissioner their ability to cast votes in the Committee of the Whole. This rule was in place prior to January 1995, and we believe it is a good rule and will try to adopt that amendment to the rules. We will finish business in time--I have discussed with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt--we are trying to accommodate our schedule so that the minority is able to leave in a timely fashion to go to their meeting in Cambridge.
