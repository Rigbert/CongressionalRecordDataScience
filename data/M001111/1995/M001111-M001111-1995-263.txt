 Again, I was here at 9:30 this morning to object to proceeding to the bill because of the jurisdictional questions I had about whether the bill should have gone to Banking, which I sit on, which does oversee the Export Administration Act. It did not go through that committee, and that is why I voiced those objections. [[Page S6668]]   I then later agreed to go at noon. But I have not had an opportunity to speak to the bill. I intend to do that. I know other Senators do.  I also know there are amendments out there. I cannot give a specific number, or any time, and it will be up to the Senator from Alaska what he determines to do in terms of cloture.
