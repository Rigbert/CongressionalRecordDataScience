That was one of the important recommendations that the commission made. Those recommendations were made, of course, over a year ago, I think. I am not sure of the exact date, but over a year ago. Your side did not implement that particular recommendation.  The gentleman is correct, we have not implemented the recommendation as recommended. What Speaker Pelosi has done, she has discussed with Leader Boehner what I would refer to as a hybrid of that, not perfect from I think the Commission standpoint, but meeting in spirit what the Commission wanted to do. What the Commission wanted to do was empower the Intelligence Committee with a participation in the appropriations process, which the Commission perceived would give them a greater relevance and greater influence.  We agree with that; so as you know, we have suggested and are implementing a hybrid where the members of the Intelligence Committee and members of the Defense Appropriations Committee will meet and work together to accomplish that objective. We hope that will move towards effecting what the Commission wanted to achieve, while, at the same time, maintaining the jurisdictional issues which, as you know, in this body can become very, very acutely debated.
