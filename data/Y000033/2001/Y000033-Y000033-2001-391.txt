I want to confirm here on the floor our conversation earlier that we have a great deal of sympathy for the enormous relief efforts taking place in Houston as a result of Tropical Storm Allison. I applaud the gentlewoman's efforts in doing everything possible to make sure that the United States House of Representatives helps Houston recover from this disaster. I would add that this Congress has never refused to meet the requirements and obligations to a natural disaster in our country and many other parts of the world. We are working together on this.
