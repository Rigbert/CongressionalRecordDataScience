President, 20 years ago this week, on June 3 and 4 in 1989, the world watched the Communist Government of China violently crack down on peaceful demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. We all remember that. It is hard for me to believe it has been 20 years ago.  One picture that is forever imprinted on our minds and our memories is that of a lone Chinese student who stood before a line of army tanks following days of violence that had resulted in hundreds killed and thousands more wounded. We never did find out what happened to that young student. I assume he was taken away, tortured, and killed, but we don't know that. He displayed tremendous courage in the face of tyranny and injustice. For weeks, students had raised their voices demanding greater democracy, basic freedoms of speech and assembly, and an end to corruption. While the photo of this student became infamous to the world as a picture of the Chinese people and their desire for true and lasting freedom and democracy, it remained virtually unknown to the people of China due to the Chinese Government's continued censorship and oppression.  On March 25, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, while on a trip to China, remained silent regarding the ongoing human rights abuses there. Instead, she talked about the government onglobal warming and issues such as that. This week in Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner followed the Pelosi model, remaining mute on human rights abuses that are going on today, and spoke only of environmental issues.  In 2005, I gave a series of speeches on the threat China poses to our Nation. Now, 4 years later, we are in a position where they are the largest holder of our national debt, and my concerns regarding China remain the same.  I have spent many years in activity in Africa, primarily Sub-Saharan Africa, and right now we are competing with China for the energy that is there. China is doing a better job than we are. They are competitors of ours not just militarily but economically. It is of great concern to me that as we continue to grow in our relationship and our dependence on China, our U.S. Government officials seem to place more value on the Chinese Government's treatment of the environment than the treatment of their own people and the threat they pose to our Nation.  On the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Pelosi and Geithner's omission is a disgrace to the memory of those who stood and many who died as they pleaded with the government to allow them basic freedoms that we as Americans possess and enjoy.  Sadly, ignoring these issues is exactly what the Government of Beijing wants. They would like nothing more than to erase the memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre from our minds and from the minds of all people around the world. The Chinese Government would like us to forget that in June of 1989, they used lethal force of 300,000 troops strong to crush peaceful protestors who were seeking greater freedoms. The Chinese Government would like the image of that courageous man standing before the line of tanks to fade from our memory. However, we can't forget the hundreds who were murdered, the thousands who were injured, and the more than 20,000 people who were arrested and detained without trial due to the suspected involvement in the protests, specifically in Tiananmen Square.  We don't know today where those people are. Most likely, they are still incarcerated someplace or they have been killed. The Communist government is so bent on wanting us to forget these issues that they have shut down blogs, blocking access to individual news sources such as Twitter, and denied access to popular sites such as YouTube.  Since Tiananmen Square, China has continued to increase severe cultural suppression of ethnic minorities such as the Tibetans, the Uighurs; increase persecution of Chinese Christians, the Falun Gong, and other religious groups and other minorities; increase detention and harassment of dissidents and journalists; and has maintained tight controls on freedom of speech and access to the Internet. We know journalists who right now are still incarcerated over there, but there is no trace of exactly where they are.  Despite the promises to the contrary, China didn't provide greater access to the international media during the 2008 Olympic Games. Unlike the previous hosts of the past games, the Government in Beijing blocked access to certain Internet sites and media outlets in an attempt to censor free speech.  As China grows economically and continues to exert its influence globally and thus considers itself a significant player on the world stage, I believe China should be held to a standard of political, religious, and ethical responsibility.  Our country was founded by those who were seeking basic freedoms, and we have to stand for those who are doing the same in other countries. When basic freedoms can be practiced, countries thrive and prosper because people are allowed to choose a better way of life for themselves. We must also recognize the danger we place ourselves in by becoming closer and more dependent upon nations that continue to silence their people, deny them access to information and the ability to practice their cultures and beliefs. That is what is happening today.  On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, my colleague Senator Brown and I have introduced S. Res. 167 to remember the families and the victims who were killed in the June 1989 protest and to call on the Government of China to put an end to its continuing human rights violations. Our country must not remain silent, and many of my fellow colleagues in the Senate who are cosponsors of this resolution agree.  This resolution calls on the Chinese Government to release all prisoners still in captivity as a result of their suspected involvement in Tiananmen Square protests and to release all others who are currently being imprisoned without cause. This resolution puts the Senate on record, encouraging the Chinese Government to allow freedom of speech and to access information, while ending the harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment practices the government has carried out against those who are minorities and who seek religious freedom. We also call on our government to uphold human rights in China. Our silence only dishonors those who lost their lives and freedoms in Tiananmen Square.  We have this resolution right now. So far, we have cosponsors who have just found out about it and called in, including, in addition to Senator Brown and myself, Senators Graham, Lieberman, Kyl, Coburn, Vitter, Menendez, Webb, and Brownback. I encourage others to join in this message that I believe is a very clear message that should be sent by the United States.  Today--this very day, this moment--there are 150,000 people who are protesting in Hong Kong right now because of the problems we are addressing with this resolution. So I encourage my colleagues to join in this resolution and get this message out loud and clear.                          ____________________
