Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3833) to facilitate the creation of a new, second-level Internet domain within the United States country code domain that will be a haven for material that promotes positive experiences for children and families using the Internet, provides a safe online environment for children, and helps to prevent children from being exposed to harmful material on the Internet, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3833       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Dot Kids Implementation and      Efficiency Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and      entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and      develop educationally and intellectually;       (2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive      amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies      indicate that a significant portion of all material available      on the Internet is related to pornography;       (3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web      for positive purposes, are often presented--either mistakenly      or intentionally--with material that is inappropriate for      their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children,      parents, and educators;       (4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate      for them, including pornography, can distort the education      and development of the Nation's youth and represents a      serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of      other problems for children, including inappropriate use of      chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and      financial difficulties;       (5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth,      frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk      takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are      at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on      the Internet;       (6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to      17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of      unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the      solicitations were reported to the police;       (7) children who come across illegal content should report      it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online      mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes      against children;       (8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports,      including reports of child pornography, online enticement for      sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and      child prostitution;       (9) although the computer software and hardware industries,      and other related industries, have developed innovative ways      to help parents and educators restrict material that is      harmful to minors through parental control protections and      self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a      national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful      material on the World Wide Web;       (10) the creation of a ``green-light'' area within the      United States country code Internet domain, that will contain      only content that is appropriate for children under the age      of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section      within a library and will promote the positive experiences of      children and families in the United States; and       (11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside      first with the parent, the protection of the physical and      psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from      material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental      interest.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain      within the United States country code Internet domain for the      location of material that is suitable for minors and not      harmful to minors; and       (2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration oversees the creation of such a      second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient      establishment and operation of the new domain.     SEC. 3. NTIA AUTHORITY.       Section 103(b)(3) of the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C.      902(b)(3)) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end      and inserting ``; and''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(C) shall assign to the NTIA responsibility for providing      for the establishment, and overseeing operation, of a second-     level Internet domain within the United States country code      domain in accordance with section 157.''.     SEC. 4. CHILD-FRIENDLY SECOND-LEVEL INTERNET DOMAIN.       The National Telecommunications and Information      Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is      amended in part C by adding at the end the following new      section:     ``SEC. 157. CHILD-FRIENDLY SECOND-LEVEL INTERNET DOMAIN.       ``(a) Responsibilities.--The NTIA shall require the      registry selected to operate and     maintain the United States country code Internet domain

to enter into written agreements with      registrants, to use the new domain in accordance with the      standards and requirements of the registry.       ``(4) Rules and procedures for enforcement and oversight      that minimize the possibility that the new domain provides      access to content that is not in accordance with the      standards and requirements of the registry.       ``(5) A

Continuous and uninterrupted service for the new      domain during any transition to a new registry selected to      operate and maintain new domain or the United States country      code domain.       ``(8) Procedures and mechanisms to promote the accuracy of      contact information submitted by registrants and retained by      registrars in the new domain.       ``(9) Operationality of the new

require registrars to enter into written agreements with      registrants, to prohibit two-way and multiuser interactive      services in the new domain, unless the registrant certifies      to the registrar that such service will be offered in      compliance with the content standards established pursuant to      paragraph (1) and is specifically constructed and operated to      protect minors from harm.       ``(11) Written agreements with registrars, which shall      require registrars to enter into written agreements with      registrants, to prohibit hyperlinks in the new domain that      take new domain users outside of the new domain.       ``(12) Any other action that the NTIA considers necessary      to establish, operate, or maintain the new domain in      accordance with the purposes of this section.       ``(c) Treatment of Registry and Other Entities.--       ``(1) In general.--Only to the extent that such entities      carry out functions under this section, the
