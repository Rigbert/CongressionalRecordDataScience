The Democrats would win that battle. I don't think the people at home care whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win. They want families to win. This is an example where families would win, where you could have protection.  Let me give an example. I am sure the Senator is well aware of this. If a woman in the course of a pregnancy is going to her obstetrician, and because there is a change of insurance companies at her employment, she is asked to go to a different HMO, we provide that she can continue with the same doctor's care, in whom she has confidence, through the completion of her pregnancy. I think it is common sense and good medical judgment. I think both sides could agree on it. That is part of our Patients' Bill of Rights.  It says if you are going to the emergency room with a child, you don't have to check in the glove compartment, pull out the insurance policy, and go through it page by page to get the right hospital. It says if somebody at an insurance company makes a wrong decision and you lose your life or your health, they can be held accountable, as every business and person in America is held accountable.  Those are some basics in the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights. The Republican leadership does not want that issue to come to the floor because they now know we have the votes to pass it. They have blocked us every step of the way.
