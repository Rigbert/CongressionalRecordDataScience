Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of the Inland Empire are exceptional. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Teri Ooms is one of these individuals.  In 1997 Teri Ooms was appointed the President/CEO of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership (IEEP) and of its sister companies. IEEP is responsible for the regional marketing, attraction and recruitment of new business to the region, the expansion and retention of existing business, film, tourism, high tech regional development, workforce collaborative, regional visioning and the Small Business Development Center.  Ms. Ooms joined the Inland Empire Economic Partnership in 1991 as the Executive Director of its Inland Empire Small Business Development Center. Under the excellent direction of Ms. Ooms, the Center grew to a staff of 21 with multiple regional locations, and its program has increased funding to $1.1 million, making it the largest California program. The Center has created numerous special services and training programs, and can demonstrate economic impact of over $300 million in its eleven year history.  As President/CEO, Ms. Ooms completed a reorganization of the company resulting in new programs and services, financial stability and increased prominence in the community. In the period of 1997-2003 IEEP has had 70 successful business attractions and retentions resulting in over $730 million in new investment into the region creating over 9,500 jobs. The region has over 5,000 film shoots, demonstrating a little over $425 million in regional impact in the same period. In 1999, she was awarded ``Management Leader of the Year,'' by the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management, and in 1998, was a recipient of the ``Women of Distinction'' award given by the Business Press. Since 1997, IEEP's membership has grown by 10% and maintains an average membership retention ratio of 93%. EIIP has evolved to include a high technology development program and coordination of the region's workforce collaborative to bring education and business partnerships to benefit employers, employees and students and a regional collaborative focused on regional visioning, planning, advocacy and implementation.  Teri's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the economy of the Inland Empire in California. I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
