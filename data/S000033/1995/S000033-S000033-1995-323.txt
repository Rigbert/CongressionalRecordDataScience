 The Progressive Caucus has brought forth a number of alternative ideas to the contract, and maybe it would be useful if we talked about some of the ideas and some of the legislation that we are working on.  Recently, as you know, the president has come out to increase the minimum wage. You and I have supported legislation for several years which would raise the minimum wage to an even higher level. I introduced legislation 4 years ago which would raise the minimum age to $5.50 an hour. It seems to me that at a time when the purchasing power of the minimum wage today is 26 percent less than it was in 1970, in other words, our low-wage workers are significantly poorer and worse off than they were 25 years ago, that the time is long overdue, that we should be saying that if you are going to work 40 hours a week in the United States of America, you should not be living in poverty.  Does that not make sense to you?
