 President, on a different matter, later today the Obama administration's FCC will take up a proposal by the President to strike a blow to the future of innovation in our country. It is the so-called net neutrality rule.  The growth of the Internet and the rapid adoption of mobile technology have been a great American success story, and they were made possible by a light regulatory touch. In fact, it is this bipartisan light touch consensus that allowed innovators to develop and sell the products people want and to create the kind of high-quality jobs Americans need without waiting around for government permission.  The Obama administration needs to get beyond its 1930s rotary telephone mindset and embrace the future. That means encouraging innovation, not suffocating it under the weight of an outdated bureaucracy and poorly named regulations such as this one.                          ____________________
