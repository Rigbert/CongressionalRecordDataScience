Speaker, I wish to extend the deepest sympathies of our community to the family and friends of Congressman Charles Arthur Hayes of Chicago, IL, who served in this body from September 1983 through December 1992.  It was my distinct pleasure to know and work with this indefatigable man we called Charlie, including a visit to his central city Chicago district. During that tour, we walked from public housing development to public housing development, trying to envision a better and different future for the people--especially the children--living there.  He knew every nook and cranny of his town. While we explored his neighborhoods, he talked about his early life, how upon graduation he had sought to work in Chicago but was denied because he was a man of color. He eventually joined the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and spent his life as a tireless and vocal advocate for the working people of our Nation--and for those who wish to work but are denied access.  Through his life, he helped America move forward. As a staunch ally of Martin Luther King, Jr., and civil rights advocates, he changed the laws of our land to meet the Nation's promise that ``All people are created equal.''  We shall miss you, Charlie. I still look for you in the corridors of Congress, and still hear your voice. Very few citizens with a background like yours achieve election to this Chamber. You brought a set of experiences and a world view that need greater voice. Rest in peace, faithful servant. In your life, you made a difference.                          ____________________
