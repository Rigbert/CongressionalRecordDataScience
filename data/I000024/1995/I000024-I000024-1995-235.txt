BYRD. The framers saw a need for amendments at some point in time, so they provided a way to do that in the Constitution itself. But I am opposed to amending the Constitution to write fiscal theory into it, fiscal policy. I am also opposed to destroying our constitutional system of mixed powers and checks and balances by a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  I respect those who differ with me, but why do we keep on talking about a constitutional amendment? We Senators have as much power as Senators in the year 2002 will have. Why wait?
