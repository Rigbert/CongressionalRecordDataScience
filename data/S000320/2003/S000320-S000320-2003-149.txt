 President, I rise today to introduce the ``National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003.'' This bill, which is cosponsored by the Ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, as well as Senators Bond and Mikulski, the Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations, will provide a one-year extension of the lapsed federal flood insurance program.  The National Flood Insurance Program, ``NFIP'', expired on December 31, 2002. The expiration of the program has prevented homeowners and home buyers from obtaining or renewing flood insurance policies in the intervening time. Since anyone buying or refinancing a home in a flood plan must have flood insurance, NFIP's expiration will block the path to home ownership for many Americans, and have a disruptive effect on residential real estate and mortgage markets.  I have a December 6, 2002 letter from Anthony S. Lowe, the Administrator of the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, which goes into greater detail regarding the consequences of the expiration of the NFIP. As Director Low indicates in this letter the lapse of this authority could effect as many as 400,000 households in the month of January alone. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  The bill that I am introducing today simply extends the NFIP through the end of this calender year, retroactive to January 1, 2003. As such, it's purpose is the same as S. 13, which the Senate passed last November 20th.  The House passed companion legislation this week, and it is our hope to have a short term extension of the NFIP enacted into law as soon as possible. This will permit the two Houses of Congress to consider the larger issues confronting the NFIP in a deliberate manner, without creating hardship for homeowners and undue turmoil in our nation's real estate markets.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Federal Emergency Management Agency,                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2002.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On December 31, 2002, certain basic      authorities for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's      National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will expire. The      continuing resolution (P.L. 107-294), which extends FY 02      baseline funding through January 11, 2003, does not extend      NFIP authorization. This lapse in authority in January alone      could affect as many as 400,000 households seeking to obtain      or renew a flood insurance policy in nearly 20,000      communities in all 50 States and territories.       In particular, the lack of authorization for NFIP to issue      and renew policies will cause significant disruption to      policyholders, the lending and real estate industries,      secondary mortgage market, many private insurance companies      writing flood insurance under arrangements with the NFIP, and      particularly those seeking home loans or mortgage refinancing      that requires flood insurance as a precondition to      settlement.       The lapse in authorization will also have a negative impact      on public entities that provide or require flood insurance,      including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together control      about 85% of the secondary mortgage market in the country. In      addition, since policy renewal billing is generally conducted      45-90 days prior to expiration of a policy, unless our      authority to renew policies is reauthorized immediately, many      more individuals will be impacted than the above initial      estimate.       The four authorities requiring reauthorization are sections      1309(a)(2), 1391, 1336 and 1376(c) of the National Flood      Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-448). Should they lapse, the      resulting uninsured flood losses could impose significant      hardship on citizens, and increase costs to the Federal      government and the States. I would urge Congress to act as      quickly as possible to reauthorize this important program      effective January 1, 2003. Should you have any questions on      this issue, please do not hesitate to contact our      Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs Division at (202)      646-4500. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                              Anthony S. Lowe,                                                    Administrator,                  Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration.
