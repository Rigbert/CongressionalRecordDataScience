Speaker, in the last Congress, rats, bugs, and even weeds were more important than people. Certain bureaucrats have become so eager to list new species as endangered, they have lost sight of the intent of the Endangered Species Act and ignored human concerns.  The Stephens kangaroo rat, considered not only to be endangered, was partly responsible for the destruction of 29 homes in my district. In fall 1993, southern California was battling several wildfires. Because homeowners lived in critical habitat they were unable to obey California law and clear dry weeds and brush away from their homes. It was even illegal for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to set controlled fires so that they could reduce the amount of combustible materials. The result: 29 homes destroyed.  Well, Mr. Speaker, yesterday we struck a blow to rats and scored a touchdown for the American people. The Combest-Condit amendment to H.R. 450 sets not only a moratorium to the Endangered Species Act, but is retroactive to November 20, 1994. This may not bring back the 29 homes in my district, but it will help the American people realize that this Congress thinks they are more important than rats, bugs, and weeds.                          ____________________
