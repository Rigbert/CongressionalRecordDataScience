Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Calvert Alliance Against Substance Abuse, Inc., or CAASA, in celebrating its 10th Anniversary. CAASA, an organization which aims to fight substance abuse, has become a key player in reducing alcohol and drug abuse across Calvert County, Maryland. I commend CAASA for its starting as a grassroots drug prevention efforts.  It is imperative that youth are taught the dangers of drugs and alcohol at an early age. CAASA's sponsorship of numerous community activities geared towards children has encouraged them to steer away from drugs. Their support of various activities such as DARE, Just Say No Clubs, the Haunted Crack House, and many other programs have helped to keep many of the youth of Calvert County drug-free and out of trouble. By providing more school-based substance abuse programs, they have given these children alternatives to drug use.  Without the full support of the government and local communities, CAASA could not have enjoyed ten years of success. I would like to recognize community members, schools, civic and service organizations, religious groups, businesses, public agencies, and the county government for their continuous support of CAASA. This valuable partnership has enabled CAASA to reduce alcohol and drug abuse through public awareness, education, treatment, and law enforcement.  Alcohol and drug use remains a problem in both rural and urban communities across the Nation. Calvert County is fortunate to have such a valuable resource. I congratulate CAASA on 10 years of service and wish it all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
