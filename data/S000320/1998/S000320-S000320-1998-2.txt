 President, due to an inadvertent oversight, Senator Susan Collins was not listed as a cosponsor of S. 2145, the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 1998, when the Senate returned from August recess in September. I hope this statement in the Congressional Record will clarify Senator Collin's enthusiasm for S. 2145. I thank Senator Collins for her support of the bill.                          ____________________
