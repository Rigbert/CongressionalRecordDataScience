 Frankly, I find those arguments very offensive because, as taxpayers in this country, we provide dollars for many facilities across this country. But we have singled out women who are overseas serving us in countries overseas, and have told them that they cannot use their own private dollars to pay for a medical service in those facilities. We pay for many other services in those facilities, but we will not provide an abortion for those women. Yet, the Senator is absolutely correct; she will have to fly back to this country in a military plane paid for by taxpayer dollars. She will eat meals on that plane paid for by taxpayer dollars. All of us use taxpayer dollars when we travel on the roads, when we use our public schools, when we go to our colleges, when we have the police come to our house, or when we have a firetruck come to the House.  Why are we singling out women who need a medical procedure and expanding the use of taxpayers' funds in that terminology? I find that very offensive.
