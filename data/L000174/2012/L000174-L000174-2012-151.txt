President, it is an honor to recognize Rosaire Longe, aman who has dedicated much of his life to civil service. Whether fighting fires, serving the city of Burlington, VT, as city assessor, representing his district in the Vermont State Legislature, or maintaining order in the courtroom as a court officer, Mr. Longe has continually served the people and State of Vermont.  A native of New York, Mr. Longe spent most of his childhood years in Vermont. After graduating from Burlington High School in 1958, Mr. Longe worked as a firefighter for the Burlington Fire Department, a profession he continued for 10 years. Mr. Longe went back to school at Champlain College, where he received his associate's degree in accounting in 1979. Before beginning his career as a court officer, Mr. Longe worked as the Burlington City Assessor and served as a state representative for one term in the Vermont Legislature. For the past 20 years, Mr. Longe has ensured the smooth running of the Vermont Superior Court in Burlington as a court officer. His ready smile and easy manners have helped jurors, witnesses and judges alike feel assured in the courtroom. Outside of work, Mr. Longe served as a Justice of the Peace for over 30 years, and in that capacity, he has presided over the marriage of over 2,000 couples.  These professional accomplishments aside, Mr. Longe has touched the lives of many Vermonters. Friends and co-workers have described him as ``one of the best men'' they know. Whether he is leading people in and out of the courthouse, officiating a neighbor's wedding, or merely encouraging those around him with a smile and a laugh, Mr. Longe has proven himself to be the epitome of a true Vermonter. Marcelle and I have known Rosaire and his wife, Irene, for decades, and share Vermonters admiration for him. In light of his character and history as a public servant, Rosaire deserves recognition for a full lifetime of civil service and contribution to his community and State.                          ____________________
