President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  September 20, 1999:  Donetta L. Adams, 26, Bloomington, IN; Barbara F. Allen, 65, Bloomington, IN; Eugene S. Bassett, Jr., 35, Davenport, IA; Antonio Butler, 19, Miami, FL; William Cook, 38, Detroit, MI; Rosa Gomez, 41, Miami, FL; Travis L. Harris, 27, Chicago, IL; James Hoard, 31, Bloomington, IN; Katherine Kruppa, 39, Houston, TX; Teal Lane, 19, Baltimore, MD; Mark Pitts, 22, Detroit, MI.  One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned was 65-year-old Barbara Allen of Bloomington, Indiana. Barbara's boyfriend shot and killed both her and her pregnant daughter, 26-year-old Donetta Adams, before turning the gun on himself.  Another victim of gun violence, 41-year-old Rosa Gomez of Miami, was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend after having been harassed and threatened by him on several occasions.  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.                          ____________________
