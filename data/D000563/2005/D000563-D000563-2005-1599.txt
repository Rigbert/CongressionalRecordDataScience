President. I congratulate the American Legacy Foundation on the occasion of yesterday's announcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the Foundation is a recipient of the agency's Children's Environmental Health Award.  The widespread use of tobacco and devastating effects of secondhand smoke create a serious environmental health risk for America's children. Since its inception 5 years ago, the American Legacy Foundation, a non-profit health organization dedicated to building a world where young people reject tobacco and anyone can quit, has worked to discourage adult and youth tobacco use and reduce the effects of secondhand smoke.  Passive exposure through secondhand smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke, puts children at risk for a range of negative health consequences including asthma, ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, reduced lung function, respiratory infection, and other chronic respiratory symptoms. According to current population survey data, 13.8 million kids ages 0 to 17 are exposed to secondhand smoke and 22 percent of middle school students and 24 percent of high school students are exposed to secondhand smoke in the home. American Legacy's campaigns and programs to reduce smoking are helping to reduce the number of young people breathing environmental tobacco smoke.  The Environmental Protection Agency is recognizing the Foundation because of its initiatives to address the negative health effects of tobacco. Outreach efforts include public awareness campaigns and initiatives designed to educate and empower youth to take action against the environmental health threat that smoking and secondhand smoke poses to them.  It is with great pleasure today that I commend the agency for its program of recognition and the American Legacy Foundation for its award.                           ____________________[Page S4150]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  CONGRATULATING THE AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION ON RECEIVING THE EPA                  CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AWARD
