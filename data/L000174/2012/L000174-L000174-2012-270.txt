President, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on the Watford nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then resume legislative session.
