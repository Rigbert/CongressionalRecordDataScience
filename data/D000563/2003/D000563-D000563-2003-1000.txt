HATCH. There were plenty of reasons Richard Paez was held up by people on our side. He had ruled in a number of cases in ways that appeared to be, and I think was, in fact, activist judging. Without my support, Richard Paez would not be sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. So, again, I feel impugned by the question because without me going to bat for him, which I did, without me fighting for him on the floor, which I did, without me giving him a vote, which I did--which you are not; I should say the Democratic side is not--he would not be sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he knows it and you know it--every Democrat on the other side knows it.  Unfortunately, I want to talk personally to my colleagues. I will do itthrough the mechanism of the Chair. But the fact is, had I not supported him, he did not have a chance to be on the court because there were many people who believed he was an activist judge and, I have to confess, it was a close question.  I finally asked him to come visit with me. I sat down with him. He is a nice man. He is a good man. I have to admit, I felt he was an activist judge. But I also felt he was a good man.
