 President, I am pleased to welcome the 28th annual Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN] conference to Seattle, WA, June 15-19, 1996. The theme of the conference, ``The Future is Ours to Create,'' will focus on future opportunities and challenges relating to the changing and expanding role of enterostomal therapist nurses, and other nurses specializing in wound, ostomy, and continence care.  Founded in 1968, WOCN is the only national organization for nurses which specializes in the prevention of pressure ulcers and the management and rehabilitation of persons with ostomies, wounds, and incontinence. In addition, WOCN is a professional nursing society which supports its members by promoting educational, clinical, and research opportunities, to advance the practice and guide the delivery of expert health care to individuals with wounds, ostomies, and incontinence. I applaud them for their commitment and dedication to their work.  In this age of changing health care services and increasing costs, the WOCN nurse plays an integral role in providing cost-effective care for their patients. This year's Seattle conference will provide a unique opportunity for WOCN participants to learn about the most current issues and trends related to their practice. I am honored that WOCN has chosen Seattle to host its conference and wish them every success.                          ____________________
