First is that even though the last amendment brought up by the Republican side is vehemently opposed by a Member on this side who could not be present, we made no objection to that, knowing he would have time to debate later on. Mr. President, we did this to try to comply with the request of the majority leader and the distinguished Senator from Utah, who said they wanted to move forward with this. We did it in good faith. Frankly, for one of the very few times in my 25 years in the Senate, I find my faith shaken because it is very obvious nobody intended to go forward; they just wanted to go right back to Y2K and block anything else.  If their side wants to bring up something even if our side is not here to debate it, that is fine. If our side wants something similar, that is not fine. It is like the Democratic amendments being voted down over here so a day or so later they can be brought up as Republican amendments and voted up over there. And in between we hear complaints about this is taking too long.  I will repeat what I have said before: Every single Democrat wants a juvenile justice bill with everything from the prevention of crime to education to helping our juveniles. I question whether the same thing can be said for the other side of the aisle.  The Senator from New Jersey had the floor. I yield back to him.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
