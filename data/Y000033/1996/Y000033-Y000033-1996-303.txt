Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult for me to sit here and listen to the rhetoric that comes out from that side of the aisle, the outright mistruths very nearly close to the mistruths have been spoken by the President of the United States.  When I hear people talk about the Tongass, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates], and, no, I will not yield. I listened to that tirade a while ago, and I will not yield. The Tongass does in fact--the provision of this bill froze the amount of timber that could be harvested. It froze it to 1.7 million acres. . . .
