President, I agree with the Senator. I point out that in the specifics of the bill, I think it says shall not, in regard to cost containment on Medicare A and B, but the rest is encouraged. That is where we get into problems because CER is the blueprint on how we allot health care dollars in this country.  I might mention to the Senator, I had a chart on what CER recommended, and it had a figure of a humpback whale and how much money we would be devoting to different age groups. If you are 60--and, by the way, the average age of the Senate is 62--you are out of luck. If you are 70, you better get something fixed real quickly before this bill passes. That is my point. I thank the Senator for his comments.
