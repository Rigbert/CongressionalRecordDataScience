 I want to create jobs, not cut jobs. What Senator Boxer and Senator Cardin and others are talking about is creating meaningful, good-paying jobs as we retrofit coal-burning plants so they do not poison the children of Vermont and other States around the country.  So to Senator Inhofe and others, I say respectfully: Stop poisoning our children. Let them grow up in a healthy way.
