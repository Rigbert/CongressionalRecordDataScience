Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. Lucas Lutheran Church in South Toledo. On Sunday, June 12, the church dedicated a state historic marker as part of its 130th anniversary celebration. The celebration began on Mothers Day 2016 with a concert featuring the Toledo Symphony's Brass Quintet.  St. Lucas is a progressive Lutheran Church wrapping itself around its congregants in their faith journeys. It describes itself as ``a faith community of many ministries and many ministers. In all we do we strive to glorify Jesus Christ.''  The church began on March 21, 1886 when a group of people met in the home of Louis Burman to discuss the formation of a Lutheran church in Toledo's southern neighborhood to serve the Germans settling there. Though first meeting in borrowed space, by 1887 the congregation had its own church building and parsonage on Walbridge Avenue. With both German and English services, a Ladies Aid Society, Young People's Society and choir, the church was well established. Though these organizations were briefly disbanded, by 1897 they were a permanent part of the mission of St. Lucas. That same year, a monthly paper was published in coordination with two other congregations, with an eventual readership in 1200 homes.  As it grew, the church outgrew its space and the last services in St. Lucas' first church building were held on May 8, 1910. The new building was a reflection of the church's origins as a German mission church and built in the Gothic revival style. During the 1911 dedication celebration of the new church building, the congregation received a German language Bible inscribed by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The dedication also saw the first English-speaking sermon, offered by Pastor Hugo Hamfeldt. Soon Sunday services were spoken in English. The church undertook renovations in 1931, 1945, 1961 and as part of its 1986 centennial celebration in order to ``enhance and update theworship atmosphere.'' In the 1960s as the ecumenism movement flourished, St. Lucas was a charter member of the Old South End's ecumenical organization known as CROSS (Christians Relating Our Savior on the South Side.) CROSS has engaged in exchanges in the pulpit, Thanksgiving Eve and Unity Good Friday services, Feed Your Neighbor food pantry and children's summer services. As the neighborhood changed, St. Lucas continued to adapt itself, ``taking risks for the sake of the Gospel.'' It now sits in the heart of a neighborhood with many challenges, yet the church soldiers on meeting the needs of its congregation and neighborhood through outreach.  Now as it comes to its 130th anniversary, St Lucas Lutheran Church proudly dedicates a historic marker outlining the church's history in the neighborhood. A special feature of the dedication ceremony is the world premiere of a hymn which was commissioned especially for the 130th anniversary. With words and music by the parish's husband and wife team of Michael and Karen Biscay, Choirmaster Ron Lang conducts the St. Lucas Choir, accompanied by organist Jamie Dauel in the fast-ever performance of the anthem. At its 125th anniversary, the Biscays wrote a hymn in tribute to the congregation's German heritage and this work is also featured in Sunday's dedication ceremony. I was pleased to join the congregation and members of our community in celebrating this joyous occasion.  St. Lucas Lutheran Church stands today in testament to the faith and perseverance of its members through the ages. Generations have worshiped together, prayed together, served together. Truly, it can be said of St. Lucas that its congregation has lived the Gospels and Christ's message as written in Matthew 12:30-31 to ``Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength . . . Love your neighbor as yourself.'' As the congregation of St. Lucas Lutheran Church continues on its faith journey, living the Gospel and sharing Christ's message of Love, it stands on a rich and deep history. The Ohio Historic Marker records that history as the church turns forward to a future strong in its faith.                          ____________________
