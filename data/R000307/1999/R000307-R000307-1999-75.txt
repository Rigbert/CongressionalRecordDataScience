President, today, by a previous order, the Senate will begin a series of stacked votes on the Abraham Social Security lockbox amendment, the Baucus motion to recommit, and the Robb amendment regarding effective dates of the provisions in the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999.  Following the votes, Senator Gramm of Texas will be recognized to offer a substitute amendment containing across-the-board tax cuts, estate tax relief, and reductions in capital gains taxation. By previous consent, there then will be 10 hours of debate time remaining on the bill today. Therefore, it is the intention of the majority leader and other rational Senators to continue to make significant progress on the bill and complete action on this legislation no later than tomorrow.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
