 Estrada is not the only former deputy or assistant to the Solicitor General nominated to the Federal bench. In fact, there are seven others now serving on the Federal Courts of Appeals. None had any prior judicial experience, and the committee did not ask the Justice Department to turn over any confidential internal memoranda those nominees prepared while serving in the Solicitor General's Office. The seven nominees were: Samuel Alito on the 3rd Circuit, Danny Boggs on the 6th Circuit, William Bryson and Daniel Friedman on the Federal Circuit, Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner on the 7th Circuit, and A. Raymond Randolph on the D.C. Circuit. Why should Mr. Estrada be treated any differently?  During Mr. Estrada's hearing, Judiciary Committee Democrats alleged that the committee has reviewed the work product of other nominees, including memos written by Frank Easterbrook, by Chief Justice Rehnquist when he served as a clerk to Justice Jackson, and by Robert Bork when he was an official at the Justice Department.  For the record, there is no evidence that the Department of Justice ever turned over confidential memoranda prepared by Frank Easterbrook when he served in the Solicitor General's Office. There also is no evidence that the committee even requested such information.  During Robert Bork's hearings, the Department did turn over memos Judge Bork wrote while serving as Solicitor General, but none of these memos contained the sort of deliberative materials requested of Mr. Estrada and the Justice Department. The Bork materials include memos containing Bork's opinions on such subjects as the constitutionality of the pocket veto, and on President Nixon's assertions of executive privilege and his views of the Office of Special Prosecutor. None of the memos contain information regarding internal deliberations of career attorneys on appeal decisions or legal opinions in connection with appeal decisions. Moreover, the Bork documents reflected information transmitted between a political appointee, namely the Solicitor General, and political advisors to the President, rather than the advice of a career Department of Justice attorney to his superiors, as is the case with Mr. Estrada.  You see, the Judiciary Committee has never requested and the Department of Justice has never agreed to release the internal memos of a career line attorney. To ask that Mr. Estrada turn over his memos is unprecedented, and frankly unfair. No Member of this body would ever condone a request to turn over staff memos. What my staff communicates to me in writing is internal and private. I am sure every other Senator feels the same way as I do. This Democrat fishing expedition needs to stop. Miguel Estrada is a more than well qualified nominee and he deserves a vote on his nomination, today.  In conclusion, we are again seeing an attack on another very talented, very principled, highly qualified legal mind. It all boils down to this, Mr. Estrada's opponents refuse to give him a vote because they say they do not know enough about him. They further contend that the Justice Department memos, which they know will never be released, are the only way they can find out what they need to know about Mr. Estrada. It is a terrible Catch-22.  These obstructionist efforts are a disgrace and an outrage. We must put a stop to these inappropriate political attacks and get on with the business of confirming to the Federal bench good men and women who are committed to doing what judges should do, interpret law as opposed to making law from the bench, because it is our responsibility to make law as members of the legislative branch.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 18, 2003]                               Just Vote       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of      Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.      Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of      the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough      Democrats are holding together to prevent the full Senate      from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation      range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks      judicial experience, his critics say--though only three      current members of the court had been judges before their      nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age      as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and      several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was      nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by      refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar      in nature to those of previous nominees, including many      nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration      refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no      reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a      letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He      is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only      because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they      are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats      don't want to put a conservative on the court.       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which      Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under      the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of      his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's      right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to      play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the      Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable      games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote,      answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to      address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to      address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no      reason for Republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a      distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a      Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were      it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr.,      Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been      waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote.      Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed,      Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate      lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a      procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for      good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and      vote.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2002]                           The Estrada Gambit       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy keeps saying he's      assessing judicial nominees on the merits, without political      influence. So why does he keep getting caught with someone      else's fingerprints on his press releases?       The latest episode involves Miguel Estrada, nominated more      than a year ago by President Bush for the prestigious D.C.      Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada scares the legal briefs      off liberal lobbies because he's young, smart and      accomplished, having served in the Clinton Solicitor      General's office, and especially because he's a conservative      Hispanic. All of these things make him a potential candidate      to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court down the road.       Sooner or later even Mr. Leahy has to grant the nominee a      hearing, one would think. But maybe not, if he keeps taking      orders from Ralph Neas at People for the American Way. On      April 15, the Legal Times newspaper reported that a      ``leader'' of the anti-Estrada liberal coalition was      considering ``launching an effort to obtain internal memos      that Estrada wrote while at the SG's office, hoping they will      shed light on the nominee's personal views.''       Hmmm. Who could that leader be? Mr. Neas, perhaps? Whoever      it is, Mr. Leahy seems to be following orders, because a      month later, on May 15, Mr. Leahy sent a letter to Mr.      Estrada requesting the ``appeal recommendations, certiorari      recommendations, and amicus recommendations you worked on      while at the United States Department of Justice.''       It's important to understand how outrageous this request      is. Mr. Leahy is demanding pre-decision memorandums, the kind      of internal deliberations that are almost by definition      protected by executive privilege. No White House would      disclose them, and the Bush Administration has already turned      down a similar Senate request of memorandums in the case of      EPA nominee Jeffrey Holmstead, who once worked in the White      House counsel's office.       No legal fool, Mr. Leahy must understand this. So the      question is what is he really up to? The answer is almost      certainly one more attempt to delay giving Mr. Estrada a      hearing and vote. A simple exchange of letters from lawyers      can take weeks. And then if the White House turns Mr. Leahy      down, he can claim lack of cooperation and use that as an      excuse to delay still further.       Mr. Leahy is also playing star marionette to liberal      Hispanic groups, which on May 1 wrote to Mr. Leahy urging      that he delay the Estrada hearing until at least August in      order to ``allow sufficient time . . . to complete a      thorough and comprehensive review of the nominee's      record.'' We guess a year isn't adequate time and can only      assume they need the labor-intensive summer months to      complete their investigation. (Now there's a job for an      intern.) On May 9, the one-year anniversary of Mr.      Estrada's nomination. Mr. Leahy issued a statement      justifying the delay in granting him a hearing by pointing      to the Hispanic group's letter.       These groups, by the way, deserve some greater exposure.      They include the Mexican American Legal Defense and      Educational Fund as well as La Raza, two lobbies that claim      to represent the interests of Hispanics. Apparently they now      believe their job is to help white liberals dig up dirt on a      distinguished jurist who could be the first Hispanic on the      U.S. Supreme Court.       The frustration among liberals in not being able to dig up      anything on Mr. Estrada is obvious. Nam Aron, president of      the Alliance for Justice, told Legal Times that ``There is a      dearth of information about Estrada's record, which places a      responsibility on the part of Senators to develop a record at      his hearing. There is much that he has done that is not      apparent.'' Translation: We can't beat him yet.       Anywhere but Washington, Mr. Estrada would be considered a      splendid nominee. The American Bar Association, whose      recommendation Mr. Leahy one called the ``gold standard by      which judicial candidates have been judged,'' awarded Mr.      Estrada its highest rating of unanimously well-qualified.      There are even Democrats, such as Gore advisor Ron Klaim, who      are as effusive as Republicans singing the candidate's      praises.       When Mr. Estrada worked in the Clinton-era Solicitor      General's office, he wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in      support of the National Organization of Women's position that      anti-abortion protestors violated RICO. It's hard to paint a      lawyer who's worked for Bill Clinton and supported NOW as a      right-wing fanatic.       We report all of this because it reveals just how poison      judicial politics have become, and how the Senate is      perverting its advise and consent power. Yesterday the      Judiciary Committee finally to help fellow Pennsylvania      Brooks Smith.       Mr. Estrada doesn't have such a patron, so he's fated to      endure the delay and document-fishing of liberal interests      and the Senate Chairman who takes their dictation.
