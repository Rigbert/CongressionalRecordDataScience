 I say to the Senator through the Chair, I really do look forward to working with Senator Alexander. This is very important. I so regret some of the pressures that are brought upon this program. I am so pleased he and I agree these children should have different models to choose from in the public educational arena.  This Washington Scholarship Program, I think we both believe, can go a long way, and hopefully the findings will be positive. I look forward to working with the Senator from Tennessee as well. I thank him for his comments.
