Speaker, I rise against this bill. I don't know if you saw the headline today in The Wall Street Journal: ``Grim Milestone as Jobless Rate Tops 10 percent.'' The New York Times: ``Jobless rate hits 10.2 percent with more unemployed. Official figure is highest since 1980. Broader measure stands at 17.5 percent.''  Mr. Speaker, I am from Michigan where our unemployment rate exceeds 15 percent. People want to work and pay taxes. They don't want to be laid off and receive benefits.  This 1,990-page bill is almost 20 pounds. Does anyone actually believe that spending another $1 trillion is going to reduce our unemployment? We add employer mandates. The Joint Committee on Taxation says that one-third of the $460 billion in taxes is going to be paid for by small businesses. How does that decrease our unemployment? It doesn't.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me say this: one of our colleagues today is quoted as saying: Health care costs are rising faster than wages and inflation, and this bill does not change that trend.  That was a Democrat and not a Republican who said it.
