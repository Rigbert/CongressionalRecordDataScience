Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from California, Maxine Waters, for yielding me this time and for calling this special order, along with the gentleman from Ohio, Lou Stokes.  I want to thank Maxine Waters, our colleague, the new chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, for her leadership, for her vision, for bringing to the caucus a sense of vigor and vitality.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today to celebrate Black History Month; to talk about the civil rights movement and all that it has accomplished. Thirty-two years ago blacks in the South could not vote. I could not vote. Blacks were not allowed in the same restaurant as whites, the same hotels as whites. Blacks were not even allowed to drink from the same water fountain as whites.  Growing up in rural Alabama, in the heart of the black belt, I grew up surrounded by the signs that divided our world: white waiting, colored waiting; white men, colored men; white women, colored women.  In the 1960's, during the movement, all of this changed. People from all across our country, men and women, young and old, black and white, red, yellow and brown, came to the South. They came to change the world and they succeeded. We succeeded. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 changed our country. It changed our world. It is a better place. It is a more inclusive place.  So it pains me today to hear people attack these laws. It pains me to hear politicians say that these laws have done more to divide our country than to unite it. These people do not know what they are saying. They do not know how far we have come.  To those who say these laws do not work, I say ``Walk in my shoes.'' I have seen the progress. I have seen us grow as a Nation and as a people. I have seen a poor black man, denied the right to vote, become a Member of Congress because of these laws.  It is not the laws that divide, it is people who divide. It is politicians playing the race card to win votes. It is politicians who attack any solution to the racism that still exists in our society. It is people who ignore the racism and attack those who offer solutions and work to overcome the racism that is still with us.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, we have made great progress as a Nation and as a people. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act have made us equal under the law, but we are still not equal. The scars and stain of racism still plague our society.  We must speak up against those who see the world as rich against poor, black against white, us against them. We have heard the political speeches, seen the political ads. They fan the flames of racism, the racism that burned dozens of black churches to the ground last year.  My colleagues, thanks to the civil rights movement, we are all equal under the law. We have come a long way toward being in a country where all men and women are created equal. We have come so far because of the movement, because of the laws, not in spite of them.  It is time, Mr. Speaker, for us to speak openly about race. We must redirect the priorities of our Nation. We must use our resources not to divide but to bring together, not to tear down but to uplift, not to oppress but to set free.  We, every one of us, have a moral obligation, a mission and a mandate from the spirit of history, from our fallen martyrs, Martin Luther King, Jr., Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andy Goodman and Mickey Schwerner. Wehave an obligation to work for hope and opportunity for all, to build upon the civil rights movement, to build upon its legacy which has brought us here today.  Yes, Ms. Waters, as I said earlier, we are a better nation, a better people because of the civil rights movement.                              {time}  1600  We are in the process of laying down the burden of race, but we must do more. We must continue to fight injustice wherever it rears its ugly head. And we must continue to dialogue between all men and women of good will. I thank the gentlewoman again for holding this special order.
