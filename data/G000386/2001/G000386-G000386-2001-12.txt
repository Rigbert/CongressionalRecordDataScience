 President, I compliment the University of Montana. They did, in fact, play well--too well--against the University of Northern Iowa.  Before I had bragged to Senator Daschle 2 weeks ago about how we were going to show the University of Montana how to play football, I wish I had researched how they have done so well in the last few years. I probably would not have been so boastful. But we had just come away from a tremendous victory, the UNI Panthers over the University of Maine Black Bears, just the week before. I thought if the Panthers could beat the Black Bears, they could surely beat the Grizzlies. But it did not turn out that way.  You played tremendous football, and I thank you very much for being so temperate in your remarks about the Panthers of the University of Northern Iowa.
