 President, yesterday I spoke to my colleagues about management problems within the FBI, and within the Bureau's reputed crime lab. I spoke about the consequences of this mismanagement. Confidence and trust in the Nation's premiere law enforcement agency is dwindling. It is because of the FBI's own abuses of its very enormous powers.  Yesterday, I mentioned that I would talk about a specific case, with specific allegations. The case involves apparent false statements and evidence tempering by an FBI agent in a high profile case brought before the Federal judicial system and the U.S. Congress.  In a letter to me dated February 21, FBI Deputy Director Weldon Kennedy stated that the Justice Department inspector general ``found no instance of perjury evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence.''  Mr. President, my first response to that is as follows: The IG investigation was not a criminal investigation. It therefore would not find perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence. If it had been a criminal investigation, I believe Mr. Kennedy would not have said what he said. His credibility is undercut by the facts.  This morning's Washington Post contains a story about how one FBI agent, Special Agent Michael P. Malone, apparently shaved evidence, provided false statements, and tampered with evidence for an Eleventh Circuit Court proceeding involving then-Judge Alcee L. Hastings. Mr. Hastings is now a Member of the House of Representatives. Mr. Malone is still an FBI agent, and has testified in thousands of cases.  Despite well-documented evidence of this wrongdoing, the FBI covered it up. The evidence was documented by an FBI lab scientist, who performed lab tests on a piece of evidence in the Hastings case. Malone falsely claimed to have done the tests himself.  The FBI scientist who made the allegations is not Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, the more well-known whistleblower from the FBI lab. Rather, it is Dr. William Tobin of the same lab. By the way, this undercuts the FBI's assertion that Dr. Whitehurst is the only one in the lab making these allegations.  A memorandum written by Dr. Tobin in 1989 details the alleged false statements, evidence shaving, and evidence tampering by Agent Malone. It was the basis of reports in the last 24 hours in the media. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post story.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1997]                     FBI Role in Impeachment Probed                           (By Pierre Thomas)       The Justice Department inspector general has been      investigating whether the FBI intentionally gave misleading      testimony to a judicial panel that was deliberating whether      to recommend that then-U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings      be impeached.       The Justice Department probe has uncovered evidence that an      FBI examiner who worked on the Hastings case, now a      Democratic representative from Florida, vigorously challenged      the bureau's laboratory analysis of a key piece of evidence      relating to the judge's truthfulness in a bribery trial in      the early 1980s. But Justice Department investigators found      that FBI supervisors largely ignored the examiner's critique      and never provided the dissenting information to Congress,      which later removed Hastings from the bench.       The revelation is the first detailed account supporting      allegations by FBI whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst about      shoddy FBI laboratory work. Whitehurst claims that bureau      officials routinely manipulated forensic work and allowed      flawed expert testimony during court proceedings if it helped      prosecutions.       ``It is not just Dr. Whitehurst who has alleged wrongdoing      in the FBI crime lab,'' Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa)      said yesterday.'' . . . I fear the FBI has covered up the      lab's shortcomings.''       Documents obtained by The Washington Post in connection      with the Hastings investigation raise questions about the      bureau's willingness to address criticisms of its laboratory      procedures, even when its own employees raised them, Grassley      and others said.       ``The misrepresentations and misstatements in the      transcript (regarding FBI forensic testimony in the Hastings      case) . . . represent a glaring pattern of conversion of what      should have been presented as neutral data into incriminating      circumstances by complete reversal of established laboratory      test data with scientifically unfounded, unqualified and      biased testimony,'' wrote frustrated FBI examiner William A.      Tobin in 1989.       Tobin wrote that, while he agreed with the FBI's overall      forensic assessment in the Hastings case, he was concerned      that the bureau's testimony had gone too far in an apparent      attempt to bolster the case against Hastings. Tobin's      memorandum noted no fewer than 27 exceptions, or challenges,      to bureau testimony against Hastings, Florida's first black      federal judge, after he was acquitted of federal bribery      charges. The judicial inquiry begun after his acquittal      raised allegations of racism from African American      leaders.       During an interview with the Justice Department inspector      general's office, Tobin reiterated his concerns to      investigators, according to sources familiar with the      inspector general's ongoing review. He also told      investigators that he turned his memorandum in to his      supervisor, but the bureau apparently did nothing to address      his concerns. In fact, he never heard back from his superiors      on the matter, Tobin said. In addition, sources said that      investigators have been unable to find Tobin's original      forensic report, which should have been used to prepare for      the testimony in the Hastings case.       ``Alcee Hastings and I have believed for some time that a      fair amount of evidence against him was manipulated or      manufactured,'' said Terence Anderson, Hasting's attorney      during impeachment proceedings.       Hastings called the revelation ``astounding beyond belief.      I need to understand who withheld this information, why they      withheld it and what effect it would have had if it were      presented to Congress,'' which impeached and convicted him.       Whitehurst's attorney, Stephen Kohn, agreed, saying that      ``if the FBI could put forth false evidence regarding a      sitting judge, every American is at risk to FBI      lawlessness.''       In response to a broad inspector general investigation of      the FBI crime laboratory, Justice Department officials have      notified at least 50 state and federal prosecutors of      potential problems in their cases.       Hastings was charged in 1981 along with friend and      Washington lawyer William A. Borders Jr. of engaging in a      conspiracy to accept a $150,000 bribe from an undercover FBI      agent posing as the brother of two men convicted of      racketeering. In exchange, Hastings was to reduce the men's      sentences and return nearly $1 million in forfeited property.       Borders was convicted of the crime. Hastings, in a separate      trial in 1983, was acquitted of the same charges. He has      steadfastly maintained his innocence.       But after a 3\1/2\-year investigation prompted by an ethics      complaint from several of his fellow judges, successive      judicial panels concluded that Hastings had not only engaged      in a bribery conspiracy, but lied and manufactured evidence      at the trial to win acquittal.       Investigators sought to challenge Hastings' truthfulness on      a number of fronts.       Hastings testified he was with Borders at the time he was      alleged to have taken the bribe in part because he was trying      to find a leather shop to repair a men's purse whose strap      had broken.       FBI forensic experts were asked to test the strap to see if      it could be snapped by accident, as Hastings described, or      whether it was too strong and would have had to have been      cut. The FBI's lab experts concluded the strap had been cut.      The inference was that Hasting had cut the strap in an      attempt to concoct an alibi.       Tobin generally agreed with that conclusion but said he was      deeply troubled about FBI testimony in the case and believed      it ``revealed a pattern of complete omission of crucial      conditions, caveats, premises and or assumptions which may be      viewed as tending toward exculpatory.''
