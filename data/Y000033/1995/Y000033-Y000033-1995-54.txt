Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the royalty relief provision of S. 395, as adopted by the Committee on Commerce, has targeted deep water relief provisions that the administration supports for existing leases. It targets relief for only those leases that would not be economic without the release, and that is the Clinton administration.  I include for the Record a letter from Secretary O'leary on this subject, as follows:                                      The Secretary of Energy,                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1995.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     Committee on Resources, House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration reiterates its      support for the title providing deepwater royalty relief to      the central and western Gulf of Mexico.       In the energy policy plan, Sustainable Energy Strategy:      Clean and Secure Energy for a Competitive Economy in July      1995, the Administration outlined its overall energy policy      stressing the goals of increased energy productivity,      pollution prevention, and enhanced national security. To      achieve these goals, ``the Nation must make the most      efficient use of a diverse portfolio of domestic energy      resources that will allow us to meet our energy needs today,      tomorrow, and well into the 21st century. The Administration      continues to promote the economically beneficial and      environmentally sound expansion of domestic energy      resources.'' (page 33) In furtherance of this objective,      ``The Administration's policy is to improve the economics of      domestic oil production by reducing costs, in order to lessen      the impact on this industry of low and volatile oil prices.''      (page 35) One of the ways indicated to lower these costs is,      ``providing appropriate tax and other fiscal incentives to      support our domestic energy resources industries.'' (page 34)      Finally, the Strategy specifically targets the opportunities      in the Gulf of Mexico.       One of our best opportunities for adding large new oil      reserves can be found in the central and western Gulf of      Mexico, particularly in deeper water. Royalty relief can be a      key to timely access to this important resource. The      Administration supports targeted royalty relief to encourage      the production of domestic oil and natural gas resources in      deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. This step will help to      unlock the estimated 15 billion barrels of oil-equivalent in      the deepwater of Gulf of Mexico, providing new energy      supplies for the future, spurring the development of new      technologies, and supporting thousands of jobs in the gas and      oil industry and affiliated industries. (emphasis in      original, page 36)       The royalty relief provision in S. 395 as adopted by the      conference committee is a targeted, deepwater royalty relief      provision that the Administration supports. For existing      leases, it targets relief for only those leases that would      not be economic to develop without the relief. Few new      leases, the provision is targeted for a specific time period      for only a specific number of barrels of production, and      could be offset by increased bonus bids.       The Minerals Management Service has estimated the revenue      impacts of new leasing under section 304 of S. 395. For lease      sales in the central and western Gulf of Mexico between 1996      and 2000, the deepwater royalty relief provisions would      result in increased bonuses of $485 million--$135 million in      additional bonuses on tracts that would have been leased      without relief, and $350 million in bonuses from tracts that      would not have been leased until after the year 2000, if at      all, without the relief. This translates to a present value      of $420 million, if the time value of money is taken into      account. However, the Treasury would forego an estimated $553      million in royalties that would otherwise have been collected      through the year 2018. But again, taking into account the      time value of money, this offset in today's dollars is only      $220 million. Comparing this loss with the gain from the      bonus bids on a net present value basis, the Federal      government would be ahead by $200 million.       It is important to note that affected OCS projects would      still pay a substantial upfront bonus and then be required to      pay a royalty when and if production exceeds their royalty-     free period. A royalty-free period, such as that proposed in      S. 395, would help enable marginally viable OCS projects to      be developed, thus providing additional energy, jobs, and      other important benefits to the nation.       In contrast, in the absence of thorough reform of the 1872      Mining Law, hard rock mining projects on Federal lands can be      initiated without paying a substantial bonus and are never      required to pay a royalty on the resources developed. The end      result is that the public is denied its fair share of the      benefits from the resources developed.       The ability to lower costs of domestic production in the      central and western Gulf of Mexico by providing appropriate      fiscal incentives will lead to an expansion of domestic      energy resources, enhance national security,      and reduce the deficit. Therefore, the Administration supports the      deepwater royalty relief provision of S. 395.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that it has      no objection to the presentation of these views from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler].
