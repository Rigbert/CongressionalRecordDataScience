 President, I wish to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Manchester Memorial Hospital located in Manchester, KY. Originally the Oneida Mountain Hospital founded in the mid to late 1920s, Manchester Memorial Hospital is now a 63-bed, acute care, nonprofit Christian community hospital.  James Anderson Burns and Dr. C. Adeline McConville, an optometrist from New York City, founded the original hospital in the early 1900s. In the late 1930s, when McConville's failing health forced her to retire, a board of trustees was selected, and the hospital deeded to the State of Kentucky so it could receive State funding. In 1952, the State returned the hospital back to the remaining original trustees.  The doors reopened in 1955 and by the mid-1960s, the hospital had an average occupancy of 139 percent. The logical next step was to build a new hospital. After many years of hard work fundraising and negotiating, construction was completed in 1971 on a tract of land in the Lyttleton area.  I would like to extend my thanks to the leadership and staff at Manchester Memorial for their hard work and dedication to helping the people of Kentucky, and I congratulate them on 45 years in their new hospital. Though it started small, today Manchester Memorial Hospital has more than 500 employees and averages 60,000 patient visits each year. It is the parent organization for five home healthcare offices serving 14-plus counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia and has been twice named a ``100 Top Hospital in America.''  An area publication, the Manchester Enterprise, recently published a piece announcing the 45th anniversary of Manchester Memorial Hospital. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From The Manchester Enterprise, Sept. 8, 2016]                  Memorial Hospital Opens Their Doors       In September 1971 patients were transferred from Oneida      Hospital to the new Memorial Hospital       Manchester Memorial Hospital is celebrating its 45th      anniversary this year. The hospital started from humble      beginnings as Oneida Mountain Hospital, which began in the      mid-to-late 20s by founder James Anderson Burns, founder of      Oneida Baptist Institute, and Dr. C. Adeline McConville, an      optometrist from New York City.       It was Anderson's dream to bring a hospital to the area,      and Dr. McConville was captivated by his pursuit of it. She      pledged to return to the mountains with him and work to open      a hospital.       Dr. McConville operated the hospital until the late 1930s,      when failing health forced her to retire.       A Board of Trustees was selected and the hospital deeded to      the state of Kentucky so it could receive state funding. It      operated under their leadership until 1952, when the state      returned the hospital back to the remaining original      trustees.       The late Mr. Thomas Britton sought diligently for an      organization to come operate the hospital. Through the advice      of a friend, he contacted the Seventh Day Adventist Church      and they accepted the challenge.       Due to the building being vacant, their first task was to      make it usable again. Through various donations they re-     opened the doors after a three-year hiatus on August 22,      1955.       Over the years, the hospital continued to grow and by the      mid-60s had an average occupancy of 139 percent. There were      times when the 22-bed hospital had 49 patients. The clinic      was equally as crowded. The choice was obvious--build a new      hospital.       Fund raising began with the plan to build another hospital      in the Oneida area. Plans were drawn and submitted, but the      Department of Health would not approve the site.       Hospital Administrator Herb Davis, with Dr. W.E. Becknell,      negotiated through Mr. Saul Goins to build the hospital on a      tract of land in the Lyttleton area that Mr. Goins farmed on.      But there was a problem; there was no bridge to the land.       Mr. Isom Hensley started a letter-writing campaign to the      Department of Highways to request a bridge be built. The      State approved the bridge, and now the attention turned to      raising money for construction.       Mrs. Marie Langdon and Mr. Bill Baker started soliciting      donations for the construction. The Clay County Jaycees each      pledged $200 apiece towards the construction.       The dream of a new hospital became a reality in late 1969      as approval was given and construction began in 1970. The      hospital was completed in mid-1971 and the transfer of      patients from Oneida to Manchester was made in September of      that year.       Here's a look at the story from September 9, 1971 where the      hospital was moved from Oneida to Manchester:       Patients and equipment vacated the century-old Oneida      Hospital in what was described as one of the quickest moves      in the annals of hospital history.       Herb Davis, administrator of Memorial Hospital in      Manchester, said the 23 patients at Oneida were moved in      ``record time'' and without a ``single incident.'' All were      brought to the new Memorial Hospital in Manchester.       Only three of the patients were able to sit up for the ride      from Oneida to Manchester.       The move was accomplished through the help of both local      funeral homes, who provided ambulances and personnel to      transport the patients 17 miles in distance.       At the same time the patients were moving, much of the      medical care equipment needed by patients was moved.       In one case, a patient was taken off the operating table      following surgery and the table was removed while he was in      recovery to be transported.       Statistics on the move as released by hospital officials      list Mrs. Webb, 93, of Burning Springs as the last patient to      leave Oneida Hospital.       Mrs. Ester McIntosh was the last person to receive surgery      in the old hospital, and Mr. and Mrs. Billy Jones were      parents of the last baby born at the hospital.       The first baby born at Memorial Hospital in Manchester was      born to Cassie and Charles Stewart of Sibert, Ky.       The move was accomplished through a 40-hour continuous      effort by many of the hospital's staff, who got things ready      for the move, then set up again when the move was complete.       By noon, Tuesday, eight new babies had been born at the      hospital and 29 patients were on the register.                          ____________________
