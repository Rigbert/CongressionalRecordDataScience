Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Vincent L. Barile, Deputy Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, who retired after 28 years of service at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA.  Vince began his career with VA in 1975 as a veterans' benefits counselor. In 1976, he transferred to the Budget Service in VA's central office. From 1979 to 1984, he served as a budget analyst in the Veterans Health Administration, where he rose to supervisor of budget formulation and operations.  In 1984, Vince joined the National Cemetery Administration, NCA, as the director of budget and planning. In this position he was responsible for the formulation and implementation of the annual budget, all planning activities, and other activities including emergency preparedness, energy conservation and safety programs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs promoted Vince to Deputy Under Secretary for Management for NCA in 1990.  In 2002, Vince was appointed Deputy Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs. In this capacity, Vince oversaw budget and planning, information systems, communications, human resources, administration, contracting, memorial programs, state cemetery grants, and operations and construction for 120 national cemeteries. Vince testified before the Veterans' Affairs Committee frequently on memorial affairs issues, where he brought extensive knowledge and experience to the witness table.  When asked what they will remember most about Vince Barile, employees he supervised say that he was a mentor and a teacher. He often conducted impromptu sessions in the hallways, always credited his employees for their work, and helped them find opportunities to learn. As evidence of the high regard he had for his employees, Vince summed up his remarks at his farewell party by saying that his Exceptional Service Award was not his award, but one in recognition of all his employees. He noted that if his career was considered successful, it was because of the people who worked for and with him. He then applauded his staff.  With Vince's retirement, VA is losing vast institutional knowledge and a real friend to America's veterans. Thank you, Vince, for your 28 years of dedicated service to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Nation.                          ____________________
