Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  May I ask, do you know when the Rules Committee will meet, Mr. Majority Leader?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The Rules Committee will meet tomorrow morning. I anticipate a short amendment will be posted as early as tonight. It is our expectation the Rules Committee will meet tomorrow morning to report the rule providing for consideration of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act.  Upon adoption of that rule, the House will proceed with general debate on the measure and final passage.
