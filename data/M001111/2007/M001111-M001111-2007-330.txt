 President, for the information of all Senators, as the majority leader said, we are going to go to final passage tonight no matter what it takes. We are working our way through the amendments.  I am going to proceed to two amendments that I believe are agreed upon by Senator Salazar and Senator Kyl that I believe will be adopted by voice vote.
