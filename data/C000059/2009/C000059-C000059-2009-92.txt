The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated leader who has given his time and talent to advance U.S. interests in space, science and aeronautics. On January 20, 2009, Administrator Michael Griffin concluded nearly four years of service as the NASA Administrator.  Dr. Griffin was nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate as the 11th Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He began his term on April 14, 2005. As Administrator, Mike led the NASA team and managed its resources to advance the U.S. Vision for Space Exploration which included returning the space shuttle to flight, completing assembly of the International Space Station and development of the Ares rocket and Orion crew vehicle to return us to the moon and eventually to Mars.  Prior to his tenure with NASA, Griffin served as Space Department Head at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. He was previously President and Chief Operating Officer of In-Q-Tel, Inc., and also served in several positions within Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Virginia, including Chief Executive Officer of Orbital's Magellan Systems division and General Manager of the Space Systems Group. Griffin also previously served as chief engineer and as associate administrator for exploration at NASA, and as deputy for technology at the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.  Mike Griffin is a true rocket scientist and has the post-secondary degrees to prove it. He received a bachelor's degree in physics from Johns Hopkins University; a master's degree in aerospace science from Catholic University of America; a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland; a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California; a master's degree in applied physics from Johns Hopkins University; a master's degree in business administration from Loyola College; and a master's degree in Civil Engineering from George Washington University.  Mike Griffin is a certified flight instructor with instrument and multiengine ratings. In addition, he is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and International Academy of Astronautics, an Honorary Fellow of the American Astronautical Society, a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and a previous adjunct professor at the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University, and George Washington University, where he taught courses in spacecraft design, applied mathematics, guidance and navigation, compressible flow, computational fluid dynamics, spacecraft attitude control, astrodynamics and introductory aerospace engineering. He is the lead author of more than two dozen technical papers, as well as the textbook, ``Space Vehicle Design.'' Mike is also the recipient of the Department of Defense's Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest award given to a non-government employee.  Mike has demonstrated his ongoing passion for NASA and provided tremendous leadership for the agency in the Second Space Age. I am proud to call Mike a fellow American and friend. I know that many people around the country are grateful for his service and join me in saluting his many achievements. Whatever the future holds for him, Godspeed Mike Griffin.                          ____________________
