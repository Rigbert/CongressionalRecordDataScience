I thank the Senator for bringing to it my attention. Let me make it clear: Some Medicare HMO choice plans are good. Seniors want them, and they should have the option to turn to them. In my State, though--I don't know if it happened in Pennsylvania--some of these insurance plans came in and decided they couldn't make enough money, and they cut and ran.
