  Before joining the Committee staff in 2004, Ms. Tyborowski spent twelve years at the Department of Energy. There, she worked on a wide range of vital energy and environmental policy issues, including nuclear clean-up, natural resource management, nuclear non-proliferation, international fuel cycles, and fissile materials policy implementation. In these areas and others, she evaluated existing policies, made recommendations for essential changes, authored reports to Congress, managed complex programs, and traveled abroad to facilitate international cooperation. Her extensive experience in both foreign and domestic energy issues in a variety of capacities made her a valuable member of the Department and prepared her to make equally meaningful contributions to Congress.   The Appropriations Committee first benefited from Ms. Tyborowski's expertise in 2000, during her detail with the Energy and Water Subcommittee. That year, she assisted in the preparation of the Fiscal Year 2001 Appropriations Bill, giving recommendations on funding levels and reporting requirements from the perspective of a federal agency under our jurisdiction.   With both Departmental insight and familiarity with the appropriations process, Ms. Tyborowski was an obvious choice for a permanent professional position on the Appropriations Committee. Joining the Committee staff in 2004, she spent a year with the Homeland Security Subcommittee working on science, infrastructure, and intelligence issues before returning to the Energy and Water Subcommittee to oversee major Department of Energy accounts. In this capacity, Ms. Tyborowski's in-depth knowledge of energy policy made her a truly invaluable member of the team.   The Energy & Water subcommittee has a history of working close together, but when I became Chairman of the subcommittee I was able to gain a much deeper appreciation for the tremendous contribution Ms. Tyborowski made to the subcommittee. During this transition period, she provided an essential source of consistency and expertise. She quickly became a go-to person for nearly all of the energy-related issues and her work was critical to the subcommittee's success during her four year tenure.  On top of all her professional contributions, Ms. Tyborowski has also been a distinct pleasure to work with. Tenacious and honest, Ms. Tyborowski is universally regarded by her colleagues for the deep commitment and passion she brings to her work. We have each appreciated her wonderful and contagious sense of humor. Her presence will be sorely missed. I must also acknowledge Ms. Tyborowski's family--her husband, Keith, and her son, Eric--for their support as Terry managed the demands of a congressional schedule.   For all the knowledge she has shared and the sacrifices she has made, on behalf of the Energy and Water Subcommittee I would like to extend to her our utmost thanks. We wish her all the best for her return to the Department of Energy. We know that she will continue to do great things.                          ____________________
