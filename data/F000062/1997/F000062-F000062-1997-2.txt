 Thomas, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Grams, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Roth) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 149       Whereas, the ability of the United States and the People's      Republic of China to avoid conflict, to cooperate, and to act      as partners rather than adversaries has a substantial bearing      on peace and stability in Asia and worldwide;       Whereas on October 28-30, 1997, President Jiang Zemin of      the People's Republic of China conducted a state visit to      Washington, DC;       Whereas the state visit included meetings with President      Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and the      Congressional leadership;       Whereas, in connection with the state visit, china gave      clear assurances that it will conduct no new nuclear      cooperation with Iran, reiterated its commitment not to      assist unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, joined the Zangger      Committee, and promulgated national regulations to control      exports of nuclear material, equipment and technology;       Whereas, President Clinton announced his intention to      certify that China has met the conditions necessary to      implement the 1985 Agreement for Cooperation Between the      Government of the United States and the Government of the      People's Republic of China Concerning the Peaceful Uses of      Nuclear Energy;       Whereas China agreed to allow a delegation of American      religious leaders to conduct a fact-finding mission on      religious freedom in China, to resume a project of accounting      for prisoners, and to conduct preparatory talks on      establishing a Non-Governmental Organization forum on human      rights;       Whereas the United States and China agreed to conduct      regular summit, cabinet-level, and sub-cabinet level meetings      in their respective capitals, and agreed to the establishment      of a direct telephone link between the two Presidents;       Whereas the United States and China agreed to increase      contacts between their respective militaries in order to      avoid incidents at sea between their naval forces, and to      coordinate their responses to humanitarian crises;       Whereas the United States and China agreed to increase      cooperation aimed at promoting the rule of law in China,      including training judges and lawyers, drafting legal codes,      and developing due process of law;       Whereas the United States and China agreed to expand their      cooperation in law enforcement efforts, including by      stationing officers of the United States Drug Enforcement      Administration in the United States Embassy in Beijing;       Whereas the United States and China have agreed to      cooperate on developing clean energy projects in China      through the use of United States products and technology;       Whereas despite some significant achievements reached      during the state visit of President Hiang Zemin, many      significant concerns and problems remain in the U.S.-China      relationship;       Whereas the United States continues to have serious      concerns about the human     rights policies and practices of the People's Republic of      China, including the imprisonment of Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan,      and other dissidents, limitations on the free practice of      religion, harsh population control measures (including      isolated reports of forced abortion), the use of prison labor      to produce cheap consumer goods, the continuing suppresson of      the people of Tibet, and the refusal of China's leadership to      meet with the Dalai Lama;       Whereas the United States continues to have deep concerns      about reports of exports from China of nuclear, chemical, and      ballistic missile technology, and advanced conventional      weapons, to countries who are known proliferators, such as      Iran and Pakistan;       Whereas the United States continues to seek from the      People's Republic of China measures to reduce the growing      trade imbalance between the United States and China,      including access to China's markets for United States      products and services;       Whereas the United States believes it is imperative that      the People's Republic of China commit to resolving the Taiwan      question by exclusively peaceful means, and that both sides      should resume a Cross-Straits dialogue as soon as possible;       Whereas the recently concluded U.S.-China summit is part of      President Clinton's articulated policy of engagement with the      People's Republic of China, a central goal of which is to      further draw the People's Republic of China into the      international community and toward internationally recognized      standards of behavior; and       Whereas President Clinton accepted President Jiang's      invitation to make a return visit to the People's Republic of      China in 1998: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) welcomes the agreements and understanding reached by      the United States and the People's Republic of China during      the state visit of President Jiang Zemin;       (2) urges the President to continue to press vigorously for      further progress in China's policies and practices in the      areas of human rights, nonproliferation, trade, Tibet, and      Taiwan;       (3) views the expected return visit to the People's      Republic of China in 1998 by President Clinton as an      opportunity for the United States and the People's Republic      of China to advance their relationship by enhancing      cooperation in areas of accord and making genuine progress      toward resolving areas of disagreement.
