 President, today, I am introducing legislation along with Senator Sessions and Senator Kyl to help in sending our young people a no-use message on drugs. This parallels efforts in the House by Congressman Matt Salmon and it is supported by NASA.  The average age of our young people who first use illegal drugs is 16 and the age of first use is dropping. We need to reverse this trend and prevent drug use among young people. An easy way of contacting them is at our finger tips. NASA's web sites are among the most visited government sites. Thousands of schools have programs that include NASA's web sites in their curriculum. I believe it is important to reach out to those young people. Here is a chance to reach millions of young people at no added expense to the taxpayer.  In this bill the NASA administration must work with the Office of National Drug Control Policy to add anti-drug messages on NASA's web sites. With our young people being bombarded by images of violence and drugs from films and TV, this is a way to get the anti-drug message to our children at a young age through a location that we know a large number will see. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1337       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ANTI-DRUG MESSAGES ON INTERNET SITES.       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration, in consultation with the Director of the      Office of National Drug Control Policy, shall place anti-drug      messages on appropriate Internet sites controlled by the      National Aeronautics and Space Administration.                                 ______                                       By
