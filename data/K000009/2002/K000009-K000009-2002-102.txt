Speaker, I submit the following article. The growing wave of Palestinian suicide bombings, followed inevitably by fierce Israeli military counter-attacks, ought to be proof for anyone that Middle East violence has degenerated beyond the bounds of any possible moral justification and into the realm of cultural psychosis.  Each side in this conflict continues to point a finger at the other, claiming, ``You started it,'' as if the childish refrain were reason enough to continue down what looks more and more like a path to Armageddon.  This is a regrettable characteristic of the Middle East mayhem, one not easily understood in the West. Any inclination to turn the other cheek is almost always overcome by religious and cultural injunctions to crush and grind the enemy into the dust. Charity toward an adversary, it seems, is a sign of weakness.  Arabs and Jews contesting the Holy Land are never going to make peace with each other until both sides have had their fill of the bloodbath. The question facing a horrified, uncomprehending world is ``when will enough be enough?''  The relentless procession of young Palestinians willing, even eager, to don explosives and give their lives to kill Jews and regain their historic homeland provides no indication of an early peace.  The so-called ``spiritual leaders'' of Hamas and other Palestinian movements point to such self-serving verses in the Qu'ran as, ``And slay them wherever ye find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse then slaughter.''  The Islamic militants who nurture, cultivate, and train the suicide bombers boast that they will send ``a million martyrs to Jerusalem,'' and who can doubt them?  The Israelis, who also claim this territory as a religious and historic right, fall back on the self-perpetuating justification of self-defense. Memories of the Holocaust (``Never again'') warn them of annihilation. The shock of the continued bombings neutralizes the nation's calmer voices and nascent peace movement. And violence begets violence.  The question of who is to blame no longer matters to a good bit of the outside world, but in the Middle East it remains pretty much the only issue. Until one side or the other takes responsibility, this burgeoning threat to humanity will continue to monopolize the world's resources and attention.  As much as we in the United States wish it were otherwise, what is happening in Israel and the West Bank cannot be separated from our war on terrorism. The same ancient fears and frustrations fuel both conflicts.  President Bush at first tried to distance the United States from the turmoil, but even he realizes now that inattention for several months last year was a mistake.  An end to the madness that has engulfed the region could be reached in several ways. The preferable one would be through the services of a negotiator of uncommon skill and forbearance, possibly someone who is not yet apparent on the diplomatic stage. Another more horrifying possibility: a cataclysm of bloodshed that would make the current suicide bombings seem tame by comparison.  World leaders, even those without a direct stake in the Middle East, have a responsibility to apply pressure on all the parties involved to see that the path of least violence is the one taken.                          ____________________
