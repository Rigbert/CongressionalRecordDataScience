Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this substitute amendment which guts the bill.  Where to begin? I will begin with the title of the first section of the substitute. It is entitled ``Three Strikes and You're Out.'' But it is not true when we read the substitute. In fact, the substitute provides that following three violations of this provision, the court ``shall refer each such attorney to one or more appropriate State bar associations for disciplinary proceedings.'' Three strikes and you are still in.  The Democratic substitute does not say that the attorney shall be suspended from the practice of law. That is what the base bill says. The bill says that after three strikes ``The Federal District court shall suspend that attorney from the practice of law in that Federal District Court.''  The base bill follows through on its ``three strikes and you're out'' promise. The Democratic substitute says ``three strikes and you have a foul ball.''  But it gets worse. Not only are the filers of frivolous lawsuits not out after three strikes under the Democratic substitute, but the Democratic substitute even changes what a strike is under existing law. Currently Rule 11 contains four criteria that can lead to a Rule 11 violation. The Democratic substitute references only three, kind of like shrinking the strike zone.  Currently, Rule 11 allows sanctions against frivolous filers whose denials of factual contentions are not ``warranted on the evidence'' or are not ``reasonably based on the lack of information and belief.'' The Democratic substitute removes this protection from the victims of frivolous lawsuits under existing law. The Democratic substitute for the first time without penalty allows defendants to file papers with the court that include factual denials of allegations against them that are not warranted by the evidence and not reasonably based. In other words, misleading and unfactual filings end up getting a get-out-of-jail-free card under the Democratic substitute.                              {time}  1400  Instead, the substitute provides additional protection for defendants filing frivolous defenses that are not warranted by the evidence and not reasonably based. This is a step backward for victims of frivolous lawsuits under both State and Federal law.  Further, the base bill provides that those who file frivolous lawsuits can be made to pay all of the costs and attorneys' fees that are ``incurred as a direct result of filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, that is the subject of the violation.'' The Democratic substitute does not include that critical language, which is necessary to make clear that those filing frivolous lawsuits must be made to pay the full costs imposed on their victim by the frivolous lawsuit.  The Democrat substitute also imposes complicated mandates on each State's judicial districts, requiring them to ``develop and implement a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan.'' The Democratic substitute requires States to implement these mandates under exceedingly complex requirements that span all the way from pages 10 to page 15 of the Democratic substitute and requires things like ``systematic, differential treatment of civil cases that tailors the level of individualized and case specific management,'' whatever that means. At a minimum, this is overly burdensome, and may be unconstitutional.  The Democratic substitute requires that States ``develop and implement'' these plans when the Supreme Court has held that ``Congress may not simply commandeer the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a Federal regulatory program.'' That is in New York v. The United States 1992. That is exactly what the Democratic substitute does without any justification under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  The Democratic substitute also completely overrides State laws regarding the sealing of records in all cases, including proceedings in which State laws protect the privacy of sexual abuse victims, including children. And let me repeat this: if the Democratic substitute passes and becomes law, State laws relative to the sealing of court records on sexual abuse cases, including those against minors, can be open to public scrutiny. Shame on you. This blunderbuss provision in the Democratic substitute covers State divorce proceedings, and even all criminal cases, without a showing of why State procedures are inadequate.  The Democratic substitute also retains rule 11's current ``free pass'' provision, which allows lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims simply by withdrawing those claims within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been filed.  Now, let us look at that. A frivolous claim or frivolous filing has been made. You have 21 days after you make it to withdraw it. But meantime, the opposite party has got to go to the legal expense to make the motion to the court to show that the claim is frivolous. And who ends up paying the bill on that? Not the lawyer who filed the frivolous claim, but the defendant and the defendant's lawyers; and that provision actually encourages frivolous lawsuits by allowing unlimited numbers of frivolous pleadings to be filed without penalty. Talk about a loophole big enough to drive the Queen Mary through, that is it.  The Democratic substitute also does not include the bill's essential provisions to prevent the unfair practice of forum shopping.  In short, the Democratic substitute does not provide for three strikes and you are out. It provides for three strikes and you get referred to the State Bar Association that can continue to let the offending attorney practice law. The Democratic substitute even weakens existing law that protects plaintiffs from defendants that file frivolous denials that are not warranted by the evidence and are not reasonably based. The substitute also fails to provide that attorneys' fees be awarded to cover the full costs of responding to a frivolous lawsuit, and the substitute also burdens the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a Federal regulatory program. It overrides State procedures governing the confidentiality of documents in the course of legal proceedings. That is more than three strikes against the Democratic substitute, and it should be soundly defeated.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
