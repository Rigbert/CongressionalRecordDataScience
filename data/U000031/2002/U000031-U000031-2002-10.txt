Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. I urge colleagues to join me in voting decisively in support of this legislation, as we have in the past two Congresses. As a civilized society founded on respect for life, we cannot allow this cruel and dehumanizing procedure to continue.  In these abortions, healthy infants who could survive are brutally killed just a breath away from birth. Although the consensus in the medical community is that this procedure is never necessary to save the life of the mother, this bill does include that exception to the ban.  On many issues that we debate in this body, there are shades of gray and room for honest disagreements on principle and substance. But on this issue, there is no question. There are no shades of gray. Partial birth abortions are acts of evil, pure and simple. They turn the wonder, the miracle, of the birth of a human being into a terrible travesty of horrible death and suffering.  Yesterday, the President and Mrs. Bush announced an adoption initiative to extend the welcome of family to a vulnerable child. Isn't it sadly ironic that we are here today, actually arguing about banning a procedure that dashes the hopes of childless couples for an infant to love and nurture.  The greatness of nation is judged not only by the size of its armies or the strength of its economy, but also by the way it treats its most vulnerable and frail. In the name of simple human decency and of our belief in all this nation must stand for, I call on this body to ban this procedure.
