Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note that tomorrow, on November 8, 2003, will mark the 25th anniversary of enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). At a time when American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and families throughout the country were being ravaged by abusive child welfare practices that caused untold thousands of American Indian and Alaska Native children to be unnecessarily placed in foster homes, adoptive homes and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) boarding schools, the 95th Congress said no more and unanimously adopted the ICWA. I am proud to have been a member when that occurred--truly one of the finest moments in the history of Congress and in my service.  The ICWA stands as perhaps the most important Indian law the Congress has enacted. For the first and only time, Congress explicitly acknowledged that the trust responsibility of the United States extends to ``protecting American Indian and Alaska Native children'' and the integrity of Native American families and tribes, a sine qua non to this Nation's commitment to securing the ``continued existence and integrity'' of Indian tribes as both governments and societies.  The ICWA recognized that tribes have a parens patriae relationship to their children that supersedes any like interest of the States. Accordingly, the law enhances the sovereign right of tribes to determine, under tribal law, whether and under what circumstances children require out-of-home placement. Concomitantly, the law reduces and conditions the authority of States in this regard by compelling an overarching commitment to preventing out-of-home and out-of-tribe placement of American Indian and Alaska Native children. When, as a last resort, placement occurs, the ICWA requires States to make every effort to return American Indian and Alaska Native children to their families and tribal communities. And, when that is not possible, the ICWA mandates that, except in unusual circumstances, these children are preferentially placed in tribal homes.  In the 25 years since enactment, the fulfillment of ICWA's purpose ``to protect the best interest of American Indian and Alaska Native children'' has been remarkable. Tribes have acted forcefully to help keep families intact. Because of the ICWA, many tribes and States have developed significant cooperative relationships aimed at eliminating State child welfare practices harmful to American Indian and Alaska Native families and children and implementing policies and practices targeted at maintaining the integrity of American Indian and Alaska Native families and tribes. As a result, ICWA's promise to benefit the welfare of American Indian and Alaska Native children has benefitted many thousands of these children, enabling them to mature into functioning and contributing citizens of their tribes and of the Nation.  Although the achievements of the ICWA are many and noteworthy, much remains to be done. Full and effective implementation of the ICWA has not occurred either because of deliberate resistance, outright obstruction, ignorance of or inattentiveness to ICWA's requirements, or just misunderstanding the relationship between the ICWA and the requirements of other federal child welfare laws. To address and remedy ICWA implementation problems of most concern to tribes, I introduced H.R. 2750 on July 15, 2003. This measure--  Clarifies that the ICWA applies to all American Indian and Alaska Native children involved in ``child custody proceedings'' (as defined in the ICWA) and defines the minimum efforts that must be undertaken to prevent the breakup of an American Indian or Alaska Native child's family through involuntary out-of-home placement.  Requires detailed notice to American Indian and Alaska Native tribes in all voluntary child custody proceedings, to parents in voluntary adoption proceedings, and to parents and tribes in all involuntary proceedings.  Clarifies the right of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes to intervene in all voluntary state court custody proceedings, provided that the tribe files a notice of intent to intervene or a written objection within 45 days of receiving notice of a voluntary termination of parental rights or within 100 days of receiving notice of a particular adoptive placement, and certifies that a child is a member, eligible for membership, or is the child of a member.  Requires notice to extended family members and recognizes their right to intervene in state child custody proceedings.  Requires attorneys, public and private agencies to provide detailed information to American Indian and Alaska Native parents of their rights under ICWA.  Limits parents' rights to withdraw consent to an adoption to 6 months after relinquishment of the child or 30 days after the filing of an adoption petition, whichever is later.  Clarifies tribal jurisdiction in Alaska.  Facilitates the ability of tribes without reservations, including tribes in Alaska and Oklahoma or with disestablished reservations, to assume jurisdiction over child custody proceedings.  Narrows the grounds upon which state courts can refuse to transfer cases to tribal courts.  Clarifies tribal court authority over children transferred to tribal court jurisdiction.  Defines the circumstances under which state ICWA violations may be reviewed by federal courts and provides for federal review of state ICWA compliance.  Provides for criminal sanctions for anyone who assists a person to lie about their American Indian and Alaska Native ancestry for the purpose of avoiding application of the ICWA.  Allows state courts to enter enforceable orders providing for visitation or contact between tribes, natural parents, extended family and an adopted child.  Extends ICWA (in some cases) to cover children of state recognized and Canadian Indian tribes, and children who reside or are domiciled on a reservation and are the child of a member, but who are not eligible for tribal membership.  Makes it easier to American Indian and Alaska Native adoptees to gain access to their birth records.  Establishes that foster and adoptive homes licensed or approved by American Indian and Alaska Native tribes in compliance with the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act shall satisfy the requirements for foster and adoptive home licensing under any other federal law.  Clarifies that the terms of tribal-state agreements regarding the care and custody of and jurisdiction over American Indian and Alaska Native children shall be controlling even when another federal law may have different requirements.  On this 25th anniversary of the ICWA, I urge my colleagues to take another historic step and enact H.R. 2750. Enactment would assure that on ICWA's 50th anniversary, American Indian and Alaska Native families are strong, their children are healthy and their communities are thriving. For the betterment of our Nation and all of its people, our legacy should be no less.                          ____________________
