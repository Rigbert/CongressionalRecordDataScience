President, let me start off by saying that there is nothing wrong with arms control in principle, but there are a lot of reasons to oppose the START II treaty. The treaty does not destroy a single Russian warhead. It talks about downgrading, reducing, downloading, retiring, converting--all actions that can be reversed. The Russians do not have to destroy the warheads.  I wondered also what would happen to those warheads if Russia should decide to comply with the START II treaty--this is a big ``if,'' since they have not complied with other treaties--but if they did, what would happen to those warheads if they were, for example, to download them?  We all know the financial needs of the former Soviet Union, Russia in particular. And we also know that there is a market for those warheads in hostile areas of the world--in the Middle East, North Korea, China, all throughout the world. You have to ask: what would happen to those warheads? We are looking at an agreement that allows Russia to continue modernization, build heavy missiles for 7 more years, and new submarine-launched missiles, and new land missiles, including a hard-to-find mobile missile that even the United States does not have. It allows them to conduct aggressive military exercises and to increase anti-U.S. intelligence.  I feel that no effective verification or enforcement could be put in place with this treaty, even if the Russians should comply with it. But let us look at the history. People assume they are going to comply with the START II treaty but they did not comply with the START I treaty, they did not comply with the biological weapons convention, with the chemical weapons convention, the INF treaty, the ABM Treaty. Just around Christmastime Pavel Grachev, who is the Minister of Defense for Russia, made a statement that they did not intend to comply with our Conventional Forces Europe treaty, the CFE treaty.  Their reason for not complying, he said, was that the CFE Treaty was not a treaty made between the United States and Russia, but between the United States and the USSR. I would ask why, if that is true, are we so compelled to comply with the ABM Treaty, which also was not between the United States and Russia, but was ratified in 1972 when Russia was still the Soviet Union? So I have to ask the question, why is it so important, at this particular time, to have the START II treaty?  Let us look at what has happened just recently. I know we all rejoiced just a few years ago when Boris Yeltsin and the reformers took control. But look what happened just in the last election, last December, of the Duma. The Communists, now, have 157 seats; Boris Yeltsin and the Reform Party, only 55 seats; the person I think most people here dread more than anyone else, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, his party, the Ultranationalists, took 51 seats. So he is almost even with Yeltsin's party, and it is just one-third of what the Communists now have. So, it is a totally different environment right now in Russia from 1993, when the START II treaty was signed by President Bush and President Yeltsin.  I think, when you realize that we are ratifying a flawed agreement with a country that has never lived up to previous agreements, and that we are accepting Russia's demands that we remain naked to missile attacks from all over the world, that this is wrong.  On December 28 President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization bill. His prime objection to this bill was that we were spending money on a national missile defense system. In his message he declared that this might violate the 1972 ABM Treaty, which prevents the deployment of a multiple-site missile defense system in the United States. Clinton stated that the missile defense plan ``* * * puts the United States policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty and puts at risk continued Russian implementation of the START I treaty and Russian ratification of the START II treaty.''  Our President rejects a national missile defense system. He says that U.S. national security in the post-cold-war world rests on two treaties, the ABM Treaty and the START treaty, both negotiated at the height of the cold war. That is the linkage the President is making. We can argue whether or not there is a linkage between the ABM Treaty and the START II treaty, but in fact the President thinks there is. He has stated that there is, and he accepts the Russians' linkage between these treaties, which says that we must abide by one, the ABM Treaty, to get the other, the START treaty.  You might ask yourself the question: why is it that Russia is so interested in those two treaties? First of all, I have serious doubts that they would comply with the START II treaty. Maybe they have doubts that they would, too. But it seems to me they are bent on our agreeing to reduce our nuclear capability, which they would do to, and at the same time they are even more interested in the ABM Treaty. I think this is something we really have not talked about enough.  The ABM Treaty was one that was put together in a Republican administration. It was Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger's project. Dr. Kissinger was the architect of the ABM Treaty of 1972. In 1972 we had two superpowers in this world. Mr. President, we could identify who the enemy was. At that time it seemed to be a good idea. I did not agree with it at the time, but I certainly did not question the wisdom of President Nixon and of Dr. Kissinger, because it seemed that a policy of mutual assured destruction was in the best interests of the United States. Simply put, that is a policy that says: we agree not to defend ourselves and not to implement a national missile defense system if you agree to do the same thing. That way, the risk of complete destruction keeps us from attacking each other.  You may believe that this was not a good idea at the time. I did not think it was a good idea. But there is certainly some justification for it.  That is not the environment that we are in today. In fact, Henry Kissinger himself has said that it is insane to continue with this type of policy in today's environment when you have the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction all throughout the world. It was Kissinger who said, and this is a direct quote: ``It is nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''  People have made several references to the fact that President Reagan actually started some of the START negotiations. But I would recall the 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Iceland. It was really the defining moment in the cold war. Gorbachev proposed to eliminate all nuclear weapons and everyone was all excited. But then he established the condition that President Reagan would have to kill the Strategic Defense Initiative, a plan for a national missile defense system. In other words, he said we will agree to doing away with and destroying all nuclear weapons if you agree to make yourself vulnerable to an attack.  Reagan walked away from the bad agreement in order to save the United States missile defense program. We are faced with the same choice. Our President currently is embracing that very notion that Reagan rejected, even though, since 1986, the missile threat has greatly increased and Russia has violated treaty after treaty. We have to ask, what is so good about the tradeoff now?  Mr. President, I will make this brief because I have made this statement on the floor so many times before. I have deep concern about what is happening right now with our attitude toward a national missile defense system. It is kind of interesting--all these people who come in and want to talk about how bad a national missile defense system is always use such words as ``Star Wars,'' trying to make it look like something that is mythical, something that is science fiction. In fact, anyone who was watching TV during the Persian Gulf war knows that the technology of knocking missiles down with missiles is something that is alive and well.  President Clinton appointed Jim Woolsey to be CIA Director, and he was certainly privileged to more information, or as much as anyone else in the world, concerning this Nation's defense. And he said that there are between 20 and 25 nations around the world who currently have, or are developing, weapons of mass destruction, either nuclear, chemical, or biological, and are developing the missile means to deliver those weapons of mass destruction.  So there is a greater threat. Most people who are watching the security scene today believe there is a greater threat facing America today than there was during the cold war, because now we are not talking about one enemy, we are talking about 25 or so countries that are developing this technology.  If anyone is comfortable in what is happening right now, I suggest that you read last Wednesday's New York Times. I will not submit this for the Record because I did so yesterday when I first read it. I was still in some degree of shock. The New York Times provides fresh evidence of the folly of leaving America vulnerable to ballistic missile attack.  In an article entitled--listen to this--``As China threatens Taiwan, it makes sure United States listens--'' the Times reports on ominous information recently passed to National Security Adviser Anthony Lake concerning measures being taken by Beijing to facilitate military action against Taiwan, and points to statements intended to detour the United States from coming to Taipei's assistance. Referring to Charles Freeman--he is a former U.S. Ambassador to China, now Assistant Secretary of Defense--the article reports that ``A Chinese official told him of the advanced state of military planning and that preparations for a missile attack on Taiwan and the target selection to carry it out have been completed and await final decision by the politburo in Beijing.'' Freeman reportedly told Lake that ``A Chinese official asserted that China could act militarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention by the United States because American leaders `care more about' ''--listen to this--``Los Angeles than they do Taiwan.'' That statement Mr. Freeman characterized as an indirect threat by China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.  Mr. President, this is the environment we are in today. Today the Senate is considering a treaty, START II, that will further endanger our country because the President and the Russians link it to the ABM Treaty, which precludes our country from defending itself against missile attack.  I would like to submit something for the Record. It was in the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial called, ``The ABM Treaty's Threat,'' on January 2.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Wall Street Journal, January 2, 1996]                        The ABM Treaty's Threat       With his veto of the 1996 defense bill last week, President      Clinton just made the world a more dangerous place. If      there's a silver lining, it is that it sets down an important      political marker for this year's presidential campaign. GOP      upstart Steve Forbes also put down a marker last week,      castigating Bob Dole and the Senate for their apparent      willingness to ratify the Start II treaty--a ``further      pretext,'' Mr. Forbes said, for the ``policy of leaving the      American people vulnerable to missile attack.       Given the current Senate, the President's veto is almost      certain to be sustained, hamstringing the effort to build      critically needed defenses against ballistic missile attack.      Millions of Americans may pay for his decision with their      lives, when some future commander-in-chief lacks the means to      shoot down a ballistic missile heading on a lethal trajectory      for an American city. By vetoing the bill, Mr. Clinton also      shows that he has no viable strategy for dealing with the      changed nuclear realities of the post-Cold War world--     realities that are discussed nearby by former Reagan Defense      official Fred C. Ikle.       The Administration, to the extent it's thinking at all      instead of repeating Democratic Party rote, remains mired in      an obsolete mindset that sees Moscow as our main foe and      regards arms control and ``mutual assured destruction'' as      the centerpiece of policy. Mr. Clinton's principal objection      to the GOP defense bill is that by requiring deployment of a      missile-defense system by 2003 it would violate the 1972      Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty under which the U.S. and the      Soviet Union agreed not to defend themselves against missile      attack.       The Republican bill is ``on a collision course with the ABM      treaty,'' Mr. Clinton said in his veto message. That, as we      see it, is precisely the point. The ABM Treaty is a grave      danger to national security and the United States ought to      exercise its prerogative to withdraw. If any progress toward      defense is to be made, every Republican Presidential      candidate ought to pledge to give the required notice on his      first day in office.       We thought back in 1972 that agreeing not to defend against      missile attack was a reckless promise, but today any vestige      of a rationale has vanished. More than two-dozen nations      already possess ballistic missiles and a number will soon      have missiles capable of reaching across the Atlantic or the      Pacific. It's not hard to imagine that Washington or San      Francisco would make tempting targets for a lunatic leader in      one of the Iraqs or North Koreas of the world. When that      happens, it will be too late to start building a missile      defense.       The ABM Treaty is just one relic of the Cold War that Mr.      Clinton is intent on preserving. He further objects that it      would derail his arms-control efforts, keeping the Russian      Duma from ratifying Start II, under which Russia would reduce      its nuclear arsenal to 3,500 warheads from about 8,000.      Whatever the Duma does, it looks likely that the U.S. Senate      will ratify Salt II three years after it was signed by      Presidents Bush and Yeltsin. Perfunctory debate ended last      week and a vote is expected soon. Mr. Forbes, free of the      impact of past habit, is one of the few Republican voices      urging against ratification.       Yet with few exceptions, Republicans do believe that      defending America against missile attack ought to be a      national priority. Their Congress has put forward a workable      and affordable plan toward that goal. On the other hand, we      have a President who's decided that it is more important to      the security of the United States to reduce the number of      Russian nuclear warheads than to have the capability to      defend ourselves against missile attack from the madmen of      the world.       As for Start II, somehow we don't find it very comforting      to contemplate a world in which the Russians have 4,500 fewer      scary things tucked away in their arsenal but a Saddam      Hussein has one that he intends to use on us. Clearly it's      time for a new security strategy. It will require more, but      missile defense will be a cornerstone. Mr. Ikle argues that      to wake the world to this obvious need may well take a      nuclear explosion, either accidental or deliberate.
