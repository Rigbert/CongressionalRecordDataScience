Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor that I rise to celebrate Black History Month and its 2000 theme--Heritage and Horizons, the African-American Legacy and the Challenges of the 21st century. As I consider this year's theme, I reflect on this great nation's African-American heritage, and anticipate a multitude of future accomplishments in the new millennium.  As we reflect on the great African-American contributions made to our nation's history, I would like to draw your attention to some individuals who were the first in representing the African-American community in Indiana's First Congressional District: William Burke, the first African-American police officer in Gary; Lonnie Bolden, the first African-American firefighter in Gary; Bernard Carter, the first African-American Prosecutor in Lake County; and Rudy Clay, the first African-American State Senator.  These individuals, the trailblazers for our future leaders, had the courage and initiative to set high aspirations, achieve their goals, and become role models for our youth. We must recognize this great African-American heritage, honor our African-American pioneers and celebrate their accomplishments. However, we must stop there. We are at the dawn of a new century.  A true role model for today's youth is Karen Freeman-Wilson of Indiana's First Congressional District. Karen, a native of Gary, recalls showing her seventh grade report card to her father. Her grades included 5 ``A's'' and one ``B''. After indicating his pleasure, her father told her if she brought up the ``B'' and continued to work hard, she could achieve any goal she could conceive. She became the 1978 valedictorian for Gary Roosevelt High School, the first in her family to attend college, and in 1985, a graduate of Harvard Law School. She then returned to her home in Lake County to confront new challenges as a deputy prosecutor and later a public defender. From 1989 to 1992, she headed the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, guiding legislation which made Indiana the first state in the nation to pass fair housing laws aligned with the federal government's. She also brought Indiana law into alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Karen was appointed a Gary Circuit Court judge in 1994, the first African-American to serve in that position. As a judge, she developed programs to combat drug addiction, gang involvement and teen smoking. In addition, she has worked with Gary pediatrician Dr. Steve Simpson to establish a home for babies born addicted to crack cocaine.  On February 21, 2000, Karen Freeman-Wilson confronted her latest challenge when she was appointed to be the youngest Indiana State Attorney General. As Attorney General, Karen vows to continue her efforts to protect children, the elderly, and victims of rape and domestic violence, while providing quality legal representation of all the people of Indiana.  Karen clearly states that she owes her personal and professional success to many influential leaders and activists who paved the way before her. Now, Karen Freeman-Wilson is paving the way for young African-American children to confront and conquer new challenges.  I would also like to draw your attention to two distinguished African-American youths who have emerged victorious after facing many difficulties and will lead us into the 21st century. Dominic Adams, a junior at Lew Wallace High School in Gary, is currently serving as a Congressional page. Dominic is a member of the male role model program at his high school, head of the school newspaper, and a member of the Christ Baptist Church youth choir.  Another distinguished young person is Andrea Ledbetter, a senior at Emerson High School in Gary. She recently won a national Target scholarship. Andrea is involved in many activities including the Gary Youth NAACP Chapter, U.S. People to People Student Ambassador Program, Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program, Academic Super Bowl team, and Governor O'Bannon's Indiana Point of Youth Program. As a part of a citywide Stop-the-Violence rally in Gary, Andrea was instrumental in recruiting cheerleaders from each of the area high schools to provide routines aimed at increasing the peace. In addition, Andrea is an outstanding academic student, ranked number one in her class with a grade point average of 4.10 on a four-point scale. Andrea and Dominic are fine representatives of their high schools in Gary, of Indiana's First Congressional District, and of Future African-American leaders.  As we celebrate Black History Month, let us all continue our work together. Let us celebrate our country's African-American heritage and commemorate it. Let us address the challenges of the 21st century, encouraging and helping our young African-Americans to achieve success.                          ____________________
