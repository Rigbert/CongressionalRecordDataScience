 Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a resolution on Social Security. The following was agreed upon by both houses of the Vermont General Assembly on the 13th of May, 1999.  I call the attention of my colleagues to this resolution and submit the resolution to the Congressional Record for their benefit.                               J.R.H. 113  Joint resolution requesting congress to protect and preserve Social                                 Security       Offered by: Representatives Corren of Burlington, Aswad of      Burlington, Bouricius of Burlington, Darrow of Newfane,      Darrow of Dummerston, Hingtgen of Burlington, Jordan of      Middlesex, Keenan of St. Albans City, Kreitzer of Rutland      City, Nuovo of Middlebury, Smith of Sudbury, Sullivan of      Burlington, Sweetser of Essex, Valsangiacomo of Barre City,      Vinton of Colchester, Wheeler of Burlington and Zuckerman of      Burlington.       Whereas, the purpose of Social Security is to provide a      strong, simple and efficient form of basic insurance against      the adversities of old age, disability and dependency, and       Whereas, for 60 years Social Security has provided a stable      platform of retirement, disability and survivor annuity      benefits to protect working Americans and their dependents,      and       Whereas, the costs to administer Social Security are less      than one percent of the benefits delivered, and       Whereas, the American and world economies continue to      encounter periods of high uncertainty and volatility that      make it as important as ever to preserve a basic and      continuing safety net of protections guaranteed by our      society's largest guarantor of risk, the federal government,      and       Whereas, Social Security affords protections to rich and      poor alike and no citizen, no matter how well-off today, can      foretell tomorrow's adversities, and       Whereas, average life expectancies are increasing and      people are commonly living into their 80's and 90's, making      it more important than ever that each of us be fully      protected by defined retirement benefits, and       Whereas, medical scientists are continually developing new      ways to maintain and enhance the lives of people with severe      disabilities, thus making it more important that each of us      to be protected against the risk of dependency,      institutionalization and impoverishment, and       Whereas, the lives of wage earners and their spouses are      seldom coterminous; one often outlives the other by decades,      making it crucial to preserve a secure base of protection for      children and other family members dependent on a wage earner      who may die or become disabled, and       Whereas, Social Security, in current form, reinforces      family cohesiveness and enhances the value of work in our      society, and       Whereas, Congress currently has proposals to shift a      portion of Social Security contributions from insurance to      personal investment accounts for each wage earner, and       Whereas, Social Security, our largest and most fundamental      insurance system, cannot fulfill its protective function if      it is splintered into individualized stock accounts and must      create and manage millions of small risk-bearing investments      out of a stream of contributions intended as insurance, and       Whereas, private accounts cannot be substituted for Social      Security without eroding basic protections for working      families, since such protections, to be strong, must be      insulated from economic uncertainty and be backed by the      entity best capable of spreading risk, the federal      government, and       Whereas, the diversion of contributions to private      investment accounts would dramatically increase financial      shortfalls to the Social Security trust fund and require      major reductions in the defined benefits upon which millions      of Americans depend; and       Whereas, to administer 150 million separate investment      accounts would require a larger bureaucracy, and the      resulting expense and the cost of converting each account to      an annuity upon retirement would consume much of the profit      or exacerbate the loss realized by each participant, and       Whereas, the question of whether part of the Social      Security Trust Fund should be diversified into investments      other than government bonds so that, while still invested      collectively at low expense, returns may be increased, thus      enhancing the capacity of the fund to meet its obligations to      pay benefits while spreading the risk across the entire      spectrum of Social Security participants, is entirely      different from that of splintering its millions of accounts,      and       Whereas, creating an array of winners and losers would be      contrary to the basic principles of insurance and risk      distribution, thus defeating the purpose of this part of our      retirement system, and       Whereas, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to      provide a full menu of provisions that enables working      Americans and their employers to voluntarily contribute to      tax-sheltered accounts that are open to the opportunities and      exposed to the risks of investment markets, diverting Social      Security contributions to private accounts duplicates      existing programs, and       Whereas, such recently created systems now cover half of      American families, now therefore be it       Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives:       That the General Assembly respectfully and strongly urges      Congress not to enact laws that might tend to diminish or      undermine a unified and stable Social Security system, and be      it further       Resolved: That laws to encourage workers and their      employers to save or invest for retirement should supplement      and not substitute for the basic benefits of Social Security      insurance that are vital to American working families, and be      it further       Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a      copy of this resolution to the President of the United States      Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the      United States and each member of the Vermont Congressional      Delegation.                               ____________________
