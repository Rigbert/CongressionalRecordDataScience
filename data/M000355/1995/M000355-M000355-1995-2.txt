 President, it is my pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian and a record-breaking quarterback. Tim Couch ended his high school football career on a high note with a 1-yard touchdown pass during the state quarterfinals. Some may wonder what is so special about this play. Well, that pass will go down in the record books as the one that put the Leslie County High School quarterback over the top as the national all-time leader in touchdown passes. In 4 years, he has thrown an amazing 12,092 yards--an accomplishment that helped earn Tim honors as National High School Player of the Year.  Leslie County is located in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. The last time the national spotlight shone on the small town of Hyden was in 1978, when President Nixon made his first public appearance since his resignation. He was there to attend a dedication of a gym named in his honor. According to local newspapers, residents said it was an exciting day, because everyone in the nation knew about Hyden. And now history has repeated itself, but this time the spotlight is shining there because of the youth who's become known as ``the pride of Hyden'' --Tim Couch.  His final game as Leslie County High School quarterback was a memorable one in many ways. Besides breaking the passing record, Tim faced a consistent seven-man rush, he injured his right ankle trying to block an extra point, and he was sacked five times. But check out his numbers: he completed 17 of 34 passes for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns. After the record-breaking pass, the game came to a halt. Fans and the media stormed the field to ask Tim for autographs and interviews. Fireworks lit up the night sky, and sirens and horns filled the air. And before the game resumed, Tim was handed the game ball. What a night!  Every time Tim took to the gridiron, the entire town of Hyden flocked to Eagle Field to watch the ``Air Commander'' throw another pass on his way to the record books. Sports Illustrated recently did a profile of the star quaterback. In the article, Tim said of his 374 fellow Hyden residents, ``everybody around here is just so happy. They all want to see me go to the NFL and become a big star. It gives me a lot of pride, the way such a small place has rallied around one person.''  If you think football is his only game, think again! Not only is Tim an award-winning quarterback, he is also one of the best high school basketball players in Kentucky. He led the state in scoring last season, with 36 points a game, and he is one of the front runners in the race for Kentucky's Mr. Basketball. No wonder he's being recruited by the top colleges in the Nation. However, it is my hope that this superstar decides to stay in the Bluegrass State and make one of Kentucky's fine universities his new home.  Mr. President and my fellow Members of Congress, please join me in congratulating the ``Pride of Hyden.'' Tim Couch has an exciting career ahead of him, and I wish him good luck in the future. Mr. President, I also ask that an article from a recent edition of Sports Illustrated be printed the Record.  The article follows:                             Pride of Hyden                           (By Steve Rushin)       Elbert Couch parks his white Ford Bronco next to another      emblem of American infamy: the Richard M. Nixon Recreation      Center in Hyden, Ky. ``There's two kinds around here,'' Couch      says. ``There's Republicans, and there's Damn Democrats. I'm      a Damn Democrat, but we're outnumbered four to one in this      county.''       This is Leslie County, in the mountains of eastern      Kentucky's Cumberland Plateau. It was here, in 1978, that      Nixon made his first postexile public appearance, for the      dedication of a grand gymnasium that honors his presidency.      ``Everybody knew us because of Nixon,'' says Leslie County      High School basketball coach Ron Stidham, standing on his      home court inside the Tricky Dick. ``But that notoriety      aside, Tim Couch has made Hyden--well, if not a household      name exactly, at least people know where we are again.''       Tim Couch, Elbert's son, is the best high school basketball      player in Kentucky. He led the state in scoring last season,      with 36 points a game as a Leslie County High junior. He is      expected to be named Mr. Basketball of the Bluegrass after      this season, which is why most Division I basketball coaches      want to upholster Couch in their school colors come 1996.       Trouble is, Tim is also the most highly sought after      football recruit in the nation, one who almost certainly will      break the national record for career passing yardage this      Friday night in the state quarterfinals. He is 50 yards away      from breaking the mark of 11,700 set two years ago by Josh      Booty of Evangel Christian High in Shreveport, La., and Couch      needs only five touchdown passes to break that national      record as well. ``Couch is the best quarterback prospect I've      seen in 17 years,'' drools Tom Lemming, who publishes a      national recruiting newsletter. ``Better than Jeff George,      Ron Powlus and Peyton Manning. He reminds recruiters of John      Elway.'' ESPN draft nitwit Mel Kiper Jr. agrees and considers      Tim, who is 6'5'' and 215 pounds, one of the best pro      quarterback prospects in the nation. And to think that Tim is      just 18.       ``Everybody around here is just so happy,'' Tim says of      Hyden (pop. 375). ``They all want to see me go to the NFL and      become a big star. It gives me a lot of pride, the way such a      small place has rallied around one person.''       Through it all Tim has remained unfailingly polite,      genuinely humble and undeniably charismatic. Everywhere one      goes in Kentucky, people talk about the closely-cropped      Couch. He's like Gump, with a pump fake. And there's another      important difference: ``He's an A-B student,'' says Leslie      County High principal Omus Shepherd. ``In fact, to see him in      school, you wouldn't know he's an athlete, you wouldn't know      him from any other student. I don't know of any problem we've      ever had out of the boy.''       The boy was excused from class one afternoon early in the      football season when Governor Brereton Jones came to Hyden to      make Tim an honorary Kentucky Colonel, one of the youngest      recipients of the state's equivalent of knighthood. The      next evening the colonel threw for three touchdowns and      ran for two more in a 34-27 win a Woodford County High,      after which several opponents wanted a piece of him. ``I      saw them coming at me and thought we were in a fight,''      says Tim. Instead, they wanted his autograph.       The next day Tim drove 124 miles to Lexington to watch the      Kentucky-Louisville football game with his folks. En route,      they stopped at a diner. Recently retired Los Angeles Laker      center and former Kentucky star Sam Bowie approached Tim's      table to say how much he has enjoyed following Tim's career.      Emboldened, Adolph Rupp's grandson Chip, who also happened to      be in the diner, did the same. After the game the Couches      repaired to the Lexington home of Miami Heat guard and ex-     Wildcat star Rex Chapman, who simply wanted to meet Tim.       ``I told him he was my hero growing up,'' Tim says of      Chapman. ``I told him how I dreamed in the backyard about      filling his shoes some day at Kentucky.''       ``Tim used to shoot baskets outside for hours in the      winter, until his fingers were      bleeding,'' says Tim's mother, Janice. ``I always had to make him come      in before he got frostbite.''       Come summer, he would throw footballs all afternoon with      his older--by four years--brother, Greg. Tim always pretended      to be Joe Montana or Dan Marino. Now, Marino aspires to play      with Couch. ``I hope I'm still in the league when you get      here,'' the Miami Dolphin quarterback told Couch when the two      met in Cincinnati, where the Dolphins played the Bengals on      Oct. 1.       Tim never played baseball. ``He told me in ninth grade,      `Dad, I don't want to stand there and let them throw a ball      60 miles an hour at my head,''' recalls Elbert, who is      director of transportation for the county school system. When      Greg became the quarterback at Leslie County High, Tim      attended practices. ``In fifth and sixth grade he was      throwing the ball like a rocket,'' says Eagle football coach      Joe Beder, an assistant at the time. ``You knew then he would      be the quarterback here.''       Couch made the high school team as a seventh-grader, backed      up his brother as an eighth-grader and became the starting      quarterback as a freshman, when Greg went to play football at      Eastern Kentucky (where, after redshirtings one season, he's      now a junior reserve). Tim points to the utility pole in the      front yard of his family's comfortable two-story home. ``When      Greg went to college, I used to throw at that light pole,''      he says. ``I'd take a five-steps drop and try to hit it as if      it was a receiver on the run, 30 feet out.'' Then he would      place two garbage cans next to each other and throw ``little      fade passes'' over the first defending can and into the      second. ``There's not much else to do in Hyden,'' says Todd      Crawford, a physician's assistant who works with the Leslie      County team.       So the Hydenites watch Couch. County judge-executive Onzie      Sizemore was a star high school quarterback in Hyden in the      early 1970s. ``Time is the best athlete I've ever seen in      Kentucky,'' says the judge, deliberating on Tim down at the      county court and jailhouse. ``He's the best thing that ever      happened to Hyden. I just hope he doesn't run for county      judge-executive, because then I'm out of a job.''       They come from all over Kentucky to see Tim play. On Friday      nights cars back up for a mile at the toll booth that guards      the Hyden exit of the Daniel Boone Parkway. And when the      Eagles play an away game, says Rick Hensley, whose son Ricky      is Tim's favorite target, ``last one outta town turns out the      lights.''       There is a sign outside of town that reads Hyden: Home of      Osborne Bros. Stars of the Grand Ole Opry, the Osbornes wrote      ``Rocky Top,'' which is the football anthem at Tennessee,      whose Volunteers are unanimously reviled in Kentucky. When      Tim engineered a season-opening 44-42 upset of Fort Thomas      Highlands High in Lexington, he came home to find      that benevolent vandals had altered the sign so it read      Hyden: Home of Tim Couch.       This season Couch has thrown for nearly 3,500 yards and 37      touchdowns in 12 games. Clearly, his numbers are      preposterous. Last year he completed 75.1% of his passes, a      national record. Against Clark County High in the 1994 season      opener, he completed 25 of 27 passes. Against Shelby Valley      High this fall, he threw for 533 yards and seven scores and      was pulled four minutes into the second half. Likewise, in      October he played only one half against one of Kentucky's      top-ranked teams, Hopkinsville, when the badly outmanned      Eagles were bused seven hours each way and lost 61-0.       Even that defeat didn't cool the ardor of the Couch      potatoes, as Hyden's residents have come to call themselves.      As he drives home from football practice in his Mercury      Cougar on an autumn Thursday, Couch waves like a parade      marshal to every passing pedestrian, then enters his house      and is handed the telephone. ``Tennessee,'' says Janice, and      Tim chats cordially with Volunteer football coach Phillip      Fulmer. Bobby Bowden, Terry Bowden, Lou Holtz and Joe Paterno      check in weekly as well.       There is enormous pressure on him to play football at      Kentucky, and the Cats are on Couch like cats on a couch.      Here is a front-page Lexington Herald-Leader headline: Couch      To Watch UK Scrimmage. Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino      met with Tim and promised him a spot on the basketball team      if he sign to play football for the Wildcats. And Kentucky      football coach Bill Curry, although forbidden by the NCAA to      talk about recruits, called him ``the best high school      prospect I've ever seen.'' Every Omus, Onzie and Elbert in      Kentucky expects Tim to make the Cats an instant football      power. ``I may be crazy, but I believe Tim Couch is good      enough to get this program back to the Sugar Bowl,'' writes      columnist Dave Barker in The Cats' Pause, a Kentucky sports      weekly. ``Yes, that's right. From 1-10 to 10-1.''       ``Lord God, if Tim goes to UK they'll be namin' babies for      him before he plays his first game,'' says Elbert's friend      Vic DeSimone. ``Every kid in Kentucky will wear a number 2      jersey.'' DeSimone--a candy manufacturer's rep who has      dropped by Leslie County High to chat--furrows his brow      before giving voice to every Kentuckian's darkest fear. ``You      wouldn't let him go to Tennessee, would you?'' he asks      Elbert. ``I mean, the boy can go to Liberty Baptist and still      become a pro.''       ``Have to take the Fifth Amendment on that one,'' says      Elbert, who later concedes: ``If Tim does go out of state,      we'll have to move out of state.''       Wherever Couch goes, if he plays basketball at all in      college, it will be as an afterthought to football, and a      great many disappointed people will be left in his wake.      ``It's hard for an 18-year-old kid to tell a coach whom he's      grown up adoring that he isn't going to play for him,'' says      Tim, who is still considering Auburn, Florida, Kentucky,      Notre Dame, Ohio State and (sigh) Tennessee. ``I'm thinking      about it all the time,'' he says of his impending decision.      ``Even if I'm just lying in bed, it never leaves my mind.''       He has made certain of that. Taped above the light switch      in his bedroom is a two-sentence note from a football      assistant at Northwestern. ``Your talent is God's gift to      you,'' it reads. ``What you do with your talent is your gift      back to God.''       It is the last thing that Tim sees each night when he turns      out the lights.                          ____________________
