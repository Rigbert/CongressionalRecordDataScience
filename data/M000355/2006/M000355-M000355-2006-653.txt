 President, the official Senate photograph of the 109th Congress will be tomorrow. We need to encourage everyone to be prompt and to be in their seats at the appropriate time right after the policy luncheons.  Today, the Senate turned to the Department of Defense authorization bill. Senators who have amendments should be consulting the bill managers so they can get in the queue to offer their amendments. We can expect the first vote of the day tomorrow afternoon at 12:15. This vote will be on the Zarqawi amendment to the Defense authorization bill.  Senators are reminded that tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., we will have a cloture vote on the Stickler nomination; that is, to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration. This week we also will address an emergency supplemental appropriations conference report. And, finally, for the third time I reiterate, the photograph for the 109th Congress, for the Senate, will be tomorrow at 2:15 p.m., and we ask that all Senators be seated in the Chamber no later than 2:15, right after the policy lunches.                          ____________________
