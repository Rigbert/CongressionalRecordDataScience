 President, I would like to briefly respond to Senator Lee's comments.  I understand the reasons for which he is opposing this nominee. I would again point out that, in my opinion, based on what I heard the distinguished Senator say, it has nothing to do with the nominee. It has to do with a peripheral issue. I would hope a majority of the Senate would understand this is a totally noncontroversial, totally capable, totally qualified, and totally good nominee. To hold her confirmation hostage is something that doesn't redound well on this body.  This is a judicial emergency in the Southern District of California, and we need to get this judge approved. So while I appreciate the Senator's comments--I think most of us are well aware of the feelings on the other side--I think somehow, some way, we have to come together and prevent what is happening. And what is happening is, if I don't get my way on something, I am going to hold up appointments, I am going to hold up confirmations, and I am going to do whatever I can to show I have power to disrupt this body.  In essence, the body can be disrupted. We know that.
