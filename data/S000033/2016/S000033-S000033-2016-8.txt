 President, to commemorate Public Recognition Week, the Vermont Federal Executive Association--VTFEA--recognized the more than 4,000 Federal employees working across the State and the good work they do every day. I would like to offer special congratulations to the 2016 Excellence in Government award winners, who have been recognized by VTFEA for their exemplary government service: Vermont Federal Team of the Year Award, The Northwest Vermont Locality Pay Committee--Brandon Ackel, Transportation Security Administration; Robert Brugman, National Credit Union Administration; Brian Johansson, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Kelly Larsen, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaska; Bruce McDonald, Transportation Security Administration; Sean McVey, U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Mark Nielsen, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Jeff Ostlund, Transportation Security Administration; Corey Price, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Texas; Lisa Rees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Diana Richardson, Federal Aviation Administration; Krista Scheele, Transportation Security Administration.  In November 2012, VTFEA discussed what initiatives would benefit the most Federal employees, and it didn't take long to realize that securing locality pay for Vermont was the No. 1 priority. In early 2013, VTFEA created a Locality Pay Committee, consisting of employees from six Federal agencies. Working tirelessly, the team prepared a locality pay proposal for northwest Vermont and, in December 2013, presented it to the Federal Salary Council in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the first proposal was denied, so the following year, they tried again. Again, the proposal was denied. Not to be discouraged, the team drafted a third proposal in November 2015, and committee members traveled to Washington at their own expense to support the package and their fellow Vermonters. At the hearing, the council approved the package, which is waiting for approval by the President's pay agent and the President. The Northwest Vermont Locality Pay Committee's tenacity, collaborative spirit, and positivity is why Vermont is being considered for locality pay. And it is because of their efforts that VTFEA chose them as Federal Team of the Year.                          ____________________
