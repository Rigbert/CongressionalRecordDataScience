Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Alvin Kreuz of Delta, Ohio. Al passed from this life on May 20 after being given 80 years surrounded by his loving family.  Al Kreuz was born in Swanton, Ohio to Jacob and Melvina Kreuz. He was the second youngest in a family of eleven children. After graduating high school, Al enlisted in the United States Army where he served from 1955 to 1957. After coming home, he married his wife Charlotte in 1959. Together over the next 57 years Al and Char raised a family of their own: sons Mike, Gary and Alvin John Jr and daughters, Laurie, Becky and Barbie. As the years passed they were later blessed with fourteen grandchildren.  Though he spent his professional career with Sohio Company and later in partnership at Toledo Radiator and Glass, Al's true passion as a businessman was his forty year career as owner and operator of Smith's Restaurant in Wauseon, Ohio. Just off the turnpike, featuring delicious home-cooked fare and outstanding pies, everyone in Fulton County and even further knew of Smith's Restaurant and Al and Char Kreuz and their family.  Long a business leader, Al had a strong commitment to community and wanted to serve his fellow citizens. He did so as an elected politician, serving three terms as a Fulton County Commissioner. As his obituary noted, `` `Vote for the man, not the party' was his slogan that earned him the distinction in 1980 of being the first Democrat elected in Fulton County in 48 years!'' His tenure was marked by compassion and a devotion to the county and people he served. Fulton County, Ohio and its residents truly benefitted from Al Kreuz's public service.  Not just a business and political leader, Al was also a leader in several civic associations including the Knights of Columbus, Wauseon Rotary, Catholic War Vets and the Delta F & M Advisory Board.  He also loved sports. His obituary highlights that ``he was an integral member of a group that founded the Wauseon Racquet Club . . . As a lifelong athlete and sports enthusiast, his talents on the softball field, bowling alley, and golf course earned him many awards and accolades. He was most proud of his nine (no, you didn't misread this) holes-in-one. His skill never abated and for the last twelve years he continued to periodically shoot his age up until the end. As for bowling, his first and only perfect 300 game earned him a $10,000 purse (ironically sponsored by Smith's Restaurant!). His love of athletics and teaching prompted him to volunteer as a coach with the CYO and St. Mary's (now Holy Trinity) basketball programs for 27 years. Additionally he coached little league and later assisted the Evergreen HS golf team.'' His love of sports and support of his teams is also evident in his claim as a University of Michigan Wolverines season ticket holder for 44 years. His favorite sporting events were those of his grandchildren, where he could always be counted on to be cheering for them on the sidelines.  As if his devotion to family, his business, community, civic organizations and sports teams was not enough, Al was also a talented tinkerer. As he was tinkering in his workshop he developed ``an amazing talent in woodworking. Many of his family and friends continue to enjoy his labors of love'' including me.  I was privileged to know Al Kreuz for more than thirty years and counted he and Char and their family among friends. For a decade we shared the goal of making life better in Fulton County, Ohio. Al Kreuz was a family man, business and civic leader, citizen statesman and so much more. His legacy is writ large in Fulton County, Ohio. His life and times, his service and talents are imprinted there as his good works of family and community carry forward.                          ____________________
