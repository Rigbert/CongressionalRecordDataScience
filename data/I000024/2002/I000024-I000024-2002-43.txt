President, quite often we are not together on legislation. In this case, we are. It was my wish we would have a stronger amendment. There was one in the House that mentioned Yasser Arafat. I think we should be mentioning Yasser Arafat.  We are in a war on terrorism. He is a terrorist. Sometimes we forget that in 1973 he gunned down three of our diplomats, including our U.S. Ambassador. He fits every description, every definition of a terrorist. All of us need to rise up and fight our battles, including Israel. This amendment is not strong enough, but I do support it.
