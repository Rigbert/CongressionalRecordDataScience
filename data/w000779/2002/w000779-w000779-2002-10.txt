President, over the past seven years, Congressman Chris Cox and I have teamed up several times on legislation affecting the Internet. The Global Internet Freedom Act that I will introduce today could be called ``Cox-Wyden V,'' because this is our fifth collaboration. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl in introducing this bill in the Senate.  This legislation aims to foster the development and deployment of technologies to defeat state-sponsored Internet jamming and censorship, and in turn, to help unleash the potential of the Internet to promote the causes of freedom and democracy worldwide.  This is a time when Americans are acutely focused on security threats emanating from sources beyond U.S. borders. The terrorist attacks of September 11 made plain that ignorance, extremism, and hate abroad can have terrible consequences not just in other countries, but right here at home. And the daily drumbeat of debate over Iraq emphasizes that oppressive foreign regimes can pose serious hazards. The world is truly getting smaller.  In the field of information technology, Americans have rightly responded with a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity. The interlinked computer networks that make up the Internet, and on which American's critical infrastructure increasingly relies, must be secured against would-be cyberterrorists. This is a matter of top importance, and I have sponsored legislation, as Chairman of the Science and Technology Subcommittee, to promote research and innovation in this area. It is my hope that the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act will be signed by the President in the coming weeks.  But it is important to remember that the international nature of the Internet does not just create new threats. It also presents tremendous new opportunities.  Openness, transparency, and the unfettered flow of information have always been the allies of freedom and democracy. Over time, nothing erodes oppression and intolerance like the widespread dissemination of knowledge and ideas. And technology has often played a key role in this process. From the printing press to radio, technological advances have revolutionized the spread information and ideas and opened up new horizons for people everywhere. Not surprisingly, the foes of freedom, understanding the threat these technologies pose, have often responded with such steps as censoring the press, jamming radio broadcasts, and putting media outlets under state control.  The Internet promises to revolutionize the spread of information yet again. Unlike its predecessor technologies, it offers a truly worldwide network that makes geographic distance irrelevant. It enables any person connected to it to exchange ideas quickly and easily with people and organizations on the other side of the globe. The quantity and variety of information it permits access to are virtually unlimited.  So once again, governments that fear freedom are trying to rein in the technology's potential. They block access to websites. They censor websites and email. They interrupt Internet search engines when users try explore the ``wrong'' topics. They closely monitor citizens' Internet usage and make it known that those who visit the ``wrong'' websites will be punished. Orthey prevent Internet access altogether, by prohibiting ownership of personal computers.  For a confirmed example of this, I would simply call attention to the inaugural report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, issued just last week, October 2. This report, the product of a bipartisan commission with members from the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Administration, finds that ``over the last 18 months, the Chinese government has issued an extensive and still growing series of regulations restricting Internet content and placing monitoring requirements on industry.'' It goes on to cite accounts of the Chinese government using high-tech software and hardware to ``block, filter, and hack websites and e-mail.'' Offshore dissident websites, foreign news websites, search engines, and Voice of America's weekly e-mail to China are all subject to being blocked. Internet usersattempting to access foreign web-sites often find themselves redirectedto Chinese government-approved websites.  Other countries, from Cuba to Burma to Tunisia to Vietnam, engage in similar activity.  There are technologies that can help defeat the firewalls and filters that these governments choose to erect. Proxy servers, intermediaries, ``mirrors,'' and encryption may all have useful applications in this regard. But the U.S. Government has done little to promote technological approaches. This country devotes considerable resources to combat the jamming of Voice of America broadcasting abroad. But to date, it has budgeted only about $1 million for technologies to counter Internet jamming and censorship.  This country can and should do better. The Internet is too important a communications medium, and its potential as a force for freedom and democracy is too great, to make a second-rate effort in this area.  That is why Senator Kyl and I are introducing the Global Internet Freedom Act today. It is time for the U.S. Government to make a serious commitment to support technology that can help keep the Internet open, available, and free of political censorship for people all over the world.  This legislation would establish an Office of Global Internet Freedom, with the express mission of promoting technology to combat state-sponsored Internet jamming. The office would be based in the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, to take advantage of NTIA's extensive expertise in international telecommunications and Internet issues. Location within the Department of Commerce will also help ensure close ties with American technology companies, whose active involvement will be essential for any technology-based effort to succeed. Cooperation with the International Broadcasting Bureau will be indispensable as well, and is required in the legislation.  Funding for the new office would be authorized at $30 million for each of the next two fiscal years. The office would make an annual report to Congress on its activities, and on the extent of state-sponsored Internet blocking in different countries around the world.  Finally, the bill would express the sense of Congress that the United States should denounce the practice of state-sponsored blocking of access to the Internet, should submit a resolution on the topic to the United Nations Human Rights Convention, and should deploy technologies to address the problem as soon as practicable.  As I mentioned at the outset, Representatives Chris Cox and Tom Lantos have already introduced companion legislation in the House, and I strongly applaud them for taking the lead on this issue. Here in the Senate, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kyl and myself in this important, bipartisan effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3093       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Internet Freedom      Act''.     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of      association are fundamental characteristics of a free      society. The first amendment to the Constitution of the      United States guarantees that ``Congress shall make no law .      . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the      right of the people peaceably to assemble.'' These      constitutional provisions guarantee the rights of Americans      to communicate and associate with one another without      restriction, including unfettered communication and      association via the Internet. Article 19 of the United      Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly      guarantees the freedom to ``receive and impart information      and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers''.       (2) All people have the right to communicate freely with      others, and to have unrestricted access to news and      information, on the Internet.       (3) With nearly 10 percent of the world's population now      online, and more gaining access each day, the Internet stands      to become the most powerful engine for democratization and      the free exchange of ideas ever invented.       (4) Unrestricted access to news and information on the      Internet is a check on repressive rule by authoritarian      regimes around the world.       (5) The governments of Burma, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, the      People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Vietnam,      among others, are taking active measures to keep their      citizens from freely accessing the Internet and obtaining      international political, religious, and economic news and      information.       (6) Intergovernmental, nongovernmental, and media      organizations have reported the widespread and increasing      pattern by authoritarian governments to block, jam, and      monitor Internet access and content, using technologies such      as firewalls, filters, and ``black boxes''. Such jamming and      monitoring of individual activity on the Internet includes      surveillance of e-mail messages, message boards, and the use      of particular words; ``stealth blocking'' individuals from      visiting websites; the development of ``black lists'' of      users that seek to visit these websites; and the denial of      access to the Internet.       (7) The Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, as well as      hundreds of news sources with an Internet presence, are      routinely being jammed by repressive governments.       (8) Since the 1940s, the United States has deployed anti-     jamming technologies to make Voice of America and other      United States Government sponsored broadcasting available to      people in nations with governments that seek to block news      and information.       (9) The United States Government has thus far commenced      only modest steps to fund and deploy technologies to defeat      Internet censorship. To date, the Voice of America and Radio      Free Asia have committed a total of $1,000,000 for technology      to counter Internet jamming by the People's Republic of      China. This technology, which has been successful in      attracting 100,000 electronic hits per day from the People's      Republic of China, has been relied upon by Voice of America      and Radio Free Asia to ensure access to their programming by      citizens of the People's Republic of China, but United States      Government financial support for the technology has lapsed.      In most other countries there is no meaningful United States      support for Internet freedom.       (10) The success of United States policy in support of      freedom of speech, press, and association requires new      initiatives and technologies to defeat totalitarian and      authoritarian controls on news and information over the      Internet.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to adopt an effective and robust global Internet      freedom policy;       (2) to establish an office within the National      Telecommunications and Information Administration with the      sole mission of promoting technological means of countering      Internet jamming and blocking by repressive regimes;       (3) to expedite the development and deployment of      technology to protect Internet freedom around the world;       (4) to authorize the commitment of a substantial portion of      United States Government resources to the continued      development and implementation of technologies to counter the      jamming of the Internet;       (5) to utilize the expertise of the private sector in the      development and implementation of such technologies, so that      the many current technologies used commercially for securing      business transactions and providing virtual meeting space can      be used to promote democracy and freedom; and       (6 to bring to bear the pressure of the free world on      repressive governments guilty of Internet censorship and the      intimidation and persecution of their citizens who use the      Internet.     SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT                    INTERNET JAMMING AND CENSORSHIP.       (a) Establishment of Office of Global Internet Freedom.--     There is established in the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration the Office of Global Internet      Freedom (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the      ``Office''). The Office shall be     headed by a Director who shall develop and implement, in      consultation with the International Broadcasting Bureau, a      comprehensive global strategy for promoting technology to      combat state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming      and persecution of those who use the Internet.       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated to the Office $30,000,000 for each of the      fiscal years 2003 and 2004.       (c) Corporation of Other Federal Departments and      Agencies.--Each department and agency of the United States      Government shall cooperate fully with, and assist in the      implementation of, the strategy developed by the Office and      shall make such resources and information available to the      Office as is necessary to the achievement of the purposes of      this Act.       (d) Report to Congress.--On March 1 following the date of      the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the      Director of the Office shall submit to the Congress a report      on the status of state interference with Internet use and of      efforts by the United States to counter such interference.      Each report shall list the countries that pursue policies of      Internet censorship, blocking, and other abuses; provide      information concerning the government agencies or quasi-     governmental organizations that implement Internet      censorship; and describe with the greatest particularity      practicable the technological means by which such blocking      and other abuses are accomplished. In the discretion of the      Director, such report may be submitted in both a classified      and nonclassified version.       (e) Limitation on Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall be      interpreted to authorize any action by the United States to      interfere with foreign national censorship for the purpose of      protecting minors from harm, preserving public morality, or      assisting with legitimate law enforcement aims.     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of the Congress that the United States      should--       (1) publicly, prominently, and consistently denounce      governments that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to      information on the Internet;       (2) direct the United States Representative to the United      Nations to submit a resolution at the next annual meeting of      the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemning all      governments that practice Internet censorship and deny      freedom to access and share information; and       (3) deploy, at the earliest practicable date, technologies      aimed at defeating state-directed Internet censorship and the      persecution of those who use the Internet.
