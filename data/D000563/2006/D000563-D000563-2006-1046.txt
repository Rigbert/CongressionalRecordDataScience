About 75 percent of the Illinois National Guard units have been activated to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan, and some have been on more than one tour of duty. During the course of that, they have left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan a lot of wornout equipment, damaged equipment. Currently our National Guard, in some areas of supplies, like certain trucks, is down to 7 percent of what they need, and nationwide we have been told the National Guard stock of supply and equipment has been depleted to the level of 34 percent of what they need.  Can the Senator from Nevada tell me whether our commitment of the National Guard to the border will also be a commitment to replenish the equipment they will need to serve effectively there and return home and do their job?
