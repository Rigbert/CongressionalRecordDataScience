 President, as I had noted before we left for recess, the way to look at these judicial appointments is to talk about apples and apples, not apples and oranges.  At this point in President Bush's 8 years, he had 303 judicial nominations confirmed. President Obama so far has had 324. According to my math, that is 21 more judges confirmed during the 8 years of President Obama to this point than during the 8 years of President Bush to this point.  That said, we are looking to see if we can set up another vote on a judicial nominee, but until that process is complete, I object.
