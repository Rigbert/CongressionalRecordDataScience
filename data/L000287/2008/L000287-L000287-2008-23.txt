Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 6532) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:       Senate amendment:       On page 3, line 2, strike ``September 30, 2008'' and insert      ``the date of the enactment of this Act''.
