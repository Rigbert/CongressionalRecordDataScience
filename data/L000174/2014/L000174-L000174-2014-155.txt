President, I am pleased, although not surprised, with the latest news that Vermont's children rank as the healthiest. Recent data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Vermont ranks at the top or near the top of the list on a variety of metrics, including a child's access to health care, and percentage of children who exercise regularly. We all know that healthy habits begin in childhood, and Vermont has worked for years to ensure that all Vermont children have access to healthy beginnings.  Vermont has long been a trailblazer on health care, particularly for children. Recognizing that access to health care for children and pregnant women is critical to a healthy society, Vermont created the Dr. Dynasaur Program in 1989 to help families who could not afford health insurance but could not qualify for Medicaid. The program was such a success, Governor Howard Dean expanded Dr. Dynasaur in 1991 to cover all children and teens. Governor Dean's success with the program and leadership on the issue paved the way for Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.  Vermont has taken other steps as well to ensure all children can grow up healthy. In addition to having one of the lowest rates of uninsured children, Vermont has worked hard to give children access to healthy meals at school. Vermont brings local food into schools and teaches children about healthy eating through the Farm to School Program. And in order to make sure all children have access to school meals, Vermont gives those eligible for reduced-price lunches those meals for free. By working in a coordinated fashion across agencies and with advocacy groups, Vermont reaches out to children in need to help those families receive access to health care, nutrition assistance, and other vital safety net programs.  Unfortunately, there are still some troubling national trends related to children's health of which Vermont is not immune. Larger serving sizes and greater access to junk food combined with sedentary lifestyles have contributed to the steady rise in childhood obesity rates. Additionally, we are seeing a rise in the number of children living in poverty and without consistent access to nutritious food and health care. If we fail to reverse these trends, we are setting our children up for health problems that will last well into adulthood.  We must continue to support the efforts of our States and so many families who are trying to help their children make healthy choices. Instead of working to undermine the efforts we have made to ensure children can eat nutritious meals in school or to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or reducing eligibility in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Program or other nutrition programs, we should be working together to ensure all American children have the chance to succeed.Vermont has shown tremendous leadership in this area, and I hope we can all learn from its model.  I ask unanimous consent that the following Washington Post article, ``Best state in America: Vermont, for its healthy kids,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 21, 2014]          Best state in America: Vermont, for its healthy kids       A lifetime of good health starts in childhood. Health      insurance, access to health care and regular exercise make      for fit kids with long life expectancies. And nowhere in      America are kids healthier than in Vermont.       Across a range of metrics, the Green Mountain State excels,      according to the latest data collected by the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention. Fewer than one in four      Vermont children are overweight or obese. More than 81      percent have access to medical and dental care. Nearly 99      percent have health insurance. And one-third of all Vermont      children report exercising at least 20 minutes a day.       Vermont's relatively small and prosperous population makes      it easier than in some other states for officials to reach      out to potentially vulnerable children, said Cathy Hess,      managing director for coverage and access at the National      Academy for State Health Policy. What's more, Vermont has      been a pioneer in children's health reform.       The state's Dr. Dynasaur program, created in 1989, covered      tens of thousands of low-income children long before the      federal Children's Health Insurance Program came into being.      Congressional authors modeled the federal program in part on      Vermont's plan.       Vermont policymakers have also worked for years to build      partnerships between public and private institutions to      promote children's health. There's the Vermont Child Health      Improvement Program, run through the University of Vermont;      Children's Integrated Services, run through the state      Department for Children and Families, which works to connect      low-income families with young children to social services;      and the Blueprint for Health, established in 2006 to improve      health-care services and control costs.       ``They're focusing on the child and the family, and not so      much trying to fit the child in different bureaucratic      holes,'' Hess said.       Other states can brag about their successes: Children in      West Virginia, Missouri, Tennessee and Oklahoma report      getting more exercise than their compatriots in Vermont. Kids      in Utah and Colorado are less likely to be obese or      overweight. And Hawaii and Massachusetts insure a greater      proportion of their children.       States with higher percentages of low-income families tend      to fall at the less healthy end of the spectrum, especially      if those families are minorities with less access to health      care. Nearly 40 percent of children in Louisiana and      Mississippi are obese or overweight. Only 56 percent of      children in Nevada and 59 percent in Idaho have access to      medical and dental care. Just 18 percent of Utah children say      they get 20 minutes of daily exercise.       Perhaps those states should study Vermont's model. The      Green Mountain State is a lap ahead of the rest of the field.                          ____________________
