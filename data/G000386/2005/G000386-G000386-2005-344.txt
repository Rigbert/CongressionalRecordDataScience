  Madam President, this amendment and this discussion both are not about the cost of production of agricultural commodities. This amendment and this discussion are about payment limits and the need to prevent public funds from being used by the biggest producers to become even larger by bidding up cash trends and capitalizing their extra profits from production into land values.  There is public interest in this being the result of Federal farm programs, and all except the very largest farmers know that and support this effort.  Focusing on costs of production is totally meaningless, unless one also includes the revenue from production.  Every crop has a different set of numbers on cost and a different set of numbers on revenue produced. Those numbers vary from crop to crop, and, to a degree, vary from region to region and year to year.  The farm program support levels have never been set on the basis of cost of production or on profitability, taking revenue into consideration. Support levels have been set by the Congress, not by some index based on cost of production.  Moreover, this is not about inefficiency, as some have argued for years. The largest producers, with extra profit from their size or scale, from discounts received in input, and from premiums received for volume production are not passed along to consumers. Those extra profits are used to bid land away from midsize and smaller operators.  Keep in mind that these programs are not entitlement programs. The purpose is to stabilize the sector and provide an income supplement when commodity prices are low.  I yield the floor.
