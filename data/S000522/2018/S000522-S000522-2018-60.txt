Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a pro-life leader who has been a leader in educating members of our Conference about the dangers of assisted suicide. He serves on the Financial Services Committee. He has been, of course, a great leader in defending the unborn and their moms.
