President, 3 months ago, I noted in my statement on April 18 that it had taken the Senate almost 1 year longer to confirm 150 of President Obama's district court nominees than it took the Senate to confirm the same number of President Bush's district court nominees. Unfortunately,we have not picked up the pace, and we remain almost 1 year behind the record we set from 2001 to 2005. Today, the Senate confirms the 200th of President Obama's circuit and district nominees. Thanks to Senate Republicans' concerted effort to filibuster, obstruct and delay his moderate judicial nominees, it took almost 1 year longer to reach this milestone than it did when his Republican predecessor was serving as President--over 10 months, in fact. I have repeatedly asked Senate Republicans to abandon their destructive tactics.
