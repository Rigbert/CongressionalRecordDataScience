Speaker, I rise today to honor and draw attention to an effective program worthy of commendation and support. The Gang Resistance Education and Training program, [G.R.E.A.T.]. The program, developed in 1991, is sponsored by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Currently, the program is taught in 45 States by over 1,300 officers representing 548 agencies. During the 1995-1996 school year, over 21,000 students will receive the G.R.E.A.T. curriculum in Prince George's County, MD.  The G.R.E.A.T. program is a prevention program designed to help seventh graders become more responsible members of their communities. It establishes a joint enterprise between the police, the school system, and parents and provides a unique educational program which helps students set goals for themselves, resist hostile or illegal peer pressure, learn how to resolve conflicts without violence, and understand how gangs could ruin their lives.  Not a day goes by without negative stories about our Nation's young people and their increasing involvement in criminal activity. This builds a strong case for involving our young people in programs that compensate for the crime and violence, drugs and alcohol abuse, and negative activity that is all too prevalent in our society. Timely and well-managed programs such as G.R.E.A.T. and strong support can make the difference between a wasted and a productive life.  The future of America's children remains precarious. In our society, young people are confronted with the difficult task of overcoming many obstacles which threaten their maturation. As we look towards the future of this great Nation, this is a loss our country cannot afford. Fostering development of programs that promote successful passage from adolescence to adulthood is the right thing to do because we help prevent youth from adopting antisocial and irresponsible lifestyles.  As gangs and gang related violence rise in our country, preventive programs will be on the forefront of the fight in reducing crime and substance abuse. I will continue to support the G.R.E.A.T. program and others which enable our youth to realize they have positive options for their future.  Today I was joined at a press conference by Brett Sturgill, an eighth grader at Benjamin Tasker Middle School in Bowie, MD. His statements clearly illustrate the success of the G.R.E.A.T. program and the necessity of continuing to expand the program in order to reach more of our children. I respectfully submit that his remarks be entered into the Record.                      G.R.E.A.T. Press Conference       During my seventh grade year here at Tasker, I took part in      the G.R.E.A.T. program. G.R.E.A.T. is Gang Resistance      Education and Training. We learned that we all have basic      needs. Three physical needs are food, water, and shelter. But      just as important are three emotional needs of love, caring,      and understanding. These three emotional needs should be met      by your family and friends. But sometimes when there are      problems in families, kids turn to gangs. We learned that      this is not good because gangs are groups of people out to do      harm. Gang activities often lead to crime and with every      crime there is always a victim. We role-played various gang      situations and discussed victim's rights.       We learned the importance of the extended family which      includes not only immediate family but other relatives and      friends who are supportive of us. Each family has traditions      and rituals which are part of their culture. These traditions      can be anything from opening gifts on Christmas Eve to having      pizza on Friday nights to special celebrations for birthdays.      These traditions and rituals are important because they make      us feel like we are a part of the family. We also learned      that it is important to respect other people's cultures.       Conflict resolution was another important part of      G.R.E.A.T. We learned that when there is a conflict we should      first identify the problem. Then we need to think about our      possible choices and the consequences of each choice. After      that we should decide which action would be best and then do      it. The last thing is to think about our action and the      consequences of it. Did the problem work out okay? Did we      make a good choice?       We also learned that we have responsibilities at home, at      school, and in the neighborhood. These might be taking out      the trash, feeding the dog, doing the dishes, shoveling the      driveway for a neighbor, or doing our best in school.       Goal setting is another important part of G.R.E.A.T. A goal      is something you want to do in the future. They can be short      term goals like getting an A on an Algebra test or long term      goals like going to college.       Set goals, be responsible, be a part of an extended family      of relatives and friends who support each other, and avoid      groups of people who are out to do harm. That is the message      of G.R.E.A.T.                          ____________________
