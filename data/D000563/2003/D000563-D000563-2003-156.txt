President, Section 312 of the bill before us is entitled ``Procedures to enhance the accuracy and completeness of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies.'' My Responsible Student Amendment addresses exactly that: the completeness of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. My amendment is designed to ensure that young Americans who have positive credit histories established by responsibly repaying their student loans will be able to take a clean shot at the American dream when they try to buy their first home. It does so simply by requiring what until recently was standard practice for student loan providers; regular reporting on all loan repayments to each of the three major credit bureaus.  Until recently, responsible repayment of student loans was rewarded as would be expected, with a positive credit history. Responsible repayment was responsibly reported by student loan providers, in the typical fashion, to all three major credit bureaus. One of those providers, the biggest, is Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae was founded in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise, GSE. In 1997, the company initiated the privatization process. Sallie Mae, in other words, was born and raised on the taxpayers dime. One might hope that it would therefore feel some responsibility to keep taxpayers' interest in mind.  About a year ago, however, Sallie Mae, by far the largest provider of Federally guaranteed student loans, suddenly stopped reporting repayment information to two of the three major credit bureaus. It turns out that TheHigher Education Act, which established the Federal student loan program, requires that defaults on student loans be reported to all three national credit bureaus, while positive repayment information only has to go to one. Is this the way we want to reward responsible repayment of student loans? Don't we want a system that rewards responsible repayment, rather than one that shrugs and says that that information doesn't matter?  What is the result of Sallie Mae not reporting to two of the three major credit bureaus? Thousands of young people--whose main or only use of credit has been their student loans from Sallie Mae--suddenly have major gaps in their credit histories. Stories in the Washington Post and the American Banker have described the case of one typical 31 year old, named Eric Borgeson. Mr. Borgeson is an architect who lives in Edwards, CO. Mr. Borgeson, who graduated from college 10 years ago, had a perfect credit repayment record on his three Sallie Mae loans. Then, midway through the home-buying process, his credit score dropped by 40 points. Sallie Mae had pulled his perfect repayment records from his credit reports with two of the three major credit bureaus. As a result, he ended up with a lower credit score and a significantly higher interest rate on his mortgage, that he estimates will cost him nearly $200 more per month in interest payments.  Why has Sallie Mae stopped reporting to two of the three major credit bureaus? The answer is simple: pre-screened lists. Credit bureaus typically sell lists of their customers, pre-screened to meet certain criteria based on the information in their credit reports. Sallie Mae's competitors were using such lists to offer Sallie Mae's customers better deals. Rather than meet the competition, Sallie Mae simply decided to pull its customers' information from bureaus that wouldn't agree to stop selling pre-screened lists.  Sallie Mae claims that it is simply protecting its customers from unwanted solicitations. Sallie Mae knows, however, that there is a toll free phone number people can call to keep their name off of such pre-screened lists. If it really was concerned about protecting its customers from unwanted credit card solicitations, it could simply publicize that number: 888-567-8688.  The group of consumers in question here is a unique group of consumers. Just starting their careers, still paying off their loans: if there is any group of consumers that benefits from competition among loan providers and consolidators, this group is it. This is a group that often wants to hear from Sallie Mae's competitors. Those still repaying their student loans may get offers from consolidators who will combine all their loans and charge a lower overall interest rate. Those who have finished repaying their student loans are often establishing homes, careers, and families and therefore using credit cards more than average users. They, therefore, may benefit from being able to compare the credit card package they have with the offerings of competitors.  By trying to shield its customers from competing offers, Sallie Mae does them a disservice twice: it punches a big hole in their credit histories, resulting in higher rates on mortgages and other new loans, and it prevents them from learning of better deals for other financial services. Each of these alone could cost consumers thousands of dollars.  My amendment prevents that from happening. It amends the Higher Education Act by adding the word ``each,'' requiring reporting to each of the major ``consumer reporting agencies''--credit bureaus--and making clear that both positive and negative information should be accurately reported.  Responsible repayment of student loans should be rewarded by inclusion in accurate and complete credit histories. This amendment will ensure that result.                      Amendment No. 2062 Withdrawn  I need no further time. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
