 I am anxious to hear what my friend from North Carolina has to say. I will sit here and listen to all of it. And I sincerely am anxious to hear it. But I want my colleagues to know for scheduling purposes, I indicated to Senator Kyl I am going to respond specifically to some of the points he raised because--again, I am not being solicitous--I think he is one of the best lawyers in this place. He knows this area very well. I think each of his points warrants a very specific response. But I will attempt to do that on Tuesday when we are back in. So I want to put people on notice, I am prepared to debate the issue if people wish to, but as far as I am concerned, we do not intend on using any more time today, unless for some reason my colleagues conclude I should.  I yield the floor.
