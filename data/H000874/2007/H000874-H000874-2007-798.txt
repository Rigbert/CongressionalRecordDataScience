Armed with nothing more than a $5,900 investment and a winemaking pamphlet from the public library, Ernest Gallo--along with his brother, Julio--created one of the world's largest wineries out of a small family-owned business, employed thousands of hard-working Americans over the years, and revolutionized the way the wine industry operates in the United States.  And while his role as co-founder of the Gallo Winery may be his claim to fame, Ernest Gallo was also a generous philanthropist who willingly answered the call when his community needed him most. Ernest created an endowment at the Gallo Center for the Arts in Modesto, CA. He established the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center at the University of California at San Francisco. And those are just two examples of his strong support for educational and health-related endeavors the world over.  Ernest Gallo was the personification of the American Dream--a self-made man who transformed his personal business successes into tangible public benefits that enhanced the lives of countless Americans. And I would like to extend my most heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Ernest Gallo as we mourn his loss.                          ____________________
