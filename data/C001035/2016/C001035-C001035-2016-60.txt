There are communities throughout the United States that are racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination or other historic barriers.  The rule does not change the Fair Housing Act, which for decades has included the affirmative fair housing requirement. The whole purpose of the rule is to ensure that States and communities that receive Federal funds take this requirement seriously.  This rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify barriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. The rule does not penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a community in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may find.  HUD would never deny Federal funds to a community simply because of its demographics. It has never done so in the 48 years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act, and it will not under this rule.  Additionally, I know some have expressed concern about what effect this rule would have on Alaskan Natives and other Native Americans. HUD's housing programs for Native Alaskans and other Native Americana are authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, NAHASDA. NAHASDA includes a statutory exemption from the Fair Housing Act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule does not change.
