 Paul):  S. 2512. A bill to establish an emergency transportation safety fund for the reconstruction of bridges along the Interstate Highway System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency Interstate Bridge Safety Fund Act, cosponsored by my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul. This bill seeks to authorize additional funding for our Nation's critical transportation infrastructure through spending offsets provided by the repeal of the antiquated Davis-Bacon Act. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that over 10 years, repealing the Davis-Bacon Act would save the Federal Government some $13 billion.  Kentucky is home to a number of critical interstate bridges that are in need of replacement, including the Brent Spence Bridge in Northern Kentucky, the I-65 bridge in Louisville, and an I-69 bridge in Henderson. This bill seeks to create a fund to help advance these very types of interstate bridge projects without raising taxes, adding to the deficit, or by authorizing tolling. Federal funding saved through the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act could be much better spent building a number of interstate bridges that are sorely needed in Kentucky and communities across America. I call on my Senate colleagues to support this measure to invest in our Nation's critical transportation infrastructure, on which American commerce depends.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2512       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Interstate Bridge      Safety Fund Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Davis-Bacon Act requires that workers on all      federally funded or federally assisted construction projects      be paid what is commonly referred to as a prevailing wage, as      calculated by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of      Labor.       (2) According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the      Davis-Bacon Act were repealed, the Federal Government could      save an estimated $12,700,000,000 in discretionary outlays      from 2015 through 2023.       (3) These savings could be redirected to the reconstruction      of closed and functionally obsolete bridges along the      Interstate Highway System, which would improve highway safety      and interstate commerce.
