 I have not seen the editorial. It does not surprise me. I have seen similar editorials, like in Longview, WA, a very small rural community that understands the need to educate their kids because they can no longer rely on the timber jobs that were there maybe even a decade or two decades ago, and they know their kids need to know math and science so they can attract some of the high-tech industries that are coming in and seeing that those kids get the education they need.  I have heard from schools in Yakima, WA, a farming community, Everett, a suburban district, right in the heartland of Seattle, Garfield High School, where teachers have said to me: This money is critical, it is targeted, it is used for what we need to do, you can be held accountable for it; don't renege on a promise.
