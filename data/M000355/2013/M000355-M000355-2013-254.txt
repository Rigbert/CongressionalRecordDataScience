 I remember that day still, and I am sure many of you do. It remains one of our country's proudest moments. But not every American was able to share in the excitement. As the senior Senator from Arizona put it, when the momentous event occurred, I had no idea it was happening. I and several hundred comrades were otherwise engaged. That is because 2 years earlier, on his 23rd bombing run over Vietnam, a missile hit Lieutenant Commander McCain's plane. He ejected, his body spiraling through the air until it hit water thousands of feet below--a lake right in the center of Hanoi.  An angry mob set upon him.
