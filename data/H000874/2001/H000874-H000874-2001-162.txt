 This year, I am once again proud to have introduced H. Con. Res. 79 to permit the 64th running of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby, which is to take place on the Capitol Grounds on June 23, 2001.  This resolution authorizes the Architect of the Capitol, The Capitol Police Board, and the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to negotiate the necessary arrangements for carrying out running of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in complete compliance with rules and regulations governing the use of the Capitol Grounds.  In the past, the full House has supported this resolution once reported favorably by the full Transportation Committee. I ask my colleagues to join with me, and the other cosponsors including Representatives Albert Wynn, Connie Morella, Jim Moran, Frank Wolf, and Eleanor Holmes-Norton in supporting this resolution.  From 1992 to 2000, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby welcomed over 52 contestants which made the Washington, DC, race one of the largest in the country. Participants range from ages 9 to 16 and hail from communities in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia.  The Winners of this local even will represent the Washington Metropolitan Area in the national race, which will be held in Akron, OH, on July 28, 2001.  The young people involved spend months preparing for this race, and the day that they complete it makes it all the more worthwhile. The soap box derby provides our young people with an opportunity to gain valuable skills such as engineering and aerodynamics.  Furthermore, the derby promotes team work, a strong sense of accomplishment, sportsmanship, leadership, and responsibility. These are positive attributes that we should encourage children to carry into adulthood.  I want to thank the Transportation full committee and subcommittee chairmen and ranking members for their support and I urge all of the Members to support this legislation.
