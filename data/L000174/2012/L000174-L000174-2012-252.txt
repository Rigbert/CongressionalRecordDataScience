President, Jeffrey Helmick . . . ========================= END NOTE =========================   Some have chosen to criticize Mr. Helmick for his role as court-appointed defense counsel. Those who criticize him may not understand how our justice system works. Our legal system is an adversary system, predicated upon legal advocacy for both sides. That is what Mr. Helmick did at the request of the court.  No nominee should be disqualified for representing clients zealously. At his confirmation hearing to become the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts made the point:       ``[I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back      before the founding of the country that lawyers are not      identified with the positions of their clients. The most      famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the      British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that      for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution      in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule      of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.       Our Founders thought that they were not being given their      rights under the British system to which they were entitled,      and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that      what they were about was defending the rule of law, not      undermining it, and that principle, that you don't identify      the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the      views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is      critical to the fair administration of justice.''  Mr. Helmick was appointed by the court to represent a defendant and he had an ethical obligation to advocate zealously for that client. That was what he did, and he should not now be punished for doing his duty.  In addition, there has apparently been an objection to Mr. Helmick's handling of an ethical dilemma where he refused to disclose a client secret. This is particularly odd because the Ohio Court of Appeals who heard the case stated that Mr. Helmick ``should be commended for his professional and ethical behavior in a very difficult situation.'' In addition, although a divided Ohio Supreme Court ultimately ordered disclosure of the letter based on a balancing test in a 4 3 decision, the Court nevertheless agreed unanimously with Mr. Helmick that the letter was a client secret. Indeed, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that Mr. Helmick acted in good faith.  Let us confirm this good man and not try to tarnish his distinguished reputation. I join Senator Brown and Senator Portman in urging a vote for confirmation.  I yield back the remaining time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
