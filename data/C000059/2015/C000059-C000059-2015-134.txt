Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As mentioned earlier, I live in one of the most, maybe the most, regulated air districts in the United States, and I am a strong advocate for clean air. My district has achieved some of the largest emission reductions in the country.  However, EPA continues to dig the hole deeper as my district continues to try to work its way out of nonattainment. So EPA and the States need to use the resources we provided in the bill to play catch-up on a statutory obligation to help communities implement the 2008 standard.  Remember, just last April, EPA finalized the rule for the 2008 standards. When 85 percent of the communities can achieve the latest standards, then EPA should consider whether or not revisions are necessary.  I will remind my colleagues that the Clean Air Act only directs EPA to review the standards every 5 years. It does not require that EPA revise the standard.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
