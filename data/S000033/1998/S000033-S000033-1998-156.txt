 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert their statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.          Statement by Rachel Salyer Regarding Substance Abuse       Rachel Salyer: My name is Rachel Salyer. I am a senior at      the Bellows Free Academy in St. Albans.       I think there are so many issues surrounding the youth of      today, things like success--we are pressured to succeed in      life, whether that is monetarily, or just self. And the      adults in the community don't seem to be helping very much.      When adults, parents and other adults alike throughout      Vermont and the nation characterize teenagers as all being      troublemakers or all being people who drink or party, then      they are sending a message to the youth of the community that      they don't care about our future, because it is our future,      and they are not going to be around for it, and it is our own      fault, basically.       These stereotypes are wrong. Not all youth in Vermont are      people who like to drink, people who like to do drugs, people      who go to parties every weekend. That's why organizations      such as Green Mountain Prevention Project are such an      important part of Vermont youth, because they sponsor      programs like the Green Mountain Teens, which is a group of      teens who have gotten together, who try to make other teens      aware that there are all these issues surrounding them, that      parents and adults have this image of us, and we want to try      and change it.       Basically, what the Green Mountain Teens do is, we are a      peer-awareness and prevention group. We provide healthy      alternatives to doing drugs or drinking and things like that.      We have coffee houses, we have haunted houses, winter balls,      dances, anything you can imagine, any other kind of healthy      lifestyle habit, we promote that, in order to tell teens that      there is something else out there. We are setting examples      for teens by being teens, and telling them that there are      other choices. And we are trying to show the adults in the      community that we need their support also, that we recognize      there is a problem, and that it needs to be changed.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much.                                  ____    Statement by Josh Lemieux, Mark Boyle, Carl Halback and Richard             Gonzales Regarding Skateboard Community Building       Carl Halbach: First of all, thank you for inviting us here.      The point we are trying to prove today is, we have changed      our community outlook and image from a negative to a positive      outlook.       Mark Boyle: A lot of groups here are talking about things      they would like to do and things that they think need to be      done, or processes they need to do. We would like to prove      that works. We did a lot of community service and got help      from a lot of community members in order to enhance what we      enjoy. And this is one of those things that a lot of these      groups out there need to think about doing, and this is how      they need to do it, just like get a lot of help from the      community and be able to follow the guidelines that the adult      world uses, and not dwell on the fact that they need to let      us do what we want to do, because we are going to do it      anyway.       Richard Gonzales: Basically, I looked at the State of      Vermont, and I seen that they don't recognize extreme sports      as one of the big issues, as like physical activities, and,      you know, we just took it upon ourselves to build our own      park and raise money, and do stuff like that, try to help our      city out.       Josh Lemieux: Right now, we are building a new skate park.      We just got done. It ran for like five years, and was getting      too small. Right now, we are moving and expanding to a bigger      skate park, and doing this by ourselves. And we have a grant      from a couple of companies, and we are just raising money      right now. We have the communities behind us, just trying to.       Carl, did you want to add something?       Carl Halbach: Yes. Basically went around asking for      donations, seeing who would like to help us. A lot of the      times, we worked for the money, instead of having it handed      to us. There is a sliding hill near our town. And we decided      to go clean it up and put up all new fences and paint the      buildings and take them down and rebuild them again, so they      are in a much better condition, and made the sliding hill      much more safe.       Congressman Sanders: Are we talking about St. Albans?       Carl Halbach: Yes.       Congressman Sanders: Mark, did you want to add anything?       Mark Boyle: We have done this all by ourselves. We have      guidance of some outstanding citizens in our community, Miss      Gridmore and Doctor Chip. I mean, they don't do work for us,      but they help organize stuff, because not all community      members are going to be totally accepting of a bunch of rag-     tag kids coming and saying, can we do some work for money so      we can do this, or can we have community support, and she      helped us work through the right channels and we really      appreciate it.       Congressman Sanders: This is an excellent presentation.                                  ____Statement by Jess Walters, and Linh Nguyen, and Ryan Lafebvre, and Gary               Bailey Regarding Burlington's Old North End       Ryan Lefebvre: Hello. My name is Ryan. I am here to      represent Burlington's Old North End. We decided that one of      the most important issues to us is how teens in the Old North      End spend their out-of-school hours.       Each day, teens in the Old North End decide how they will      spend at least five of their waking hours when not in school.      For many of these, the hours harbor both risk and      opportunity.       For many that are home alone, the out-of-school hours      present serious risks for substance abuse, crime, violence      and sexual activity, leading to unwanted pregnancy and      sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Time spent      alone is not the crucial contributor to higher risk; it is      what young people do during that time, where they do it, and      with whom, that leads to positive or negative consequences.       According to a 1990 survey, my community contains 29      percent of the Burlington's population, and has the highest      percentage of people of color in the city. Over half of the      households are female-headed, and over 60 percent of these      families live below the poverty line.       Poverty is especially pronounced for the Old North End's      children, 42 percent of whom lived in poverty in 1990. That      percentage is higher today. The Old North End has 32.1      percent of its residents living below the poverty level,      compared with 19.3 percent for the city as a whole.       Recently, a number of focus groups were held, where youth,      senior citizens, and business people spoke out about concerns      they have about the Old North End. The following issues and      concerns were continually mentioned: Public drinking, drug      dealing, continuing poverty, racial tensions, and potential      gang violence.       We proposed a teen center that would directly address many      of our community concerns, as well as issues many of you will      be presenting later today. Jessica is now going to tell you      why there is a need for our teen center in Burlington.       Jessica Walters: Hello. My name is Jessica Walters.       Yes, there are other teen centers in Burlington, but there      are many reasons why they do not meet our needs.       First, they all have limited teen hours. For instance, I      have nowhere to go after school until 5:30, and most youth      centers close at 9:00 at night. My friends usually hang out      on the street until teen hours start or until they have to go      home.       Due to things mentioned by Ryan, North Street isn't really      a safe place for teens to hang out. Most of the teens that      live in the Old North End go to Burlington High School, where      there is no computer and Internet access available to us      after school. Currently, there is nowhere to go to do      research or study after school hours. The other youth centers      don't have a place for us to do this.       The final issue is the adults' role. Other youth centers      have too much supervision and not enough opportunity for      independence and creativity. There are also a lot of little      kids around.       Now Gary is going to tell you about what our teen center      will be like.       Gary Bailey: Hello. My name is Gary, and I would like to      tell you about our teen center.       Our teen center will be run by youth, it will be for ages      13 through 19, and it will be free of charge. We feel that it      should be open for longer hours, like said she before,      because other teen programs like the one we want to open will      have to be open for younger children also, so we only have a      section of the day that we can go there, so we are still out      in the streets.       We feel that it should have a resource room run by adults,      with a minilibrary, mentoring and tutoring facilities, a      career college center, and information on social services.      Also, a job board for a list for people to     get jobs easily, and maybe once a week somebody in there      helping them out, somebody like Becky Trudeau or something,      where they won't have to go five different places to look for      a job, they can just go there and have one place to look.       We feel that it should have a computer room, with Internet      access. A lot of people work right after school, and they      have to be there around 3:30, including us. And we don't have      the time to go after school and work on the computers to get      an essay done, so we feel that it should have computers where      it will be available for us after work.       We think there should be recreational rooms, including a      gym, a game room. Also special events, such as, once a month,      a dance or some sort like that. We also think there should be      a lounge so that we can relax and watch TV.       Congressman Sanders: Good. Linh, do you want to begin?       Linh Nguyen: My name is Linh Nguyen. We would like to ask      for continued support in finding out how we should embark on      this teen center and after school program. We strongly      believe this would make the Old North End a better place for      teens, and not only the teens, but the community as a whole.      We would, as well, be a model to replicate in the rest of      Vermont.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much. Thank you all      very much.                               ____________________
