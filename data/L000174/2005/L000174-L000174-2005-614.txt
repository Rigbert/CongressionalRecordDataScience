President, I recommend all the Republicans and Democrats listen to the speech given by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. I said to him earlier this morning if it were he and I who were allowed to work this out, we could work it out probably in less than an hour. I said the same thing to the President and to our two leaders.  Hopefully everyone understands the significance of this debate and what the Republican leader, the majority leader is doing. He has decided to trigger the nuclear option. That is what it is. This nuclear option is something any Senate majority could have done any time over the past 50 years. It boils down to the Republican Senate leader declaring the Senate rules governing filibusters are out of order.
