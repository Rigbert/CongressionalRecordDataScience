 President, I think maybe I answered too casually when I answered the Senator's question--that maybe I have a feeling there were not legitimate concerns by people on my side. There are a couple legitimate concerns. No. 1, the Senator's amendment does have some mandate on States. That creates a lot of concern--I will bet not only on my side but on his side as well. That is a very philosophical point of view of the impact which we make in the Senate on 50 States, and how many subdivisions I don't know. The other one is the extent to which this might lead to legitimate legal retaliation as a result of the Senator's amendment. That seems to me to be a reasonable, free, and fair trade consideration in any action this body takes.  I want to make clear that it is not strictly political. There are some concerns about his amendment. I enunciated at least two.
