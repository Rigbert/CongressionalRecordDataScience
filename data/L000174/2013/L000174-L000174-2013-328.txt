President, I understand Senator Vitter, the Senator from Louisiana was on the floor earlier discussing the amendment Senator Hatch and I have proposed, Amendment No. 1183. I have read the remarks the Senator from Louisiana made, and I wish he had read our amendment more carefully. His remarks seem to be describing a different amendment than the one Senator Hatch and I have proposed.  Our amendment is very simple. Under current law, foreign performing artists who come to the United States must get either an ``O'' or ``P'' visa. The Immigration Statute requires that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS process these visas in 14 days. This statutory requirement is a reflection of the time sensitivity involved with scheduling these artists for engagements in the United States, and permitting them to meet their obligations, which of course benefit the American organizations that hire them. Our amendment, which is limited to non-profit organizations, provides that if the 14-day statutory requirement for processing is not met, then the foreign artist's petition would automatically be given expedited processing, and the associated additional fee is waived. But let me be clear, the visiting artist is already paying a fee of several hundred dollars for the petition. All our amendment would do is provide the petitioner with free expedited processing if the deadline were not met by the agency.  Senator Vitter expressed concern that providing expedited processing in a case where the immigration agency does not adhere to its statutory deadline would take funding away from the enforcement of immigration law. Surely Senator Vitter knows that U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services is a fully fee-funded agency, and has no enforcement responsibilities. When Congress reorganized the former Immigration and Naturalization Service and created the Department of Homeland Security, the visa adjudication and immigration enforcement functions were separated. So let me be clear--the waiver of an expedited processing fee has absolutely no effect on the funding that goes to immigration enforcement. Moreover, as I discussed this morning, the bill we debate provides $6.5 billion to border security and enforcement. Our amendment is not some giveaway to, as Senator Vitter described, ``well-heeled'' individuals. Rather, it is an incentive for USCIS to process these petitions in a timely way as they are required under the law.  But the most important distinction that the Senator from Louisiana failed to explain to the Senate was that our amendment applies only to non-profit organizations. Organizations like the Greater New Orleans Youth Orchestra, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, Louisiana State University Opera, and the New Orleans Ballet Association. I suspect that these are not the ``well-heeled'' individuals the Senator from Louisiana is describing. In fact, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of 83 Louisiana Arts Organizations and supporters of the amendment Senator Hatch and I have offered.  The Senator from Louisiana called our amendment misguided. Again, I wish he had read the amendment more carefully. I suspect the dozens of non-profit performing arts organizations across Louisiana that are enriching their communities with performances from international musicians and dancers would not think it is misguided to help them continue their important work. With such an incredibly rich musical history and tradition, I suspect the people of Louisiana, like Americans across the country, place a very high value on the performing arts.  So with that clarification, I hope I have addressed the concern of the Senator from Louisiana and that he will reconsider his opposition.
