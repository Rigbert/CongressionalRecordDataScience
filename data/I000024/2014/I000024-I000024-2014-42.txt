Brown, of Harrah, OK who died on September 25, 2007, of wounds suffered from a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Muqdadiyah, Iraq.  A cavalry scout, Brown joined the military in September 1988, a year after graduating from Harrah High School. He was inspired to join the military by his father Richard Haynes Brown, a senior master sergeant who retired at Tinker Air Force Base, OK after 22 years of service.  In April 2006 he was assigned 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based in Fort Hood, TX and deployed for his second tour to Iraq in October 2006.  A funeral service was held at the Brown family plot in Rineyville, KY, near Fort Knox, TN.  Kevin is survived by his parents Glenda and Richard Haynes Brown, his wife Lena of Killeen, TX, the couple's daughters Maria, 13, and Charlene, 14, a sister Brandy Ross of Moore, OK, and two stepchildren Jeremy and Pamela.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Kevin's family. He lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who twice volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.
