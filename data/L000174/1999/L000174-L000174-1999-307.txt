President, I am also disappointed that the House chose to scale back the authorization of these program from five years as passed by the Senate to four years.  The bottom line, however, is that the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have gone without authorization for too long. We should pass this legislation without further delay.  I have been able to clear this bill on my side of the aisle. Unfortunately, the Republicans have not been able to do the same and are, once again, holding up enactment of this legislation. The holdup on passage of this already long-delayed and much needed authorization for a number of worthwhile programs to provide assistance to at risk children and their families must be put to an end.  The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 authorizes a variety of critical programs for our nation's most at risk children and youth--those who are missing or have been exploited and those who have run away or been forced from home or are homeless. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. They also handled 132,357 telephone calls to their hotline, which included calls to report a missing child, to request information or assistance and to provide leads on missing or potentially exploited children. This figure includes 10,904 reported leads or sightings of missing children, an increase of 25 percent over such leads in 1997.  Since 1984, the National Center has helped investigate more than 80 cases involving Vermont children who have been reported missing. They have had extraordinary success in resolving these cases, some of which have taken several years and have involved out of state or international negotiations. I want to thank Ernie Allen and all of the dedicated employees and volunteers associated with the National Center for their help in these matters.  The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provides free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs. The National Center has trained 728 sheriffs and police chiefs from across the U.S. in recent years, including police chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro and Winooski, Vermont, as well as members of the Vermont State Police. They have trained an additional 150,000 other officers in child sexual exploitation and the detection of missing children since 1984.  The National Center is also a leader in reducing the number of infant abductions by educating nurses, security staffs and hospitals. A seminar held in Vermont, trained 250 nurses and security personnel, should provide greaterpeace of mind to new parents in my home State.  Most recently, they have expanded their role in combating the sexual exploitation of children by going on-line. Last year, they launched their ``CyberTipline'' which allows Internet users to report suspicious activities linked to the Internet, including child pornography and the potential enticement of children on-line. In the second half of 1998, they received over 4,000 leads from the CyberTipline which resulted in numerous arrests. I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope that we will promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with their important activities with fewer funding concerns.  The National Center established an international division some time ago and has been working to fulfil the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Last year the National Center held a conference on international concerns with child abductions and international custody battles between separated parents from different countries.  The other important piece of this legislation is the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act which distributes funding to local community programs on the front lines assisting the approximately 1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless or have left or been forced from their families for a variety of reasons. Those who provide services pursuant to these programs and those who are the beneficiaries of those services are far too important to be left hanging. In a Congress in which the budget and appropriations processes have given way to short-lived spending authority, they all deserve the reassurance of reauthorization and a commitment to funding. Only then will our State youth service bureaus and other shelter and service providers be able plan, design and implement the local programs necessary to make the goals of the Act a reality.  In 1974, Congress passed the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The inclusion of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in this legislation recognized that young people who were effectively homeless were in need of shelter, guidance and supervision, rather than punishment, and should be united with their families wherever possible.  Since 1974, the programs that make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act have evolved to meet the complex problems faced by our young people, their families and our communities. Over the last decade, as a nation, we have witnessed an increase in teen pregnancy rates, drug and alcohol abuse beginning as early as grade school, child physical and sexual abuse, and a soaring youth suicide rate.  Since 1989, the transitional living program has been part of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. This program, which was developed by my former colleague Senator Simon, has filled a gap in the needs of older youth to help them make the transition to independent living situations.  The majority of these program in Vermont are run by the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth. The Vermont Coalition is a community-based network comprised of member programs that provide crisis response, emergency shelter, counseling, and other services to troubled youth throughout Vermont counties.  The programs we are seeking to reauthorize include those directed at young people who have had some kind of alcohol or other drug problem. The isolation in rural areas can lead to serious substance abuse problems. It is difficult to reach young people in rural areas and it is difficult for them to find the services they need. In Vermont, these drug abuse prevention programs provide essential outreach services.  Service providers are being challenged as never before with an increasingly complex set of problems affecting young people and their families. Now is not the time to abandon them. There is consensus among services providers that young people seeking services and their families are increasingly more troubled--as evidenced by reports of family violence, substance abuse and the effects of an array of economic pressures. These services may well be the key to breaking through the isolation of street youth, their mistrust of adults, and their reluctance to get involved with public or private providers.  The programs embodied in S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act, are important and should not once again be held hostage to the controversial debate on juvenile crime.                               Exhibit 1                                             United States Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.     Hon. Donna Shalala,     Secretary of Health and Human Services,     Washington, DC       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am pleased that we are close to      enactment of S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway      Children Protection Act of 1999, which will reauthorize      programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and      authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children. The Senate passed the Leahy-Hatch      substitute to S. 249 on April 19, by unanimous consent.      Yesterday, the House passed its version of this legislation.       I am concerned about language inserted into the bill during      House consideration upon which the Senate was not consulted.      That language provides for a ``consolidated review of      applications'' of RHYA grants. Before agreeing to the new      language, I need to be assured that this could in no way be      construed as consolidating any of the RHYA programs under a      single formula allocation.       As you know, under the RHYA, each year each State is      awarded at a minimum $100,000 for housing and crisis services      under the Basic Center grant program. Effective community-     based programs around the country can also apply directly for      the funding available for the Transitional Living Program and      the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants.       I hope that you can clarify that the new language inserted      by House will do noting to collapse the distinct programs      authorized under the RHYA. These programs are very important      and I would like to see the legislation passed without      further delay.       I have been working since 1996 to enact this reauthorizing      legislation. I worked to have the Senate pass this      legislation during the last Congress and again earlier this      year. With your assurance that Vermont and other small states      will not be disadvantaged by the language inserted by the      House in competing for national grant funding, I will seek to      expedite enactment.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                            Department of Health &                                               Human Services,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC       Dear Senator Leahy: You have asked us to consider the      impact of certain language recently inserted into the House      version of S. 249, the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway      Children Act of 1999''. Specifically, you have asked us to      consider whether proposed section 385, Consolidated Review of      Applications, will adversely affect the eligibility of small      States to receive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA)      funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic      Center Grant program.       I am advised by General Counsel that currently the      Secretary has wide statutory discretion to prescribe the      procedures which will be used in awarding various grants      under the RHYA. The Secretary presently exercises this      discretion by choosing to include in a consolidated grant      announcement several discrete funding opportunities with      distinct application requirements. After studying the      pertinent language in S. 249, General Counsel has concluded      that the proposed legislation provides for a similar level of      discretion with respect to procedures to be used for various      grant awards under the RHYA. Therefore, since the proposed      legislation does not require the Secretary to change in any      way her current procedures for awarding RHYA grants, it will      not require the Secretary to commingle the current separate      and discrete RHYA funding opportunities so as to adversely      affect the eligibility of small States to receive RHYA      funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic      Center grant program.       I hope this information is helpful to you as you proceed      with final consideration of S. 249. The Department deeply      appreciates all your efforts to reauthorize the Runaway and      Homeless Youth Act.           Sincerely,                                               Richard J. Tarplin,     Assistant Secretary for Legislation.                          ____________________
