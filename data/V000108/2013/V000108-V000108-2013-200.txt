Speaker, it is with great pride and sincerity that I rise in recognition of High School Radio Day 2013. This year marks the second annual High School Radio Day, a day to observe the uniqueness of each high school radio station and the impact each has on the community, the State, and the Nation at large. Indiana is the birthplace of high school radio. The first station in the United States, WNAS, signed on in May, 1949 in New Albany, Indiana. In the following decades, the students working for high school radio stations in northwest Indiana have exhibited outstanding ingenuity, intellect, and leadership as the stations have grown and thrived.  In 1954, high school radio arrived in northwest Indiana with the formation of WGVE-FM 88.7 radio in Gary. First housed in Lew Wallace High School, the station relocated to its current home of the Gary Area Career Center in 1969. WGVE-FM 88.7 began operating at less than 50 watts, but the station has evolved to become the home of a wide array of community news, educational programming, public service announcements, and music. The station keeps local residents connected to their government by broadcasting meetings of the Gary School Board and Gary Common Council.  For over 35 years, WDSO-FM 88.3, Chesterton High School's commercial-free, educational station has broadcast valuable programming to listeners throughout northwest Indiana. It took nearly two years of planning and careful work with the Federal Communications Commission to take the station on-air, with broadcasts beginning in 1976. Since that time, the station broadcasts local, State, and national news coverage, as well as sports coverage and live broadcasts from town meetings, the Duneland School Board, and the Community Bulletin Board. WDSO-FM 88.3 was also one of the first radio stations to use fiber optic cable to transport a radio signal over a mile and a half from the studio to the transmitter.  It is with great credit not only to the dedicated and passionate students who operate these stations but the administrators that ensure their continued success that high school radio stations still leave their indelible mark on the people of northwest Indiana. Specifically, Eric Johnson, Clarence Stevens, Sarita Stevens, Lakisha Walls, and Lionel Chambers, at WGVE-FM 88.7, as well as Michele Stipanovich and Matthew Waters at WDSO-FM 88.3, have done outstanding work to grow their respective stations. These individuals deserve recognition for their committed, energetic approach to the development of bright young students eager to learn the ways of broadcast journalism.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing these two exemplary student organizations, as well as each of the 43 high school radio stations from 19 States participating in High School Radio Day 2013. Their efforts have molded and continue to mold generations of rising journalists, performing a vital public service for all Americans.                          ____________________
