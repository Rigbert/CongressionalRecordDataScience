Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1654 and urge my colleagues to vote for the conference report so that we can send this bipartisan bill to the President and have it signed into law.  This bill is endorsed by all the conferees, regardless of party, in both the House and the Senate. I wish to express my appreciation for the hard work of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall), the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon), and the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) and offer my thanks for their services on the conference committee and their suggestions for compromise without which we would not be on the House floor today.  In passing this bill, Congress will help determine the priority investments in science and technology needed to fulfill America's future in space.  H.R. 1654, the NASA Authorization Act of 2000, authorizes the activity of our civilian space program for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The bill authorizes $14,184,400,000 for NASA in fiscal year2001, which is about $149 million more than the President requested. It also authorizes $14,465,400,000 for NASA in fiscal year 2002, which is $160 million above the President's request.  The bill fully funds the request for human space flight, including the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. More importantly, it contains key policy provisions to control cost growth and maintain the schedule of the International Space Station.  The bill caps station costs at $25 billion. We have slightly increased the program reserves that a blue ribbon task force argued were needed to avoid future costs growth. Additionally, we have added a contingency authorization of 20 percent to address the worst case scenarios, such as a partner's withdrawal from the program or the loss of an element during launch. We have also protected the space station design, which will remove a source of future cost growth and scheduled delays.  By moving NASA in the direction of a commercial Transhab structure, we transfer the risks and costs of development to any private sector entrepreneur willing to take them. We have also developed three new provisions to address the Russian situation. For years, the Russian Government has failed to provide the resources needed for the Russian Space Agency to meet its obligations to the International Space Station partnership. These failures have cost the United States some $5 billion and delayed the program's completion by over 4 years.  The Russian Government recently diverted two progress vehicles and a Soyuz spacecraft to Mir, despite previous promises to use them to meet Russia's obligation to the International Space Station. This bill would seek to prevent recurrences by directing the highest levels of the U.S. Government to raise this issue with their counterparts in Russia. Hopefully, by bringing higher level political attention to the problem, we can solve it.  The bill also directs the NASA administrator to seek and renegotiate the appropriate international agreements to bring the benefits each partner receives from its involvement in the International Space Station into line with the partner's actual contributions. This provision will help us return the International Space Station partnership to the equitable foundation required by the Intergovernmental Agreement. Simply put, the administrator would have to seek to reduce Russia's utilization rights while increasing our own and those of our other partners until such time as Russia meets all of its obligations to the International Space Station.  Last but not least, the bill directs the administrator to seek to reduce America's share of the operating costs as compensation for any additional capabilities we provide to our partners through NASA's Russian Program Assurance activities. NASA plans to spend about $1.2 billion directly making up for Russia's failures. Some of this funding will result in a more capable station so it makes sense to reduce our outyear costs vis-a-vis the other partners as compensation for performing above and beyond the call of duty.  In addition to the policy provisions intended to improve our human space flight program, we have increased funding for the critical area of science aeronautics and technology. These critical investments are needed to build a better future and have produced such past scientific and technological breakthroughs as the Topex-Poseidon spacecraft, which has vastly improved our knowledge of the El Nino effect and its impact on the global environment.  NASA's activities in space science have brought us the amazing discoveries of distant planets and black holes by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Aeronautics research has improved the performance and efficiency of our military and civilian aircraft, while life and microgravity research is helping chart the growth of cancer cells.                              {time}  1315  These additional funds will accelerate NASA's Near Earth Object Survey to detect asteroids and comets that may threaten Earth, to enable NASA to conduct an Earth Science Data Purchase program that leverages billions in private investments for scientific purposes, to allow NASA to fund additional life and microgravity researchers so that the International Space Station is fully utilized for scientific benefit, and to accelerate NASA's efforts to leverage its scientific efforts to improve math and science education in the United States.  Members may be pleased to hear that we have authorized funding for space grant colleges and universities, which many Members from both sides of the aisle have sought.  There have been no NASA authorization bills sent to the President since 1992. This is the first time in 8 years that the House and the Senate have managed to build a consensus about the policies and priorities that affect the future of our space program. By passing this bill, we hope to give the appropriators additional tools and guidance to use in their annual deliberations. We will provide congressional guidance on a variety of space issues facing NASA and again demonstrate our commitment to the future of science and technology in the United States. I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
