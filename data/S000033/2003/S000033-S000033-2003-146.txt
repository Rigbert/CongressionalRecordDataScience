 Speaker, I want to share with you an article which appeared in the March 9th New York Times. It is not acceptable to me that millions of older American workers could lose the pensions they were promised by their companies because of a conversion to a cash balance pension. My experience in working with IBM employees in Vermont has shown me that these cash balance schemes are extremely unfair and could cut the expected retirement benefits of older workers by up to 50 percent.  Every member of Congress enjoys a defined benefit pension plan. We can figure out exactly how much we will receive when we retire by computing the years we have served, our salaries and the age at which we retire. A study I recently requested from the Congressional Research Service, CRS, shows very clearly that if members in Congress were in cash balance plan they would receive substantially less in pensions than in the defined benefit plan we currently enjoy.  President Bush has proposed regulations that would legalize age discrimination in cash balance pension conversion. These proposed regulations would give the green light to Fortune 500 companies to raid the pension benefits of millions of older workers. It seems to methat if Congress allows this extremely unfair proposal to go into effect, and jeopardizes the pensions of American workers, it should be prepared to do the same thing for itself.  Mr. Speaker, if cash balance plans are good enough for American workers, they should be good enough for members of the U.S. Congress. My understanding is that the Pension Security Act is supposed to go on the floor for debate sometime this month. During that time it is my intention to offer an amendment which would give all vested employees the right to choose which pension plan works best for them under a cash balance conversion. If that amendment does not succeed, I intend to offer another amendment that would convert the traditional pensions of members of Congress into cash balance plans if the President's proposal goes into effect. What's good for the American worker should be good for members of Congress.                [From the New York Times, March 9, 2003]              What if a Pension Shift Hit Lawmakers, Too?                        (By Mary Williams Walsh)       As members of Congress prepare to reform the pension      system, they might want to think hard about the proposals on      the table. A new study has examined what would happen to      their own retirement benefits if the changes that some favor      for other workers were applied to them. The answer might give      them pause.       Virtually every senator and representative would lose out,      the study found--in some cases by hundreds of thousands of      dollars--if their current Congressional pensions were      switched to a controversial variant called a cash-balance      pension.       One big loser, for example, would be Representative Rob      Portman, a major sponsor of the House Republicans' pension      legislation. He had built up a pension benefit worth $337,857      by the end of 2002, if taken as a single payment, the study      found. But if Mr. Portman had instead earned his benefits      under a cash-balance plan, he would get $239,185, based on an      age of 48 and 10 years of service.       Mr. Portman will turn 48 this year. (The study used      approximate ages in calculating the hypothetical totals.)       The study, done by the Congressional Research Service,      shows that other members of Congress would suffer losses of      varying amounts, depending on their ages and years of      service.       Congress will be deliberating on significant pension      legislation in the coming months, including proposals that      would affect benefit levels and the strength of the pension      system itself. An especially contentious debate is looming      over regulations proposed by the Bush administration on how      companies could convert their traditional pension plans to      the cash-balance variety.       The existing Congressional pension plan is generous, and no      one is really planning to trade it in for a new, stripped-     down version. For years, however, private-sector employers      nationwide have been replacing traditional pension plans with      newer ones that are generally meant to be less costly for the      companies to offer, but that in many cases yield smaller      benefits, or transfer all the risk to workers.       Seen in that context, the Congressional Research Service      study shows how well members of Congress are insulated from      some trends in the private sector.       Since the 1980's, hundreds of large companies have switched      from traditional to cash-balance plans. These plans combine      features of the traditional pension with yet another type of      retirement plan, the 401(k), in which employees manage their      own retirement money and sometimes receive matching      contributions from employers. They are called cash-balance      plans because employees periodically receive notice of a      hypothetical cash balance that they can track as it grows.       In theory, the cash-balance pension has virtues that make      it superior to the 401(k): it is paid for and managed by the      employer, and it is guaranteed by the federal government; a      401(k) has no such guarantee. But in the real world,      companies that have converted traditional pension plans to      the cash-balance variety have reduced some employees'      retirement benefits sharply. The worst losses have generally      befallen older workers.       Statistics on the trend are sketchy. But a 2002 audit of 60      corporate pension conversions by the Labor Department's      Office of Inspector General found that in 13 cases--about 20      percent--workers were deprived of retirement benefits. They      were losing about $17 million a year because companies used      improper calculations in making the conversions.       Extrapolating these lost benefits to the hundreds of      pension conversions across the country, the office said, the      affected workers ``may be underpaid between $85 million and      $199 million annually.'' The office called for heightened      regulatory vigilance.       Even assuming proper calculations, cash-balance pensions      can mean lower payments than in the traditional approach.      Cash-balance plans differ from traditional plans, which are      set up to let workers build the biggest part of their benefit      in the years just before they retire. The idea was to promote      worker loyalty by giving workers an incentive to stay with      one company.       Many graying baby boomers in traditional plans may not know      it, but now that they are passing 50 and amassing the bulk of      their pensions--they are becoming very expensive to their      employers. Companies that have converted to cash-balance      pensions have been able to reduce labor costs by ending their      traditional plans before many workers enter this high-accrual      stage.       Cash-balance pensions build benefits more evenly over the      course of a worker's career. For some people, they can yield      larger benefits than traditional plans, particularly for      younger workers who often jump from job to job.       In switching to cash-balance pensions, some companies have      notified employees in technical jargon or euphemisms that      have left workers clueless about what is really happening.      But as older employees started to realize that the      conversions could mean individual losses in the tens of      thousands of dollars, they began to pepper the Equal      Opportunity Employment Commission with age-discrimination      complaints. Some have filed class-action lawsuits against      their companies. The most prominent case, still pending,      affects more than 140,000 employees at I.B.M.       In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service, which regulates      pensions, placed a moratorium on conversions, to give      specialists a chance to sort out their legality.       Now the Bush administration has proposed regulations that      would settle the issue, laying out basic rules for making      cash-balance conversions legal. Public comment will be      accepted until Thursday, and hearings are scheduled for April      9. If the proposed regulations take effect, the moratorium      will be lifted.       Critics of cash-balance plans fear that an end to the      moratorium would prompt a flood of pension conversions. They      and their advocates in Congress doubt that the regulations      would adequately protect older workers.       ``There are millions and millions of workers today who are      scared to death that the pensions they have been promised,      that they have worked their whole life for, will not come      through,'' said Representative Bernard Sanders, a Vermont      independent who has long opposed cash-balance pension      conversions.       Proponents of cash-balance pensions have argued that      conversions are usually harmless. They note that some      companies have voluntarily sweetened their cash-balance plans      after older workers complained.       In general, members of Congress who have served the longest      would face the greatest losses if they were given a cash-     balance payout.       Patrick J. Purcell, the Congressional Research Service      economist who conducted the study, said he worked with each      lawmaker's age and years of service without knowing whom the      numbers applied to, ``so there would be less reason for      people to question the results.''       He then used standard actuarial methods to compress each      pension--normally taken as a lifelong stream of monthly      checks--into a lump-sum payment.       Calculating the lump-sum value made comparison possible      with cash-balance benefits, which are normally given in a      single payment.       Mr. Purcell then calculated what the lawmakers'      hypothetical cash-balance benefit would be if they had had      such a pension from the day they entered Congress. That      approach made for a more straightforward comparison and      possibly gave an advantage to the cash-balance plan. In      practice, some of the most harmful effects of pension      conversions occur because employees undergo the change at      midcareer.       Mr. Portman, the Ohio Republican, was unavailable for      comment on the study. But a spokesman, Jim Morrell, noted      that in 2001, Mr. Portman sponsored legislation requiring      companies to notify employees of the way their benefits would      be affected in cash-balance conversions. That bill is now      law.       Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican from Iowa and      chairman of the Finance Committee, earned a pension worth      $508,266 under the existing plan, based on an age of 70 and      18 years of service. Under a cash-balance plan, he would have      received only $161,623, according to the study.       Mr. Grassley is also the former chairman of the Senate      Special Committee on Aging and is active on pension issues. A      spokeswoman, Jill Gerber, said Mr. Grassley could not comment      on the new findings without seeing the study.       The study also found that Representative Tom DeLay, the      House majority leader, had earned a benefit worth $608,143 at      the end of 2002 under the current plan. In a cash-balance      plan, Mr. DeLay, a Texas Republican, would receive $251,086      or 59 percent less, based on an age of 56 and 18 years of      service.       Mr. DeLay did not respond to a request for comment.       Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker,      qualified for a Congressional pension worth $540,572 at the      end of 2002. He would qualify for $164,455 in a typical cash-     balance plan, the study found, based on an age of 61 and 16      years of service.       Mr. Hastert's press secretary, John Feehery, questioned      whether it was fair to single out members of Congress for      scrutiny when the entire federal compensation system is      skewed toward smaller paychecks and larger pensions compared      with the private sector.       ``The Treasury Department and Congress are looking at ways      to make sure that any conversion is fair,'' he added. ``But      on the other hand, many companies, given the economic      downturn, are faced with the possibility of not being able to      offer any plan at     all. And that also would be bad for employees.''       Ms. Gerber noted that pension conversions in Iowa, Senator      Grassley's state, generally make it clear that companies are      backing away from traditional pensions. In the mid-1970's      there were about 1,100 pension plans in Iowa, she said, but      now there are fewer than 400. With some companies deciding      not to offer any pensions at all, she said, Mr. Grassley sees      a need to find some balance between protecting workers'      benefits and offering employers incentives to stay in the      pension system.       ``The anti-cash-balance people are just anti-cash-     balance,'' she said. ``But if you just make cash-balance      plans illegal, what are the plan sponsors going to do?''       The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan branch of      the Library of Congress, did the study at the request of Mr.      Sanders, who has introduced legislation opposing cash-balance      conversions in the past--none of it successful. He said he      hoped the new findings would ``show the hypocrisy'' of      colleagues who would let other people undergo pension      conversions but would not have to suffer ill effects      themselves.       ``If they think a cash-balance plan is good enough for      American workers, why don't they convert their own      pensions?'' he asked in an interview.       He said he intended to introduce legislation this week that      would force Congress to put its money where its mouth is: it      would require the conversion of all Congressional pensions to      the cash-balance type if the legislators allow the      administration's proposed regulations to go forward.       Mr. Sanders himself would lose 72 percent of his pension if      that happened. Based on an age of 61, with 12 years of      service, he qualified for a $416,159 lump-sum payment at the      end of 2002. In a cash-balance model, he would have received      $115,850.       He would not comment on the prospects for his cash-balance      legislation. Perhaps more pragmatically, he said he would      also introduce legislation to require companies converting      their pensions to let each worker choose whether to keep the      old plan or go with the cash-balance plan.       Some companies have done this voluntarily, he noted.       ``Kodak has done that,'' he said. ``Motorola has done that.      CSX, which is the new secretary of the Treasury's company,''      had done that, he said, referring to John W. Snow, who was      chief executive of CSX, the railway company, before Mr. Bush      appointed him in December to replace Paul H. O'Neill. As      Treasury secretary, Mr. Snow has authority over the proposed      regulations.       All of those companies converted, Mr. Sanders said, ``but      they gave workers the choice.''                          ____________________
