President, we have a whole lot of things, but it does not speak of if UNICEF borrows. ``If the United Nations * * * borrows funds from any international financial institution.'' I am not on a fishing expedition. I just want to make sure we have a clear record. I do not favor the United Nations or anybody outside of the United States or my own State of Vermont raising taxes. But we are talking about if the United Nations borrows, all of these others will then be precluded from contributions from us.  I am not trying to get the distinguished Senator from North Carolina to change his amendment. I just want to make sure we understand what it does, that is all. He has a perfect right.
