Speaker, I rise to share the powerful story of Douglas Rumsey, a retiree of Teamsters Local 707 Pension Fund. For years, Douglas paid into his pension fund. Time and again, he gave up pay raises, deferring those raises be invested in his pension to make sure his retirement would be secure with one.  Tragically, millions of hard working Americans like him now face a grim prospect, a retirement without economic security as their hard-earned pensions is pulled out from under them. Due to no fault of his own, Douglas's pension was cut from $2,800 per month to $900 per month. Today, everything is a financial struggle. He can no longer support his family He can no longer pay his property tax, or his medical insurance. Even purchasing everyday items basic to daily life is a dilemma of true necessity. After 23 years of trucking service, after he put his life on the line for this country in his service in the Army, Douglas should be able to enjoy the golden years of his life, with his friends and family, without daily financial worry. Instead, he now lives in poverty, struggling to make ends meet. A robust member of his community, his distress is felt throughout his community.  I include in the Record the full testimony of Douglas Rumsey. Douglas Rumsey is not alone in his plight. This Congress turned its back on more than 40 years of pension promises, rolling back anti-cutback provisions. It turned its back on hundreds of thousands of hard working Americans. Telling these personal experiences is critical to understand why immediate action is required to buoy hope, retirement security, and the livelihoods of millions of American workers.  It is why I introduced the ``Keep Our Pension Promises Act,'' along with Senator Bernie Sanders for the last several years, which would establish a legacy fund within the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to ensure solvency for multi-employer pension plans, but really to ensure the solvency of so many hard working American's retirements.  Additionally, it is why I joined my colleagues to introduce the ``Butch Lewis Pension Protection Act'' in honor of an Ohio Teamster. Without congressional action, nearly 50,000 Ohio retirees in the Central States Pensions Fund and thousands more Ohioans in the nearly 100 other troubled multi-employer plans pensions are in jeopardy. I have led the charge to push for a legislative fix to the multi-employer pension crisis year after year. The multi-employer pension crisis is just the tip of a looming pension crisis. It is time for Congress and this nation to come to terms with this economic threat in our own backyards.  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense issue. Congress must act now. That's why I rise in strong support of this measure, and urge my colleagues to do the same.                          LETTER TO COMMITTEE       I am a retiree of Teamsters Local 707 Pension Fund. I have      lost 70% of my pension to date. I was promised this pension      and paid into it by taking pay cuts that were part of my wage      package and by giving up pay raises to make sure my pension      was secure. I'm asking that the Select Joint Committee for      Pension to please select the Butch Lewis Act (S-2147) as the      solution for the pension crisis. The 4,500 members of my      pension fund have been suffering for two plus years with      drastic cuts. In February 2016 my pension was reduced 50% and      then in February 2017 it was cut another 20% for a total of      70%. Please get the Butch Lewis Act passed as written. The      Butch Lewis Act is not a government bailout; it helps all      multi-employer pension funds including the Coal Miners, Iron      Workers, and Carpenters.       Many of the retirees from my pension fund are losing their      homes and can't afford food and health care insurance. Many      of the retirees, including myself, are veterans and many are      disabled and are 70 and 80 years of age. Please don't turn      your back on the workers and veterans who have help build      this country by working all their lives.       I am going to have to sell my home that I have work for all      my life and I'm not able to support my wife or live my      retirement years as a self-supporting member of my community.      Without my pension I'm living below poverty. My pension has      already been cut from $2,800 per month to $900 per month. I      cannot afford to pay my property taxes pay, my medical      insurance, and my medications, heat my home and buy food. No      one can live on $900 from PBGC after they had made plans to      have their full pensions that were earned and promised.      Please include Road Carriers Local 707 in the solution to the      pension crisis solution.       I was drafted into the Army and then worked my entire life      so that I could retire with dignity and enjoy my retirement.      I am now disabled and cannot work to make up the 70% of my      pension that I have lost. I cannot enjoy my retirement years      and spend time with family and friends because of the pension      cuts I have taken. My wife and I have worked and planned all      our lives to live near family so that in our retirement years      we could enjoy and have family nearby if needed for health      issues but this too is threatened with these cuts. The stress      caused by these cuts is unbearable to us at a time we should      be enjoying the fruits of our long labor.       Above are just some of the things impacting the lives and      health of myself and many of the families of Local 707--we      are a prime example of how devastating this pension crisis      has been to us and will be to others if all our pensions are      not saved.           Thank you     Douglas Rumsey.                          ____________________
