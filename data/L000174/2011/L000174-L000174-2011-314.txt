President, as one born in Montpelier, VT, I grew up listening to WDEV in Waterbury. My mother and father were friends of the owners of the station and I still remember days as a child going to visit.  Living now in Middlesex, VT, I--like everyone else in our area listen to WDEV to find out what is happening throughout central Vermont. At a time when more and more radio stations nationwide go to a canned format, WDEV is one that has not forgotten over the decades that it is a mainstay of the community.  Recently when we were facing horrible flooding and storms in Vermont, the lifeline for all of us was WDEV. Only there could we find out what was happening on the weather, what was happening on road conditions, and what we would face. Stefan Hard of the Times Argus wrote an excellent story about Chris Bouchard and Roger Hill and what they did to keep us all safe and informed. I talked with my friend Ken Sauier, about what they had done and said I intended to speak on the Senate Floor, and now, Mr. President, I ask that the article by Stephan Hard be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                  [From the Times Argus, June 6, 2011]                             Storm-Centered                            (By Stefan Hard)       For weather forecasters Chris Bouchard and Roger Hill, who      were on duty May 27, the historic storms of that day quickly      pushed their workdays into overdrive and overtime and gave      them a first-hand taste of the crazy weather they were      reporting on. Looking back, they are both in awe at the level      of destruction caused by the storms' related flooding, but      are grateful that no one was killed.       Hill prepares forecasts for Radio Vermont, WDEV, for      utility companies, and for his WeatheringHeights.com website;      Bouchard is a staff meteorologist at the Fairbanks Museums      Eye on the Sky forecast center.       Both men knew from early in the day, May 27, that the      weather could be turning severe.       ``It was clear to us for several days that there was a      possibility for severe weather on Thursday-Friday,'' said      Bouchard. ``On the day of the event in the morning, it looked      pretty clear that we were going to get supercell      thunderstorms, large hail, damaging winds and possibly even      tornadoes.'' Bouchard reported as such during his 12:55 p.m.      weather report on Vermont Public Radio. The first supercell      of the day passed just north of Burlington at about 3p.m. and      left large hail on the ground as it passed over Lowell.      Bouchard continued his warnings through the afternoon.       By 6:30 p.m., storms were beginning to hit central Vermont,      and power was knocked out at Hill's home and forecast center      in Worcester. Hearing tornado warnings on the radio for      Caledonia County and without power to run his phalanx of      computers, Hill decided to head to the WDEV studios in      Waterbury, where the station had back-up power and where Hill      could get his own evaluations and warnings directly on the      air in the midst of what he had already determined could be      life-threatening conditions due to the continued risk of      tornadoes, dangerous lightning, and with already-saturated      ground from recent rains, a real possibility of catastrophic      flash floods. He hopped in his car and headed for Waterbury.       ``I felt a need and a responsibility to do this,'' said      Hill. ``I've haven't had anybody die on my watch and I didn't      want that to happen this time,'' he said.       Hill forgot to take his cell phone charger and didn't leave      a note for his wife, Michelle, as to where he was going. ``My      wife is very upset with me,'' he said. ``She didn't know      where I was until she heard me on the air.''       Driving through Middlesex, Hill encountered a downed tree      across the road and had to reroute and rain and hail fell and      tornado warnings continued come across on the crackling      radio. When he got to the station offices in Waterbury, the      door was locked (after business hours) and his cell battery      was dead, so he couldn't call on-air host Lee Kittell to let      him inside, and Kittell was unable to check and see emails      that Hill was sending from his netbook, which still had a      charge. Kittell was very busy and lightning temporarily      knocked out the station's computer system. Hill resorted to      running down the street to use the phone at a convenience      store to call Kittell to let him in. Once inside, Hill and      Kittell reported on the storm continuously, except for a      half-hour break for the audio track of WCAX-TV news at 11,      until 1:45 a.m.       Callers kept the phone lines lit up all evening with      reports of continuous lightning, ball lightning, hail the      size of golf balls, trees down, power outages, and worst of      all, flash flooding in Barre and Montpelier. Hill, stunned,      kept seeing a line of ``training echo'' thunderstorms      streaming     into central Vermont all night and his on-air voice became      increasingly ominous.       ``I felt stupid, but I got to the point where I was just      saying, Oh, my God!''       Meanwhile, Bouchard had finished his forecasting shift at      the Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury, and had taken to the      road, storm chasing, and didn't have the need to let anyone      know where he was going. ``I went to Barnet, because that's      where it looked like the action was going to be,'' he said.      Bouchard stopped in several locations, setting up his tripod      just outside his car to get pictures of clouds that might      produce tornadoes, and lots of lightning. Bouchard said at      one point, he grabbed his tripod and camera and jumped in his      car just as lightning bolts crashed to the ground      uncomfortably close. Bouchard never saw a tornado, and none      were confirmed from that storm outbreak, but he got some      striking lighting photos, some of those will part of a show      of 32 of his best lightning images at the Fairbanks Museum at      the end of the month.       Hill, his cell battery dead, his netbook battery now dead,      and his own batteries running low, headed home from WDEV at      about 2 a.m. after receiving, along with Kittell, countless      calls from listeners praising the duo for staying on the air      with information. Of course, on his way home, Hill couldn't      update his wife on his progress through the continuing      storms, so, when he finally made it home, he faced a storm of      another kind.       Happily, Hill and his wife, Michelle on Sunday were      beginning a belated celebration of their 25th wedding      anniversary, taking a few days off, including a little      travel. Hill has planned a small detour in their travels to      see, first-hand, the level of destruction in Springfield,      Mass., where, last week, two tornadoes struck in another      example of powerful, training echo thunderstorms.                          ____________________
