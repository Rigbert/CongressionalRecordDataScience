 President, the technical corrections in this modification obviously have been agreed to by Senator Baucus or I would not have offered it, and they are not controversial. The corrected items in this modification are technical in nature. It merely perfects policies in the Finance Committee's reported mark that were drafted incorrectly in S. 1. The corrected items also reflect drafting changes that, while small, were important from CBO's perspective in getting us a complete score. All of these technical changes are incorporated now into this modified version of S. 1.  The new version also includes an official line-by-line score from the Congressional Budget Office. I am looking forward to getting on to amendments at this point. I repeat what I said yesterday: My hope is the spirit of comity and consensus building that existed in the Finance Committee last week will be and can be, and I am surely going to work for it to be, replicated here on the Senate floor. The Finance Committee members reached across party lines to arrive at that consensus. For some it was very difficult. But the final vote showed a lot of give and take because that vote out of committee was 16 to 5. I hope that same spirit will prevail here today and in the coming days this week and next week that we are on the bill.  There was another part of the consent I did not ask. I now ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to--our professional staff has some disagreement whether or not I should be making that motion at this point, so I will not.
