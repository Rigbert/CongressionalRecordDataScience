Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are moving forward tonight with a very important bill for our Nation's seniors,our moms and dads and health professionals who care for them.                              {time}  0045  No senior should be forced to forego needed medications, take less than the prescribed dose or go without necessities in order to afford life-saving medication.  The bill before us tonight will provide much-needed comprehensive Medicare, prescriptive care for all seniors who elect to participate. For those who can least afford their prescriptions, Medicare will cover a hundred percent of these premium deductibles.  In addition to modernizing Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit, the bill before us tonight will also help to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have ready access to high-quality community-based health care services.  The bill fixes flaws in the Medicare prescription fee schedules that are resulting in significant unintended cuts in physician payments. It also improves hospitals and skilled nursing homing reimbursement, eliminates a scheduled 15 percent cut in home health payments, puts a moratorium on the cap on physical therapy reimbursement, and takes a good first step in improving reimbursement for ambulance services.  It is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to votes yes.
