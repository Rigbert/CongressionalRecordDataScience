Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to restore Medicare coverage for ultrasonic nebulizers--medical devices used to treat patients with severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and other respiratory diseases.  In April 1997, the Durable Medical Equipment Carriers [DMERC's], under the authority of the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], made a significant change in Medicare reimbursement policy that will put seniorcitizens and disabled persons with respiratory illnesses at serious risk. My legislation is very simple. It restores Medicare coverage for ultrasonic nebulizers to the same terms and conditions that existed prior to this change.  The device in question uses ultrasonic sound waves to turn medicine into a fine mist that is inhaled by the patient into the lungs. Ultrasonic nebulizers are extremely efficient at delivering medication where it is needed--the lungs--and in the optimum particle sizes.  Without any clinical justification and without any public notice or comment, the DMERC's have either eliminated Medicare coverage for ultrasonic nebulizers entirely, or reduced reimbursement rates so drastically that suppliers will no longer provide them.  The DMERC's decision was made despite the fact that ultrasonic nebulizers have been considered safe, effective, and medically necessary for years, and notwithstanding a large body of evidence that ultrasonic nebulizers are more efficient at delivering medication than the most similar alternative, the jet nebulizer or pneumatic compressor.  Furthermore, beneficiaries are being forced to switch to a metered-dose inhaler [MDI], which is not covered by Medicare. This has led to a significant increase in the out-of-pocket-costs of Medicare beneficiaries. I am particularly concerned that the additional costs borne by senior citizens may cause some to forego needed treatments--an outcome which could put their lives in jeopardy.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the increased costs to seniors, the lack of openness and public accountability, the new ``one-size fits all'' Medicare respiratory care policy is downright dangerous. While metered-dose inhalers [MDI's] are wonderful devices, they are not the appropriate therapy for every person.  Indeed, a number of well-controlled studies suggests that up to 50 percent of senior citizens do not use MDI's properly--even after repeated instruction. What these studies imply is that if HCFA does not reverse the decision of the DMERC's and restore Medicare coverage for ultrasonic nebulizers, there will be seniors, forced to switch to MDI's, who could require hospitalization because they cannot use their MDI properly.  Asthma and cystic fibrosis are not diseases to be taken lightly--if a person does not have the proper medicine, they can die. It is that simple. In fact, of the nearly 5,000 people who die every year from asthma, most deaths resulted from patients who failed to take their medication.  For those with severe arthritis or poor hand-eye coordination, they cannot use an MDI at all. They will be the real victims of the new HCFA/DMERC policy on ultrasonic nebulizers. The HCFA/DMERC decision to deny ultrasonic nebulizer coverage is a clear case of a policy that is ``penny wise and pound foolish.'' If a single inpatient hospital admission results from improper MDI usage, it will cost Medicare tens of thousands of dollars in increased costs.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the impact on seniors if the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] is allowed to begin banning metered-dose inhalers that contain chlorofluorocarbons [CFC's], as they proposed on March 6, 1997. If HCFA removes coverage for ultrasonic nebulizers, forcing seniors to use metered-dose inhalers, and FDA in turn removes most metered-dose inhalers from the market, seniors will be left with a dramatically reduced range of therapeutic options at significantly higher prices.  This outcome is completely unacceptable, and that is why my good friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Cliff Stearns, and I have joined in introducing the Senior Citizen Respiratory Care Act of 1997. Congress must act soon to reverse HCFA's ``stealth'' coverage change, and restore Medicare reimbursement to devices which are safe and effective therapeutic options for seniors with serious respiratory illnesses.                          ____________________
