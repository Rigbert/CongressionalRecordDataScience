Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), the sponsors of this bill, for H.R. 4528, which creates a new scholarship program to assist low-income students' studies overseas.  As I think my colleagues know, it is now called the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarships. During mark-up in our subcommittee, through which it moved in a bipartisan manner, we were very happy to name it after the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the distinguished chairman of our committee.  This will help a number of low-income students who very often can get the money for the tuition but do not have the means to get to the country of destination. This will facilitate that. So I think it is an excellent bill, and I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for his leadership.
