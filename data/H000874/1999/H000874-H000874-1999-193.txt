Speaker, can there be any doubt now that the leadership wants to kill campaign finance reform? If my colleagues will listen closely, they can even hear the leadership trying to talk this issue to death one more time.  The leadership has ordered 2 months of hearings. Last Thursday was our first. What did we learn? Nothing, nothing that we did not learn in 15 hours of floor debate last year on the Shays-Meehan bill, a bill that passed this House by 252 to 179; nothing that we have not learned already in the 12 committee hearings on the issue since the 104th Congress.  Mr. Speaker, the time for talk has long since passed. The Americans want and expect action. We can pass the bipartisan Shays-Meehan bill right now. These hearings are a sham designed to delay actions. As our colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), observed, if we wait until September, the Senate will just run out the clock.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sign the discharge petition to bring Shays-Meehan to the floor. Otherwise these hearings promise to be the death knell for meaningful campaign finance reform this year.                          ____________________
