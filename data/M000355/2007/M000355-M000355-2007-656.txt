 President, let me just say, with regard to the cloture motion just filed by the distinguished majority leader, that if cloture were to be invoked on the underlying bill, the opportunity to pass what has developed into a bipartisan minimum wage proposal, including both an increase in the minimum wage and tax provisions, which are important for the small businesses that tend to hire people who work at the minimum wage, would be lost. So certainly it is my hope that cloture will not be invoked on Wednesday on the underlying bill so that we could continue in the bipartisan spirit in which we have begun this session of Congress and move forward on a bill that in all likelihood will receive, at the end of the process, a very large bipartisan vote of support, and that is a combination of the minimum wage increase and the small business tax provision.  So I encourage my colleagues on this side of the aisle to, in the spirit of bipartisanship, defeat that so we can continue to deal with the substitute that I think will enjoy broad bipartisan support.
