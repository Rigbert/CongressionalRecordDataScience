President, today I want to draw attention to the 11th annual National Assisted Living Week, which begins on September 11 and continues through September 17. Created in 1995 by the National Center for Assisted Living, and being celebrated for the second time in conjunction with the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging and Assisted Living Federation of America, National Assisted Living Week emphasizes the importance of assisted living services to the more than 1 million seniors and persons with disabilities who rely on them every day.  The theme for this week is ``A Fair to Remember.'' The theme encourages assisted living facilities to create their own ``Fair'' environment for the residents, families, staff, volunteers and local community and to celebrate their time together and share the fun with family and friends.  Assisted living continues to grow in importance as our society's demographics change and as we live longer. Seniors and their families want a homelike setting and are seeking alternatives to nursing homes. Because assisted living has been able to develop to meet community needs, it can be very different in different States. However, the goal is the same: to provide quality care for those who need some help in caring for themselves but are not in need of the care provided by a nursing home.  My home State of Oregon pioneered the concept of assisted living, and I am proud of my State's ability to continue to evolve the concept so that it meets the changing needs of seniors. All of us want to be in a safe environment and as independent as possible for as long as possible. Assisted living provides care while maintaining the dignity of the individuals they serve. Our Nation must continue to support those long-term care options that allow consumers the care setting that is appropriate for their needs.                          ____________________
