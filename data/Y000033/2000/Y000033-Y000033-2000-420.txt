Reclaiming my time, I happen to agree with the gentleman, but remember the balance that I was talking about. Without this provision, if this amendment was adopted, if this amendment was adopted, then, very frankly, the package falls. I have to tell the gentlemen that. They understand that.  So I would suggest respectfully that we defeat the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Fossella). All time on the amendment has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
