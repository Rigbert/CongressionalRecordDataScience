 President, this vote had to be held open in order to allow time for Vice President Pence to come down and break a tie.  My colleagues and I came to the floor weeks ago to make clear that this harmful legislation should not come to the floor. Republicans didn't listen to us, and they didn't listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable. We are not going to give up. We are going to keep holding them accountable, and we are going to keep making sure that women's voices are heard.  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have already come and will continue to come to the floor today to stand against this shameful, dangerous resolution.
