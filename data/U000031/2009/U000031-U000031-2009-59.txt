 Portage Northern's forensic program, led by Coach Laurel Scheidt, has a rich 44 year history with 11 state titles to its name. The team had a successful 2009 season with first-place finishes at every invitational and an excellent performance at both the district and regional competitions. At this year's state competition over 80 schools and 800 students participated. The Northern team dominated the Class A division, qualifying the maximum 28 entries to the tournament with 45 students. Northern collected a record 1,066 sweepstake points defeating second place finisher Birmingham Seaholm High School by over 330 points.  It is an honor to congratulate the entire 2009 Portage Northern Forensic Team and pay special tribute to first-place finishers Andrew Beckner, Spencer Dudd, John Kramer, Kasey McSoley, Brennan Mange, Bryce Maurer, Nich Mueller, Nathan Novaria, Brady O'Brien, Caitlin Utt, Allyson Williams and Amanda Willoughby.  On behalf of all residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Portage Northern Forensic Team, Coach Laurel Scheidt and the entire Portage Community--you are an inspiration to us all. Go Huskies!                          ____________________
