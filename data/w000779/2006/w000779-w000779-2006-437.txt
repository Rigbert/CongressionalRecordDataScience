 As the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee knows, Senator Grassley and I have worked for a decade to bring some openness and accountability to the Senate by requiring that when a Senator puts a hold on a major piece of legislation, they would have to disclose it publicly. Senator Grassley and I are ready to go with that bipartisan amendment which we have worked on for a decade. I would simply ask the distinguished chairman of the committee and the ranking minority member what the process is so that Senator Grassley and I can bring forward this bipartisan amendment. I pose my question to the distinguished chairman of the committee.
