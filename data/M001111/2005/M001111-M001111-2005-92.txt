 President, I wanted to take a minute, as we finish this bill, to again thank my colleague from Missouri for his tremendous work on this bill. I know he has been under personal duress today and had a late night last night, but his team won despite what it appears to be. I think he has done a tremendous job and I wish to thank him.  I also wish to thank all of the majority staff, John Kamarck Paul Doerrer, Cheh Kim, Lula Edwards, Josh Manley, and Matt McCardle for their help in working with us for many months along the way, and also our minority staff, Peter Rogoff, Kate Hallahan, Diana Hamilton, Bill Simpson, Meaghan McCarthy, as well as my personal staff, especially Casey Sixkiller. I also want to thank all of the floor staff who have been diligent in working with us as we have moved this bill through and again thanks to my colleague from Missouri for his tremendous work on this bill.
