 We are waiting for Members to bring their amendments to the floor.  For the information of all Senators, there will not be votes after 3 o'clock tomorrow, as everybody knows. We intend to finish this bill by Wednesday. So there is not a lot of floor time tomorrow.  If anyone has an amendment, offer it tonight. We will set up the vote for tomorrow or Wednesday. Again, we intend to finish this bill by Wednesday. So do not expect that your amendments will have time after that.  Again, I ask Members who have amendments to bring them to the floor and offer them so we can get them considered and up for a vote.  Again, it is going to be a short week. We need to get the bill done by Wednesday. We ask everybody to please consider that and come and offer their amendments so we can get this bill moving.
