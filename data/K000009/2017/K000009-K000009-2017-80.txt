Chairman, I just wanted to add a bit to that.  I thank Congressman Mast very much for offering this amendment. I do think we need to work with the Corps. Obviously, this is a growing problem. We have heard from Florida colleagues. We have heard from colleagues in Nevada, throughout the Great Lakes region.  These algal blooms are truly frightening. In the Midwest, in the Great Lakes region, a major water system was shut down for 3 days in the city of Toledo, denying water to over half a million people for 3 days. It is quite frightening.  At the moment, there is no--and I say this for the Corps' benefit, because it would require cooperation with other agencies--ecosystem satellite mapping or drone technology currently that is able to photo large regions and home in on where the nutrients are that are causing the problem.                              {time}  2000  As I have gotten into this more deeply, we need high science, whether it is high-frequency infrared or whatever we use. We do not have the ability to home in on where the causes are coming from and then target the toxic portions of those algal blooms.  So a lot of work is needed, and I really appreciate the gentleman rising tonight. I know you have gotten the Corps' attention as you have gotten our attention, and we will work with the chairman to see if we can't make progress on this really vexing issue.
