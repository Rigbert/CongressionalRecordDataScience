 President, I rise today in honor of Women's History Month to recognize the tremendous achievements women have made for the United States and pay tribute to their tireless efforts to fight for themselves, their families, and all Americans.  We have set aside this month for over 30 years to give us the opportunity to not only reflect on the past and observe the many accomplishments of American women, but to also inspire the next generation of women leaders. I look upon the great courage our foremothers have displayed with great admiration and continue to personally be inspired by those who blazed the trail for women like me.  When I first came to Washington in 1992, they called it the ``Year of the Woman.'' Only two other women were serving in the Senate, and four women had just been elected to the chamber, myself included. Today, a quarter of the Senate is represented by women and a record 102 women serve in the House of Representatives, including the first woman speaker. I am proud of the progress we've made and hopeful we will continue to build on that momentum toward full equality..  Even at record levels, though, the number of women in Congress falls far short of the 51 percent of our Nation's population that are women. I have great hope in the next generations of women to rise up and help lead the way in building a better California and United States.  As in government, women have been and continue to be leaders in major social change efforts in our Nation. The business world has been transformed by powerful women at the table, as have science, music, film, athletics, literature, and much more. Today, there are more than 10 million women owned American businesses and half of our workforce is made up of women.  Enrollment numbers at medical and law schools are now almost evenly split between men and women. Our women warriors serve in critical roles in the U.S. Armed Forces, with more than 200,000 active-duty servicewomen proudly serving and a growing number of women veterans representing every branch of service.  Women who have selflessly answered the call to duty have served their Nation with honor, courage, and distinction. I have the utmost respect for the dignity and valor they exhibit and they are commended.  As a United States Senator proudly representing California, I ask you to join me in celebrating the stories and greatness of American women who accomplished the unprecedented and honor their legacies by continuing to defend the rights they worked so hard to achieve. Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.                            ____________________
