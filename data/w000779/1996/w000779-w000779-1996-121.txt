President, I introduce the Kinship Care Act of 1996. Today Representative Connie Morella is introducing companion legislation in the House.  Grandparents caring for grandchildren represent one of the most underappreciated natural resources in our Nation. They hold tremendous potential for curing one of our society's most pressing maladies: The care of children who have no parents, or whose parents simply aren't up to the task of providing children a stable, secure and nurturing living environment.  There is such a great reservoir of love and experience available to us, and more especially to the tens of thousands of American children who desperately need basic care giving. We provide public assistance to strangers for this kind of care, but the folks available to provide foster care homes are in short supply.  At the same time, inflexibility in current regulations often force us toignore a precious alternative that is right at our doorstep. Our public policy planners have missed the forest for the trees. Grandparents can fill the gap. They are ready, willing and able to provide the kind of care these youngsters so desperately need.  The legislation I plan to introduce in the Senate today will give States the flexibility to provide the support these grandparents need, so that our seniors can help fill the care gap.  The House included my legislation, similar to today's bill, as part of the welfare reform measure last year. My new legislation will continue the process of shifting the focus of our child welfare system from turning children over to strangers, to granting them the loving arms of grandparents and other relatives.  States have been moving in this direction for over a decade. Over the past 10 years the number of children involved in extended family arrangements has increased by 40 percent. Currently, more than 3 million children are being raised by their grandparents. In other words, 5 percent of all families in this country are headed by grandparents.  It's time that the Federal Government get with the program and start developing policies that make it easier, instead of more difficult, for families to come together to raise their children.  My bill has several parts. The first would require States to give preference to relative providers when a child is removed from their parents' home. Too often I have heard stories of grandparents or other relatives, not finding out that their grandchildren have been removed from their children's home. By the time they know what is happening, the grandchildren are locked into the foster care system.  Often I have heard stories where brothers and sisters are split up and grandparents spend years in court trying to reunite their own families. As we rethink our child protection system, we need to rededicate ourselves to looking to families, including extended families, for solutions. When a child is separated from their parents, it is usually a painful and traumatic experience. Living with people that a child knows and trusts gives children a better chance in the world and gives families a better chance to rebuild themselves.  The second part of my bill allows States to obtain waivers to set up kinship care guardianship systems where grandparents and other relative providers can receive some financial assistance without having to turn over custody of the child to the State, and without having to go through the paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles of the foster care system.  Our child protection system is where our welfare system was about 10 years ago. We know it isn't working well, but States and the Federal Government are still fumbling for solutions. What we need to do now, as we did for our welfare system, is start opening the door for States to try new ideas to both protect children and keep families together.  As we reevaluate the effectiveness of our country's child protection systems, it's time that we identify new ideas and new ways to find loving environments for our Nation's most vulnerable children. Grandparents can provide the lynchpin for such a new system.                                 ______      By
