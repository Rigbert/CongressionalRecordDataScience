Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize Edgewater Behavioral Health Services as the organization celebrates its 40th anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the organization is hosting a celebratory event on Friday, October 17, 2014, at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza, in Merrillville, Indiana.   The growing need for quality mental health care in the United States led to Congress passing the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. The Gary Community Mental Health Center was one of the original facilities set up in Indiana after the passage of this bill. In 1974, due to the hard work of many leaders in Gary at the time, the center was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization. Over the years, the organization continued to grow, expanding its range of services and leadership. Under the direction of current president and chief executive officer, Dr. Danita Johnson Hughes, the center's name was changed to Edgewater Systems for Balanced Living, Inc. and, in 2014, began doing business under the name Edgewater Behavioral Health Services. Edgewater provides services ranging from crisis intervention and addiction services to day treatment, out-patient programs, and residential services, to name a few. Due to the outstanding leadership of Dr. Johnson Hughes and the entire staff, Edgewater currently provides services for over 30,000 clients each year. The organization also provides over $3 million in services to charity cases.   Edgewater partners with other service providers, groups, and organizations in order to meet the needs of each person that walks through its doors. This year, Edgewater is honoring Dr. Daniel Lowery, Ph.D., president of Calumet College of Saint Joseph, with the Commonweal Award for Personal and Professional Leadership. This award recognizes distinctive contributions made by individuals who hold the value of the common good over personal gain. The Sojourner Truth House, a ministry for women and children in Gary, will be honored with the Commonweal Award for Institutional Leadership. This award recognizes institutional and organizational leadership that promotes the common good within communities faced with long-term, difficult challenges. For their exceptional commitment to the community of Northwest Indiana, and for touching the lives of countless individuals, each recipient is worthy of the honors bestowed upon them.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Edgewater Behavioral Health Services as the organization celebrates its 40th anniversary. Edgewater has played an important role in enriching the quality of life in Northwest Indiana. As a community we are grateful and proud to have had its support during the past 40 years. For its remarkable leadership, devotion, and compassion shown in its service to so many in need, Edgewater is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
