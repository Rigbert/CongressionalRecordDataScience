President, earlier I put into the Record the letter that I was honored to sign with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia explaining why we should not go forward with this amendment to the Constitution.  Let me say one last thing on this. Ours is a powerful Constitution. It is inspiring because of what it allows. It is inspiring because it protects the liberty of all of us.  Think of the responsibility the 100 of us here have. Let us be good stewards. Let's keep for our children and our children's children the Constitution with protections as well considered as those bequeathed to us by the founders, the patriots, and the hard-working Americans who preceded us. Work together to improve crime victims' rights in legislation. Let the States do the same. But let us remember that the 100 of us are the ones who must reserve constitutional amendments for those matters for which there are no other alternatives available, and this is not such a matter.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
