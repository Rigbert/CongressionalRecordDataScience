Ernest Tomasi. Dr. Tomasi was named the distinguished citizen of the year by the Montpelier Rotary Club.  Madam President, I have known Dr. Tomasi my whole life. And my parents knew him even before I did. He is a remarkable man, and probably one of the last examples of a country doctor, even though he has always practiced in our capital city.  Dr. Tomasi, a man very proud of his Italian heritage, as was my late mother, was one who would make sure that everybody who needed a physician received that physician's care.  So many times people would come to him telling him that they could not afford a doctor's care but needed a doctor's care. They always got it. It would be remarkable if somebody were able to tally up all the people of central Vermont who were cared for by him but never received a bill because they could not pay for it.  I also think of the number of times as a youngster seeing him going out making house calls, and then even in later years, even after I became a U.S. Senator, seeing Dr. Tomasi with his battered bag heading off for house calls.  It was my privilege to see him in 1994, when he went back for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. He had landed on Normandy as a young medic and, as he said, was one of the only ones who went ashore without guns. He also tells some pretty horrific stories of what happened to the people who were landing. It was a mark of his bravery that even though he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and a Presidential Citation, this was never a part of his conversation, and only reluctantly did he go back for the 50th anniversary.  My wife and I had a chance to talk with him on different occasions while he was there. He was one of the brave, brave people President Clinton and General Shalikashvili and others referred to at that celebration.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Longtime Doctor Named Rotary's Citizen Of Year'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Longtime Doctor Named Rotary's Citizen of Year                           (By Art Edelstein)       Dr. Ernest Tomasi's medical office on Barre Street could      well be the setting for a Norman Rockwell painting: The suite      of rooms does not sparkle in medicinal white, there are no      secretaries behind glass partitions, and the examining tables      are from a bygone era.       But Tomasi can be forgiven the lack of high technology. Now      semi-retired, he has practiced medicine locally for 50 years,      delivering at least 1,000 babies. Along the way, he raised      six of his own children, treated many patients without taking      a fee and contributed to innumerable volunteer efforts.       His career has not gone unnoticed. Earlier this month,      Tomasi received the Montpelier Rotary Club's Distinguished      Citizen of the Year award for his many years of service to      the community.       Tomasi, who turns 83 at the end of February, is a cheery      man who doesn't boast about his formidable medical career and      his years in the armed services.       ``I think the fact that he has continued to practice      medicine and is an old-style doctor interested in his      patients first made him a great candidate,'' said Rotary      President Roderic Sherman. ``He is an outstanding example of      good deeds.''       ``He has been providing services to anyone needing medical      help for 50 years,'' said David Pinkham, who chaired the      selection committee. ``Dr. Tomasi provides services for      barter, or free. He is an example of somebody doing something      for others.''       A Montpelier native, Tomasi graduated from St. Michael's      high school on Barre Street, and from the University of      Vermont medical school in 1942. After interning for a year in      Waterbury, Conn., where he met his wife, he joined the U.S.      Army.       Tomasi doesn't like to talk much about his role as a member      of the D-Day invasion force that landed on the Normandy coast      of France on June 6, 1944. He said his team of medics were      brave men. ``They were the only ones who went ashore without      guns,'' he said.       Tomasi earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart      and the Presidential Citation.       Tomasi travelled back to France to celebrate the 50th      anniversary of D-Day in 1994. The trip, paid for by his      colleagues at the Central Vermont Hospital, brought back      painful memories of his war years. ``It was so horrible. I      saw a lot of soldiers die,'' he said.       ``I didn't want to go back to Omaha Beach; there were too      many bad memories.''       But there were some better memories of his tour of duty in      Europe that he can smile about. In 1944, after the Allies      began defeating the Germans, Tomasi and his unit liberated      the first town on the German border near the Elbe River.      There he delivered a baby girl. Years later he received a      letter from that child when she became an adult.       ``He doesn't talk much, especially about his trip to Europe      in 1994,'' said his wife of 50 years, Barbara Tomasi. ``He      landed and all these boys around him were killed. Going back      to the beach and cemetery were emotional.''       While the war was an unpleasant experience, Tomasi did not      shirk his responsibilities to his fellow veterans. He has      been an active member of the American Legion and Veterans of      Foreign Wars and has served as the Post doctor for 30 years.       After the war, Tomasi returned to Montpelier to practice      medicine. He has witnessed many changes in the medical      profession in his half-century of practice.       ``It's all changing too fast,'' he said. ``I wish I could      live long enough to see how it comes out.''       A surgeon, he no longer performs operations but continues      to assist in them.       Tomasi began scaling back on his practice in 1994. Before      then, his wife said, he kept a grueling schedule.       ``He would work from 8 in the morning until 11 or midnight      with a supper break,'' she said. ``He did this until three      years ago when he cut back on patients. He still makes      occasional house calls.''       Adera White, a friend and former nurse, said Tomasi is a      special doctor.       ``Through medicine, he's done much. He would treat people      and not get paid; for years he never sent bills to any of his      patients,'' she said. ``Whoever felt they could pay, paid      him. He wasn't in it for the money, that's for sure.''       While Tomasi said he is thinking about retiring from      medicine, his wife doubts he will quit his life's work.       ``This is the only thing he has; he is devoted to his      patients,'' she said. ``He loves sports, but never had any      hobbies. * * * I don't think he will ever retire.''                          ____________________
