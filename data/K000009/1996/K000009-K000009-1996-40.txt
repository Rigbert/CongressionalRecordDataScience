Speaker, tomorrow it is my understanding that the Subcommittee on Trade of the House Committee on Ways and Means will be holding hearings on the very important issue of China and the renewal of most-favored-nation trade status with China. I am here this evening to enter remarks in the Record because the committee scheduled these hearings very quickly, without much public notice, and is allowing no Member of Congress to testify on this very important issue.  If I had been allowed to testify tomorrow, I would be one Member of Congress who would state that I strongly believe that this issue deserves more than a perfunctory hearing largely closed to the public, and to the membership, because a new course in our relations with China must be struck; a course that reflects the rule of law and benefits the wider populace of both our great nations rather than the base material interests of a few who trade off that closed marketplace.  Congress has been voting annually on China and its preferred trade status since 1974 when Jackson-Vanik was signed into law, which tied the internal politics of nonmarket economies to their external trading relations with the United States. Jackson-Vanik was a good idea in 1974, and it remains a good idea today if anybody would bother to go back and read it.  The amendment provided a classic carrot-stick approach to policy. The carrot was the U.S. market. The stick was taking away any nation's most favored trading status if it hurt us or it did not live up to our highest ideals. While China has been gorging itself these many years on the carrot of our marketplace, somewhere along the line we lost the stick to effect change in regard to China's attitudes and policies toward our country and toward the citizens of both our nations.  Every year since 1974, President after President, from President Ford to President Clinton, have stood before this Congress and the American people to assure us that our trading relations with China will improve if China's most-favored-nation status is renewed for just 1 more year. This, of course has not happened.  If we refer to this chart here, over the past decade alone the United States has recorded a 1,000 percent increase in our trade deficit with China. Just this year alone, it is projected to be even higher than ever in the past, over $40 billion of additional debt, another record.  Thirty-three percent of China's exports come here to this market. One out of every three products they send someplace else in the world ends up on our shelves. At this pace, China will surpass Japan in the next 2 to 3 years as the nation with which we possess the largest trade deficit in the world. And of course, as our trade deficits have been getting larger and larger every year, the pull-down on our wage levels is greater and greater very year and the erosion of our manufacturing base greater and greater every year as we watch it replaced with service jobs that pay so much less.  If we look at what is happening, however, under China MFN it effectively says to China they have a 2-percent tariff rate to get into our market, but guess how much China's tariff rate is against our goods, even with MFN? Thirty to forty percent. Thirty to forty percent. What kind of a deal is it for our country where we lower our barriers to their goods, but they refuse to lower their barriers to ours? What kind of a deal is it for us?  China is a closed command economy with tariff rates much higher than our own and, beyond that, exchange rates which they manipulate that actually increase the price of our goods into their market by over 50 percent. We know, beyond the exchange rates, beyond tariff barriers, our own U.S. Trade Representative has stated in a report that there are so many nontariff barriers that China also employs to prevent our goods from going into that land, and also is known for other trade abuses involving arbitrary standards, testing, labeling, certification. Their government procurement process remains largely closed to foreign competition. They engage in export subsidies, theft of intellectual property, and they employ an array of barriers to our services and foreign investment.  There is no question who benefits from the renewal of China MFN. It is not the American worker. It is companies like Wal-Mart that employ 700 different contract shops, that employ people in China at 10 cents an hour to make everything from toys to Nike shoes that they then send back into our market, and our people's prices are not lowered. Forty percent of our own apparel industry, for example, has been wiped out, out of this country, replaced by Chinese production, and it is as though nobody here in Washington has even been hit with a brick bat over the head.  Let me say that in the days ahead I will be putting in the Record additional information about what China MFN actually means to our country and the people of China. It is time to stand for the rule of law and reciprocity in trade.                          ____________________
