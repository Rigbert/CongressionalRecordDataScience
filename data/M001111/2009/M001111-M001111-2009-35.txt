 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., Wednesday, November 18; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, and that Senator Rockefeller be recognized to speak; that following his remarks, there be a period of morning business for 2 hours, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first hour and the Republicans controlling the next hour; that following morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the nomination of David Hamilton to be U.S. circuit judge for the Seventh Circuit. Finally, I ask that the postcloture time count during any adjournment, recess, or period of morning business.
