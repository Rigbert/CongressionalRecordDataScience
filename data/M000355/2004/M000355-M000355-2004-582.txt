 President, a short while ago I filed a cloture motion relative to the JOBS bill. That cloture vote will occur on Wednesday of this week. The chairman will be back tomorrow to discuss the importance of this legislation, and we hope to finish the bill this week. Amendments may still be considered prior to the cloture vote, and we will continue to look for an opportunity to consider amendments that are relevant to the underlying bill. Rollcall votes are, therefore, possible during tomorrow's session. Senators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.
