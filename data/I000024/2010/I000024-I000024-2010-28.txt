I think the Senator from Massachusetts is right that we have covered enough of this tonight. There are some things that would be worth going into in a closed session. One thing that doesn't have to be in a closed session is the fact that there is a long record of Russians not complying with the first treaty. I would rather use another word than ``cheating,'' but that is one that everyone understands, and that has characterized Russia's behavior in previous treaties.  The statement we are making right now, everyone is in agreement that the lower the arsenal becomes, the more significant it is for inspections for verification. I think everyone is in agreement with that. That is something that is probably the strongest point of our argument.  The last thing I will say is just to repeat something I said for which I was a little bit overwhelmed when I said it. This is the first in 51 years that we have missed our wedding anniversary. And what I was trying to say before I got choked up is to my wife at home: I love you more today than I did 51 years ago.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.                          ____________________
