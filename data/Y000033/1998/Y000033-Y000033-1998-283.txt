Mr. Speaker, today I am filing a report by the Committee on Resources entitled Abuse of Power: The Hardrock Bonding Rule which presents the results of the Committee's oversight investigation of an informal rule-making process at the Department of Interior. We are publishing the report in order to open the curtains and let full sunlight shine on Interior's rule-making process. The issue here is not about mining--it is about the right of a citizen to meaningful participation in the rule-making process.  The report concludes that Department documents obtained by the Committee clearly show that undue interference of political appointees at Interior in the rule-making was so great that the integrity of the rule-making process itself was discredited. In addition, the new rule was published despite warnings from Interior's own regulation writers and lawyers that they had significant concerns about compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).  After this regulation was implemented, political appointees at the Department of Interior attempted to prevent and obstruct the Committee on Resources from carrying out its Constitutional oversight responsibilities. A drawn-out string of dilatory tactics was initiated after all document pertaining to this rule-making were requested. Some records were produced by Interior pursuant to this request, but many documents were withheld from the Committee under a prospective claim of ``privilege.'' The Department also tried to impose rules and conditions under which this Committee could have access to documents. After these dilatory tactics continued for more than three months, the Committee subpoenaed the documents.  In their dissenting views file with the report, the Minority argues that the documents obtained under the subpoena are confidential and part of the deliberative process. We disagree. A consensus has emerged under the APA that a rule-making record or file should be created in informal rule-making. In Citizensto Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, the Supreme Court stated that, although agency action is entitled to a presumption of regularity, ``that presumption is not to shield [the] action from a thorough, probing, in-depth review.'' 401 U.S. 402 (1971). These documents are part of the rule-making record.  An appendix to the report contains some of the subpoenaed documents which illustrate the serious problems with this rule-making. Perhaps this will encourage the political appointees at Interior to comply with the laws governing rule-makings and goad the Department into reforming their rule-making process to restore meaningful input from the American people. Certainly, a higher standard can be expected of the ``most ethical Administration'' in American history.  The Minority also says that ``despite assurances to the contrary'' during oversight hearings conducted by Subcommittee on Mineral and Energy Resources Chairman Barbara Cubin, the report concludes that actions by a special assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals constitutes a ``serious conflict of interest.'' The Minority is construing more from these remarks than we implied. Indeed, immediately after this statement during the June 19th hearing, Chairman Cubin told Department officials that ``the cure for this problem or perceived problem would be to allow public comment, because the appearance isn't very pretty. I mean it really looks bad. . . .'' Interior was also withholding key documents from the Committee at the time of the oversight hearings. Interior produced these documents, but only after they were subpoenaed, nearly two months after these remarks were made.  In fact, Interior recently lost a lawsuit over this regulation. The Minority Views to the report try to minimize this stating that the court ``did find that DOI [Interior] violated only the procedural requirement of the RFA [Regulatory Flexibility Act] by not consulting with the SBA [Small Business Administration] on the definition of a `small entity.' ''  The court decision concerned whether Interior obeyed the law in issuing the regulation. The court granted a summary judgment against Interior, which means that after construing all of the relevant facts in the most favorable light for Interior, the court found that Interior had no case, and ordered the Department to rescind the regulation and start over.  In her concluding statement, the judge said, ``While recognizing the public interest in preserving the environment, the Court also recognizes the public interest in preserving the rights of parties which are affected by government regulation to be adequately informed when their interests are at stake and to participate in the regulatory process ad directed by Congress [emphasis added].'' I am attaching a copy of this Court decision to these remarks for inclusion in the Record.  The Resources Committee told Interior officials more than a year ago--long before the Department was sued--that the new rule was illegal because the department violated the rule-making process. We urged them to withdraw the rule and correct these violations. Instead, Interior wasted taxpayer money defending an untenable position in a lawsuit.  This whole sorry episode results from the refusal of a few imperious, high-level, politically motivated bureaucrats to obey laws that govern a rule-making. Accountability is the issue. Political bosses at Interior, who love to write regulations for others to obey or face severe penalties, refuse to heed laws that regulate their own actions. Shouldn't they be accountable too?   [United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil                        Action No. 97-1013 (JLG)] Northwest Mining Association, plaintiff, v. Bruce Babbitt, Secretary,             U.S. Department of Interior; et al., defendants                               memorandum       This matter is before the Court on opposing motions for      summary judgment. The Plaintiff, Northwest Mining Association      (``NWMA'', disputes a final rule enacted by Defendant United      States Bureau of Land Management (``BLM'') concerning      reclamation of mining lands. The Small Business      Administration (``SBA'') submitted an amicus curiae brief in      favor of NWMA's position. The Arizona Mining Association and      the Nevada Mining Association jointly submitted an amici      curie brief, also in favor of NWMA's position. The Court      heard oral argument on March 10, 1998. For the reasons that      follow, NWMA's motion is granted and the BLM's motion is      denied.                             I. Background       In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and      Management Act (``FLPMA''), 43 U.S.C. 1701, (et seq. (1994).      Congress declared in the FLPMA that it is the policy of the      federal government, through the Secretary of the Interior, to      manage public lands ``in a manner which recognizes the      Nation's need for domestic sources of minerals . . . from      public lands[.]'' 43 U.S.C.  1701(a)(12).\1\ Congress,      however, also recognized the need to manage the public lands      ``in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific,      scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and      atmospheric, water resource, and archaeological values[.]''      43 U.S.C. Sec. 1701(a)(8). Accordingly, while managing public      lands under the Act, the Secretary and the BLM must ``take      any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue      degradation of the lands'' by ``regulation or otherwise.'' 43      U.S.C. Sec. 1732(b).---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\The Secretary is charged ``to promulgate rules and      regulations to carry out the purposes of [the] Act.'' 43      U.S.C. Sec. 1740. The administrator of these rules and      regulations is the Director of the BLM, through the authority      and at the direction of the Secretary. 43 U.S.C.      Sec. 1731(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The BLM's obligatory duty to prevent unnecessary or undue      degradation of public lands has significant application in      the mining industry. The extraction of hardrock minerals,      such as gold and copper, often involves the excavation of      large open pits, the use of toxic chemicals, disruption of      underground water, and various other negative environmental      effects. Historically, some miners abandoned their claims      after the minerals ran out and left the land disturbed. In      many cases, the use of millions of dollars of public funds      has been required to reclaim such old, abandoned mining      operations and return them to an environmentally sound state.      (Def. Mem. at 2-3.)       In 1981, the BLM responded to this problem by promulgating      regulations, set forth in 43 C.F.R. Sec. 3809, which allowed      it to require bonds from miners in certain situations.      Bonding ensures a miner's compliance with environmental      standards by proactively funding the reclamation before the      operation begins. In the event of a miner's default of its      reclamation obligation, the bond, or other surety, will      fund the environmental restoration, not the public. (Def.      Mem. at 2-3.)       The original regulations defined three levels of mining      activities: ``casual'' level use, where only negligible      disturbance of the land results (43 C.F.R. Sec.  3809.0-     5(b)); ``notice'' level use, where mining operations are      greater than casual use but still disturb less than five      acres per calender year and where the operator need only      submit a general notification of operations to the BLM before      commencement (43 C.F.R. Sec. 3809.1-3(a)-(c)); and ``plan''      level use, where more than five acres per calendar year are      disturbed and where the operator must submit a detailed plan      of all operations and reclamation to be undertaken to the BLM      for approval (43 C.F.R. Sec. 3809.2-9(b)). The original      regulations allowed the BLM to require plan level operators      to post a bond to ensure the reclamation of disturbed areas,      but such bonds were not mandatory to all plan level      operations (43 C.F.R. 3809.1`-9(b)).       On July 11, 1991, the BLM issued a notice of proposed      rulemaking to amend its bonding requirement rules. The      proposed rule would require bonds for all mining operations      larger than casual level use. 56 Fed. Reg. 31,602 (1991).      Notice level operators would be required to post a $5,000      bond for each claim, Id. at 31,604, while plan level      operators would be required to post a bond in an amount      specified by the BLM, but in no case to exceed $1,000 per      acre for explorational operations and $2,000 per acre for      mining operations. Id. at 31,605. Additionally, the proposed      rule would allow alternative financial instruments to be      substituted or bonds, Id. at 31,602, and would require      operators with a history of noncompliance with BLM      regulations to file plans on subsequent operations which      would normally be conducted on a notice level. Id. at 31,602.       The BLM stated that it would accept comments on the      proposed rule amendments until September 9, 1991, Id. at      31,602, but later extended the comment period to October 9,      1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 41,315 (1991)).       On February 28, 1997, almost six years after the original      proposal, the BLM issued the final rule. 62 Fed. Reg. 9093      (1997). The final rule contained several substantive      differences from the proposed rule which are pertinent to      this case. Most notably, notice level and plan level      operators are each required by the final rule to post bonds      for 100 percent of the estimated reclamation costs. Id. at      9100, 9101.       Additionally, the final rule requires notice and plan level      operators to employ an outside engineer to calculate and      certify the cost of reclamation of the disturbed areas, Id.      at 9100-01, provide bonds for all its existing mining      disturbances within ninety days (if not in compliance with      the rules), Id. at 9103, and meet water quality standards for      one year at the reclaimed site before the bond would be      released. Id. at 9102. The final rule imposed criminal      sanctions on persons who knowingly violate the regulations.      Id. at 9103.       The BLM stated that the rule, as enacted, would not have a      significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.      Id. at 9099. The BLM defined ``small entity'' as ``an      individual, small firm, or partnership at arm's length from      control of any parent companies.'' Id. at 9099.       The NWMA seeks summary judgment under the Administrative      Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 551, et seq. (1994)      (``APA'') on the basis that there was no notice in the      proposed rule of the 100 percent bond requirement, the      professional third party engineer requirement, the water      quality requirement, or of the potential criminal sanctions.       Alternatively, the NWMA seeks summary judgment under the      Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 601,      et seq. (1994) (as amended by Pub. L. 104-121, Title II, 110      Stat. 864-67 (1996)) on the grounds that, when certifying      that the final rule would not have a     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small      entities, the BLM did not use the Small Business      Administration's definition of ``small miner'' and did not      follow the appropriate procedure for adopting an alternate      definition as required by the RFA.       The BLM generally denies the NWMA's allegations and itself      moves the Court for summary judgment, arguing that the NWMA      lacks standing to object. The BLM alleges that, since the      NWMA failed to participate in the rulemaking process by      filing any comments during the appropriate period, the NWMA      lacks standing to challenge the new rule under the APA. \2\      The BLM also alleges that, because the NWMA is not itself a      small entity, it lacks standing to challenge the new rule      under the RFA.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ The NWMA asserts that, in fact, it did submit comments,      but that its records of such have been lost in the      intervening five years. (Pl. Mem. At 12-13, Pl. Reply at 3-     7.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             II. Discussion       The Court shall grant summary judgment ``if the pleadings,      depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on      file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there      is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the      moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.''      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317      (1986).                        A. Standing of the NWMA       The BLM claims that the NWMA does not have standing to      object to its final rule under either the APA or the RFA      because it did not submit comments during the notice and      comment period. The NWMA asserts that it need not have      submitted comments because the BLM's original rule proposal      did not properly inform it that its interests were at stake.      The NWMA further asserts that, in any event, it has      associational standing as a representative of its members.       The Plaintiff is correct. The nature of the NWMA's claims      under the APA is that there was insufficient notice of the      altered and additional aspects of the final rule given by the      BLM in its initial proposal. There is no way the NWMA could      have submitted comments regarding interests it was not      informed were at stake.       The BLM also challenges the NWMA's assertion of      associational standing, contending that it does not apply to      rulemaking procedures. The BLM does not provide an      explanation of why this is so. In Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.      490 (1974), and Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising      Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333 (1977), the Supreme Court refined its      associational standing doctrine into a three-prong test.       ``[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of      its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have      standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it      seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose;      and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested      requires the participation of individual members in the      lawsuit.''--Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.       The Plaintiff here meets these elements and the Court finds      no basis to conclude that rulemaking should be regarded as      exempt from this test. Accordingly, the Court finds that the      NWMA has standing under the APA to object to the final rule      at issue here.       The BLM also claims that the NWMA lacks standing under the      Regulatory Flexibility Act because the language of the RFA      extends standing to seek judicial review only to a ``small      entity.'' The RFA provides that ``a small entity that is      adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action is      entitled to judicial review. . . .'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 611(a)(1).      Section 601(6) of the RFA states, in relevant part, that the      term ``small entity'' shall have the same meaning as the term      ``small organization.'' Section 601(4) states, in relevant      part, that the term ``small organization'' means ``any not-     for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and      operated and is not dominant in its field. . . .'' Here, the      BLM does not contest the NWMA's assertion that it is an      independently owned and operated, not-for-profit enterprise      which is not dominant in its field. (Pl. Mem. at 34-37.)      Therefore, the NWMA is a ``small entity'' as defined by      the RFA and has standing to object.\3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \3\ It is probable that the NWMA would also have standing to      object under the RFA based on associational standing,      discussed supra.---------------------------------------------------------------------------                  B. Plaintiff's Claims Under the APA       The standard for judicial review of the BLM's actions here      is set forth in Section 706 of the APA. The court shall      ``hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and      conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse      of discretion, of otherwise not in accordance with the law.''      5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A). The Court must show ``great      deference'' to the agency's interpretation of its own powers      and responsibilities. EPA v. National Crushed Stone Ass'n,      449 U.S. 64, 83 (1980) (citation omitted).       The gist of the NWMA's numerous counts under the APA is      that the final rule enacted by the BLM is significantly      different from that originally proposed. The NWMA alleges      that the differences are great enough to constitute abuses of      the notice and comment requirement, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(b), and      the basis and purpose requirement, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(c) of      the APA. The final rule, however, ``need not match the rule      proposed [and] indeed must not if the record demands a      change.'' Kooritzky v. Reich, 17 F. 3d 1509, 1513 (D.C. Cir.      1994) (citations omitted). To do otherwise ``would lead to      the absurdity that . . . the agency can learn from the      comments on its proposals only at the peril of starting a new      round of commentary.'' International Harvester Co. v.      Ruckelshaus, 478 F. 2d 615, 632 n. 51 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The      test is whether the agency gave notice to interested parties      that a different rule might be enacted. Kooritzky, 17 F. 3d      at 1513. Adequate notice is given if the final rule is a      ``logical outgrowth'' of the proposed rule. Fertilizer Inst.      v. EPA, 935 F. 2d 1303, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Therefore, the      pertinent question to be asked in this case is whether the      BLM's final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule.       The determination of what rule is a logical outgrowth of      another can be a difficult task and require detailed      examination of the administrative record. For instance, the      NWMA alleges that the minimum bond amounts required by the      final rule cannot be a logical outgrowth of the maximum      amounts contemplated by the proposed rule. At first blush,      this might seem to be one of the NWMA's strongest arguments.      An examination of the administrative record reveals that the      rule proposal does, indeed, state that bond amounts for plan      level operations ``would be capped at $1,000 per acre for      exploration activities and $2,000 for mining activities.'' 56      Fed. Reg. 31,603. The proposal goes on, however, to state      that ``[c]omments are specifically requested on the adequacy      of these definitions.''Id.       The request for commentary on the definitions reasonably      could be construed to include commentary on the adequacy of      the dollar amount, which, in turn, reasonably could be found      to constitute adequate notice that the rule might be changed.      It is uncertain whether additional examination of comments      received would be indicative of the adequacy of the notice.      It is also uncertain whether testimony at trial might prove      dispositive of the issue. In other words, the claim is not      readily applies to the summary judgment standard, i.e., that      no reasonable factfinder could find for the BLM in this      matter.       The Court does not need to conduct such as exhaustive      examination of the administrative record to reach the merits      of the NWMA's claims under the APA because of the disposition      of their claim under the RFA.       C. Plaintiff's Claim Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act       The NWMA's claim under the RFA is that the BLM did not      follow the legal procedure required by the RFA when it issued      the final rule.       The RFA requires administrative agencies to consider the      effect of their actions on small entities, including small      businesses, small non-profit enterprises, and small local      governments. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 601, et. seq.;      Southwestern Pa. Growth Alliance v. Browner, 121 F.3d 106,      118 (3d Cir. 1997). See also S. Rep. No. 96-878, at 1-6      (1980). When an agency issues a rulemaking proposal, the RFA      requires the agency to ``prepare and make available for      public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis''      which will ``describe the impact of the proposed rule on      small entities.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 604(a).       Rather than prepare initial and final regulatory      flexibility analyses, the BLM chose to use the exception      allowed by Section 605 of the RFA. Section 605 provides:       Sections 603 and 604 of this title shall not apply to any      proposed or final rule if the head of the agency certifies      that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant      economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If      the head of the agency makes a certification under the      preceding sentence, the agency shall publish such      certification in the Federal Register at the time of      publication of general notice of proposed rulemaking for the      rule or at the time of publication of the final rule, along      with a statement providing the factual basis for such      certification. The Agency shall provide such certification      and statement to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small      Business Administration.--5 U.S.C. Sec. 605(b).       In a section of the final rule publication entitled      ``Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' the BLM      stated that the final rule ``will not have a significant      econimic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''      62 Fed. Reg. 9099. The BLM stated that, for the purposes of      this certification under the RFA, the term ``small entity''      is defined as ``an individual, small firm, or partnership at      arm's length from the control of any parent companies.''. Id.      The BLM set forth a short factual basis for the      certification. Id.       The nature of NWMA's challenge is that the BLM did not use      the correct definition of ``small entity'' (specifically, a      small miner) when it made the ``no significant impact''      certification.       The RFA requires agencies to use the Small Business      Administration's definition of small entity. Section 601 of      the RFA sets forth, in relevant part, ``[f]or the purposes of      this chapter . . . the term `small entity' shall have the      same meaning as the term `small business' . . . . '' 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 601(6). The term ``small business'' has the same meaning      as the term ``small business concern'' under section 3 of the      Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 632 (1994). 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 601(3).       An examination of the Small Business Act reveals that the      SBA may ``specify detailed definitions or standards by which      a business concern may be determined to be a small business      concern for the purposes of [the Act] or any other Act.'' 15      U.S.C.     Sec. 632(a)(2)(A). The SBA publishes these small business      definitions in 13 C.F.R. Sec. 121.201. Division B of section      121.201 provides, in pertinent part, that mining concerns      must have 500 or fewer employees to be considered ``small.''      Id. Therefore, the standard for ``small miner'' which the BLM      must use when performing an Initial or Final Regulatory      Flexibility Analysis or when certifying ``no significant      impact'' is a 500 or fewer employee standard. By using a      definition other than the SBA's, the BLM violated the      procedures of law mandated by the statute.       The BLM, for its part, argues that it used a subsequent      Congressional definition of ``small miner'' used in recent      legislation.\4\ This argument is unconvincing in light of the      clearly mandated procedure of the RFA. The definitions      section of the RFA uses phrases such as ```small entity''      shall have the same meaning . . . '' and ```small business''      has the same meaning . . . ''. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 601 (emphasis      added). Words such as these doe not leave room for alternate      interpretations by the agency. The ultimate expression of      legislative intent is, of course, and unambiguously worded      statute.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \4\Specifically, the Department of the Interior and Related      Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1993, 106 Stat.      1374, 1378-79 (1992). (Def. mem. at 15-26; Def. Reply at 14-     15).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Insofar as the BLM's certification (i.e., that the final      rule would have no significant impact on a substantial number      of small entities) was without observance of procedure      required by law, the NWMA, as complaining party, is entitled      to relief, and this Court, therefore, grants NWMA's motion      for summary judgment on these grounds.                 D. Relief to be Granted Under the RFA       Section 611 of the RFA, entitled Judicial Review, provides,      in pertinent part:       In granting any relief in an action under this section, the      court shall order the agency to take corrective action      consistent with this chapter . . . including, but not limited      to, remanding the rule to the agency, and deferring the      enforcement of the rule against small entities unless the      court finds that continued enforcement of the rule is in the      public interest.     5 U.S.C. Sec. 611(4)(A)-(B). Consequently, the issue is what      the public interest is here.       The BLM, arguing for continued enforcement, warns of      potential publicly funded restoration efforts and cites a      ten-year old report showing an estimated restoration cost of      $284 million for a parcel of federal land that had been left      unreclaimed. See generally GAO/RCED-88-123BR (April 1998).       The Court, however, is unconvinced by such anecdotal      evidence. In fact, the Court does not find that much would      change should enforcement be discontinued. Large, open-pit      mines are already subject to discretionary bond requirements      by the BLM as plan level operations. 43 C.F.R. Sec. 3909.1-     9(b). Moreover, the BLM admits that it already has in      place a policy which requires 100 percent bonding for all      mining operations which use cyanide or other dangerous      leachates (Def. Mem. at 6,8; Def. Reply at 8.) In other      words, to protect the environment against the most      potentially dangerous mining operations, the BLM need only      exercise its existing powers between a remand and its next      final rule promulgation.       Moreover, the new rule's requirements concerning the amount      of regulation on the smaller notice level mining operations,      the dollar amounts the BLM can require for all bonds, and the      additional procedural expenses incurred by miners when      obtaining the bonds, appear to have a large impact on the      small miner. Effects on small businesses and industry-wide      changes in regulatory expenses, however, are precisely what      the procedural safeguards of the RFA and the APA are set in      place to address. A claim that the public interest requires      an exception to the RFA and APA because of the very interests      they protect requires a better showing of threatened societal      harm than the BLM has produced here.       Finally, the BLM states that, upon remand, any new rule      promulgation will be delayed because Congress has prohibited      the BLM from publishing new hardrock mining rule proposals      until November 15, 1998.\5\ See Department of the Interior      and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998,      Pub. L. No. 105-83 Sec. 339 (1997). While true, the BLM      itself delayed enacting a new rule for roughly nine years      after the issuance of the GAO report and five and one-half      years after its own rule proposal. The BLM has not explained      this delay in light of its alleged urgency. The absence of      alacrity by the BLM in this matter convinces the Court that      another brief delay will not be contrary to the public      interest.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \5\ The BLM did not address this argument in its briefs, nor      did it file a post-hearing brief. It mentioned this argument      briefly during oral argument only.---------------------------------------------------------------------------                            III. Conclusion       While recognizing the public interest in preserving the      environment, the Court also recognizes the public interest in      preserving the rights of parties which are affected by      government regulation to be adequately informed when their      interests are at stake and to participate in the regulatory      process as directed by Congress. For this reason and for the      reasons stated in this memorandum, the Court remands the      final rule to the BLM for procedures consistent with this      opinion. Accordingly, the Plaintiff's motion for summary      judgment is denied. An appropriate Order accompanies this      Memorandum.                                                    June L. Green,                               United States District Court Judge.     Date: May 13, 1998.
