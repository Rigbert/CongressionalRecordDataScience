Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. Visclosky's amendment. As a cosponsor of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, I was very pleased with the passage of this legislation last year. However, I was extremely troubled with the President's waiver of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act on May 16. I joined many of my colleagues in expressing our disappointment with his decision to waive the statutory restrictions on assistance to the Republic of Turkey, and I am urging my colleagues to support this amendment to strengthen the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act.  The Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act prohibits U.S. assistance to any country that prohibits or restricts the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to other countries. We should not allow humanitarian assistance to be used as a political weapon while innocent victims are deprived of food, fuel, and medical supplies, whether it be in the wake of a natural disaster or armed aggression.  Unfortunately, countries are still hampering the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to those in need. Turkey continues its illegal blockade of American humanitarian relief to needy population in Armenia and it continues to deny the existence of the Armenian Genocide of 1915.  This amendment would limit the scope of the executive waiver under the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. This amendment would limit the President's waiver authority to only U.S. military aid--economic assistance would be withheld from any country that impedes the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to other countries.  This amendment continues to protect U.S. national security interests, but it will send a strong message to nations that blocking humanitarian assistance to those in need is unacceptable. I commend the members of the committee who have worked on behalf of this legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to support this important amendment.                              {time}  1700
