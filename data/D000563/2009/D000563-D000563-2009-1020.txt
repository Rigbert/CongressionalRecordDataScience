President, today I am introducing a bill, together with my Republican colleague Senator Orrin Hatch, that will help the financial security of Federal judges and their families. It will do so without costing the Federal Government a penny.  Our bill, the Judicial Survivors Protection Act of 2009, will create an open season for active and senior federal judges to enroll in the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System, JSAS, if they are not currently enrolled. JSAS provides an annuity for the surviving spouses and dependent children of a deceased federal judge. Depending on the judge's length of service, the annuity for a surviving spouse can be as high as 50 percent of the judge's average annual salary, and the annuity for surviving dependent children can be as high as 20 percent.  In addition, our bill would provide an important health insurance benefit for the surviving family members of decease Federal judges. For a surviving spouse or dependent child to continue to receive health insurance coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefit, FEHB, program after the judge's death, the judge must have been enrolled in JSAS. Otherwise, they can no longer participate in FEHB.  Federal judges have only 6 months from the date of their appointment to sign up for JSAS and, for a variety of reasons, many do not do so. For example, many individuals take substantial pay cuts when they leave a law firm to become a Federal judge, and they are unable to afford JSAS contributions, which amount to a 2.2 percent of a judge's annual salary. Nearly 900 federal judges, representing about 40 percent of the federal judiciary, currently do not participate in JSAS. However, if given the opportunity, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts estimates between 200 and 300 judges would sign up.  Take, for example, the case of Judge Michael Mihm, who is a federal judge in the Central District of Illinois, my home State. Judge Mihm wrote a letter and said:       In 1982, when I came on the bench, the survivor's pension      (JSAS) was so bad that almost no incoming judge signed up for      it. Plus, the percentage of salary involved was very high. So      I didn't sign up for it then. In the early 90s I was a member      of the Judicial Branch Committee, and at that time the      Committee and the judiciary succeeded in getting a bill      passed that improved the benefits (established a 25% floor)      and the percentage of salary paid. There was an open season.      That would have been the time to join. However, at that time      I had four children attending private universities . . . I      simply couldn't afford to bring home a smaller paycheck. I      have for some time now been very interested in `buying in' to      the survivor's pension, that is, pay in everything I would      have paid in if I had joined during the open season, plus a      penalty amount for waiting until now to join.  I also received a letter from U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman in the Northern District of Illinois, who said: ``Especially given the circumstances of our current economic crisis, providing for my family in the event of a death is of urgent importance to me. I think I speak for many of those in my circumstance that I am happy to make a make-up payment and contribute a greater share of my income to participate in this program.''  The bill that Senator Hatch and I are introducing would allow Judge Mihm, Judge Gettleman, and the hundreds of other nonparticipating federal judges around the country to pay a penalty and buy into the JSAS program. Such judges would be required to pay an enhanced contribution rate of 2.75 percent of their salary each year rather than the 2.2 percent rate they would pay if they had enrolled within 6 months of taking office.  As a result, the cost of our bill would be borne by these new enrollees and not by the Federal Government or by previously enrolled judges. The Congressional Budget Office has conducted an informal review of this bill and determined that the cost of this bill is insignificant. Therefore, the bill would require no Federal funds and have noPAYGO implications. The higher ongoing contribution rates for new enrollees will offset the value of any potential future liabilities that would be incurred by the JSAS fund, which currently has assets of over $500 million.  One of the highest priorities of the federal judiciary in recent years has been the pursuit of a pay raise. Federal judges have not received a pay raise from Congress since 1991, other than occasional cost-of living adjustments, and there is a concern that some of this Nation's best and brightest attorneys no longer seek Federal judgeships because of the financial sacrifice they and their families would have to make. The bill that Senator Hatch and I are introducing today would not raise the judicial pay of our federal judges, but it would at least provide a modest benefit that might make judicial service more tenable and more attractive. I hope Congress will take up and pass the Judicial Survivors Protection Act of 2009 as soon as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1107       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
