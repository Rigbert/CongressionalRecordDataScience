Speaker, I rise today to honor Delegate Joanne C. Benson--a woman of integrity, principle, love and passion for helping others. As a Member of the Maryland State House of Delegates since 1991 and an educator in the Prince George's County School System for forty years, Joanne Benson has touched the lives of thousands in her service to people. On this very special occasion of celebrating her retirement we must all give great thanks for the difference she has made in carrying out her life's work.  Having known this extraordinary woman for all my years of public service, I have seen first hand her compassion and unfailing love for children, family and community. Her motto, ``If not now, when? If not us, who?'' exemplifies her tireless efforts in being a voice for the voiceless, a power for the powerless and a fighter for those who have given up the fight.  Born in Roanoke, Virginia, the daughter of Reverend and Mrs. William Claybon, she is one of six children. After graduating from South Hagerstown High School, she received her Bachelor of Science Degree from Bowie State University and later achieved a Master of Arts Degree from Catholic University. Her career in education began as a teacher in Calvert County and soon thereafter she began to work for the Prince George's County School System, where over the years she has served in a number of capacities including teacher/facilitator, master teacher, instructional support specialist, human relations specialist, Principal and parent involvement specialist. And throughout this long tenure there is one thing she has always been--one of the strongest and most ardent activists for improving the quality of life and the quality of education for our children.  Joanne is a caring individual. Story after story can be told of her purchasing shoes and coats for children in need; bringing food to a hungry family; accessing free health and dental care for children; and finding shelter for the homeless. It was her work while she was Principal of John H. Bayne Elementary School that started the first after-school program in which teachers, parents and community leaders volunteered to work. She began a clothes closet and food pantry and started adult education classes for parents. And she was an early advocate of school uniforms, recognizing that if a child looks good, they feel good.  From an early age, Joanne learned that the rewards we receive are from the work we do. She has carried her concern and compassion for children to her work at the Maryland General Assembly where she is one of the most vocal and respected legislators and where she has been able to implement policies to better life for youngsters. She was an original sponsor of the Primary Seat Belt Law which serves as a national model for children's car seats and seat belt laws. She has gained the reputation as always being there for her constituents, whether it is help to get more funding for public education or safer streets in their community, and always takes positive action.  One of her proudest achievements has been the establishment of the not-for-profit organization known as SAFE STREETS 2000. This program, designed to educate and strengthen our communities and organizations, has helped many become more knowledgeable of available resources in the prevention, intervention and rehabilitation of senseless violence. For this work, Delegate Benson was profiled on the front page of the Washington Post and the Prince George's Journal and was featured on Nightline with Ted Koppel and Night Watch with Charles Rose.  Her endless commitment to children has earned her many other awards: For the Love of Children Award from the Kiwanis Club of the Capitol Area; Outstanding Educator from Prince George's County Schools, Who's Who Among Notable Educators in Maryland, Woman of the Year from Metropolitan Business and Professional Women, Humanitarian Award from Zeta Phi Beta and Outstanding Community Service Award from Las Amigas.  There are so many accomplishments and so many awards, but anyone who knows Joanne knows the things which make her the happiest and the proudest are the small unnoticed acts of kindness. Joanne, you are blessed with an irresistible spirit which is transmitted to all you touch. And we are all so grateful for all you have done. We thank you for your friendship, your leadership and your commitment to improving the lives of children and all the citizens of Prince George's County and the State of Maryland. We salute your 40 years of outstanding and dedicated service to the Prince George's County School System.                          ____________________
