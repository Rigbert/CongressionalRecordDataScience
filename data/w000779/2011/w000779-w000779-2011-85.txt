President, today I wish to recognize someone whose name became synonymous with courage and equality, someone who in my State is every bit a pioneer as those who blazed the trails that opened the West.  Betty Roberts passed away recently at age 88, and while Oregon has lost one of its true giants, we have not lost the memory of what she gave to our State. Every time you turned around, Betty Roberts was pioneering. In the 1970s, she was the only woman serving in the Oregon State Senate. By 1977, she was the first woman to serve on the Oregon Court of Appeals and 5 years later she was the first woman on the Oregon Supreme Court.  I first met Betty in 1975 when she was one of the first elected officials in Oregon to give her full support to what was then a little known and burgeoning organization fighting for the rights of the elderly, the Gray Panthers. Over the nearly four decades of our friendship, I came to know and respect her as a tireless advocate for doing what was right based on facts and the truth.  Her road to prominence in Oregon's legal, legislative and political circles was not an easy one. As the Oregonian pointed out in its editorial, ``Betty Roberts often heard the word `no' during the first half of her life. No to finishing college, teaching or running for public office, and no to following her ambitions.''  Anyone who knew Betty recognized that she did not take no for an answer. She went from being a teacher to earning a master's degree and a doctorate, all while raising a family. She went from being elected to a local school board to being elected to the Oregon House of Representatives and from there to the Oregon State Senate.  As a member of the legislature, she supported such pioneering Oregon laws as the bottle bill and land-use planning. What she will be most remembered for, however, is her unwavering commitment to equality for women and minorities. She knew firsthand the barriers women faced. She overcame them and dedicated her life to tearing down those barriers and giving other women the same opportunities she made for herself.  In her memoir titled ``With Grit and by Grace,'' Betty wrote that she had ``a reasonable desire to live the life I wanted.''  We know now that Betty lived the life that she desired and my State and this Nation is better for it.                          ____________________
