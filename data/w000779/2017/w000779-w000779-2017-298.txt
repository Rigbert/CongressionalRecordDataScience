 We have heard Republicans say repeatedly that anything they are going to do with Medicare is not going to hurt today's enrollees or people nearing retirement. The fact is, TrumpCare hurts both. It is going to shorten the life expectancy of the Medicare trust fund, and those older people--I will be curious, when my colleague returns--I will be very interested to hear what seniors in New Hampshire who are 56 to 68 and are walking on that economic tightrope are going to say.  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for the excellent presentation.
