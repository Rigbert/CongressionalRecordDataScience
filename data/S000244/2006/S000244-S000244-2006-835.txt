Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4659, to extend until March 10 crucial provisions of the PATRIOT Act set to expire this Friday.  On December 23 of last year, both Houses unanimously passed a short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act to preserve critical antiterrorism initiatives that were set to expire at the end of last year. Unfortunately, we mustpass another extension today because a minority of Members of the other body have blocked an up-or-down vote on the conference report for H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005 which the full House passed by a broad bipartisan vote of 257-171 on December 14.  The opponents in the other body have repeatedly cited their concern for civil liberties as a justification for their obstruction. Ironically, the conference report that has been blocked contains dozens of vital civil liberty protections, many included at their request.                              {time}  1600  The original PATRIOT Act contains none of these protections. As a result, we are once again forced to extend the current PATRIOT Act rather than to implement the current important civil liberties protections contained in the conference report that even its detractors acknowledge is an improvement over current law.  When the PATRIOT Act was first passed in October of 2001, I pledged to rigorously examine its implementation to ensure that new law enforcement authorities did not violate civil liberties. Since April of 2005 alone, the House Judiciary Committee received testimony from 35 witnesses during 12 hearings on the PATRIOT Act. In addition to hearings, I have requested, along with Ranking Member Conyers, written responses from the Attorney General to detailed questions regarding use of the PATRIOT Act and whether any of its provisions have been used to violate individuals' civil liberties.  A chronology of these legislative and oversight activities follows:Oversight of the USA PATRIOT Act From October, 2001, to November, 2005:       1.
