President, for the interest of my colleagues, I do not anticipate--I do not intend to ask for the yeas and nays on any of these. I have discussed this with the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and I believe I am authorized to speak for him that he is not going to be requesting the yeas and nays.
