Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Pam Haze, an individual whose dedication and contribution to public service is exceptional. Her extensive experience and knowledge have been a great benefit to the Department of the Interior, Congress, and the American people. Pam will soon be retiring from the Department of the Interior after 34 years of federal service.  Pam has tirelessly dedicated herself to public service, committing her career to a wide range of positions. Currently, Pam is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Budget, Finance, Performance and Acquisition at the Department of the Interior, a position she was appointed to in October of 2009. It is in this current position that Pam has been responsible for the oversight and management of the Department's programs and policies in budget; finance; acquisition and property management; performance management; and small and disadvantaged business.  Pam has been an invaluable resource to me and my staff on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Whether she is testifying before our committee, or responding to a myriad of questions on behalf of the Department, Pam has been a key liaison between the Appropriations Committee and the Department. Pam is that rare individual who focuses on solving problems when faced with even the most challenging circumstances. She has earned the admiration and respect of Republicans and Democrats alike for her knowledge of the issues and ability to arrive at solutions considered fair and reasonable by all sides.  Pursuing her interests in the environment, Pam received both an undergraduate degree in wildlife biology and a graduate degree in environmental science and ecology from George Mason University. Pam took her passion with her to the Department of Interior, where she has spent the majority of her federal career within Interior bureaus, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management and the former Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. It was in these Interior agencies that Pam was able to effectively lead as a planner, hydrologist, field biologist, contaminant biologist, program analyst, administrator, budget analyst and manager.  Prior to her current service as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Budget, Finance, Performance and Acquisition, Pam spent time as the Deputy Director and Co-Director of the Office of the Budget from 1999 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2009 as the director of the Department's Office of Budget. Pam also has a great depth of experience with other federal agencies, such as the Small Business Administration and the Office of the Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System in which she played a critical role in successfully facilitating the completion of the Alaska natural gas pipeline. In addition, Pam has also previously devoted her time and knowledge to Cambridge Scientific Abstracts.  For her many years of public service, Pam deserves our thanks and praise. Her tirelesspassion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our nation. Through her broad range of roles in our government, she has spent her working life in the service of others, and this merits my most sincere gratitude. I ask that the House join me in wishing Pam the best as she begins the next chapter of her life.                          ____________________
