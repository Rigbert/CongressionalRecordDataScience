These are some of the people who got very, very wealthy.  Whether it was Mr. Mozilo of Countrywide or, of course, Michael Perry from IndyMac, which went broke, or Richard Carrion from Popular, these men were making millions and millions of dollars. This doesn't even include the big bond houses on Wall Street. Bear Stearns was the first one to go belly up.  Now we're asking our government to prop up the risky investment practices of Wall Street and to reward the very bondsmen who have placed the American people in the position of servant hood. They make out in terms of selling their bonds and by indebting the people of the United States. They get their fees.  What is amazing to me is that, if you look at the list of the bonding houses that got us in this fix--if you look at Countrywide--would you believe, even though our government knew what it was doing, it kept them on the list of primary securities dealers at the U.S. Treasury Department? HSBC, one of the primary violators, is on the list of primary dealers of the Federal Reserve.  You start looking down that list and start saying to yourself, hey, wait a minute. What is this, a circle? They all just circle the wagons. They are the same people who cause the trouble. Then they come to the American taxpayer to bail them out.  Congressman Kucinich talked about the Roosevelt administration and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was not just about bailing out Wall Street. What was interesting about what President Roosevelt did was that he created a special jobs program. If you look at what that Reconstruction Finance Corporation really did, people around America got work. There was a homeowners' loan association for cities and then a farm credit administration for homeownership in the countryside.  The Works Progress Administration, the WPA, built infrastructure acrossthis country--zoos and libraries and highways. Yes, they did prop up Wall Street, but they created new types of savings institutions, not to create debt but to create equity, to say to the American family, ``Look, you can own a home. Here is a passbook.'' These are savings and loan institutions. You would get a passbook. You could put money in there. You would actually get an interest rate worth something--4 or 5 percent a year. People learned a savings habit.                              {time}  2015  Tell me the last time you got a letter from a financial institution in this country asking you to save. All you get are credit cards. ``Get this loan, zero percent down.'' I keep a stack. I've got it in my office. It's about this high. If I signed up for all of those credit cards, I couldn't even manage to keep in touch with all of them. The debt posture that these institutions have pushed have helped push America to the precipice. And every American who's listening knows what I'm talking about.  It is not an accident that we are in this situation. The entire financial system was turned inside-out during the 1990s. We got rid of something called the Glassed Eagle Act which had been in existence from the time of Roosevelt that said you can't mix banking with commerce. You can't mix banking and commerce with real estate. They have to be separate because there are too many bad things that can happen because you know what? Some people are very greedy. They are very, very greedy. And some people don't have information to make informed financial decisions.  So we are now inheriting a situation here which is very, very serious. And today in the Financial Times--and I will place this in the Record this evening as well, and then my colleague would like to assume her role here; when she is comfortable, we will move to that--but the Financial Times had an article called ``Goodbye capitalism'' by Joshua Rosner. And what he said is, ``We have nationalized the losses from Bear Stearns,'' which is an investment bank, not a regular savings bank, ``through a transfer of risk onto the Federal Government's balance sheet and have now nationalized the losses generated by Fannie's and Freddie's poor management and functionally taken $5 million in obligations on to the government's balance sheet.''  That means not just us, our children and grandchildren are going to pay for generations. And that makes the bond houses on Wall Street so happy because they make money while the American people suffer.  The article says, ``we will see the continued nationalization of bad assets, placing the burden on the shoulders of the already overburdened American taxpayer.  ``We have done this without forcing the disgorgement of undeserved gains by the management and without replacing managements who are now controlling government-owned businesses. Instead of protecting those who made bad bets, we should use our rule of law to address the situation.'' We need a special investigatory panel with subpoena authority to look at every single person back through the 1990s who helped place America and her families in this situation.  The article says, ``Rather than making the taxpayer liable for debts and debts of the government-sponsored enterprises, it would be more sensible to effect a smooth, prepackaged reorganization plan.'' But you know what? That's not in the bill that is likely to be considered here soon. They just want the money, but they don't want to reorganize the system in order to prevent further damage in the future.  We're being pushed by the Bush administration: Do this now because the markets are really nervous, but we won't get the reform that we need in order to avoid these crises in the future. We're merely going to reward bad behavior and put the American people at risk.  ``As part of a prepackaged reorganization,'' the article goes on to say, ``the government could explicitly assure investors they will receive all of their guaranteed interest payments. Instead of giving ineffective management a line of credit,'' which is what the bill proposes to do, ``Treasury could provide the GSE's regulator with a line of credit used to assure timely payments for these obligations. This is the tool that Treasury provides the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with to sort out failed banks.'' That's what Roosevelt used.  ``Over time that line will be repaid by the running-off of the portfolios, active servicing of mortgages and through payment of claims by private mortgage insurers who guaranteed first losses on GSE mortgages.  ``The next step would create $150 billion in new equity capital and enable the GSEs, without governmental support, to achieve more fully their chartered mission. Over the past decade'' Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac ``have increasingly used their portfolios to speculate,'' and this is the first time I have read this, ``in aircraft leasing, manufactured housing, interest-only mortgages, and other securities they are specifically prohibited from buying as part of their financial mission.  ``In recent years, through these portfolios they funded nearly 50 percent of the riskier private label alternate Alt-A mortgage market, invested in aircraft, lease securities, manufactured housing and other assets that leveraged them into trouble. To achieve the speculative, hedge fund-like growth they issued almost $1.500 billion of senior corporate debt. By their investments, debt buyers supported speculation in non-mission-related activities and did so with a clear understanding they with funding non-mission-related activities.  ``They also knew GSE debt was explicitly not an obligation of the U.S. taxpayer and that was repeated constantly by the government and the companies.  ``In exchange for their current debt, these holders should receive 90 cents on the dollar of new, long-dated senior debt in the companies and 10 cents of new subordinated debt.''  ``This approach would send a very strong signal, from the government, that investors fully consider the risks of bad asset allocation.'' And ``though it would cause pain for equity and subordinated debt investors, those investors received the majority of returns over the past several years and, in our great system, they are supposed to be subordinated.''  I want to put this article in the Record. I think it is very, very well written.  And I go back to my initial question for this evening. I wonder if the American taxpayer knows they are now the insurance company for Wall Street and Wall Street's high-risk investors. We have to figure out a way, as we work our way out of this serious situation, for some of the dollars that are being directed to Wall Street, rewarding them, in a sense, for their behavior, go the other way back to community and that mayors and that local housing authorities be provided with the kind of wherewithal it's going to take to rescue our local housing markets and to create the kind of mortgage activity at the local level that will help lift our real estate industry, that will help prevent further foreclosures of our families and that will help people, face-to-face at the local level again, assure that that housing market is more secure than we have had with this very indirect, anonymous kind of relationship that has resulted from this mortgage-backed security industry that we moved into in the 1990s.  I would like to ask the extraordinarily qualified and engaged chairwoman of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee of Financial Institutions who's worked so hard on this issue, Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California, to assume her time this evening and perhaps to give us further insight on what the committee is about and what we, as a Congress and the American people, might do to help us help ourselves as a country right the ship of our economic state.  Congresswoman Waters, thank you so much for joining us this evening. Thank you for your extraordinary efforts as a Chairwoman and for bringing your committee to Ohio to witness what we are dealing with there is emblematic of what is happening across this country. Thank you for joining.               [From the Financial Times, July 15, 2008]                           Goodbye Capitalism                           (By Joshua Rosner)       In a capitalist economy, losers are expected to take losses      and winners to gain. Private enterprise is best able to      allocate     capital efficiently and, where it fails to do so, markets      make adjustments and capital is reallocated to efficient      users. This basic tenet supports good and productive assets      moving from the hands of weak players to stronger. Where this      is not possible, the U.S. system gives the government a hand      in fostering that move through an efficient process called      bankruptcy or reorganisation. This rule of markets and of law      has always been the basis of our national supremacy in      innovation and the reason ours was the world's clear choice      of a reserve currency. That was the world we lived in      previously.       Our elected officials have repeatedly demonstrated that      even equity holders, who are supposed to have the most      subordinated claims on assets, cannot be allowed to take      losses and instead believe we should all communally share in      losses that result from poor allocation and risk management      decisions. We have nationalised the losses from Bear Stearns      through a transfer of risk on to the federal government's      balance sheet and have now nationalised the losses generated      by Fannie's and Freddie's poor management and functionally      taken $5 trillion in obligations on to the government's      balance sheet. This has been done even though every equity or      debt offering of Fannie and Freddie explicitly states that      these ``are not guaranteed by the U.S. and do not constitute      an obligation of the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality      thereof other than'' of Fannie or Freddie.       By the time we are finished with this tragic period in U.S.      economic history, the government is likely to have to choose      whether to do the same for at least one more large bank,      investment bank, bond insurer, mortgage insurer, multiple      large regional bank, airline or car manufacturer. Given the      choices we have seen from officials, who obviously have      little faith in the ability of capital markets or our system      of law, we will see the continued nationalisation of bad      assets, placing the burden on the shoulders of the already      overburdened American taxpayer.       This commitment by misguided officials to print more money,      to stoke the embers of inflation and to debase further our      already hobbled currency invites foreign investors to pick      through our assets and buy our remaining strong businesses      (Anheuser Busch) on the cheap. As the strength of our      remaining industries is further weakened, along with      taxpayers' buying power, it will become increasingly      necessary, as a matter of survival, for American workers to      demand increases in their wages.       While some might applaud the government's policy action, it      will prevent the rational and orderly repricing of over      inflated assets, ensure they remain overvalued, uneconomic      and unaffordable to a populous that will see an increasing      percentage of their wages allocated for the support of our      national debt. We have done this without forcing the      disgorgement of undeserved gains by managements and without      replacing managements who are now controlling government      ``owned'' businesses.       The same economists who have repeatedly argued efficient      market theory have chosen this path. Instead of protecting      those who made bad bets, we should use our rule of law to      address the situation. That would mean we allow weak players      either to fail or to reorganise through an orderly transfer      of good assets from weak hands to strong hands. This would      protect the once-mighty U.S. dollar and affect the necessary      and repricing of assets to sustainable equilibrium. Doing so      would also decrease moral hazard and send a strong message of      faith in our great system as the model for global financial      advancement.       There is another option in relation to Freddie Mac and      Fannie Mae. Rather than making the taxpayer liable for debts      the debts of the government-sponsored enterprises, it would      be more sensible to effect a smooth, prepackaged      reorganisation plan. This could be done quite simply and      would strengthen the GSEs' ability to meet their      congressionally mandated purpose of supporting liquidity in      the secondary mortgage market.       The core of the GSEs' mission is to purchase mortgages from      mortgage originators, charge a guarantee fee to issuers to      protect their ability to stand behind these loans, and      securitise these mortgage-backed securities with assurances      to MBS holders they would receive 100 per cent of their      anticipated returns. To this end the GSEs have guaranteed      $3.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. These securities      are backed by real housing assets and there is little      question that, assuming they are well serviced, there will be      relatively little loss over a longer period.       As part of a prepackaged reorganisation the government      could explicitly assure MBS investors they will receive all      of their guaranteed interest payments. Instead of giving      ineffective management a line of credit, Treasury could      provide the GSEs, regulator with a line of credit used to      assure timely payments on these obligations. This is the tool      that Treasury provides the Federal Deposit Insurance      Corporation with to sort out failed banks. Over time that      line will be repaid by the running-off of the portfolios,      active servicing of mortgages and through payment of claims      by private mortgage insurers who guaranteed first losses on      GSE mortgages. Because these debts are core to the GSEs'      social mission and real assets back these debts, this would      be an appropriate resolution.       The next step would create approximately $150bn in new      equity capital and enable to GSEs, without governmental      support, to achieve more fully their chartered mission.       Over the past decade the GSEs have increasingly used their      portfolios to speculate in aircraft leasing, manufactured      housing, interest-only mortgages and other securities they      are specifically prohibited from buying as part of their      mission. In recent years, through these portfolios they      funded nearly 50 per cent of the riskier private label Alt-A      mortgage market, invested in aircraft lease securities,      manufactured housing and other assets that leveraged them      into trouble. To achieve this speculative, hedge fund-like      growth they issued almost $1,500bn of senior corporate debt.      By their investments, debt buyers supported speculation in      non-mission-related activities and did so with a clear      understanding they were funding non-mission-related      activities. They also knew GSE debt was explicitly not an      obligation of the U.S. taxpayer and that was repeated      constantly by the government and the companies.       In exchange for their current debt, these holders should      receive 90 cents on the dollar of new, long-dated, senior      debt in the companies and 10 cents of new subordinated debt.      The companies would then have enough capital to support their      core, chartered mission and could increase the social returns      and financial returns of investors in their core mission.      This approach would send a very strong signal, from the      government, that investors fully consider the risks of bad      asset allocation. It would almost certainly strengthen the      dollar. Though it would cause pain for equity and      subordinated debt investors, those investors received the      majority of returns over the past several years and, in our      great system, they are supposed to be subordinated.
