 Unfortunately, she is correct. Any Medicare-approved health care agency must comply with all Medicare conditions of participation. That is MCP--probably another acronym, and I will not venture to say what that sounds like--including the collection of OASIS. This means patients who do not participate in Medicare are still subject to Medicare assessment.  In June, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies don't have to--here again, this is what we have a lot of trouble with--transmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time being, but they still must spend the time taking these assessments.
