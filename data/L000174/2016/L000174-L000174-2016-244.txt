President, I would like to recognize Leslie Proll, the director of policy for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., for her years of excellent public service as she begins a new chapter in her career. Since 1998, Leslie has served as policy director at LDF, where she has advocated for the organization's policy and legislative priorities. She has brought her expertise to bear on advancing important Federal civil rights legislation and advocating for well-qualified, diverse nominees to serve in our Federal judiciary and the executive branch.  My staff has worked closely with her over the years, and she has been steadfast and unwavering in her commitment to civil rights. Leslie provided invaluable support when Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006 and passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009. Her contributions to these two critical legislative initiatives, along with the civil rights community, proved instrumental in moving these two bills through Congress.  Leslie has been an effective and tireless advocate in promoting diversity in our Federal judiciary so that our courts are more representative of the citizenry they serve. Our justice system has been made a better one because of her contributions. I commend Leslie for her years of service and wish her the best as she moves forward in her career.                          ____________________
