President, I have some photographs here that have become all too familiar to the Senate. This is a photograph of a young boy, a victim of a landmine. You can see from the photograph, he has one badly injured leg, another leg that has been torn off, and an arm that is also missing. These are similar to photographs I have on my Web page in my office on the Internet. Thousands of people turn to that Web page, and what they see there are these photographs of landmine victims.  Here is one that they turn to, this young woman. I have had somebody tell me that as the picture comes down on the computer screen, the page ends at the bottom of her long skirt. Then they click on further and the picturecontinues down and they realize she has only one leg. This woman is from Laos. She lost her leg from a landmine.  Mr. President, these photographs are not unusual. Each one represents a tragedy, of course, not only for the person involved, but also but for his or her family. These are only two victims. There are hundreds of thousands of victims of antipersonnel landmines alive today, and of course as many more who died. They are the victims of these tiny, hidden explosives that litter whole countries. They are scattered like seed. They are a blight on our planet, and they must be stopped. This mine I am holding in my hand cost $2 or $3, and is made almost entirely of plastic to make it harder to detect.  These are not weapons that know the difference between a combatant or civilian. They are, as somebody else said, the only weapon where the unsuspecting victim pulls the trigger.  A little over a year ago, President Clinton, in a courageous speech at the United Nations, declared the goal of ridding the world of antipersonnel landmines. With 100 million of these weapons in over 60 countries waiting to explode, they have become the world's most devastating cause of indiscriminate, mass suffering.  Every 22 minutes, the State Department estimates someone somewhere, usually an innocent civilian, is killed or maimed from stepping on a landmine.  NATO forces have suffered 42 landmine casualties since they arrived in Bosnia in December, including 7 deaths. There were three casualties just last Friday, all soldiers of our European allies. Landmines are, by far, the worst threat to our troops there, but also to the people of Bosnia who will be clearing these landmines, an arm and a leg at a time, for decades to come.  The entire 184-member U.N. General Assembly adopted the goal announced by the President. But since President Clinton's announcement, a debate has ensued over how to reach the goal of eliminating antipersonnel mines.  The Pentagon, which says it shares the goal, pushed a strategy to promote the use of so-called smart mines. Mr. President, technology has an answer for many things, but this is not one of them. Antipersonnel landmines are by nature indiscriminate.  There is nothing smart about a landmine that cannot tell the difference between a soldier and a 5-year-old child. These mines are scattered from the air by the tens of thousands, and the same areas can be reseeded many times during a conflict. They legitimize the use of landmines despite their indiscriminate effect.  I am very pleased that Pentagon officials are now questioning the distinction between smart and dumb mines. Again, landmines are by nature indiscriminate. That is what makes them so insidious. I also want to commend our U.N. Ambassador, Madeleine Albright, and her Deputy Karl Inderfurth, who have urged a stronger policy against antipersonnel mines.  A growing coalition, from our soldiers in Bosnia to retired Army generals to officials in the Pentagon to the Pope and the American Red Cross, are urging that we renounce these weapons as we have nerve gas and other indiscriminate killers.  On February 12, my amendment to impose a moratorium on U.S. use of antipersonnel mines was signed into law by President Clinton. That amendment had broad bipartisan support with over two-thirds of the U.S. Senate of both parties voting for it. It represents a clear shift in U.S. policy. But it is already being eclipsed by events elsewhere.  In the past 2 months, Canada and the Netherlands have unilaterally banned their use of antipersonnel mines, and they have joined 22 other countries that have called for an immediate international ban. Many of these countries have been among the largest contributors to U.N. peacekeeping forces, and they have seen the havoc wreaked by landmines. Several, like Belgium and Austria, are destroying their stockpiles of these weapons.  Mr. President, yesterday's New York Times ran a front page story entitled ``Pentagon Weighs Ending Opposition to a Ban on Mines.'' It reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, has ordered a review of the landmine issue. I want to applaud General Shalikashvili for this. There is nothing harder than challenging the conventional wisdom, and when others have said something cannot be done, to ask why not and to look for a way to do it.  I want to reiterate what I have said before. There is a tremendous opportunity here for U.S. leadership. We should listen to our Armed Forces veterans, many of whom say antipersonnel mines made their job more dangerous, not safer, and who remember their buddies being blown up by their own minefields.  Over 7,400 of the Americans killed in Vietnam, 20 percent in the Persian Gulf, and 26 percent in Somalia died from landmines. We have more to gain if the use of landmines is a war crime.  We should think of the devastation these weapons are causing around the world. Regardless of what some here may think, the world does look to the United States for leadership. We are the most powerful democracy ever known in history, by far the most powerful nation on Earth. We can exert great moral and political leadership when we want to lead as a country. The President can lead. There are few people more persuasive when he is convinced of something. I have seen him in meetings with world leaders, and I know how effective he can be. With the support of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the President could bring enormous pressure to bear on world leaders to follow our example.  It is not just the example of the Leahy amendment, but the leadership to press ahead for a ban on antipersonnel landmines worldwide.  Mr. President, this is not a Democrat or Republican issue. It is not a matter of civilians versus the military. It is an opportunity for the United States to end this millennium as the leader of a global effort to ban a weapon that Civil War General Sherman called ``a violation of civilized warfare.''  Mr. President, I commend the Congress for first adopting the moratorium that I proposed, the moratorium on the export of landmines from this country.  I commend the President for supporting my efforts in introducing a resolution in the United Nations to call for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines.  I also commend the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives, liberals, moderates joining together to vote for a moratorium on the use of landmines by the United States. Each one of these steps, Mr. President, has given hope and encouragement to other countries. Each one of these steps has reinforced our leadership.  Years ago when I first started on this quest, it seemed a lonely one. So many times Tim Rieser and I would visit other countries, and here on Capitol Hill and to the United Nations, to speak to world leaders and U.N. ambassadors about landmines. At first, we heard only a few encouraging words. But then the International Red Cross, for the first time since the 1920's when it condemned chemical weapons, called for a ban on antipersonnel mines. Then the Pope, and the leaders of so many other nations, especially those who had sent peacekeepers overseas, humanitarian organizations like the American Red Cross, religious organizations, veterans organizations--they are all speaking out against the use of these weapons.  Mr. President, the only way to stop the use of antipersonnel landmines is to stop the use of antipersonnel landmines. When 100 million of these killers are hidden in the ground in over 60 countries, we have to say ``enough is enough.'' Another 2 million are being added each year.  The only way we will stop this is to ban their use, and to turn our attention to the immense job of clearing the mines that have turned so many parts of the world into death traps.  This is an issue whose time has come. I commend those at the Pentagon, the White House, and here in the Congress, in both parties, who have supported this effort so far. Let us go one step further, and make this for all time U.S. policy, to ban their use; and then go to our allies around the world, and to other countries, and say, join with us in what is both a security and a moral imperative.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from yesterday's New York times and an Associated Press article related to the subject be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 17, 1996]          Pentagon Weighs Ending Opposition to a Ban on Mines     policy review ordered--threat to u.s. force in bosnia brings                 reconsideration of moves against weapon                          (By Raymond Bonner)       Washington, March 16.--With the daily threat of land mines      to American soldiers in Bosnia having brought the issue home,      Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of      Staff, has ordered a review of the military's longstanding      opposition to banning the use of land mines, which kill or      maim more than 20,000 people a year, primarily civilians.       In asking for the review last week during a meeting with      the chiefs of the military services, General Shalikashvili      said he was ``inclined to eliminate all anti-personnel land      mines,'' a senior pentagon official said.       The Pentagon was prompted to review its policy in part by a      strong bipartisan anti-mine sentiment in Congress, led by      Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, as well as by      a growing international campaign to ban antipersonnel mines,      Pentagon officials said.       These separate Congressional and international campaigns      against mines gained new momentum after American soldiers      began arriving in December in Bosnia, where an estimated      three million land mines have been planted. Three American      soldiers have since been wounded by the weapons.       Nearly a dozen countries have banned the use of land mines.      Senator Leahy and other advocates of a ban argue that if the      United States renounced their manufacture, sale and use, many      other countries would follow. While they concede that there      would still be outlaw states, they counter that an      international ban backed by sanctions would result in a      substantial overall reduction in the use of land mines.       Pentagon officials say General Shalikashvili acted after he      and Defense Secretary William J. Perry received a      confidential letter from the American representative to the      United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, who has just returned      from a trip to Angola. That country has many young men and      children whose limbs were ripped off in landmine explosions.       Ms. Albright wrote that a new policy on land mines was      urgently needed, because the Administration's current policy      would not achieve their elimination ``within our lifetimes.''      She sent copies to other senior Administration officials;      parts of the letter were read to The New York Times by a      supporter of the ban who had received a copy.       Two years ago in a speech at the United Nations, President      Clinton called for the ``eventual elimination'' of land      mines. Under current policy, the Administration supports an      amendment to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons that      would allow the use of only ``smart'' mines, which deactivate      or destroy themselves after a few weeks or months.       The United States was barred by Congress in 1993 from      exporting land mines for three years. Another law prohibits      the United States from using land mines for one year in 1999.       There are an estimated 100 million land mines planted in 62      countries, and an official with the Arms Control and      Disarmament Agency said last week that the number is      increasing by two million a year. The State Department has      said 600 people a month are killed or wounded by mines; the      American Red Cross has estimated that it is twice that many.       This week, the Dutch Government renounced the use of land      mines, joining Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Austria, Norway and      five other countries; France recently prohibited the      production and export of land mines. Twenty-four countries      have called for an international ban, according to the latest      tally by Human Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights      organization, which has been a leader in an international      campaign for a ban.       Last fall, the International Committee of the Red Cross      opened a campaign to ban antipersonnel land mines. It was a      highly unusual step for the Swiss organization, which is not      an advocacy organization and only once before has called for      a weapons ban--of chemical weapons, back in the 1920's.       ``We've simply seen too much,'' said Urs Boegli, director      of the Red Cross's land mine campaign, explaining why the      organization had acted.       More than any other single organization, the Red Cross      works in conflicts around the world, he said. He added that      the Red Cross had begun its ban campaign only after having      fought unsuccessfully to strengthen the 1980 conventional      weapons treaty to restrict their use.       China and Russia, which each have stockpiles of more than      100 million mines, have been the major countries blocking an      amendment to the convention that would allow all but      ``smart'' mines.       In the Pentagon, the Office of Special Operations and Low-     Intensity Conflict has pushed for a complete ban on all      antipersonnel mines--``smart'' and ``dumb''--except in      limited situations, such as along the border between North      and South Korea.       Land mines should be put in the category of chemical      weapons, said Timothy Connolly, principal Deputy Assistant      Secretary of Defense for special operations. Even though they      have military utility, chemical weapons have been banned      because of their devastating consequences, to soldiers and      civilians.       ``Some day, and that day has to be sooner rather than      later, we are going to reach that same conclusion about      antipersonnel land mines,'' Mr. Connolly, who was an Army      captain during the Persian Gulf War, said during an interview      this week.       Mr. Connolly's office rejects the ``smart'' mine      compromise.       The basis of the American support for such a compromise is      that it is possible to develop a mine that will self-destruct      or self-deactivate with 99.7 percent certainty, according to      Robert Sherman, director of advanced projects of the Arms      Control and Disarmanent Agency and a negotiator in talks on      amending the conventional weapons pact.       But Mr. Connolly said, ``There is no evidence in the United      States that we are capable of building a device capable of      working 100 percent or nearly 100 percent of the time.''       Until this recent review, Mr. Connolly's voice had been a      lonely one in the Pentagon.       Pentagon officials predicted that the Army and Marine Corps      would fight the hardest to be allowed to keep at least some      land mines, Pentagon officials said. Military doctrine calls      for land mines to reduce the number of soldiers needed in      certain situations, to canalize the enemy and to protect      vital installations, like power stations.       In the closed-door meeting last week when Gen.      Shalikashvili ordered the review, the chiefs of the Army and      Marine Corps said they needed land mines to police the border      between North and South Korea, a Pentagon Official said.       ``The U.S. Army's position is that we use land mines      responsibly,'' said an Army general who spoke on condition of      anonymity.       Senator Leahy believes, however, that with American troops      in Bosnia, if President Clinton renounced the use of land      mines, ``he would get very substantial support in the      military.'' Mr. Leahy, who has led a four-year effort in      Congress to ban land mines, said he was constantly hearing      from servicemen, from sergeants to generals, who urge him on.       Recently, he received an E-mail message from an Air Force      master sergeant, Dale A. Lamell, on duty in Bosnia, who      wrote: ``I would like to salute you for your efforts to      eliminate the international use of land mines. Bosnia should      serve as an example to the rest of the world.''       Requesting anonymity, a senior military officer at the      Pentagon also said this week that there was considerably more      support among officers for getting rid of land mines than      emerges publicly.       Freed from the constraints of being in uniform, several      prominent retired generals have agreed to sign an open letter      to the President calling for an international ban on the      production and use of antipersonnel land mines, said Robert      Muller, director of the Vietnam Veterans of America      Foundation, which began soliciting signers three weeks ago.      Among them are Gen. Frederick R. Woerner, a former commander      of the United States Southern Command in Panama, and Lieut.      Gen. Harold Moore, a former commander of the Seventh Infantry      Division and author of ``We Were Soldiers Once . . . and      Young.''       ``I very much oppose antipersonnel land mines because they      are indeed indiscriminate in their killing and maiming,''      Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf wrote this month in a letter to      Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican      National Committee during the Reagan Presidency and who had      written to the general asking him to join the campaign to ban      antipersonnel mines.       Though he said he wanted to think a bit longer before      deciding whether to sign the letter to the President, General      Schwarzkopf said his wish to see land mines ``forever      eliminated from warfare'' was based on his personal      experiences of ``having seen hundreds of my own troops killed      or maimed by them,'' as well as being ``keenly aware of the      devastating effects'' of land mines on civilians.                                                                    ____               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 17, 1996]        Senator Praises Pentagon For Reconsidering Landmine Use                           (By Sally Buzbee)       Washington.--A Senator long opposed to U.S. use of land      mines said Sunday he's delighted the Pentagon will reevaluate      its position that the deadly, hidden weapons are needed for      troop safety.       ``There are certain weapons you just don't use,'' said Sen.      Patrick Leahy, D-VT.       A Pentagon spokesman confirmed Sunday that a review of the      military's longstanding policy on anti-personnel land mines      was under review.       ``It's been an ongoing issue here,'' said Pentagon      spokesman Major Steve Manuel. ``We're still in the process of      examining it.''       Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of      Staff, ordered the review last week, The New York Times      reported Sunday.       A senior Pentagon official told the newspaper that      Shalikashvili was ``inclined to eliminate all anti-personnel      land mines.''       Worldwide, the use of land mines targeted at people, not      tanks, has escalated in the last 15 years, They now kill or      injure 26,000     people each year, the State Department estimates.       Most victims are civilians in war-torn countries like      Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam and El Salvador, but land mines      also pose risks to U.S. troops participating in the Bosnian      peacekeeping mission.       U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the      International Red Cross have urged a worldwide ban on land      mines. And Canada, Austria, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Mexico,      the Netherlands and five other countries already have      renounced their use.       But until now, U.S. military officials have insisted they      needed the option of using land mines to protect the lives of      American soldiers. They also have argued that the United      States should not give up a weapon if other nations won't.       Despite Pentagon objections, Leahy pushed through Congress      a one-year ban on the military's use of anti-personnel land      mines, except along borders and in demilitarized zones. The      ban would begin sometime within three years, and President      Clinton signed it into law.       ``The rest of the world wants the United States to lead on      this,'' Leahy said in an interview Sunday. ``If the most      powerful nation in the world can't do away with land mines,      how can we ever persuade other countries to?''       Shalikashvili ordered the review of Pentagon policy after      he and Defense Secretary William J. Perry received a      confidential letter from the U.S. ambassador to the United      Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, the Times said.       Albright, who had just returned from Angola, urged that the      current policy on land mines be changed, the Times said.      Parts of the letter were read to the newspaper by an      unidentified official who received a copy.       Leahy argues that many military officials, both retired and      active-duty, also privately support a permanent ban on land      mines.       ``This is not a Republican-Democratic, liberal-conservative      or civilian versus military issue,'' Leahy said.       The Pentagon estimates Bosnia has 3 million land mines and      Croatia another 3 million. Some are sophisticated; others      crude or homemade. NATO officials say no more than 30 percent      have been mapped.
