Speaker, on April 30, Dr. Donald N. Langenberg, who has served as chancellor of the University System of Maryland for more than a decade, will retire after a lifetime of service to higher education.  Dr. Langenberg has left a mark in academe as few others have. As chancellor of the University System of Maryland, he has overseen the emergence of a nationally recognized public university system, with top-ranked programs, unprecedented levels of state funding,and extraordinary increases in grants and contracts to conduct research. As the first chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago, he was instrumental in creating a campus now known for its quality and diversity. His leadership at the National Science Foundation, the University of Pennsylvania, the National Association of System Heads, and other academic groups has contributed to an era of extraordinary growth and vitality in American higher education.  Mr. Speaker, as a founding member of Maryland's K-16 Partnership for Teaching and Learning, he led the state toward an education system that will provide students a seamless transition from preschool to the college years and beyond. His work as chair of the National Reading Panel helped disseminate groundbreaking research and bold recommendations about the bedrock of education: teaching children how to read.  Dr. Langenberg has also contributed enormously to his academic field of physics, conducting research into experimental condensed matter physics and materials science. His earliest research was concerned with the electronic properties and Fermi surfaces of metals and degenerate semiconductors. A major part of his research career was devoted to the study of superconductivity, particularly the Josephson effects and nonequilibrium superconductivity. He is perhaps best known for his work on the determination of certain fundamental physical constants using the ac Josephson effect. A practical consequence of this work was the development of a radically new type of voltage standard that is now used around the world. One of the major publications resulting from this work is among the most frequently cited papers published by the Reviews of Modern Physics during the 1955-86 period, and has been dubbed a ``citation classic.'' The work has also been recognized by the award to Dr. Langenberg and his co-workers of the John Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Langenberg is the author or co-author of over one hundred papers and articles, and has edited several books. In addition to serving as Deputy Director of the National Science Foundation from 1980-1982, he has held predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships from the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. He has been a visiting professor or researcher at Oxford University, the Ecole Normale Superieure, the California Institute of Technology, and the Technische Universitat Munchen. In addition to the Wetherill Medal, he has been awarded the Distinguished Contribution to Research Administration Award of the Society of Research Administrators, the Distinguished Achievement Citation of the Iowa State University Alumni Association, and the Significant Sig Award of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.  Dr. Langenberg has served as advisor or consultant to a variety of universities, industrial firms, and governmental agencies. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, is President of the National Association of System Heads (NASH), and is Chairman of the Board of Directors of The Education Trust, Inc. He is a member of the Business-Higher Education Forum, a partnership of the American Council on Education and the National Alliance of Business intended to foster communication among national business and education leaders. He has been President and Chairman of the Board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Chairman of the Board of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC), and President of the American Physical Society (APS). He also recently concluded ten years of service on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and is the immediate past Chairman of the Presidents' Council of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB).  Mr. Speaker, in addition to serving the larger public through his work on various boards, Dr. Langenberg has also served in quieter, though equally profound ways. Both through his example and through individual mentoring, he has helped develop key academic leaders for the University System of Maryland and for higher education in general. By serving as an advisor to people of talent and ability, Dr. Langenberg has helped many institutions find exceptional faculty, provosts, and presidents.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Langenberg's lifetime of achievement and service will be celebrated on April 20 at a special retirement gala that will raise endowment funds for the Langenberg Lecture and Award, two efforts to continue his vision of education as a life-long journey of the human mind. Mr. Speaker, I know the Members of the House join me in thanking Dr. Langenberg for nearly 50 years of service in higher education and I rise to congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
