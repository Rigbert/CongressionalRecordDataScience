THOMAS. Madam Speaker, I will tell the gentlewoman one more time, and I do not know how to explain it to her any other way but to say that there is no corporate money that is legally allowed under the so-called hard money definition. It is not allowed, either domestic or foreign.  When individuals contribute today under the Federal Election Act, individuals who are not citizens can contribute, as we saw paraded over and over again in terms of the individuals that participated in the presidential election in 1996, some of whom have now come forward and admitted guilt in carrying on the raising of illegal contributions. Those are individuals; those are not corporations.  Could I ask the gentlewoman a question to respond to her?
