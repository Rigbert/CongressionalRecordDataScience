President, I stand here today to pay tribute to Paul Tsongas, one of the most courageous men and of the greatest humanitarians that I have had the honor of serving with in the U.S. Senate.  Paul Tsongas' work for his fellow man did not start nor stop here in Washington. Before he even dreamed of running for elected office, he donated his time to the Peace Corps, serving in Ethiopia and the West Indies.  But whether it was Ethiopia or Washington, DC, Paul Tsongas left his mark wherever he went.  In his hometown of Lowell, MA, one only needs to look at the Lowell National Historical Park to realize what he meant to his fellow citizens of that historical New England town.  He only served in the Senate for one term. But in just his second year, he led the efforts to pass the Alaska Lands Act of 1980 which has been recognized as one of the most important pieces of conservation legislation in history.  When diagnosed with lymphoma, he left the Senate to spend more time with his family. But he did not give in to his cancer. He fought it with the tenacity that those of us who knew him would only come to expect.  After undergoing experimental surgery to beat the cancer, he felt even more compelled to donate his life to helping his fellow citizens. One person he helped was my close friend Bill Gray. Bill, suffering from cancer, was constantly encouraged and cheered by Paul.  As we all remember, his remarkable run for President as an advocate for a balanced budget in 1992 helped shape America's political agenda.  After contributing to the campaign in a losing effort, he co-founded the Concord Coalition to advocate a balanced budget. Since then, the deficit has been cut in half and the Concord Coalition has become one of the most well respected bipartisan organizations in Washington.  Paul Tsongas will be remembered here in Washington and in his hometown of Lowell not only for his work as a legislator but for his work as a father, a husband, and a humanitarian.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Niki, and his daughters Ashley, Katina, and Molly.                          ____________________
