 President, early this month, in my home State of Iowa, a tragedy took place that shocked our entire State. On Wednesday, November 2, 2016, the lives of Des Moines Police Sergeant Anthony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin were taken at the hands of an assailant. It is almost unimaginable for somebody to attack the people who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities. Unfortunately, it is a threat all too familiar for everybody who has a family member in law enforcement. Just after 1 a.m. on November 2, police responded to a report of shots fired and discovered that Officer Martin was shot and killed in his car while he was on duty. A short while later, Sergeant Anthony Beminio was found shot and killed in his car. He was believed to have been responding to the report of shots fired when he was killed by the lone assailant who moments earlier had allegedly killed Officer Martin. Police do not have a motive for the shootings.  Nothing excuses the unforgivable act of attacking a police officer. I praise these heroes who gave their lives carrying out their mission to protect and serve.  Sergeant Anthony ``Tony'' Beminio joined the Des Moines police force in 2005, after serving with the Indianola Police Department for 4 years. By all accounts, he was a talented athlete, a great detective, and he will be remembered by his friends as a professional man who was always smiling. He earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Simpson College in 2001 and then a master's of science degree from the University of Cincinnati prior to becoming a police officer.  Sergeant Beminio took after his father, Frank Beminio, who served as a member of the Belmond Police Department for 17 years, 8 of which were as chief of police. As a school resource officer at Roosevelt and East high schools, Tony was cherished by students and faculty. It takes a special kind of person to be a school resource officer, and Tony was an outstanding role model who had a good relationship with the students he served.  My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Sergeant Beminio in this difficult time. I want to express my deepest condolences to Sergeant Beminio's wife, Zoe; his three children, Cameron, Haley, and Maddoz; and his parents, Patricia and Frank Beminio.  These trying times serve as a reminder to show our appreciation to those who watch over our communities and run to danger. We can look to the words of wisdom from an Iowa mother who lost her son, Officer Carlos Puente-Morales, in the line of duty earlier this year. As she said, ``We shouldn't wait for a tragedy to recognize our heroes.'' We should all live by this sentiment and show appreciationto the brave men and women who walk in the footsteps of Sergeant Beminio and Officer Martin to protect and serve our communities across the country.                          ____________________
