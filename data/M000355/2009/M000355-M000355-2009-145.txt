 President, I say to my good friend from West Virginia, I spoke this morning on his remarkable record of achievement.  We are all proud of your service to your State and to our country. I sent you a note including my remarks from this morning about this remarkable record you have now achieved. Of course, you broke the record of a Senator from Arizona. One of his successors is here on the floor and would like to address that matter as well.
