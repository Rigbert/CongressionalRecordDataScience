President, you don't have to look too far in Vermont to find any number of unique businesses. One such business is Border Air Ltd., led by its owner Cliff Coy. Cliff is the airport manager and unofficial ``aviation ambassador'' at the Franklin County State Airport in Swanton, VT. He also owns and runs Border Air Ltd., a maintenance and restoration company. He purchased Border Air Ltd. in 2007 from his father, George, who founded the company in 1989. Border Air specializes in restoring Soviet-era aircraft and is one of only five companies in the country with the qualifications to sell, maintain, and inspect them.  In addition to providing many services for the aviation enthusiasts who call Franklin County home, Border Air imports and exports planes to and from former Soviet nations, a practice that began after the senior Mr. Coy took a trip to Lithuania in 1989. George Coy heard of an Antonov An-2, the largest single-engine biplane ever built, which had just been restored and was listed for sale. In spite of a major malfunction while crossing the Black Sea with the An-2, the Coys were hooked on the idea of importing similar aircraft and selling them to American pilots.  Since then, over 300 planes have passed through Border Air's hangars, some purchased by customers as far as Chicago. Through their work with pilots and aviation enthusiasts across the world, the Coy family has brought business to Swanton and helps to keep citizens safe by inspecting planes once a year to ensure they are up to Federal Aviation Administration safety codes. Though safety is most important, Cliff Coy also aims to inspire a love of flying in children and adults across the country by bringing students from nearby Missiquoi Valley Union High School to the airport to watch air show practices or speaking with anyone interested in planes from flying to skydiving.  The Coys represent an entrepreneurial spirit that is at the heart of Vermont. In Cliff Coy, we see a true commitment to and leadership with the community.  I ask unanimous consent that the April 14, 2016, article from Seven Days entitled ``Border Air in Swanton Keeps Imported Planes Alive,'' which chronicles the Coys' history with Border Air Ltd., be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Apr. 14, 2016]           Border Air in Swanton Keeps Imported Planes Alive                            (By Ken Picard)       A stiff snow squall swirls around the main building at      Franklin County State Airport in Swanton as a large, twin-     engine turboprop prepares to roll out of the hangar. Airport      manager Cliff Coy watches silently as the King Air B200 revs      its engines with a high-pitched whine and slowly inches its      way onto the tarmac.       The plane's wingtips are upturned for improved aerodynamics      and fuel efficiency. It's just a fringe benefit that the      design also allows the plane to squeeze through the hangar      door.       ``That's a 58-foot wingspan going through a 60-foot      opening,'' Coy notes with a bemused smile. Once the wings      clear the sides, he flashes a quick thumbs-up to his      mechanic, Dan Marcotte, who's directing the pilot from the      tarmac.       Unlike busy commercial hubs, such as Burlington      International Airport, Franklin County State Airport doesn't      have its own air traffic control tower. Many planes that use      this runway lack radios, lights or onboard electrical      systems.       The 46-year-old Coy wears many hats at this small, state-     owned airstrip that's just a hop from the Canadian border.      Besides managing the airport, he's the owner of Border Air      Ltd., which was founded by his father, George Coy. As an FBO,      or fixed-base operator, Border Air performs various functions      for the flying public: fueling, inspection, maintenance,      flight training, and providing hangar and tie-down space for      parking aircraft. Coy calls its headquarters ``a cross      between a boat launch and a state park--and I'm the guy      wearing the green shirt and the hat.''       Beyond Coy's official duties, he's the airport's unofficial      ``aviation ambassador,'' which involves more than just      greeting white-knuckled travelers when they land safely in      inclement weather. Coy is Franklin County's go-to guy for      anyone who's interested in learning more about airplanes,      whether that means fixing them, flying them, building them or      jumping out of them with parachutes.       And, with fuel prices at historic lows, interest in      aviation is soaring. That's not readily apparent on the      morning I visit: Aside from the departing turboprop, about      the only thing moving on the airfield is a semierect orange      wind sock. But, according to Coy, KFSO--the airport's Federal      Aviation Administration abbreviation--is usually more active.       ``This is the busiest airport in Vermont for general      aviation,'' he says, referring to noncommercial and      nonmilitary air traffic. ``Come out here in six weeks on a      Saturday, and this place will be humming with airplanes.''       Those planes aren't just local flyers. In recent years, Coy      has carved out a unique niche for himself in the wider world      of aviation: He imports and exports planes to and from Russia      and other former Soviet-bloc countries. One of only five      companies in the country with the expertise to sell, service      and inspect Soviet-era planes, Border Air also maintains,      repairs and modifies them--an unusual specialty that Coy fell      into almost by accident.       Coy got his degree in mechanical engineering from Vermont      Technical College and studied computer science and physics at      the University of New Mexico. Then, as he puts it, he faced      an important life choice: ``Am I going to spend the rest of      my life in front of a computer screen, under bad fluorescent      lighting? Or am I going to solve problems out in the field      and get dirty?''       Coy began answering that question in 1988. That year, his      uncle Bob, who was working on a sister-city exchange program,      offered Coy a chance to travel to the Soviet Union after an      injury forced a student in the program to drop out at the      last minute.       Coy jumped at the opportunity--and not merely to see the      Soviet Union as it began to open up to the West. Coy's      father, George, himself a pilot and flight mechanic, was      keenly interested in a Russian-built aircraft called the      Antonov An-2. The 1,000-horsepower, 12-passenger plane is the      world's largest single-engine biplane ever built. As Coy      recalls, his father ``became infatuated with it and      absolutely had to have one.''       While that trip offered the chance to see an An-2      firsthand, the Coys wouldn't get their hands on one until      1989, when George Coy learned that a company in Lithuania had      a freshly overhauled An-2 for sale. As the Soviet Union      neared its collapse, the Eastern Bloc countries were becoming      like the Wild West, Cliff Coy recalls, with everything being      sold off at bargain-basement prices.     ``So he strapped a pile of cash to a belt and flew out to      Lithuania to go look at an airplane,'' says Cliff.       Since George didn't speak Lithuanian, and all the      instrumentation was in Russian, the sellers taught him how to      fly the plane. Convinced it was worth the investment, the      Coys hired a Russian pilot and a farmer from Shelburne to      help fly the An-2 back to Vermont.       Like many aviation adventures, Cliff Coy says, theirs began      with a mechanical malfunction: The plane lost all of its oil      above the clouds during a night crossing of the North Sea.*      As he recalls, ``The Russian pilot knew very few words of      English, and two of them were `Very bad!' ''       The An-2 managed to run for another half hour without oil      before landing safely. Despite the mishap, the trip stoked      the Coys' interest in importing more Russian and Eastern      European planes--such as two aerobatic trainer planes called      Yakovlev Yak-52s that they'd seen in Lithuania. Sensing a      business opportunity, the Coys began importing Russian and      Eastern Bloc planes to the U.S. for American buyers.       Since 1989, Border Air has imported more than 300 such      aircraft, including a Yak-55, which is currently under repair      in the hangar in Swanton. With only about 250 Yak-52s still      actively flying in the United States, Coy has loyal clients      who fly to Swanton from as far west as Chicago to get      their planes serviced.       What's the plane's appeal? For one thing, Coy points out,      Yak-52s closely resemble World War II fighter planes. And,      given the Soviets' efficient engineering, he adds, ``You're      basically able to maintain it out in a farmer's field with a      flathead screwdriver and a wrench. So they're incredibly      rugged and inexpensive.''       The Coys pretty much stopped importing Russian aircraft in      2005, when the dollar-to-Euro exchange rate made them      prohibitively expensive. The sale price of the Yak-52, for      example, jumped from $120,000 to $380,000.       In 2007, Coy bought Border Air from his father. These days,      much of his business has reversed direction--it involves      moving planes and pilots from the U.S. to Russia instead of      vice versa.       In the Soviet era, the only Russians who flew planes were      military pilots; when the country opened up civil aviation,      many Russians became interested in flying American aircraft.      Until the Russian ruble crashed last year, Border Air was      exporting about two containers of American-made planes to      Russia every three months.       Recent changes overseas have brought a whole new crop of      flyers to Swanton. In 2011, a wave of bad aviation accidents      in Russia killed scores of people. Putting the blame on      pilots who had obtained their licenses fraudulently, the      Russian government closed flight schools across the country.       The virtual shutdown of civil aviation in Russia could have      sent Coy's business into a tailspin. But then Russians began      coming to the United States--including the flight school in      Swanton--to obtain pilot's licenses. Apparently placing      greater trust in American flight schools than in its own, the      Russian government converts U.S. pilots' licenses into      Russian ones, Coy says.       Just as Coy is explaining the process, two Russian men with      crew cuts and black coats pass en route to a small trainer      plane to begin their flight lessons. According to Coy,      they're former Russian fighter pilots who are logging flight      time and learning to fly in U.S. airspace. ``There's a bit of      a mind shift when you go from flying something at 300 miles      per hour to flying something at 60 miles per hour,'' he says.       Of course, not all of Coy's work involves Russians and      Russian planes. As an FAA-licensed inspector, he ensures that      the aircraft he encounters are flightworthy. By law, every      aircraft, from a commercial Boeing 777 to the one-seat      Ultralight hanging from the hangar rafters, must be inspected      annually.       ``I've seen things where you wonder how these people even      made it here alive,'' Coy says. ``Unbelievably scary stuff.''       For example, he recalls encountering a pilot who reported      that his plane was flying funny When Coy checked it out, he      noticed that the bottom of the fuselage was blue--from the      dye used to identify aircraft fuel. Coy instantly spotted the      problem: The fuel line wasn't hooked up. When he went to      adjust the propeller control, it broke off in his hand. Next,      he discovered that the starboard engine wasn't bolted onto      the frame and the landing gear wasn't installed correctly.      The result: a 60-page report to the FAA.       Getting people passionate and up in the air is Coy's      mission. And, notwithstanding the back issues of Cigar      Aficionado in the airport waiting room, he says he meets a      diverse cross-section of people who are aviation enthusiasts.       Granted, it's not a cheap hobby: The costs of purchasing      and maintaining airplanes may seem daunting enough to      dissuade anyone without a seven-figure trust fund. But, Coy      points out, most people who fly these days rent their planes.      (Coy himself doesn't own one.) And enthusiasts who decide to      take the next step can buy a plane for as little as $15,000,      on par with the price of a boat.       Coy does a lot of outreach to local schools, hoping to get      the next generation interested in flying. Sometimes that      means showing the kids his various ``museum pieces''--the      historic aircraft parked in various hangars on the airfield.      Or he'll invite students from nearby Missisquoi Valley Union      High School to watch his mechanic, Marcotte, practice his      air-show maneuvers during his lunch hour. (Burlingtonians      know Marcotte as the pilot who flies acrobatic stunts over      the waterfront before the annual July 3 fireworks show.)        ``Look, if you have any interest in flying, we'll take you      for a ride in an airplane,'' Coy says. ``That's what we do,      because we want to get people interested in flying.''       Correction, April 14, 2016: An earlier version of this      story misreported Coy's age--it is 46. The body of water over      which Coy's plane experienced engine trouble was the North      Sea, not the Black Sea. Additionally, aviation enthusiasts      can buy a plane for $15,000, not the higher number originally      reported.  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
