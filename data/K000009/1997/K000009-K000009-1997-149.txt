Speaker, it is mutual.  I understand what has happened here. In a way it is laughable, but in a way it is truly sad, because I remember the debates in subcommittee, I remember the debates in full committee, and I have to say that the amendment that we submitted was very different in terms of where we took the initial funding. We were trying to be somewhat flexible when we came before the committee. We feel that we were hijacked in the process, but I really feel that the name of the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. Roukema] should be on there.
