On any ordinary day, the Republicans would not stand up and say that we need more bureaucracy; we need more 2-year rule-making on things that are important to the American people.  We are creating transparency here. We're creating a stakeholder committee.  Yes, they have done some stupid things in GA. But does that mean you're going to go to all of the things that relate to passengers and airports and baggage screening and explosives and everything else and put those out into a public rule-making process with all the sensitive security information that's involved? That's impossible. It's impractical, and it would jeopardize the safety of the American public.  Yes, let's fix the problems with GA. Somebody down there needs to be picked up and shaken upside down to understand what GA's all about. The chairman's doing that. We'll continue to do that. We'll work with you. We're creating a stakeholder group so that GA will have a voice. But don't throw out all of the other critical security directives and the flexibility to put them in place and change them without a bureaucratic process.
