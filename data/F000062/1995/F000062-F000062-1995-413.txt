 They fear that Congress will have to amend the Constitution every time they enact enabling legislation.  This statement is pure hogwash--history has proven that constitutional amendments are inevitably defined by enabling legislation. During my statement on February 9, I displayed 20 volumes of the United States Code Annotated related to the 14th amendment. Are the supporters of this argument saying that they are opposed to all this legislation because it does not belong in the Constitution?--I think not.  They also believe that the Social Security trust funds can be protected through this same enabling legislation. At this time, I will reintroduce to the Record a letter from the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service. Just to remind my colleagues, let me read the reply I received to an inquiry about the ability to protect Social Security in implementing legislation. The letter reads,       If the proposed amendment was ratified, then Congress would      appear to be without the authority to exclude the Social      Security trust funds from the calculation of total receipts      and outlays under section 1 of the balanced budget amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                      The Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.     To: Senator Diane Feinstein     Attention: Mark Kadesh     From: American Law Division     Subject: Whether the Social Security Trust Funds Can Be          Excluded from the Calculations Required by the Proposed          Balanced Budget Amendment.       This is to respond to your request to evaluate whether      Congress could by statute or resolution provide that certain      outlays or receipts would not be included within the term      ``total outlays and receipts'' as used in the proposed      Balance Budget Amendment. Specifically, you requested an      analysis as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors      Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance      Trust Fund could be exempted from the calculation necessary      to determine compliance with the constitutional amendment      proposed in H.J. Res. 1, which provides that total      expenditures will not exceed total outlays.\1\       Section 1 of H.J. Res. 1, as placed on the Senate Calendar,      provides that total outlays for any fiscal year will not      exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless authorized      by three-fifths of the whole number of each House of      Congress. The resolution also states that total receipts      shall include all receipts of the United States Government      except those derived from borrowing, and that total outlays      shall include all outlays of the United States Government      except for those used for repayment of debt principal. These      requirements can be waived during periods of war or serious      threats to national security.       Under the proposed language, it would appear that the      receipts received by the United States which go to the      Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the      Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be included in      the calculations of total receipts, and that payments from      those funds would similarly be considered in the calculation      of total outlays. This is confirmed by the House Report      issued with H.J. Res. 1.\2\ Thus, if the proposed amendment      was ratified, then Congress would appear to be without the      authority to exclude the Social Security Trust Funds from the      calculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of      the amendment.\3\                                            Kenneth R. Thomas,                                             Legislative Attorney,                                            American Law Division.                               footnotes     \1\H.J. Res. 16, 104th Congress, 1st Sess. (January 27, 1995)      provides the following proposed constitutional amendment--     Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed      total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of      the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by      law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a      rollcall vote.     Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held by      the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the      whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an      increase by a rollcall vote.     Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall      transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United      States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays      do not exceed total receipts.     Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law      unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each      House by a rollcall vote.     Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this      article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is      in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for      any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in      military conflict which causes an imminent and serious      military threat to national security and is so declared by a      joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number      of each House, which becomes law.     Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this      article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on      estimates of outlays and receipts.     Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the      United States Government except those derived from borrowing.      Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States      Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.     Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with      fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning      after its ratification, whichever is later.     \2\House Rept. 104-3, 104th Congress, 1st Session states the      following: ``The Committee concluded that exempting Social      Security from computations of receipts and outlays would not      be helpful to Social Security beneficiaries. Although Social      Security accounts are running a surplus at this time, the      situation is expected to change in the future with a Social      Security related deficit developing. If we exclude Social      Security from balanced budget computations, Congress will not      have to make adjustments elsewhere in the budget to      compensate for this projected deficit. . . .'' (Id. at 11.)     it should also be noted that an amendment by Representative      Frank to exempt the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance      Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund      from total receipts and total outlays was defeated in      committee by a 16-19 rollcall vote. Id. at 14. A similar      amendment by Representative Conyers was defeated in the      House, 141 Cong. Rec. H741 (daily ed. January 23, 1995), as      was an amendment by Representative Wise. Id. at H731.     \3\Although the Congress is given the authority to implement      this article by appropriate legislation, there is no      indication that the Congress would have the authority to pass      legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the      amendment.
