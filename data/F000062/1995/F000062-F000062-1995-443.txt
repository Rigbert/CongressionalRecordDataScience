 President, let me make this point, if I may, because the Senator from Idaho has just said these are not Federal programs.  The majority report says these are Federal programs. The majority report says: ``Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by S.J. Res. 1 is the Electric Power Program of the TVA.'' Now you are saying it is not only TVA, it is Bonneville as well.  Now, maybe to some the argument can be made that there is no Federal responsibility for these. But if something happened with these programs, I think we would bail them out very rapidly. I do not accept the argument that they are not Federal programs, and the majority report does not accept that argument.  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.
