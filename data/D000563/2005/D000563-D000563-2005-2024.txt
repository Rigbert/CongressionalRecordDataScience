So we offered an amendment yesterday which said when it comes to that bankruptcy situation we should be more tolerant, more lenient and more sensitive to these men and women who have risked their lives serving America in the Armed Forces.  When we offered that amendment the Senator from Florida may recall that yesterday some 58 Senators voted against it, many of whom will be the first to welcome these guardsmen and reservists with open arms, thank you for your service to our country. Now Senator Kennedy has an amendment pending which says, what about the category of Americans who have overwhelming medical bills because of a medical condition they never could have anticipated and they get trapped in bankruptcy? Can we take that into consideration and not hit them as hard as others and not take their homes away from them at the end of the day? Now the Senator comes in with another category, which I think is equally legitimate, of victims of identity theft.  If I understand the Senator from Florida, he is following in the same line of argument, and that is the bankruptcy court should not be blind to reality, to the reality of the guardsmen and reservists serving our country and paying a heavy price at home in terms of their personal finances. Nor should this bill be insensitive to a single mother raising children, diagnosed with breast cancer, who as a waitress with another job cannot pay off her medical bills, or in the Senator's case an elderly person whose identity was stolen and charges were run up beyond anything that she could handle.  It is my understanding that what you are saying is this law should be sensitive to the realities of people who are doing the right thing but are being victimized, either by medical illness or by identity theft. Is that the intention of the Senator?
