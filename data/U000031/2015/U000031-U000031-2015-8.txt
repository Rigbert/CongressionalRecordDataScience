Speaker, the world does face many challenges and risks, and when it comes to climate change, we on this side believe that we have to take an economically realistic and pragmatic approach.  To address climate as well as other risks, we support policies that will promote access to affordable and reliable energy that allows our communities to grow economically, to adapt to changes, and to be resilient both now and in the future. We also support technological innovation and the development of resilient, efficient infrastructure both to reduce emissions and to withstand climate-related events regardless of their causes.  The underlying bill that we are about ready to pass promotes access to affordable and reliable energy, diversity, efficiency, and modernization of all of our energy infrastructures. Passage of this bill would help ensure that we have critical energy infrastructure in place to withstand new threats, whether they be from climate or other risks such as terrorism and cyber attacks.  I would note, Mr. Speaker, that here in the United States, thanks to innovation--as we have expanded access to our abundant energy supplies as we have over the last couple of decades--energy-related carbon dioxide emissions have actually significantly declined, and they are projected to remain below 2005 levels through 2040 and will continue to decline as a share of worldwide emissions, particularly when compared to other nations like India and China.  So for those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
