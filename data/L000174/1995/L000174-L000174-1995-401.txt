President, I do not like to ask this question. I realize we are in the Dracula stage of legislation. The Dracula rule appears, over the last several months, where we do not vote during daylight hours but only in the evening. Otherwise, we might be wasting our time with our families, our wives, our husbands, our children, whatever else.  As one who would like to spend some time with his family, I wonder if the leader might be able to give us some idea whether this will be one of those 2 or 3 evenings a month that we are allowed time with our families. I realize the commitment of everybody here to family values. I just ask that question.
