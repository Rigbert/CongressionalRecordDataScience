I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, in the spirit of your amendment, would you consider an amendment which would make the 2-year prohibition on lobbying also retroactive, so that Senators who have not lobbied previously would be prohibited from lobbying for 2 years and it would be retroactive as well?
