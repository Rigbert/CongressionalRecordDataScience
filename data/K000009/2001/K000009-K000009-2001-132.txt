Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, I would say to the chairman of our subcommittee, very reluctantly, very, very, very reluctantly, very, very, very, very reluctantly, I am going to be forced, because of the rules, to withdraw my amendment to put America on a more renewable energy future. But I would hope that our words today have been heard at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I appreciate the chairman for his indulgence, and I would hope that wisdom will prevail in the days and months ahead.
