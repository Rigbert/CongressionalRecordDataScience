President, I commend the Senator from Kentucky for trying to move this bill along. I have been trying to do the same on my side. I am hoping we can.  In fairness, if people actually have amendments, they should bring them forward. We have had several hours of quorum calls today. It would not seem to make a great deal of sense that we be here at midnight tonight finishing the bill. I join with the Senator from Kentucky. We could easily have had it finished by now. I will make one last call on our Members, but I am very eager to go to third reading.  I see other Senators seeking recognition. I yield the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, we are going to finish the bill tonight. We hope to finish it late this afternoon. We have made good progress on this side of the aisle in whittling down the number of amendments. We would like to talk to anyone remaining on the Republican side who has an amendment they may want to offer, and Senator Leahy, of course, is open for business on the Democratic side.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
