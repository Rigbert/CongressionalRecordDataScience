President, Larry Small, Secretary of the Smithsonian, has provided a letter to the majority and minority leaders that clarifies the intentions of the Smithsonian with regard to Section 5 of H.R. 2195.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Small concerning this clarification of how the Smithsonian will proceed with voluntary separation incentive payments be made part of the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Smithsonian Institution,                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2003.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Frist and Leader Daschle: In discussions to      facilitate the Senate's consideration of H.R. 2195, the      ``Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act,'' the Smithsonian      Institution would like to clarify its intentions with regard      to Section 5, providing authority for voluntary separation      inventive payments, or buyouts. This letter gives a detailed      explanation of how we will proceed with the buyout.       If this legislation is enacted, the Secretary of the      Smithsonian Institution will have the authority to offer      separation incentives to employees who voluntarily retire or      resign. Incentives will be offered on the basis of      organizational unit, occupational series or level, geographic      location, specific window periods, skills, knowledge, other      job related factors, or a combination of such factors. An      incentive payment will be the lesser of the amount of      severance pay the employee would be entitled to if the      employee were entitled to a severance payment, or an amount      determined by the Secretary not to exceed $25,000. We will      offer buyouts for no more than three years from the date of      enactment of H.R. 2195.       Any employee is eligible for the buyout if he or she is      serving under an appointment without time limitation and has      been employed for at lest three years continuously in the      civil service at the Smithsonian. Employees not eligible for      the buyout are reemployed annuitants, employees eligible for      disability retirement, employees about to be separated for      misconduct or unacceptable performance, employees who have      previously received a voluntary separation incentive payment,      employees who are on transfer from an agency of the Executive      Branch, and employees who had received a recruitment or      relocation bonus, a retention allowance, or a student loan      repayment.       The Secretary will devise a plan outlining the intended use      of voluntary separation incentive payments. The plan will      include the specific positions and functions to be      reallocated, a description of the categories of employees to      be offered incentives, the time period during which      incentives may be paid, the number and amounts of the      incentive payments, and a description of how the Smithsonian      will operate after positions and functions are reallocated.      The Secretary will consult with the Office of Management      and Budget regarding the Institution's plan prior to      implementation and will provide an organization chart for      the Smithsonian Institution reflecting its operations      after incentive payments have been completed.       In addition, buyouts will only be made in the case of an      employee who voluntarily separates and will be paid in a lump      sum after the employee's separation. Buyouts will not be the      basis for payments or included in the computation on any      other type of governments benefit, will not be taken into      account in determining the amount of severance pay, and will      be taken from appropriations or funds available for the basic      pay of the employee.       We will amend our administrative procedures and make clear      the buyout offer that any employee who accepts the voluntary      separation incentive payment and then accepts employment for      compensation with the Federal Government within five years      will be required to repay to the Smithsonian Institution,      prior to the individual's first day of employment, the entire      amount of the voluntary separation incentive payment. This      repayment requirement may be waived in certain circumstances,      as detailed in the Homeland Security Act (Public Law 107-     296).       The purpose of the buyout is not to reduce employment at      the Smithsonian but to reconfigure the workforce to meet      current and future needs.       I hope this information is useful. Please do not hesitate      to contact me if you have any further questions. The passage      of the ``Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act'' prior to      the August recess is extremely important to the Institution.           All the best,                                                Lawrence M. Small,                                                        Secretary.
