As we offer our heartfelt congratulations to them, we have the opportunity to reflect on the significant milestone these two lives, joined as one, celebrate this year.  Married on June 14, 1958, their lives have been marked by a lasting devotion to one another, and to serving and glorifying the Lord.Through their commitment to a strong faith, Vern and Jo have touched many lives. However, in my opinion, the greatest accomplishment and contribution of this couple are their four children, Heidi and her husband, Bob; Brian; Todd and his wife, Mirjam; and Marla; and their five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. As they gather together on April 26 to mark this special day, it is the perfect time to reaffirm and strengthen the love and memories they share together.  Through a strong dedication to the institution of marriage, Vern and Jo have built a life of love and purpose. This celebration serves as an inspiration for all of us, and again reminds us that great things happen when we seek to serve and glorify God. What a fitting tribute to Vern and Jo.  I offer our best wishes for a joyfully memorable anniversary celebration as well as good health and much happiness for many years to come. As one of just a few scientists serving in the House, apparently our colleague has found the formula for lifelong happiness. May God continue to bless Vern and Jo, and I know that they will continue to be a blessing to their family, and to their many friends and colleagues.                          ____________________
