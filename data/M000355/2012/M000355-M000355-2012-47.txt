 President, I certainly agree the Senate isn't working. We get a few days in between recesses, rarely work at night, and almost never do anything on Thursday. That is entirely within the purview of the majority leader.  It is true that a few years back, when my party was in the majority, we contemplated changing the rules, but cooler heads prevailed and we didn't.
