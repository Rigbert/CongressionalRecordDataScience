Mr. Speaker, after 5 long years, Tajikistan's civil war--the costliest conflict in the former Soviet Union, in terms of casualties--may be over. Negotiations underway since 1994 under U.N. auspices have finally produced a peace accord and the opposing sides have crafted a power-sharing arrangement. Provisions are in place for over 20,000 refugees to return and elections are planned within 12 to 18 months.  Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and Saidabdullo Nuri, leader of the United Tajik Opposition [UTO], signed the General Agreement on Peace and National Accord on June 27. Among the accord's key features is the 26-member National Reconciliation Commission, composed of 13 government and 13 opposition representatives, and chaired by Nuri. Until elections are held, the opposition will control at least 30 percent of government portfolios. The opposition's fighters will be integrated into the government's force ministries, and 460 fighters will protect opposition leaders in Dushanbe. On July 10, the Reconciliation Commission came to terms on a general amnesty that will allow members of the UTO to return to Tajikistan.  The general agreement was signed in the Kremlin, testifying to Russia's key mediating role. Moscow had backed Tajikistan's Government against the opposition--a melange of democratic, Islamic, and regional forces--since the war broke out in 1992, but has obviously rethought its priorities and acknowledged that the opposition cannot be defeated militarily, at acceptable cost. Moreover, the advance of the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, which Tajik opposition fighters had used as a staging ground for assaults against Russian and Tajik Government forces, has also convinced Moscow and, apparently, anti-Taliban, Shiite Iran, that Tajikistan must be stabilized in the face of the new threat from Sunni Islamic fundamentalism.  As many analysis have pointed out, however, it is too soon for rejoicing. Though Moscow seems determined to end the conflict, there are several potential spoilers. Foremost among them is Abdumallik Abdullojanov, Tajikistan's former prime minister and chairman of the Party of National Revival. Abdullojanov represents the interests of Leninabad, the country's most populous and wealthy oblast, which had produced Tajikistan's rulers since the 1930's. By contrast, President Rakhmonov and his followers are from Kulyab oblast, whereas Nuri and most of the opposition are affiliated with the mountainous region of Karotegin. Yet Abdullojonov was not invited to participate in the peace talks or the Reconciliation Commission, and his followers have been given no positions in the coalition government. With no stake in the agreement and no incentive to promote its success, Abdullojonov has every reason to undermine its implementation, and can count on the backing of the population in northern Tajikistan.  Abdullojonov also has the presumed support of Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan, which borders Leninabad oblast and is Abdullojonov's base of operations. Karimov did not authorize Uzbekistan's signature as guarantor of the Tajik peace agreement, indicating that Russia and Uzbekistan--though they share deep concerns over Taliban victories in Afghanistan--continue to compete for influence in Tajikistan, and that Tashkent will not play along unless its interests and those of its allies in northern Tajikistan are taken into account.  If the government in Dushanbe does not see these dangers, the opposition does. On June 28, UTO first deputy leader Akbar Turajonzade told Interfax that Dushanbe's unwillingness to include representatives of other parties and movements, specifically mentioning Abdullojonov, was a mistake and could jeopardize prospects for peace.  Apart from Abdullojonov, any number of well-armed military commanders, with strong local bases, could resume hostilities or simply block the establishment of a unified country with a recognized government exercising authority over its entire territory. And even if they could be brought over, the process of sharing government portfolios and dividing the economic pie among all the various movements and factions will require masterful diplomacy.  Still, the peace accord and all its attendant problems are far preferable to the alternative Tajikistan's population has not known peace since the country became independent. The understanding between the government and the opposition may finally have laid the groundwork for the broader reconciliation that will be needed for enduring stability.  Mr. Speaker, quite apart from the obvious humanitarian imperatives, it is in the United States interests that Tajikistan's peace accord succeed. War-torn Tajikistan lags behind most other New Independent States in building democratic institutions. We should encourage the reconciliation process and urge that the planned elections take place as scheduled and that they be as free and fair as possible. It would be especially useful for IFES, the Washington-based International Foundation for Election Systems, which has done such important work in helping local authorities organize elections all over the world, to be involved with Tajikistan's Central Election Commission. Hopefully, conditions will permit other United States NGO's to begin working with political parties, and gradually help put back on track the democratization in Tajikistan that was so tragically interrupted in 1992.                          ____________________
