President, I am sorry some of our colleagues have had to wait. Both Senator McConnell and I have been down at the White House meeting with the President and other Members on foreign policy issues. It is a day when I have been wearing two hats--going from the Judiciary Committee, and some of the issues we are handling there, to the foreign policy issues. But I am glad we are going to do the foreign operations appropriations bill. We tried bringing it up a week ago, but it was held hostage by partisan sniping over judicial nominations. I think that is both unnecessary and unwarranted.  I consider it an honor that the desk that I sit in was once held by Senator Vandenberg, who coined the phrase that ``politics ends at the water's edge.'' The senior Senator from Kentucky and I have done this for years in writing the foreign aid bill, alternating us chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee. We work closely together, and I have stated many times how much I respect and admire him for his efforts to get a good, balanced foreign aid bill through.  There are things on which we can have partisan debates, but we should not allow it on this bill, especially today when our Nation is at war.
