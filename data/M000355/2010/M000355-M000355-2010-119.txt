 President, I rise to pay tribute to Mrs. Lois Baker and the commitment she made to providing rural health care services to thousands of Kentuckians. Beginning in 1971, Mrs. Baker was the chief executive officer of Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation, MCHC, which continues to provide the residents of eastern Kentucky with quality, affordable health care. Since opening its first location, a trailer located on the line between Perry and Leslie Counties, MCHC has become a fixture in the region, operating locations in five eastern Kentucky counties. Now, with 250 employees, MCHC proudly serves over 27,000 patients each year.  Mrs. Baker's commitment to the Commonwealth extends well beyond her accomplishments at MCHC. A graduate of Fugazzi Business College and the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, Mrs. Baker served as president of Baker Coal & Land Company and as president of Letcher Manufacturing Company prior to becoming CEO of MCHC. As a member of the admissions committee for the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Mrs. Baker proudly encouraged students from eastern Kentucky to pursue careers in the medical field and then to return home and utilize their skills to better the lives of their fellow Kentuckians.  Following her recent passing, the Booneville Sentinel published an article commemorating the life and accomplishments of Mrs. Lois Baker, and I would like to share that tribute with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:             [From the Booneville Sentinel, July 14, 2010]       Lois Baker leaves a long list of achievements.       Funeral services for the founder and past chief executive      officer of Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation (MCHC)      was held Wednesday, June 30, 2010 at the First Baptist Church      in Whitesburg.       Lois attended Stuart Robinson High School, Fugazzi Business      College in Lexington, KY and the University of Michigan      School of Public Health.       Before leading Mountain Comprehensive Health to become one      of the country's most successful rural health providers, she      worked in the coal business and operated a furniture plant.      She was president of Baker Coal & Land Company from 1959 to      1963, president of Letcher Manufacturing Company, Inc. in      1963 and became CEO of MCHC in 1971.       The first MCHC clinic was located in Wooten on the Perry/     Leslie county line, in a trailer. MCHC operates five clinics,      located in Letcher, Perry, Harlan and Owsley counties. MCHC's      team consists of 250 employees and provides services to more      than 27,000 patients each year. In looking back, Lois stated,      ``there was no way that at that time I could have imagined or      anyone else that was working at that time could imagine      Mountain Comp as it is today.''       In October 1983, Lois extended her commitment of providing      quality healthcare services to the residents of Owsley County      and surrounding counties by opening the Owsley County Medical      Clinic. Owsley Medical Clinic is now a medical practice      consisting of two primary care providers and 15 employees      whose mission is to utilize all available resources to      provide affordable health care to those persons residing in      its service area. The Owsley Medical Clinic is an asset to      the area as well as a source of pride for Owsley County.      Thank you Lois for thinking of us!       Lois served on many boards and committees. She was a member      of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Admissions      Committee. She said that if an eastern Kentucky student      applied to UK College of Medicine, they were accepted and      encouraged to come back to the mountains to practice      medicine. She was inducted into the Mountain Heritage Hall of      Fame, the National Association of Community Health Centers      Grassroots Advocacy Hall of Fame and the UK College of Public      Health Hall of Fame.       Lois always had a vision and she never lost that vision.      She was always a pioneer in everything and never afraid to      tackle anything. She had a presence that seemed larger than      life and felt it was purely about helping people by providing      excellent health care. Lois's great passion for her work,      compassion for her staff and patients, and friendliness even      under stress made her a role model for all of us. She will be      missed greatly by many.                          ____________________
