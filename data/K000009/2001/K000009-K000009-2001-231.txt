Speaker, Taiwan marked its president's first anniversary in office on May 20, 2001. President Chen Shui-bian, a Taiwan-born statesman, should be commended for his leadership and vision for his country.  President Chen has protected the tradition of political liberty for the 23 million citizens of Taiwan. His strong support for an educated population strives to ensure a society based on freedom and opportunity. I applaud his openness to democracy and the free exchange of ideas with other nations and cultures.  With the continued encouragement and assistance from the West, Taiwan can continue to be a beacon of hope for freedom in Asia.  On the occasion of President Chen's first anniversary in office, I wish President Chen Godspeed and good fortune as he transits through New York en route to Central America later this month.                          ____________________
