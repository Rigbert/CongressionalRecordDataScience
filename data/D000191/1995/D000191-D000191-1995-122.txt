Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, they still have not responded to the fact that yesterday the esteemed chairman of the Committee on Rules stood on the floor and said it would be a scandal to go back to the days when Members of the military and their families were on food stamps. Those days never went away. They are still here. We cannot ignore that reality.  Yes, I have been critical of the President on a number of things. Yes, his budget was not adequate to lift those families above the poverty level. Does that mean we should stay in the past? The committee only put up 25 percent of the money it estimates, which I believe is a lowball number, is necessary to get those families off food stamps. Which one-quarter of those people are we going to take off food stamps and which three-quarters are we going to leave on food stamps?
