 It is a job I don't envy.  Let me say at the outset, I have two purposes in rising today. One is, I am going to, at the end of my comments, introduce an amendment that restores full funding for the 150 function, the State Department budget, cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Smith, Durbin, Sununu, Dodd, Martinez, Menendez, Snowe, Kerry, Collins, Levin, Voinovich, Obama, Corker, Leahy, and Hagel.   What I rise to speak to now is an amendment already at the desk, amendment No. 4164. That amendment will add $551 million to the $599 million already provided in the budget resolution for the COPS Program for a total funding of $1.15 billion. I thank the Budget Committee for allocating the $599 million to the COPS Program in this resolution. That is a significant increase from the President's priorities. In fact, for the first time since its inception in 1994, the President's budget proposes to eliminate the COPS Program entirely. I am offering my amendment to get us closer to full funding of the level of $1.15 billion that proved successful in driving down crime in the 1990s.  I realize I am a broken record on this issue. Each year my colleagues hear me come down and talk about the COPS Program, the fact that we have to fully fund the program. Why am I such an advocate for the COPS Program? Mostly because I wrote the original legislation. There is a tendency around here, if you write something, you hang onto it, even if it no longer functions. But that is not the reason. It is not pride of authorship. I support it because it works. It worked. It continues to work. And it will work even better if we fund it.  In the 8 years following the creation of the COPS Program, we have driven down violent crime by 30 percent in the United States. Cops and sheriffs themselves have told us the COPS Program works and is critical to their ability to keep communities safe. In addition, we have one dozen academic studies showing that COPS grants help reduce crimes in cities of all sizes.  If it ain't broke, as Ronald Reagan used to say, why fix it? I have never heard the other side argue that this program does not work. They all agree it works. But they choose not to fund it because they think funding of local law enforcement is not a Federal responsibility or that we need to defund the program to be fiscally responsible. The truth is, this devolution of Government argument I find not very compelling. The argument that the Federal Government has no responsibility for local crime would be true if the Federal Government had no responsibility, if the States were able to do something about the drugs pouring across our international borders, if, in fact, States were able to affect crime coming across their borders from some other States, if, in fact, they had jurisdiction to reach out and deal with 60 percent of the crime that occurs in their communities because of drug abuse and drug trafficking. So there is an overwhelming Federal responsibility here.  My view is that allowing crime rates to grow and not doing everything in our power to protect our constituents is irresponsible. It is not that we are being fiscally responsible, we are being irresponsible by not funding programs we know work.  I should point out, the COPS Program actually saves money in the long run. I hear from some of my neoconservative friends, who are big on the devolution of Government and fiscal responsibility, as they talk about it. I also hear them use phrases as businesspeople: You have to spend money to make money. Well, we should, as I say, change the paradigm here.  Last March, the Brookings Institute issued a study showing that the COPS Program greatly benefits society as a whole. The study found that every $1.4 billion invested in COPS generates a benefit to society of between $6 billion and $12 billion by reducing crime. According to Brookings scholars:       COPS appears to be one of the most cost-effective options      available for fighting crime.  That is because when you prevent a crime or you fight crime, you do not pay for the cost of the injury, you do not pay for the cost of the physical damage done to the community, you do not pay for all the ancillary costs that are associated with high crime rates. You actually save money by spending money on COPS.  The Bush administration argues that because crime is lower than it was in the early 1990s, we can afford to slash crime-fighting assistance. Well, I find that striking. I start with the basic premise that if we do not see a drop in crime rates each year, then we failed. The fact is, we talk about the number of crimes, violent crimes being committed in America. If you take the total number of crimes being committed, even though they have leveled out or are only slightly increasing, they are down from the high points in the mid 1980s and the early 1990s. The fact is, there are still over 1,400,000 of those crimes being committed. Is that OK? Should we not spend money to deal with what is still an incredible number of crimes committed in America--17,000-plus murders this year? We need to get back on track now.  Our law enforcement agencies are facing a perfect storm. Let me explain why I mean by that.  Since he took office, the President has cut annual funding to COPS and Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Programs by $1.7 billion. The President's budget proposes now to eliminate these programs entirely. At the same time, he asks State and local law enforcement to take on new responsibilities--new responsibilities--relating to counterterrorism, homeland security, and immigration duties. The President is asking cops to do much more and giving them considerably less.  The FBI agents reassigned away from fighting crime to terrorism--and they must do that--have not been replaced. One investigative report last year stated that the number of criminal cases investigated by the FBI has dropped by 34 percent. I am not being critical of the FBI, nor critical of the commitment to counterterrorism. But in our effort to protect America from terrorism, we cannot leave them vulnerable to violent crime on their streets. It does not matter if you get blown up by a terrorist or shot by a drug thug on the street, you are dead. You are dead. Family members do not make a distinction between how you die. We have to protect them from both the crime on the street and from terrorism. That takes a commitment of resources that has been lacking in recent years.  Finally, the economy has slowed down. The Washington Post reported recently that next year 20 States expect their budgets to be in the red. As State governments are forced to tighten their belts and cut back on critical law enforcement funding, as they do that, Federal assistance is going to become even more important.  Many of you have heard me say this before: Fighting crime is like cutting grass. This spring, when the grass begins to grow, you go out and cut it. For 1 week, it is going to look great. Don't cut it for 2 weeks, it looks a little ragged. Don't cut it for a month, it is really ragged. Don't cut it for the summer, and you have a jungle in your front yard.  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said in another context: Society is like a wave. The wave moves on, but the particles remain the same.  God hasn't made a new brand of man in a millennia. As long as there are people and the population is increasing, there is going to be continued crime. The idea that we can spend less money one year than the year before in fighting crime I find preposterous because you do not change human nature.  Many of you have, as I have said, heard me say this for a long, long time. But the fact is, we have neglected State and local law enforcement for much too long, and we have an increasing problem on our hands.  A recent poll published by the nonpartisan Third Way indicates that 94 percent of Americans view crime as a ``very serious'' or ``fairly serious'' problem. Sixty-nine percent of Americans think violent crime is a bigger threat to them than the possibility of terrorist attacks. It is sort of a self-evident proposition, but it is interesting to know they feel that way.  The concerns of these Americans are serious, and they are real. Last year, 1.4 million Americans were victims of violent crime. Now, if crime is down from what it was a decade ago, is that an acceptable rate? Is it acceptable to say we do not have to spend any more money, we can level off violent crime at 1.4 million violent crimes a year? Are we doing our job? Are we winning the war? Are we protecting Americans? How can we justify spending less money when there are still 1.4 million violent crimes in America? More than 445,000 Americans were robbed. More than 17,000 were murdered. Is there anyone in this body who does not think these numbers are unacceptably high for a civilized nation? We know what the solution is. We know how to make American communities safer. But we know it takes a commitment, and it takes a financial commitment.  In all my years dealing with this issue of crime and the criminal justice system, there are only a few things we know for sure. One is, the older you get, the less violent crimes you commit because it is harder to run down the street being chased by a cop and to jump a chain-link fence when you are 50 years old. So violent crime decreases as you get older. The other thing we know for sure is that cops matter. If there is going to be a crime committed at an intersection and there are three cops at that intersection, the crime is going to be committed on the corner of the intersection where the cops are not standing. Cops matter.  So I find it preposterous that no one has argued against the merits--the merits--of the COPS Program and the crime bill originally written. No one argues that it does not work, but they argue we fiscally cannot afford it. Can we afford 17,000 murders in this civilized country? Can we afford 1.4 million violent acts against our fellow citizens? Can we afford 445,000 robberies, for which we know if we commit these resources of $1.15 billion a year we can significantly reduce the numberof people being victims of violent crime?  My amendment will add $551 million for the COPS Program to support the local law enforcement officials on the front lines, and it is fully offset by an across-the-board cut to nondefense, discretionary spending.  So when the appropriate time comes, I will urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I might add, it passed last year. It passed, and it passed the appropriations process until we ended up with a continuing resolution. So there has been overwhelming support for this, and I think it is needed.  Now, Madam President, I would like to turn, in the moments I have left, to an amendment I would like to offer at this time for myself and Senator Lugar. We are joined by a number of our colleagues whom I mentioned earlier. Our amendment builds on similar work done by Senator Feinstein. We all share the same goal.  My amendment restores the full amount of the President's requested $39.5 billion to the international affairs budget. To put this in perspective, for every $19 we spend on the military, we spend $1--$1--on diplomacy and development.  Last week, two distinguished former senior military officers, GEN Anthony Zinni and Admiral Smith, came before the Foreign Relations Committee to tell us that we must reorder our Nation's priorities in order to protect our national security. With more than 50 of their fellow former flag officers behind them, they are calling for a new emphasis on smart power--using our Nation's diplomatic and economic resources to protect our interests.  Secretary of Defense Gates has made the same point absolutely clear. He said:       Having robust civilian capabilities could make it less      likely that military force will have to be used in the first      place.  We can all see the results in both Iraq and Afghanistan of not having those capabilities, the resources, or the plan to turn military action into a sustainable peace.  But Secretary Gates was also perfectly clear about the real issue. In his words:       Sometimes there is no substitute for money.  He was talking about the need for an international affairs budget that can do the jobs that are now increasingly shifted onto our overburdened military or simply are not being done at all. The way we do things now, we have, in his words, ``field artillerymen and tankers building schools and mentoring city councils--usually in a language they don't speak.''  We have to do better. We face many challenges around the world in the rise of religious fundamentalism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the spread of disease, and failed states. They are all vectors that, in fact, intersect and cause great threats to us. Not one of them can be met solely or even primarily with military force. No one knows that better than our men and women in uniform.  The message we heard in our committee last week was: ``We cannot rely on military power alone to make our nation secure.'' Yet, as I said, for every $19 we spend on military resources, barely $1 goes toward civilian programs that can prevent military action, support a balanced response to security threats, or secure the peace once the shooting stops. We spend more in 3 weeks on military operations in Iraq, for example, than we have spent since 9/11 to rebuild and secure Afghanistan--the total amount of money spent in Afghanistan, which is one end of the superhighway of terrorism between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have spent less money, since 9/11, in Afghanistan defeating the Taliban and dealing with its civilian as well as military needs than we spend for 3 weeks in Iraq. This amendment will not fix that problem, but it will keep us from making it worse.  Last month, I wrote to my colleagues on the Budget Committee asking them to treat the President's budget for international operations ``as a floor, not a ceiling.'' I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have a copy of my views printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                               Committee on Foreign Relations,                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2008.     Hon. Kent Conrad, Chairman,     Hon. Judd Gregg, Ranking Member,     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg: I write in response      to your request for the views and estimates of the Committee      on Foreign Relations, as required by Section 301(d) of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974, regarding the budget for      programs under the jurisdiction of the Committee. Most, but      not all, of the programs within function 150 are under the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Relations.       At the outset, I repeat my suggestion made in years past      that the Committee consider functions 050 and 150 as part of      a ``national security budget.'' Both national defense and      international affairs programs are essential to the security      of the country, and we should fund both adequately. This was      true before the attacks on the United States in September      2001, and is even more so today.       International affairs funding is the ``first line of      defense,'' and the request should be treated as a floor, not      a ceiling. The international affairs agencies remain      underfunded and understaffed, in spite of increases in the      last decade. That is not my conclusion alone, but that of      several recent studies performed within and without the      government. Therefore, in preparing the budget resolution, I      urge you not to reduce the money allocated to function 150      under the President's request.       I also urge the Committee to bear in mind the difficulty of      estimating foreign affairs funding over the duration of the      budget resolution. Predicting the future in foreign policy      can be difficult, because so many events outside the control      of the United States can affect the course of American      policy. I think it safe to say, however, that our      international interests are unlikely to diminish over this      period; the opposite is true. In the age of globalization,      with ever-increasing links in commerce, travel, and      communications, it is more likely that our interests will      increase. Most important, we face a continuing threat of      attack by international terrorist organizations. The      unclassified portions of a National Intelligence Estimate,      issued in July 2007 (entitled ``The Terrorist Threat to the      U.S. Homeland''), stated that the ``U.S. Homeland will face a      persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three      years.'' The main terrorist organization threatening the      United States--al Qaeda--has its base of operations overseas.      Our foreign policy institutions devote substantial resources      to combating al Qaeda and its affiliates in numerous      countries overseas. In sum, our security and economic      interests dictate that we continue to provide adequate      funding for the international activities of our government.       Against this background, let me discuss several specific      items that your Committee should consider in preparing the      budget resolution.     Funding for Iraq and Afghanistan       The President has requested a relatively small amount of      foreign affairs funding for Iraq in the FY 2009 budget--$397      million in foreign assistance funds, and $65 million for      State Department operations. But this modest request obscures      a much larger supplemental request of over $2 billion for      State Department operations in FY 2008. I would expect      additional supplemental funds to be requested in FY 2009.      This continues an objectionable practice of treating these      costs as somehow unforeseen and worthy of exemption from the      normal budget discipline. We should not force the taxpayers      of tomorrow to bear the costs of today's military and foreign      policy priorities.       I am pleased that the President's budget contains over $1      billion in additional assistance for Afghanistan, but I      remain concerned that the level of commitment falls far short      of the President's pledge, made in 2002, of a reconstruction      program modeled on the Marshall Plan. In fact, over the past      six years the funds spent on Afghanistan's reconstruction      equal what we spend on military operations in Iraq every      three weeks. The budget presents little cause for optimism      that the Administration will adopt a coherent plan for      combating the illicit narcotics trade, which remains a major      threat to the objective of establishing a secure and stable      society. We, and the Afghan people, have waited half a decade      for the President's promises to be fulfilled for Afghanistan.      It is in our vital national interest to see that this budget      funds a new strategy for success rather than a continuation      of the failing policies of the past. Accordingly, I expect      that the Committee on Foreign Relations will closely review      the ongoing programs in Afghanistan and will reauthorize the      Afghan Freedom Support Act (P.L. 107-327) at levels higher      than those in the President's budget.     Non-proliferation programs       An ongoing priority of the Committee will be to improve the      non-proliferation and counterterrorism posture of the United      States. The Administration has emphasized military action      against states, but has paid insufficient attention to. non-     military efforts to keep the world's deadliest weapons,      materials, and technology out of the hands of the world's      most dangerous people.       Committee priorities in this area will include: ensuring      that sufficient resources and authority are available to take      advantage of opportunities to verifiably disable and      dismantle sensitive nuclear facilities in North Korea and, if      possible, Iran (additional resources will be of particular      importance if     Congress is unable to enact a budget-neutral Glenn Amendment      waiver for disablement, dismantlement, and verification      activities related to North Korea's nuclear programs, a      proposal that is supported by the Administration, Senator      Lugar and me); providing robust funding in a timely manner to      key international organizations carrying out critical      nonproliferation tasks, such as the International Atomic      Energy Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition of      Chemical Weapons; funding new State Department efforts to      promote biosecurity worldwide; and enacting the Global      Pathogen Surveillance Act to strengthen the ability of      developing countries to detect and combat bioterrorism      threats and infectious diseases. I first developed this      legislation in 2002, and it has been approved by the      Senate twice (most recently in December 2005 as S. 2170, a      Frist-Biden-Lugar bill). The authorization of      appropriations for these initiatives is expected to be      $150 million in FY 2009 and $180 million in each of the      out years.       Lastly, I would highlight a need that Senator Lugar has      rightly raised in the past. The Department's Directorate of      Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) is seriously under-staffed and      in need of funds to hire more full-time personnel to process      munitions license applications. Without an increase in funds      for the activities of DDTC, license applications for critical      arms sales to support our allies and their activities in      Afghanistan and Iraq will continue to be processed far more      slowly than we believe would be the case if more funds were      available. Last year, for instance, DDTC had to process more      than 40,000 cases with only 34 licensing officer positions      filled. By comparison, the Bureau of Industry and Security at      the Department of Commerce has far more staff to process far      fewer cases involving dual-use export licenses. Yet the      President's budget request for FY 2009 includes no funding      for additional staff at the Licensing Office at the      Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The Foreign Relations      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228)      authorized $10 million to be available in FY 2003 for DDTC      salaries and expenses. Six years later, the Administration's      request for FY 2009 is only $6.9 million. A doubling of that      figure is warranted, to ensure that DDTC has sufficient      funding to hire additional licensing officers.     Reconstruction and stabilization assistance       A priority for Senator Lugar and me continues to be to      significantly improve the U.S. civilian capacity to undertake      stabilization and reconstruction missions in countries that      are recovering from War or conflict. I am encouraged that the      President has requested $248 million for the Civilian      Stabilization Initiative (CSI), and I urge your Committee to      assume funding for this initiative. The request level for the      CSI would support a civilian active response corps of 250      personnel, a standby response corps of 2,000, and a civilian      reserve of 2,000 drawn from the general U.S. workforce. This      capacity is the core of legislation which Senator Lugar and I      have introduced in every Congress since the 108th Congress.      The Senate approved our bill in the 109th Congress and, with      strong support from the Administration, we are working for      enactment of the current version (S. 613).     Global health       Progress in the battle against HIV/AIDS constitutes one of      the leading accomplishments of this administration and U.S.      foreign policy in recent years, but the President's request      for global health funding, including HIV/AIDS, will fail to      build on those achievements. The request includes a very      small increase for HIV/AIDS funding overall, but it cuts      funding for the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS,      Tuberculosis, and Malaria by $340 million from the enacted      funding level for FY 2008, requesting only $200 million      within State and Foreign Operations and $300 million within      the Health and Human Services budget. In keeping with      Congress's strong support of the Global Fund, I urge that the      budget resolution assume additional funds for a U.S.      contribution that will be provided within the 150 account.      The President's budget request also significantly reduces      funding for Child Survival and Health, including a      substantial cut in bilateral funding to combat tuberculosis,      despite the fact that drug resistant strains of tuberculosis      are growing increasingly common and more dangerous.       Additionally, I would note that the authorization period      for the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS,      Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 will expire at the end      of FY 2008, unless extended by Congress. I believe that a      strong, bipartisan majority in Congress is committed to the      reauthorization of these important and successful programs. I      expect that the Committee will initiate and Congress will      pass reauthorization legislation. Therefore, the budget      resolution should assume the continuation and, I hope,      expansion of these programs.     International Violence Against Women       Current U.S. efforts to address violence against women are      well intentioned, but fragmented and piecemeal, and lack      systemic integration into current U.S. foreign assistance      programs. Our approach to this issue can, and needs to be,      more effective. Senator Lugar and I recently introduced      comprehensive legislation to address the issue, entitled the      International Violence Against Women Act (S. 2279). The bill      contains three primary components: First, it reorganizes and      rejuvenates the gender-related efforts of the State      Department by creating one central office, directed by a      Senate-confirmed Ambassador who reports directly to the      Secretary. The Coordinator will be charged with monitoring,      coordinating, and organizing all U.S. resources, programs and      aid abroad that deals with gender-based violence. Second, we      know that in humanitarian crises, conflict and post-conflict      environments, women and girls are even more vulnerable to      horrific acts of violence. The legislation requires training,      reporting mechanisms and other emergency measures for those      who are working directly with or protecting refugees and      other vulnerable populations. Finally, the Act mandates a 5-     year, comprehensive strategy, with coordinated programming,      to prevent and respond to violence against women in 10 to 20      targeted countries. The Act authorizes $175 million a year to      support programs to prevent and address violence. against      women in areas such as strengthening criminal and civil      justice systems, enhancing women's access to property and      inheritance rights, improving access to health care and      education, and supporting public awareness campaigns to      change social norms. I urge your support for the additional      funding contemplated by this bill.     Millennium Challenge Corporation       The President has requested $2.225 billion to fund the      Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in FY 2009, which is      significantly below the FY 2008 request of $3 billion. I      remain concerned about the lack of funds disbursed by MCC and      delays in implementing its Compacts. Of the nearly $7.6      billion appropriated to MCC since 2004, only $145 million has      been disbursed to date. At the same time, MCC enjoys the      continued support of the development community and represents      one of the few institutions in the U.S. Government dedicated      to providing longterm development funding. Given the slow      pace of disbursements, Congress has continued to reduce the      President's requests. This year, he has scaled back his      budget request to an appropriate level. Therefore, I      request the Committee assume MCC will receive its full      funding request.     Development Assistance funding       The President requests an increase in funding for the      Development Assistance account to over $1.6 billion,      reversing a declining trend in this account as well. I have      watched with increasing concern as the Administration has      diverted funds from the development assistance account to the      shorter-term Economic Support Funds. I believe adequately      funding both accounts is critical to supporting a multi-     faceted and balanced foreign policy. The programs supported      by Development Assistance funds--basic education, water and      sanitation, agriculture and trade capacity building--are      essential building blocks for developing countries. I support      the request level for this account.     Humanitarian assistance       I am concerned by the President's reduced request for      humanitarian assistance funding, especially funds for the      International Disaster and Famine Assistance account. The      Administration has conveyed that it intends to request      additional funds for this account through a budget      supplemental. I do not believe this represents the best      approach for dealing with emergencies as they arise. In each      of FY 2004 through FY 2007, the total appropriation for the      International Disaster and Famine Assistance account has      exceeded $500 million. There is little reason to expect this      year to be any different, yet the President's request stands      at $298 million. As a result, humanitarian agencies working      on the ground are forced to plan in a vacuum, leading to      lives lost and inefficient expenditure of taxpayer funds. I      believe it is much more sensible to fully fund these accounts      in the regular budget.     Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities       The President's request for Contributions for International      Peacekeeping Activities--the account through which we pay the      U.S. share of United Nations peacekeeping operations--     significantly underestimates the amount that we will be      required to pay for the United States' proportionate share of      assessments in 2009. The estimate of U.S. payments for fiscal      year 2008 was $2.3 billion; the budget request for fiscal      year 2009 is $1.5 billion. We know that the need for      peacekeepers in Africa alone is immense, and projected to      remain the same, if not grow. Darfur, Chad, and Somalia are      still in the grips of terrible conflicts. The Democratic      Republic of Congo, which has seen horrendous violence in      recent years and contains the largest of the U.N.      peacekeeping missions, may be on the verge of a breakthrough      toward genuine peace and needs a stable environment to      support such a breakthrough. The President's budget request,      however, would effectively cut funding for nearly all of the      U.N. peacekeeping operations from estimated 2008 levels, and      in particular a cut of $75 million for the Congo mission, a      $56 million cut for the mission in Liberia, and a cut of $39      million in the Cote d'Ivoire mission. No justification for      these reductions is provided in the budget request; the      budget resolution should assume that these projections are      inadequate.     Migration and Refugee Assistance       The request for $764 million for the Department of State's      Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account represents      deep cuts from the Fiscal Year 2008 appropriation of $1.023      billion. These cuts are most troubling at a time when      significant refugee crises     continue in nations such as Thailand and Chad. and where      refugees remain in camps for a decade or more in some regions      of the world. Of greater concern is that the President's      request makes these cuts following a year where up to two      million Iraqis have now sought refuge in neighboring      countries in the Middle East, millions more Iraqis are      internally displaced within Iraq, and at a time when the      world community is struggling to address the needs of these      populations. The budget resolution should assume a higher      level of funding, at least consistent with last year's level.     USAID operating expenses       The President reverses a declining trend of funding towards      USAID's operating expenses by increasing its FY 2009 funding      request to over $767 million. This will cover critical      salary, operational, administrative, IT and central support      costs. I believe it is a well-needed and much delayed step in      the right direction. In particular, this request will allow      the Agency to recruit, hire and train 300 new Foreign Service      Officers, barely covering attrition rates. We have asked the      Agency to expand its mission and operations into new theaters      like Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot expect it to achieve      U.S. foreign policy objectives if we do not provide      appropriate resources. I view this request as just the first      step in a comprehensive reform and overhaul of how USAID      operates.     State Department operations       The President has requested a 6.5 percent increase in the      operating budget of the Department of State. Much of this is      devoted to addressing personnel shortfalls and the need for      more officers trained in difficult languages. The lack of      experienced officers with adequate language skills in      languages such as Arabic or Chinese is well known. In      addition, several studies in the past few years--including by      the Government Accountability Office and the Center for      Strategic and International Studies--have noted that the      Department suffers from serious personnel shortages.      Altogether, the budget requests 1,543 new positions in the      Department, of which 448 would be funded by fees in the      Border Security program (i.e., visa and passport fees). I      support this increase in personnel.     Extension of Overseas Private Investment Corporation       The basic authorities of the Overseas Private Investment      Corporation (OPIC), set forth in Section 234(a), (b), and (c)      of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, expired at the end of      FY 2007, but have been extended by Congress to April 1. The      House has approved a four year reauthorization (H.R. 2798);      the Committee on Foreign Relations ordered reported a      substitute version of this bill on February 13. I believe a      majority of the Senate supports OPIC programs. Therefore, the      budget resolution should assume the continuation of OPIC      operations.     Direct spending       I request that the Committee provide the Committee on      Foreign Relations with a small allocation (not more than $10      million) for direct spending for Fiscal Year 2009. In recent      authorization legislation for the Department of State, the      Committee has approved provisions related to management and      personnel in the Department that have resulted in small      amounts of direct spending, though most of these provisions      affect direct spending and revenues by less than $500,000      annually.       I appreciate your consideration of these views and look      forward to working with you on the budget resolution.           Sincerely,                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.
