Mr. Speaker, on September 16, the European Court of Human Rights for the first time rules that the Government of Turkey must compensate Kurdish villagers whose houses had been destroyed by security forces. The Court found that the burning of homes violated European Human Rights Conventions. The Court also found that the Turkish Government had interfered with the applicants' right to appeal to the European Commission on Human Rights.  Mr. Speaker, presently, more than 150 cases involving more than 400 individuals have been submitted to the European Commission. These cases relate to the destruction of Kurdish villages, extra-judicial executions, disappearances, rape, and torture. Already, 56 such cases have been deemed admissible by the European Commission, and a handful have proceeded to the European Court.  Mr. Speaker, the sheer volume of cases brought against Turkey and declared admissible, as well as the circumstances surrounding each, leave little doubt that the Government of Turkey is not only conducting a violent campaign against its own citizens, but also trying to cover up its abuses with intimidation and propaganda. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki released a report which documented efforts by Turkish authorities to prevent individuals from pursuing cases at the European Commission and Court. The report referenced numerous incidents in which applicants, as well as their family members and lawyers, had faced harassment, torture and murder in attempts to prevent them from pursuing their cases.  Mr. Speaker, Turkish officials often recognize the European Court's jurisdiction and the right of Turkish citizens to appeal to the Court as proof of a commitment to human rights. Yet following this first ruling against Turkey, officials have called the ruling wrong and criticized the Court as being politically biased. Following a familiar pattern in which public proclamations bear little resemblance to actuality, other international human rights commitments are similarly dismissed when implementation would bring attention to serious abuses. Last July, at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Stockholm, members of the Turkish delegation agreed to invite an assembly delegation to Turkey. One week later, Turkey's Ambassador to the OSCE in Vienna stated that his government would not cooperate in issuing such an invitation. Not only has Turkey reneged on the OSCE invitation, efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] to discuss questions of access to conflict areas have also been rebuffed.  Mr. Speaker, the ruling by the European Court will surely be the first of many. The longer Turkish rulers refuse to acknowledge the true reality of the Kurdish situation the more all citizens will pay in precious blood and resources. Turkish economic and political development has been stunted by the crisis in southeast Turkey and its human dimension; 21,000 lives have been lost, 3,000 villages have been destroyed and approximately 3 million people forced from their homes in Kurdish regions by Turkish troops. And, despite what officials and their mouthpieces in the media claim, restrictions on free speech and the media persist. The U.S. Government should use every opportunity to press for real reform. If we want to fully develop a deep and lasting relationship with NATO ally Turkey, our policymakers must not continue to downplay human rights problems to advance economic and strategic interests.                          ____________________
