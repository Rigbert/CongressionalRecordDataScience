Chairman, I rise in support of the Rogan amendment to increase funding by $105 million for National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Science, Aeronautics, and Technology account. The appropriators made a good faith effort to restore cuts to the Space Science budget during the bill's consideration by the full committee, but they did not go far enough. More needs to be done, now and in conference.  Space Science has been the bright spot in NASA's research program. The space science community recognized the coming budget crunch years ago and enthusiastically embraced the ``faster, cheaper, better'' philosophy by doing business in a new way. The scientists and engineers who lead our space exploration efforts took on new technical challenges, applied more creative management techniques, and dramatically increased their productivity. This community is squeezing increased scientific and technical productivity out of every nickel. Who can forget Mars Pathfinder, which deposited a rover on the surface of Mars for one-fifth of the cost of previous Mars missions? In just the last few years, the space science community has cut the cost of spacecraft development by over 60 percent, reduced development time by 25 percent, and increased flight rate by 300 percent.  Mr. Chairman, space science is an example of good government and good science. It's also the kind of good government that we need to encourage by showing NASA's other enterprises and the rest of the federal bureaucracy that success is rewarded, not punished. As passed by Committee, the appropriations bill sends the wrong signal and makes the wrong kinds of cuts. The amendment corrects that oversight by transferring funds from a poorly-performing agency to a well-run scientific enterprise. It's an amendment we should all embrace.
