Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  What he is doing is locking in our strategic force levels, and the fact is that the armed services bill is not yet done as far as authorization, and, essentially, the gentleman is saying that we should have 430 silos. The gentleman may be correct. Maybe we need 425 silos or maybe we need 218 silos. I don't think we should prejudge that final figure until the authorization legislation is completed.  I certainly think, again, that it is limiting our options. I think any time we limit our defense options going forward that it is not good policy, and, therefore, I strongly object to the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
