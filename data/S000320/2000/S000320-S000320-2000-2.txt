 The House and Senate intelligence committees agreed to combine the working groups for both the Nazi and Japanese Imperial Government declassifications in order to obtain economies of scale from both a substantive and financial perspective. However, the requirements set forth in the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act in no way impact on the requirements set forth in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.  Mr. DeWINE. It is my assessment that title VIII does not change any of the provisions in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that govern the declassification of records required under that Act, most notably but not limited to Nazi war crimes committed in the European theater of war, including Northern Africa. Therefore, title VIII refers only to activities exclusively of the Japanese Imperial Government and does not attempt to change any procedures relating to the declassification of all records under section 3(a)(1) and (2) of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.
