It talks about sound investments. I will read portions of it very briefly here. It talks about how the rate of economic growth in Germany is surpassing our own just now, and the unemployment rate as a result has dropped to 5.3 percent, and falling further--much lower than in the United States. It investigates why that is the case. It talks quite a bit here about the German economy having made investments whose future benefits will far outweigh repayment costs. This bill and its accounts, essentially, should be doing that; but, unfortunately, it cuts back on some of the most significant job growth.  The article goes on to say that the U.S. economy is still in doldrums. And that's because many of the needed workers and machines are now idle. If the country waits, it will need to bid them away from other tasks. Also, because of the sluggish economy, the materials required for the work are now relatively inexpensive. So this is really the time to encourage investment in our economy to lift the entire system.  The article goes on to talk about the fact that in Germany there had been certain austerity backers, they call them, and it says:       Now austerity backers urge--preposterously--that      infrastructure repairs be postponed until government budgets      are in balance. But would they also tell an indebted family      to postpone fixing a leaky roof until it paid off all of its      debts? Not only would the repair grow more costly with the      delay, but the water damage would mount in the interim.      Families should pay off debts, yes, but not in ways that      actually increase their indebtedness in the longer term.  I found this article particularly instructive as we move amendments to the floor and move this bill forward.  In the article it says:       Austerity advocates object that more deficit spending now      will burden grandchildren with crushing debt. That might be      true if the proposal were to build bigger houses and stage      more lavish parties with borrowed money.  But, in fact, the dollars were being invested in the nation in projects that were creating opportunity and infrastructure that would advance the worth of the nation in decades hence.                              {time}  1430  So I think that we ought to think about this as we proceed title by title in this bill and ask ourselves the question why it is that many of the important accounts, such as the Corps of Engineers--and several of our speakers today have referenced those--has been cut by $104 million compared to this year's enacted level and falls far short of the investments that we need in one of the fundamentals in the country, and that is in water systems.  Madam Chair, I will place this article in the Record from the International Herald Tribune.  I also want to point out and place in the Record some of the severe cutbacks in this bill with more specificity:  The Renewable Energy, Energy Reliability, and Efficiency account is $971 million less than the 2013 enacted level and $1.96 billion less than the President's request;  The Department of Energy Office of Science is $223 million less than 2013's enacted level and $499.8 million less than the President's request;  The Advanced Research Projects Agency is $215 million less than the 2013 enacted level and $329 million less than the President's request;  The funding for environmental cleanup is $243 million less than the 2013 enacted level and $133 million less than the President's request;  The Nuclear Nonproliferation account is $334 million less than the 2013 enacted level and $40 million less than the President's request;  In terms of the Army Corps of Engineers, it is $104 million less than the 2013 enacted level;  In the water resources projects within the Department of the Interior, there is a $104 million reduction less than the 2013 enacted level and $85 million less than the President's request.  So when we think about the cumulative impact of it, it is just extraordinary. And I will place this data in the Record as well.  I yield back the balance of my time.    [From the Global Edition of the New York Times, July 6-7, 2013]                    When Debt Is a Sound Investment                          (By Robert H. Frank)       I recently spent a week in Berlin, where the entire city      seemed under construction. In every direction, cranes and      other heavy equipment dominated the landscape. Although many      projects are in the private sector, innumerable others--     including bridge and highway repairs, new subway stations,      and other infrastructure work are financed by taxpayers.       But wait. Hasn't Germany been one of the most outspoken      advocates of fiscal austerity after the financial crisis?      Yes, and that's not a contradiction. Fiscally responsible      businesses routinely borrow to invest, and, until recently,      so did most governments.       Lately, however, fears about growing government debt have      caused wholesale cuts in U.S. public investment. The Germans,      of course, yield to no one in their distaste for      indebtedness. But they also understand the distinction      between consumption and investment. By borrowing, they have      made investments whose future benefits will far outweigh      repayment costs. There's nothing foolhardy about that.       The German experience suggests how Americans might move      past the stalled debate about economic stimulus policy. In      the aftermath of the financial crisis, the policy discussion      began with economists in broad agreement that unemployment      remained high because total spending was too low. Keynesian      stimulus proponents argued that temporary tax cuts and      additional government spending would bolster hiring.      Austerity advocates countered that additional government      spending would merely displace private spending and that      Americans already had too much debt in any event. And the      debate has languished there.       A preponderance of evidence suggests that Keynes was right.      But as the German experience illustrates, progress is      possible without settling that question. The Germans are      investing in infrastructure, not to provide short-term      economic stimulus, but because those investments promise high      returns. Yet their undeniable side effect has been to bolster      employment substantially in the short run.       Not all German public investments have met expectations.      Berlin's new consolidated airport, for example, has      experienced several delays and cost overruns, and parts of      the city's recently constructed central rail station will be      closed this autumn for major repairs. But private investment      projects undergo occasional setbacks, too, and no one argues      that businesses should stop investing on that account.       The Germans didn't become bogged down in a debate over      stimulus policy, and they didn't explicitly portray their      infrastructure push as stimulus. But that didn't hamper their      strategy's remarkable effectiveness at putting people to      work. The unemployment rate in Germany, at 5.3 percent and      falling, is now substantially lower than that in the United      States, where it ticked up to 7.6 percent in May and held      there in June. (By contrast, in March 2007, before the      financial crisis, the rate in Germany was 9.2 percent, about      five percentage points higher than what it had been in the      United States.)       A prudent investment is one whose future returns exceed its      costs--includIng interest costs, if the money is borrowed.      Opportunities meeting that standard abound in the      infrastructure domain. According to the American Society of      Civil Engineers, the United States has a backlog of about      $3.6 trillion in overdue infrastructure maintenance. No one      in Congress seriously proposes that the country just abandon      crumbling roads and bridges, and everyone agrees that the      repair cost will grow sharply the longer we wait.       The case for accelerated infrastructure investment becomes      more compelling with the U.S. economy still in the doldrums.      That is because many of the needed workers and machines are      now idle. If the country waits, it will need to bid them away      from other tasks. Also because of the sluggish economy, the      materials required for the work are now relatively      inexpensive. If the country waits, they will cost more. And      long-term interest rates for the money to pay for the work      continue to hover near record lows. They, too, will be higher      if the country waits.       Austerity advocates object that more deficit spending now      will burden grandchildren with crushing debt. That might be      true if the proposal were to build bigger houses and stage      more lavish parties with borrowed money--as Americans, in      fact, were doing in the first half of the past decade. But      the objection makes no sense when applied to long-overdue      infrastructure repairs. A failure to undertake that spending      will gratuitously burden the country's grandchildren.       In 2009, austerity proponents in the United States argued      against stimulus, predicting that the economy would recover      quickly and spontaneously. It didn't. Later, they said the      country tried stimulus and it didn't work. But in the face of      a projected $2 trillion shortfall in the spending needed for      full employment, Congress enacted a stimulus bill totaling      only $787 billion, spread over three years. And much of that      injection was offset by cuts in state and local government      spending.       Now austerity backers urge--preposterously--that      infrastructure repairs be postponed until government budgets      are in balance. But would they also tell an indebted family      to postpone fixing a leaky roof until it paid off all its      debts? Not only would the repair grow more costly with the      delay, but the water damage would mount in the interim.      Families should pay off debts, yes, but not in ways that      actually increase their indebtedness in the longer term.       Austerity advocates, who have been wrong at virtually every      turn, are unlikely to change their minds about stimulus      policy. But with continued slow growth in the outlook, it's      time to re-frame the debate. The best available option, by      far, is to rebuild tattered infrastructure at fire-sale      prices. If the austerity crowd disagrees, it should explain      why in plain English.          Highlights of 2014 Energy & Water Appropriations Act       2014 mark: $30.426 billion.       2014 budget request: $34.483 billion.       2013 enacted (including Sandy reconstruction): $36.744      billion.       2013 enacted (excluding Sandy reconstruction): $33.240      billion.       The 2014 Energy & Water Appropriations Act would provide:       $982.6 million for Renewable Energy, Energy Reliability,      and Efficiency (not including a $157 million rescission to      2013 funding), which is $971 million less than the 2013      enacted level and $1.96 billion less than the President's      request for the same activities.       $4.653 billion for the Department of Energy Office of      Science, which is $223 million less than the 2013 enacted      level and $499.8 million less than the President's request.       $50 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency--     Energy (ARPA--E), which is $215 million less than the 2013      enacted level and $329 million less than the President's      request.       $5.5 billion for environmental cleanup activities, which is      $243 million less than the 2013 enacted level and $133      million less than the President's request.       $7.675 billion for Weapons Activities (not including a $142      million rescission), which is $97.7 million more than the      2013 enacted level and $193.4 million less than the      President's request.       $2.1 billion for Nuclear Nonproliferation (not including a      $20 million rescission), which is $334 million less than the      2013 enacted level and $40 million less than the     President's request. The House bill also includes $245      million in activities previously appropriated within the      weapons account, as requested by the Administration.       $1.109 billion for Naval Reactors, which is $29 million      more than the 2013 enacted level and $137.1 million less than      the President's request.       $4.876 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers (not      including a $200 million rescission), which is $104 million      less than the 2013 enacted level and $50 million more than      the President's request.       $965 million for water resources projects within the      Department of Interior, which is $104 million less than the      2013 enacted level and $85 million less than the President's      request.            Sequestration Impact on Energy & Water Accounts       This bill fails to address the sequester, ensuring it will      harm our ability to meet energy and water needs next year, on      top of the following impacts that are already taking hold.       Forgone hiring by Department of Energy of 300 full-time      employees; reduced contractor labor by estimated 1,200      employee-years through furloughs, layoffs, and hiring      deferrals; furlough of approximately 60 employee-years      affecting approximately 3,600 contractor employees; and      layoff or voluntary separation of more than 300 contractor      employees.       Severe cuts to renewable energy and efficiency research,      including $16 million from advanced vehicle technologies, $14      million from solar energy, $10 million from biofuels, $5      million from wind, $3 million from hydropower, $3 million      from weatherization assistance, and $5 million from      electrical grid modernization.       Cuts to Office of Science delaying or cancelling laboratory      construction, maintenance, and upgrades; and reducing math,      computing, physics, atmospheric, and cytogenics research at      labs and universities around the country.       Cuts to Environmental Management resulting in furloughs,      terminated activity and forgone work at Hanford Site (WA),      Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation (TN),      Savannah River Site (GA), and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant      (NM).
