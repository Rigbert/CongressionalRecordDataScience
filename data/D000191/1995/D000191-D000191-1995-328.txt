  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that we can have two standards for speech, I do not believe that we can change the precedents and the rules of the House arbitrarily, and certainly in this Chamber we should not abridge the first amendment.       I just want to comment that I am not sure that most of our      Members and most of the public can appreciate how serious a      violation we think the Speaker has engaged in and how deeply      we take this issue.       There are, I think, two different areas we have to look at      to understand why we would charge this as a total betrayal of      trust. Whether it is a total betrayal of trust because of his      lack of judgment, or whether it is a total betrayal of trust      because of deliberate actions I do not think we know yet.  Those are the words of now-Speaker Gingrich regarding Speaker Wright on the floor of the House. He went on further to call Speaker Wright a collaborator and a quizzling, and all of these words were spoken after the ruling quoted by the Chair of June 15, 1988.                          ____________________
