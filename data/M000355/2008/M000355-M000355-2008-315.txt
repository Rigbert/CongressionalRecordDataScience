 President, today I rise to recognize a very special individual from my home State of Kentucky, Mr. Robley Rex. Earlier this month, Mr. Rex celebrated his 107th birthday. To live 107 years in and of itself is an achievement by anyone's standard. In the case of Robley Rex, those 107 years have been especially full of accomplishment and patriotic service. He has filled his lifetime with loyal service to our Nation's Armed Forces, to the U.S. Postal Department, to local businesses, to the Methodist ministries and, perhaps most importantly, to his family and his fellow veterans.  Robley Rex was born in Hopkinsville, KY 1901. Upon turning 18, be enlisted in the U.S. Army and proudly served our Nation. He returned to Kentucky after serving with 5th Infantry in Germany in 1922. Mr. Rex then joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, and married Ms. Grace Bivens. He held jobs with local Kentucky businesses before beginning his career as a U.S. Postal Department railroad mail clerk. At the spry, young age of 86, Robley Rex began volunteering through the VFW and was honored by the group for having performed more than 13,600 hours of service over a 20-year period. He also volunteered his time at the VA Medical Center in Louisville, KY, helping the hospital staff and inspiring the patients and their families. He also found time to become an expert in proper flag etiquette. Mr. President, I don't know I anyone who knows more about how to properly care for an American flag than Mr. Rex.  I am proud to represent such a remarkable model of honor and duty and I am pleased to have the opportunity to recognize Robley Rex in front of this distinguished body. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his continued service to our Nation and to Kentucky, and to wish him all the best on his 107th birthday and in the future.                          ____________________
