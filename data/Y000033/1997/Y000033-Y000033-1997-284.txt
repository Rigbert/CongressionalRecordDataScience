Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing the New Wildlife Refuge Reauthorization Act of 1997.  By way of background, our National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of 91.7 million acres of Federal lands that provide essential habitat for hundreds of species and offer recreational opportunities for millions of Americans.  The first wildlife refuge at Pelican Island, FL, was created in 1903 when President Theodore Roosevelt signed an Executive order setting aside three acres of land as a preserve and breeding grounds for native birds. Today, the system has 511 refuges, which are located in all 50 States and 5 territories. These units range in size from the smallest of less than 1 acre at Mille Lacs National Wildlife Refuge in Minnesota, to the largest of 19.3 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. In the last decade, more than 80 new refuges have been added to the system.  The vast majority of our Nation's 511 refuge units were created administratively. In fact, less than 70 refuges have been designated by Congress. The authorizing committees, therefore, have had little, if any, input in the establishment of the other 460 refuges, which include the 192,493-acre Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, the 254,400-acre Hawaiian Island National Wildlife Refuge, and the 572,000-acre Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada. These Executive orders have set aside a huge amount of privately owned lands.  Under current law, funding for refuge acquisitions comes from two primary sources: No. 1, annual appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF], and No. 2, the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, which is financed from the purchase of a yearly duck stamp and refuge entrance fees.  In the past, more than $1 billion in taxpayer money has been appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to acquire lands that become additions to existing units or entirely new wildlife refuges. This represents a substantial expenditure of money by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] without adequate input by Congress.  By contrast, the Migratory Bird Commission, whose membership includes four bipartisan Members of Congress, regularly meets to evaluate and decide how Migratory Bird Conservation Fund will be spent. Under normal conditions, a Governor of a State, after consulting with local citizens, will recommend that a new refuge be created or that additional land be added to the system. It is a process that has worked effectively for a number of years.  Regrettably, the checks and balances that exist on the uses of the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund simply do not exist in the allocation of money from the LWCF. Therefore, lacking such a review mechanism, we have a responsibility to carefully examine the recommendations of the USFWS and, if we so choose, to legislatively create any new wildlife refuge using LWCF money in the future. This is an essential change.  Under the terms of the New Wildlife Refuge Reauthorization Act, no funds could be expended from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to create a new refuge without prior congressional authorization. This bill does not affect any land additions to the existing 511 wildlife refuges or those created with money from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund.  Mr. Speaker, Congress must have a more meaningful role in the acquisition of hundreds of acres of new Federal lands. We should authorize new wildlife refuges just as we authorize new flood control projects, highways, national parks, scenic rivers, and weapons systems. After all, we are talking about the expenditure of millions of taxpayers dollars. Furthermore, at a time when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a $440 million backlog of unfinished wildlife refuge maintenance projects, a comprehensive review of the service's priorities is appropriate.  I urge the adoption of the New Wildlife Refuge Authorization Act and want to thank our distinguished colleague from California, Richard Pombo, for his leadership in this important effort. By enacting this legislation, we will ensure that private property owners and their tax dollars are more adequately protected in the future.                          ____________________
