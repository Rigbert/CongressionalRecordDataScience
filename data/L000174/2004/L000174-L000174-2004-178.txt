His record is too extreme.  If you watch what the Bush administration does, instead of just listening to what it says, there is much evidence of this administration's outright contempt for high environmental standards. This nomination, in itself, says something about that. This nomination is emblematic of so many of this administration's appointments, especially to sensitive environmental posts. Mr. Myers' Interior appointment was the first ``swoosh'' of the revolving door. His nomination by President Bush to one of the highest courts in the land completes the cycle.  I must oppose cloture on this nomination, and I hope that the Senate's vote today will say something about the higher priority that the Senate makes of environmental quality.
