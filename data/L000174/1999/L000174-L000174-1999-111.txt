President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli in offering the ``Nursing Home Patients Protection Act'' to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. Our amendment protects nursing home patients in a business liquidation in three fundamental areas: patient privacy, patient rights and prompt transfers to new facilities.                            Patient privacy  First of all, our amendment ensures patient privacy when a hospital, nursing home, HMO or other institution holding medical records is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding that leads to liquidation. Medical privacy is an issue very important to me, and ensuring that the confidentiality of patients records is maintained should be of paramount importance.                       Defending Patients Rights  We have ensured that patients rights are defended as well. Cost cutting is always an issue in the health care system and that can translate into lower patient care quality--a fear to all health care patients. Our amendment establishes an ombudsman to provide a voice for all health care patients, making sure that judges are aware of all the facts in balancing the interests between the creditor and the patients.                       New Nursing Home Transfer  Finally, our amendment requires that the bankruptcy trustee make all reasonable efforts to transfer all of the bankrupt nursing home's patients to a nearby health care business. The prompt transferring of patients to a new health care facility must be addressed properly during a business liquidation under our legislation.  Mr. President, in my home State of Vermont, two nursing homes in Burlington recently made news due to a bankruptcy proceeding. Birchwood Terrace Healthcare and the Staff Farm Nursing Center are two very excellent nursing home facilities. Each has a corporate connection to the Vencor Corporation, a nationwide healthcare and nursing home provider that recently filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. While Vencor has pledged these Vermont nursing homes will not be affected by its plans to reorganize while in bankruptcy, I am sure that many Vermonters are alarmed at the prospect of a nursing home with their loved ones filing for bankruptcy. Our amendment should reassure Vermonters that even if a nursing home files for business liquidation under our bankruptcy laws, their loved ones will be protected.  I have been working on the overall issue of medical privacy for many years and I am particularly pleased that our amendment adds new protections for patient medical records for nursing homes in bankruptcy liquidation.  Of course, in the best case scenario any institution holding patient health care records would continue to follow applicable state or federal law requiring proper storage and safeguards. The fact is, however, under current law during a business liquidation an individual would have to wait until there has been a serious breach of their privacy rights before anyone stepped in to ensure that patient privacy is protected. Under current law it is questionable what protection these most sensitive personal records would have during a liquidation.  The reality of this situation and the practical questions of what recourse an individual would have if their personal medical records were not properly safeguarded against a business that is going out of business makes this provision essential. Our legislation would set in law the procedure that an institution holding medical records would have to follow during a liquidation proceeding.  The bottom line is that we do not want to have to wait until there has been a breach of privacy before steps are taken to protect patient privacy. Once privacy is breached--there is nothing one can really do to give that back to an individual.  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to make sure that nursing home patients privacy and rights are protected during a bankruptcy proceeding.
