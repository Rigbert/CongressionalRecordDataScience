 President, I thank Senator Kyl for those remarks. One of the great treats of my tenure in the Senate, I guess now 9\1/2\ years, has been to work with him. I do not think we have ever had a cross word between us. It has been a wonderful working relationship. I am very grateful for it. When we can work across the aisle the way we have worked, we can be much more productive. So I thank the Senator from Arizona for his work. He is a great ranking member. He was a great chairman of the committee. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I thank him for his work on this bill. I also thank his staff.  I wish to comment about my staff also. She is LaVita Strickland sitting to my right. She is a Judiciary counsel. She is very mild mannered, but she has been very tenacious in the pursuit of the consideration of this bill and has become very forceful. LaVita is enormously talented. I am very proud of her. I thank her for many hours of hard work. I think we have a good product. Thank you very much, LaVita.  I see the Senator from Kansas, the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee, has come to the Chamber. I wish to turn this over to him and also thank him for his cooperation. Senator Kyl and I sat down with Senators Kennedy and Brownback and had some good discussions and were able to put this together. Our respective staffs followed up.  I am very grateful to him for his cooperation and leadership as well.  I yield the floor.
