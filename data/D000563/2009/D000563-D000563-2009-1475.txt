President, strong leadership at the Department of Labor is essential as the economy continues to worsen.  Workers who are struggling need leaders who have been there, who know what it is like to grow up in a working class household. Hilda Solis is the right person to run the most important federal agency for workers who need a helping hand. I strongly support her nomination.  Congresswoman Solis grew up in southern California and has for decades fought for the rights of working men and women.  While a member of the California State Senate she led the fight in 1996 to increase the State minimum wage.  Since her election to Congress in 2000, she has cochaired the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues and played a key role in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2006.  Last year she helped lead the effort to provide workforce training for ``green collar'' jobs.  She is also a nationally recognized leader on the environment, and for that she became the first woman to receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2000.  Congresswoman Solis has articulated a strong vision for the Department. She is ready to lead the Department's efforts in: training and job placement for unemployed workers; building career ladders for at-risk youth, and expanding opportunities for our military heroes returning from combat.  Over 2.6 million workers have lost their jobs since this recession began, and the end is not yet in sight.  America needs an active Department of Labor to help these workers retrain for the economy of the 21st century and find new work.  America needs Hilda Solis to take charge of the Labor Department and to get to work today.  I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.                          ____________________
