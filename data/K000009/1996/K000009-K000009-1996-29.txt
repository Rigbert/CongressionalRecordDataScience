Speaker, today the House Committee on Ways and Means will vote to renew Chinese most-favored-nation status, which means our country will again grant China the same privileges in our market as we do to democratic states like England.  As the committee casts its vote, may I remind my esteemed colleagues of the Golden Rule: Free trade can only occur among free people. By any measure, China is not a nation of free people. Let me read from Amnesty International's report on China, and I quote: ``Torture remains endemic, causingmany deaths each year. The death penalty is used extensively and arbitrarily to instill fear. More people are executed every year in China than in all other countries combined.'' The list goes on and on: Forced abortions, repression of ethnic and religious groups, thousands of democracy activists jailed every year.  Given China's lack of basic human freedoms, it should come as no surprise that China does not have a free market. China remains one of the most closed markets in the world. Why should we be giving special privileges to the butchers of Beijing?                          ____________________
