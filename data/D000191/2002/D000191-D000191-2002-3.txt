Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time only to thank not only my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), but also my colleague, the gentlewoman from Toledo, Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), for being here this evening.  Mr. Speaker, I think all Members would recognize that the mark of a Member is that it is easy to be elected if you are a Republican from a safe Republican seat; it is easy to be elected as a Democrat if you come from a safe Democratic seat. But Tony Hall's seat was marginally Republican, and the people continued to elect him and reelect him because of his outstanding work not only for his community but the Nation and the world.
