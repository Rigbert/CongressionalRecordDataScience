Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Oklahoma for bringing this resolution before us.  The church has long been the heartbeat, they very soul of the black community. In the 1960's, those who opposed the civil rights movement recognized that strength. Our churches were burned. looted and burned. Our holy places were no longer a place of sanctuary but a target of those who preached hate, division and intolerance. Today, despite the progress we made as a Nation and as a people, history is repeating itself. In the ashes, of these churches are the hopes and dreams of the African-American community, justice, equality and simple acceptance. The fires that destroyed these churches are fueled not only by gasoline and matches but also by hated and intolerance and bigotry. There is a conspiracy, a conspiracy of intolerance.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues tonight to vote for this resolution and send a strong message to this Nation that we will build a sense of community. Let us use this occasion, let us use this resolution not to divide but to bring together. Bring us all together, not to tear down but to uplift. Let us speak tonight with one mighty voice. We must use our outrage to rededicate ourselves to building Dr. King's beloved community, a Nation in which we all are judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.
