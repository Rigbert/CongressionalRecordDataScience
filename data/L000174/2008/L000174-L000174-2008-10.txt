President, I yield to no one in my support of the freedoms set out in the first amendment to the Constitution, and I have devoted considerable time and energy to their protection and preservation. On October 21, 2008, I enjoyed a very special evening honoring Peter Chernin, the CEO of Fox News, and a man who shares my belief in the need to vigorously defend the first amendment. That night, I congratulated Peter on receiving the Media Institute's First Amendment Award, an award that he richly deserved for his stand against rigid and unyielding application of so-called indecency rules at the Federal Communications Commission. I believe that his words in defense of the first amendment should be heard and heeded by all Americans, not just by those who were fortunate enough to attend that event.  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Peter Chernin from October 21, 2008, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Politics, Indecency, and the First Amendment       Thank you so much for that introduction, Senator Leahy.      Your strong and unambiguous support for the First Amendment      is legendary on Capitol Hill, and I could not be more pleased      to have you, a former recipient of this award, as my      presenter tonight. And thank you to the Media Institute for      bestowing this honor on me. As the head of a media company, I      am at times painfully aware of how important the First      Amendment is to our ability to create thought-provoking and      controversial content. And as a citizen of this country, I am      thankful every day for the freedoms that we too often take      for granted: the freedom to speak freely, the freedom to      pursue our religious beliefs without persecution, and the      freedom of the press to criticize our government.       We live in a pluralistic society. One where diversity      rules, where disagreement is a constant, and where there is      more than one right answer for every question. It's messy.      And for creators of content, if we're doing our jobs right,      we sometimes offend people. It's that simple. And, believe      me, we wrestle with that fact. We struggle with complex      issues every day. Are we guilty of contributing to the      vulgarization of our society or simply of mirroring it? Is it      our responsibility to be the arbiters of good taste, or is it      our duty to push boundaries? Is it even possible to create      innovative programming for a mass audience that is diverse on      every level--from age, to religious affiliation, to      ethnicity?       We don't take these issues lightly. We are constantly      thinking about the important role we play in shaping our      culture. Whether we're creating television shows, making      films, or working at a newspaper or publishing house.      Certainly, we must entertain, we must inform and we must      provoke. But, at the same time, we must take very seriously      the power we have to affect millions through our work. That's      why we stress the importance of individual editorial      responsibility across all of our businesses. But, yes,      sometimes we do make mistakes. Everyone does. The      alternative? Well, it's chilling. If the media is ruled by      fear of crossing an ambiguous line, our product will be less      vital and more homogenous. Our ability to create news and      entertainment that is thoughtful, provocative, and accurately      reflects our society will be compromised. And Americans will      have far fewer choices. That's why it's so critical that we      don't chip away at the First Amendment until it becomes      toothless. It must remain absolute in its protections.       Two weeks from today the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing      arguments in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, the first      indecency case it has heard since the ``7 Dirty Words'' case      was decided in 1978. At issue is whether Fox violated the      indecency law when it aired two live award programs in which      actresses blurted out one or two so-called ``fleeting      expletives.'' While a case with Cher and Nicole Richie at its      center is probably not one we would have chosen to argue      before the Supreme Court, the truth is, we don't get to     pick our cases. In fact, if anyone had told me that my      company would be before the U.S. Supreme Court defending      inane comments by Cher and Nicole Ritchie, I would have      said you're crazy. But I would contend that the nature of      this speech, and who said it, makes absolutely no      difference. Because at the core of this case is an      absolute threat to the First Amendment. It hinges on      utterances that were unscripted on live television. If we      are found in violation, just think about the radical      ramifications for live programming--from news, to      politics, to sports. In fact, to every live broadcast      television event. The effect would be appalling.       There is a certain symmetry to the fact that the oral      argument in this case and the election of the 44th President      of the United States are taking place on the same day: The      Fox case, if successful, is an affirmation of the First      Amendment. The election is an affirmation of our democratic      process. And the two are inextricably intertwined. The First      Amendment is central to our democratic process because it      ensures a full and open dialogue about the candidates for      office. Without the First Amendment, our democracy could not      be sustained.       But the truth is, people don't think about defending      broadcasters' right to utter expletives in the same way they      think about defending one's right to speak critically of our      government. But they should. The First Amendment is at stake      in both cases. As a media company, we have not just a right      but a responsibility to stand up to the government when it      crosses that First Amendment line in the sand--even if the      content we are defending is in bad taste. And in the      indecency context, that line has not only been crossed, it      has been obliterated. That is why Fox is fighting the FCC in      this and several other indecency cases.       I'll admit: some of the content we are defending is not      particularly tasteful: the expletives, the brief nudity, the      carefully placed whipped cream and, of course, the pixels. I      would not have allowed my own children, when they were      younger, to watch some of these shows. But, I vow to fight to      the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial,      offensive, and even tasteless content on the air.       Why? Because, if the government gets its foot in the      censorship door with respect to unpopular entertainment      content, it is the beginning of the steep slide toward      censoring unpopular political content. And we have seen the      beginnings of this downward slide in a recent case where the      FCC initially found indecent content in a news program. If we      allow our government to intrude into the creative process to      censor the ``bad words'' at issue in the Fox case, I am      afraid we will soon reach the bottom of the slide--to      America's detriment.       Groups that claim to be interested in ``protecting      children'' are helping the government along in its attempts      to censor television. While I don't agree with these groups,      I do fully support their right to criticize what's on      television. But the job of protecting children is far too      important to leave to government bureaucrats or so-called      public interest groups. The job of protecting children lies      with parents. The job of the government is to resist the      views of interest groups with particular agendas and instead      to enforce the law in a way that is consistent, fair, and      constitutional. So I don't blame these groups for the      degradation of the First Amendment. I blame our government,      which has succumbed to the views of a particularly vocal      minority.       Look, I am not insensitive to the fact that young children      need to be protected. And that's difficult in an era of      single parent, or two working parent households. But the      protection of children must be considered in a Twenty-First      Century light. Nearly every TV set sold today includes a V-     Chip, which allows parents to block content they think may be      inappropriate for their children. Cable, satellite, and telco      video providers have finely-tuned, comprehensive parental      controls. And let's not forget the most powerful technology      available to parents: the on-off switch. These tools allow      adults to protect their kids while still being able to access      shows they love.       We as media companies also have a responsibility: to rate      shows accurately and consistently so the V-Chip works as it      should. And, as I said earlier, we need to be responsible      with our creative output. This is something we do on a daily      basis through our Standards and Practices departments, not      only by exercising editorial judgment but by constantly fine-     tuning and improving our internal controls.       Let's step back for a minute and get some perspective on      this issue. The indecency law applies only to broadcast TV:      that's a handful of channels. Over 85 percent of the country      receives their broadcast channels through a cable, telco      line, or satellite signal. Sitting right next to the      broadcast channels on these multichannel systems are hundreds      of other channels that are not subject to the indecency law.       And those other channels are just a click away on the      remote control. Nor does the indecency law apply to video-on-     demand, pay per view, DVDs, or the mother of all content      providers: the Internet. Does it really make sense to      continue government censorship of the occasional bad word,      brief nudity, or sexual innuendo on a handful of broadcast      channels when we live in an environment of infinitely      unregulated choices? In the media-rich world we live in,      singling out a few channels for indecency enforcement is not      legally sustainable.       Quite simply, it is time for the government to get out of      the business of regulating ``indecent'' speech on broadcast      TV. The threat it poses to core First Amendment values cannot      be justified in our technologically diverse world. Parents      have the tools to decide what is appropriate for their      children. Let's let parents do their job and fire the      government from the job of censoring speech. The First      Amendment is too important to our democratic society--in this      and future elections--to allow any encroachments to threaten      our country's critical freedoms.       Thank you.                          ____________________
