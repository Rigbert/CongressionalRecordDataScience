 President, we will vote on this shortly. I believe it is one of the most important issues that is before us, and I urge its adoption.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that material regarding class size reduction be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Why is Class Size Reduction so Important?                           what students say  Christopher Shim, 17 years old, Mercer Island High School: ``In elementary school, I actually feel I was pretty lucky. I was able to get personal time with the teacher, even though we had 30-35 students in my elementary classrooms.''  Chris continues: ``In high school, I have 40 people in my calculus class. This means anytime I have a question, there are 10 people in line.''  Ahmad Javid (A.J.) Aaf, 15 years old, Tahoma High School, Maple Valley, Washington: ``Kids need more attention--personal attention for students is important.''  Antonella Novi, 18 years old. Anacortes High School, Anacortes, Washington: ``In elementary school or high school, class size is really important. Because interpersonal relationships among students are important, and being able to talk to the teacher is important. Closeness leads to comfort--if you ask teachers about school, then you can ask teachers about things outside the classroom. It's easier to go to teachers you know.''  Antonella continues: ``In high school civics class, there is only one teacher, teaching two classes of 40 students each. It's harder to get through the curriculum, and to get answers to your questions.  ``When I was younger, I went to school in California. We were in one school building when I started, but by the time I left, the building was surrounded by portables.  ``I always got my questions answered by the teachers. I spoke up; I asked questions. But there were lots of kids who were quiet, who didn't get the attention they needed from teacher.  ``In smaller classes its easier to relate to your peers. You get to know each other better. In large classes, if you don't like talking in front of large groups, you're out of luck.''  Devone Van Dyne (female), 16 years old, University High School, Spokane, Washington: ``Class size is really, important. For example, my high school chemistry class has almost 40 students. It's hard to get individual help; lectures alone don't work. If there were fewer students, we could get the kind of help we need.  ``I have trouble keeping up--it's easier to fall behind in a large class. You don't feel the same investment. I have to make sure and find the time outside class to meet with the teacher.''  Amber Casali, 16 years old, and Rebecca Dean 15 years old, Shorecrest High School, Seattle, Washington: ``In elementary school, the benefits of having smaller class size include getting more attention from teachers. You can do more activities, and fewer lectures. You can plan, and work more cohesively as a class. Especially for the early grades 1-3, smaller class sizes are very important. It's so important to start early. Students can develop good working skills, and get more attention from the teacher early on, when it counts the most.''                                                                    ____Statement by Sandra Feldman, President, American Federation of Teachers                         On Reducing Class Sizes       Modern schools and more well-trained teachers are the right      antidote for the overcrowding that plagues too many American      schools. Research shows that youngsters, especially in the      early grades, perform better in smaller classes that allow      for greater one-on-one instruction. Smaller classes also help      teachers maintain discipline. Parents and teachers understand      this well, and that's why Senator Murray is absolutely      correct in supporting the President's proposal to provide      subsidies for school construction and to emphasize teacher      recruitment.       Several new studies clearly demonstrate the link between      reduced class sizes and improved academic achievement. A      sampling:       STAR, the highly reputed Tennessee class-size study,      analyzed the achievement levels of K-3 students randomly      assigned to classes of 13 to 17. Those in small classes did      much better than students in regular classes in math and      reading, every year and in all grades. The small classes made      the biggest difference in the scores of children in inner-     city schools.       SAGE, a Wisconsin program begun in 1996-97, reduces class      size for K-3 children in certain high-poverty schools. At the      end of the first year, SAGE kids had made significantly      greater improvements in reading, language arts, and math than      children had in similar schools.                                                                    ____            The Association of Washington School Principals       The Association of Washington School Principals (AWSP) is      strongly committed to supporting legislation which reduces      class size in our public school system. It is increasingly      evident that students entering our schools have diverse and      unique needs which can only be addressed by principals,      teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by      crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote      attention to each student in smaller, more manageable      classes.       Recent studies on reduced class size and their impact on      student performance, undertaken in Tennessee (STAR study) and      Wisconsin (SAGE study), speak to learner benefits in areas      such as reading, language arts, and math. In our own state of      Washington, reduction of class size and improved student      performance are priorities for both legislators and      educators.       AWSP is convinced that class size reduction is essential if      our state's, and nation's, efforts towards school improvement      are to be successful. We appreciate and support Senator Patty      Murray's commitment to this end.                                                                    ____             Washington State School Directors' Association       ``As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for      all of our students,'' Larry Swift, executive director of the      Washington State School Directors' Association, said, ``it      becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be      used efficiently and effectively. The most valuable resource      in today's schools is the people who devote their time and      effort to make schools successful--the teachers. Reducing the      ratio of students to adults is particularly critical for      youngsters with a variety of learning challenges that must be      overcome if those students are to meet the new, higher      learning standards.       ``We acknowledge and commend Senator Murray for leading the      way to assuring that our students have the learning      environment and the human resources necessary for the kind of      schools that will provide the opportunities and training they      need to become successful,'' Swift said.       The Washington State School Directors' Association is a      statewide organization representing all of the 1,482 locally-     elected school board members from the state's 296 school      districts. WSSDA serves as an advocate for the state's public      schools, provides training and technical assistance for      school board members and is very active in the legislative      process.
