President, today I rise to share my concerns about the recess appointment of Peter Eide to fill the post of general counsel at the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  Recently, President Bush announced several recess appointments of pending nominees to fill posts in his administration. One of those appointments was granted to Peter Eide. Mr. Eide's nomination has been under active consideration by the Governmental Affairs Committee since its referral, and a public hearing to consider his appointment was held on April 10. I am disappointed that the President chose to exercise his discretion to make this recess appointment rather than allowing the advice and consent process to continue on course.  Mr. Eide's credentials would make him an impeccable candidate for any number of positions in the Federal Government. However, General Counsel at the Federal Labor Relations Authority is not one of them.  The position to which Mr. Eide was appointed is described under law as being a neutral party in the settlement of disputes that arise between Federal agencies and unions on matters outlined in the Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute. However, for the past 12 years, Mr. Eide has been an outspoken critic of labor protections on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. He has consistently supported the dilution of protections for workers. He opposed OSHA regulations on safety and health programs, including ergonomics standards. He opposed provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act that provide compensatory damages and jury trials for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. He advocated a policy that would exempt employers who hired former welfare recipients from employment discrimination laws for 18 months. He consistently opposed increases in the Federal minimum wage. I find it disconcerting that someone who has been such a passionate and unrelenting foe of such labor protections for so many years would not only seek this position, but feel he is qualified to be the general counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  Looking beyond his former policy positions, Mr. Eide also lacks the requisite experience with Federal labor-management relations that I believe this important post necessitates. Most of his recent labor law experience has been in the private sector representingmanagement viewpoints. Nothing in his experience indicates he has the qualifications to perform a job representing Federal employee labor concerns.  Given his background, Federal employee labor organizations are worried about Mr. Eide's ability to perform the functions of his new post. I believe they have good reason to be concerned. I am submitting for the Record letters that I have received from Federal labor union leaders in opposition to Mr. Eide's nomination. I ask unanimous consent that these documents be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  As I have previously stated, Mr. Eide has the qualifications to serve in hundreds of positions throughout the Federal Government. General Counsel at the Federal Labor Relations Authority is simply not one of them.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         The National Treasury Employees Union,                                   March 26, 2003, Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: The National Treasury Employees Union,      the largest independent union of federal employees,      respectfully opposes the nomination of Peter Eide to be      General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority      (FLRA).       As members of the Governmental Affairs committee are aware,      the General Counsel of the FLRA is charged with enforcing the      provisions of the Federal Sector Labor-Management Relations      Statute (FSLMRS). The General Counsel directs the operations      of the FLRA's regional offices in their investigation of      unfair labor practices and in their conduct of representation      matters, such as running elections and making appropriate      unit determinations. The General Counsel is the prosecutor      for the FLRA; the incumbent determines, in the first      instance, whether to pursue alleged misconduct and, if so,      under what legal theory. The refusal of the General Counsel      to issue a complaint on an alleged unfair labor practice      charge is unreviewable. If the General Counsel does issue a      complaint, he or she controls the course of the litigation      before the FLRA.       Mr. Eide, in our opinion, is not qualified to perform the      important responsibilities of the position of General      Counsel. Although the General Counsel is the chief      prosecuting lawyer for the FLRA, Mr. Eide has not been a      practicing lawyer since 1990. Moreover, his legal experience      up to the date was confined to private sector labor      relations. There is nothing in his record that indicates any      experience whatsoever in federal sector labor relations,      which differs in many major respects from its private sector      counterpart.       Perhaps even more troubling to NTEU, Mr. Eide's work for      the last twelve years has been as an advocate for the      dilution of statutory protections for employees. As Manager      and then Director of Labor Policy for the Chamber of      Commerce, Mr. Eide has worked to oppose OSHA regulations on      safety and health programs. For example, he has proudly      pointed to this role in spearheading a coalition of      businesses and associations opposing OSHA ergonomics      regulations. He has also worked vigorously to undermine the      Fair Labor Standards Act and to amend Title VII of the Civil      Rights Act of 1964. In short, there is nothing in this record      to indicate that Mr. Eide would energetically enforce the      statutory protections of the FSLMRS, if confirmed as General      Counsel.       The General Counsel of the FLRA operates, to a large      extent, without review by the members of the Authority or by      any court. If he refuses to pursue allegations of misconduct,      the injured entity has no other legal recourse. This broad      prosecutorial discretion makes the incumbent an extremely      powerful figure in the federal sector labor relations. It      should not be entrusted to one whose career has been devoted      to advocacy of diminution of statutory protections for      workers.       NTEU therefore asks you to oppose the nomination of Peter      Eide to be General Counsel of the FLRA.           Sincerely yours,                                                Colleen M. Kelley,     National President.                                  ____         American Federation of                                 Government Employees, AFL-CIO                                    April 9, 2003, Washington, DC.     The Hon. Richard Durbin,     Committee on Governmental Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the American Federation      of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I am writing to express our      opposition to the nomination of Peter Eide to be General      Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA).       The General Counsel of the FLRA is, in effect, the chief      prosecutor of unfair labor practices. Over 80 percent of      unfair labor practices in the federal sector are filed by      unions. The General Counsel of the FLRA, therefore, is      primarily called upon to enforce the labor statute on behalf      of unions. Mr. Eide's career, for over the past decade, would      indicate that he is ideologically incapable of performing      this task.       In this regard, our review of his resume clearly shows that      Mr. Eide has spent the last twelve years working for the      Chamber of Commerce as the chief architect of every Chamber      effort opposing every labor initiative. From his opposition      to Senator Edward Kennedy's ergonomics initiative to      promoting a diminution of Fair Labor Standards Act and Equal      Employment Opportunity protections, Mr. Eide's efforts have      been dedicated 100% of the time to opposing the labor      movement and worker-friendly statutes.       Section 7101, the ``findings and purpose'' section of the      Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute, states      that:       ``(a) The Congress finds that--       (1) experience in both private and public employment      indicates that the statutory protection of the right of      employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate      through labor organizations of their own choosing in      decisions which affect them--       (A) safeguards the public interest.       (B) contributes to the effective conduct of public      business, and       (C) facilities and encourages the amicable settlements of      disputes between employees and their employers involving      conditions of employment; and       (2) the public interest demands the highest standards of      employee performance and the continued development and      implementation of modern and progressive work practices to      facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient      accomplishment of the operations of the Government.       Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in      the civil service are in the public interest.''       AFGE respectfully submits that Mr. Eide's entire adult      career is inexorably inconsistent and opposed to the stated      Congressional ``findings and purpose'' of Section 7101, and      his nomination should be opposed.           Sincerely,                                            Bobby L. Harnage, Sr.,     National President.                          ____________________
