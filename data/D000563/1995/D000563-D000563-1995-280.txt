It strikes me as eminently sensible if a person earned his or her fortune in this country, they should not be able to get off the hook and escape the tax liability. These families getting on the mass transit every day in your hometown and the city of Chicago, they are paying their taxes. It is coming right out of their paycheck. They never think about renouncing their citizenship. They are proud of their country.  I am sure they get a little catch in their throat at the ``Star Spangled Banner'' and watching the flag.  Here we are protecting these folks who would walk away from America. That does not make any sense whatsoever.  I sincerely hope we can address this in the near term because it is really a loophole in the Tax Code that must be changed.
