Speaker, I want to congratulate the citizens of Israel and the entire Jewish community on this 57th anniversary of the State of Israel's founding, also known as Yom Ha'atzmaut.  For 57 years, the Israeli people have faced persistent challenges and threats, and they have prevailed--and will continue to prevail and flourish--because of their unshakable courage and faith in Israel's democratic future.  Israel is today the only true democracy in the Middle East, and the foundation of her government is similar to our own--freedom of religion, freedom of speech, respect for basic human rights and respect for the rule of law. The American-Israel partnership is unbreakable. We are both nations of immigrants. We are safe havens for the oppressed. We are partners for peace. And we are united in fighting terrorism.  I am pleased that once again this summer I will have the opportunity to lead a delegation of Democratic Members of Congress to Israel. Two years ago, I had the honor of leading the largest Congressional delegation in Israel's history to the Jewish state. And, I believe it is imperative that our newer Members see Israel's security challenges first-hand and gain a better appreciation of her importance to America's national security interests.  I urge my colleagues to support this important Resolution.
