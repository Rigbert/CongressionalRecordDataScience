Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, I am very grateful, and I will not take up much of his time here, but I did want to point out this company, Mattel--that just fired 700 workers this morning in New York State--made $236 million in profit last year, $236.6 million, and one of the toys that they make is the Barbie doll.  Most little girls in America own between 8 and 12 Barbie dolls. There is not a single Barbie doll made in the United States of America, not a single one, even though Mattel makes inordinate profits in our market, and is moving our jobs elsewhere and is making egregious profits off the difference between what it charges us because the price of Barbie dolls did not go down in America. They run from $29.99 all the way up to $200. I know; I used to buy them when they were made here, and they pay their workers very low wages, not just in Mexico, but in Indonesia, in China, in Malaysia, and then they bring all that stuff back here for us, and they think we do not notice.  But I tell you what: Those 700 workers in New York State, we are here for you because we're going to be your voice, and we are going to continue to be your voice through this tough struggle.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Major Owens of New York who came here in the same year as I did and has been a fighter for the people of this country for as long as we have served together.
