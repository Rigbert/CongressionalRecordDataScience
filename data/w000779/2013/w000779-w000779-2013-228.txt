President, the Durbin-Enzi amendment forgets that we are in a global economy. This measure does not and cannot reach foreign retailers. A small business, for example, in Montana is sacked with the burdens of this bill. It is an administrative nightmare, which Senator Baucus and Senator Ayotte have outlined. Some businesses are just going to say: Why not do business in Canada or Mexico or even China. Now, I know my colleagues who are advocating this don't intend this result, but their legislation really ought to be called the shop Mexico bill or the shop Canada bill or the shop China bill. I don't think that makes any sense.  Chairman Baucus handles these global economic kinds of questions in the Finance Committee, and that is the place we ought to look at it, and that is why we ought to reject this amendment today.  I yield the floor and reserve my time.
