Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment basically is a limitation amendment, limiting assistance to Ukraine reducing it by an amount equal to the amount of any claim outstanding on the date of enactment of this act, whether that to be a U.S. business enterprise, a U.S. private and voluntary organization against the government of Ukraine, or any Ukrainian business enterprise.  It is my intention, as I discuss this, to draw attention to the lack of resolution on claims by Land O'Lakes and Pioneer and other such claims.
