 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1287, the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center Lease Act. I am the proud sponsor of this legislation, and as I have in the previous Congress, I thank Mr. Donnelly for joining me as a cosponsor.  I also do want to thank Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Hastings, Subcommittee Ranking Member Bishop, and especially Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva for all of their hard work in ensuring that this legislation is brought to the floor.  It has been explained and I will simply say that it is my sincere hope that this legislation will enable the continuance of our efforts to protect and to enhance the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and to ensure that all Americans can benefit from the park. The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which was established in 1966, is relatively new, but as it continues to mature, the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center will be vital in helping to provide each lakeshore visitor a complete and rewarding experience.  Mr. Speaker, we should not delay the lakeshore's ability to mature, thus allowing more people to appreciate the natural beauty of northwest Indiana.  Again, I urge my colleagues, as they did in the last Congress, to support this measure.
