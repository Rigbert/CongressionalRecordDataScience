They are ashamed of what has happened with Enron. They are ashamed of what they are seeing in this area of corporate irresponsibility. They believe they are good Americans creating profit for their shareholders and job opportunities and good products. They are looking for leadership from Washington. Usually business says, Washington, hands off, stay away from us.  Many times they are asking, What are you going to do to help us clean up the mess when it comes to accounting standards and energy regulation? We need leadership from Washington. Yet there is little or nothing coming from this administration when it comes to corporate responsibility. For the sake of this country, for the sake of the good companies in this country, those that are responsible, we need an administration that will speak out now to restore confidence to the American people in our economy, in our business structure, in our stock market. Yet the only thing we hear is the Norquist blacklist. They are going to blacklist certain people from having access to this administration if they deign to speak on behalf of consumers and average people. That sort of thing is totally unacceptable. It is an ethic we should not accept from either political party in this Nation.  I ask the Senator from California if she has heard the same thing from responsible business leaders in her State.
