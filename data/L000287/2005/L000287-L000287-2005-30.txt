Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis), I rise tonight to salute an extraordinary and gifted American.  John H. Johnson had a vision and used that vision to destroy negative racial stereotypes and to expand opportunities for all African Americans and for all Americans. With a dream and a $500 loan, secured by his mother's furniture, Mr. Johnson began publishing the ``Negro Digest'' in 1942. With very limited resources and his dream, he built an empire that included publishing and cosmetics.  Through his work and his vision, he has made a lasting contribution. ``Jet'' and ``Ebony'' provided a window to the African American community that benefited African Americans and all Americans. ``Ebony'' and ``Jet'' became part of the dialogue. It was a way of communicating. We read it in our homes, schools, and in the barber shops and beauty shops.  There is a saying in the African American community: ``If it is in `Jet,' it must be true.'' In the pages of ``Jet'' magazine, we read the current news that had an impact on the African American community. In the pages of ``Ebony,'' people saw how other people lived; and we aspired to be like the people we saw on those pages. The pages of his magazine inspired and motivated generations of African Americans. It also helped to break down racial stereotypes by offering positive images and stories of African American men and women.  In 1957 and in 1959, he accompanied Vice President Richard M. Nixon on a special goodwill tour to nine African countries and to Russia and Poland. In 1961, he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as Special U.S. Ambassador to the Independence Ceremonies of the Ivory Coast. And in 1963, he was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson as Special United States Ambassador to the Independence Ceremonies of Kenya. In 1996, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton.  Johnson was solid, dependable, and reliable. He helped to energize the African American community during the height of the civil rights movement. During the struggle for equality, he published the images of the murder of Emmett Till, which galvanized the civil rights movement. His magazines have been an anchor for African Americans and continue to do that today.  His contribution to the African American community and to American life was unique and significant, and tonight we all salute the memory of John Johnson.                          ____________________[Pages H8134-H8135]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF JOHN H.
