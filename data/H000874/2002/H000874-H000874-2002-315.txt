Speaker, Morgan Wootten has been changing the lives of young men in the Washington area for the last half century. Last month, Mr. Wootten, the head basketball coach at DeMatha High School in Hyattsville, MD, since 1956, announced his retirement.  Coach Wootten finished his career with 1,274 wins, 44 consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins, 33 Catholic league championships, 16 city titles, and five national championships. Under Coach Wootten, DeMatha finished the season ranked No. 1 in the area, a record 22 times. More than a dozen of his players have gone on to play in the NBA, 150 have received college basketball scholarships, and more than 20 are currently coaching basketball at some level. And two years ago, the all-time winningest high school basketball coach in America was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame.  But numbers do not tell the story of Morgan Wootten, nor the impact he has had on the lives of those young men he has coached at DeMatha. He is most remembered by his players, and the students in his history classes, for the lessons he taught them about life. Coach Wootten preached to his players the importance of God, family, school and basketball, in that order. His true value is measured in the professional and personal success of those he has taught and coached, and by the number of former players and students who have remained close to him over the years.  Mr. Speaker, President Theodore Roosevelt said that ``To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.'' Morgan Wootten has educated several generations of young men in both mind and morals, and I offer him my warmest congratulations on is well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
