 President, I would ask the Senator from Arizona if I may ask a question. I would ask the Senator from Arizona, is this the same AARP that I recall opposed a $10 billion reduction in the rate of increase in Medicare spending back in 2005?  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague they not only opposed it, they got all of their members fired up in opposition to it. We all heard from them back in 2005.
