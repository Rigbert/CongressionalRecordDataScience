President, for 2 weeks the government has been shut down. It is hard to imagine. It seems a lot longer if you have been sitting here in the midst of this maelstrom--2 weeks since the junior Senator from Texas took the floor and for 21 hours held the floor, giving a speech calling for the end of ObamaCare as we know it.  In that period of time we have learned a lot about ourselves. We learned a lot about this country. I think about the 800,000 Federal employees furloughed, many of whom struggle to get by and now have no paycheck coming in. It is a hardship that is totally unnecessary, a hardship that wasimposed on them because there was a strategy, a political strategy, political gamesmanship that said: We can sacrifice the well-being of those Federal employees and their families to make our political point.  It turns out they went further.
