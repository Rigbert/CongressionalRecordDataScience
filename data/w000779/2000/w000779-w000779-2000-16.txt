There are more than 50 major health organizations. The American Cancer Society has stated why they feel this legislation would have a chilling effect on pain management.  I want my colleague to know, because time is short, that Senator Nickles, in offering this bill, says doctors don't have anything to worry about with respect to prosecution under the bill--that his legislation says doctors can prescribe drugs which will hasten death if their intent is to treat the pain. So he is talking about ``intent.''  Our colleagues are right to be so concerned about who is going to determine the intent of the physician, who is just trying to help somebody suffering and gives a suffering person critical relief and dignity as they face difficult hours at the end-of-life. The person who is going to decide ``intent'' is not another doctor, not a nurse, not a health professional, not anybody with medicaltraining, but law enforcement officials. A law enforcement official is going to determine that medical provider's' intent. Somebody with no medical training is going to, in effect, have the authority to put medical providers on trial; a trial that could cause a provider to lose their license, serve 20 years in prison, and face upwards of a $1 million fine.  It doesn't have to be this way. There are many who oppose assisted suicide, who want to work in a bipartisan way to promote better pain management and reduce the demand for assisted suicide.
