President, I wish to recognize the inspiring accomplishments of Nancie Atwell from Southport, ME, who was awarded the first Global Teacher Prize by the Varkey Foundation. This international, nonprofit organization is committed to improving the quality of education worldwide. Nancie's selection as the foundation's first ever prize recipient is a testament to her outstanding contributions to the teaching profession and her effect on countless students and teachers. The $1 million prize was awarded at a ceremony in Dubai attended by former President Bill Clinton and Sheikh Mohammedbin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates.  Heralded as the ``Nobel Prize of Teaching,'' the prestigious Global Teacher Prize shines a spotlight on the critical role that teachers play in our society. Nancie was selected from more than 5,000 nominations received from 120 countries. The candidates were evaluated based on their innovative teaching practices, including their ability to prepare students to be global citizens.  The pool of thousands was narrowed down to a group of 10 remarkable nominees, including teachers from Afghanistan, India, Kenya, Haiti, Malaysia, Cambodia, and the United States. Within this elite group, Nancie Atwell rose above the rest. Nancie has been a teacher since 1973. In 1990, she used money from her own pocket to found the Center for Teaching & Learning, an independent demonstration school that educates students from kindergarten through eighth grade in the small town of Edgecomb. Her vision was to foster a more meaningful education for Maine students. The center serves a close-knit population of approximately 75 students who travel from several surrounding towns because they are attracted to the school's small class sizes, research-based curriculum, and teacher outreach programs.  In a gesture that exemplifies her deep commitment to her students, Nancie announced that she intends to donate every last penny of the $1 million prize back to her school to support its resources, scholarships, library, and to replace its worn out furnace.  Nancie, who has authored many books and articles about education and hosted 140 education workshops, embodies a teaching philosophy based on student engagement, not just assignments. She encourages her pupils to identify and pursue their passions. By enabling students to choose to read and write about what interests them, the center has created an environment where children are excited to learn and eager to demonstrate their knowledge.  In addition to teaching students, the center does remarkable work teaching teachers. Educators from other schools regularly visit the center for professional development. Once there, they observe school-wide morning meetings, libraries in every classroom, and student-driven writing workshops. The center facilitates a teacher internship program that pairs visiting educators with teachers at the school. These intern-teachers observe and confer about instruction methods and leave equipped to make substantive changes back in their own schools.  In her acceptance speech, Nancie said:       When children are engaged, when learning is joyful, those      are the lessons that stick. Those are the lessons that are      worthwhile and meaningful and hang around.  This philosophy has inspired teachers and students alike. In fact, it was one of Nancie's former students who nominated her for the prize.  Under Nancie's leadership, the Center for Teaching & Learning has earned national praise. How wonderful it is that Nancie's work has now earned global recognition. The people of Maine--and especially its students--are fortunate to have such a pioneering and driven educator fighting for a brighter future. Nancie is a remarkable ambassador for both the State of Maine and our country, and I congratulate her on this outstanding accomplishment.                          ____________________
