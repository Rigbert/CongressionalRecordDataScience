Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the gentleman's comments. I want everybody to understand one thing. As chairman of this committee, we did this job right.  The gentleman talks about constitutionality. He does not know the Constitution from something else. We sent this down to the Justice Department. They reviewed it with the best constitutional lawyers. Everything in this bill is constitutional. I did this job correctly as chairman. To have someone say it is not constitutional or allude it is unconstitutional when it has been thoroughly scrubbed by those that know the Constitution, I think is inappropriate.
