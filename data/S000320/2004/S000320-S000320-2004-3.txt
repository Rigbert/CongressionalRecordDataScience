 President, today I honor Rev. Dr. John Herbert Spencer, Sr. who passed away on October 1, 2004 at the age of 83. Dr. Spencer was a compassionate man whose selflessness and devotion to his faith, family and community will be remembered for generations.  Dr. Spencer, a native of Greene County, AL, was born on December 7, 1920, to Manuel and Annie Eatman Spencer. A graduate of the public schools in Greene County and Tuscaloosa, Dr. Spencer also attended Stillman College and Union Seminary. He became the pastor of Morning Star Baptist Church in Holt, AL in 1946 and remained at the church for 58 years. His leadership and devotion to the church spurred tremendous growth, including a new sanctuary and increased congregation.  He also preached at the following churches: Antioch Baptist Church in Hulls, AL, Hopewell Baptist Church in Lowndes County, Pleasant Green Baptist Church in Whitehall, New Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Tyler, and the Old Kingston Baptist Church in Prattville. Dr. Spencer also dedicated much of his time and energy to the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and the Alabama Baptist State Convention, particularly as Missionary for the Northwest District since 1976 and locally as Record Secretary of the New Antioch Bethlehem District, NABD, Association and instructor in both the local and State Congress of Christian Education. He was the oldest and longest serving pastor in the NABD Association.  Dr. Spencer's influence played a vital role in the completion of the NABD Association's Religious Center and the Science Building and Dinkins Hall at Selma University. He served as both Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Selma University and was instrumental in efforts to secure the school's accreditation. Honorary Doctorate Degrees from Selma University, Birmingham Baptist Bible College and Easonian Theological Seminary are among his numerous awards and citations for his contributions to Baptist work.  Dr. Spencer married Lillian Brown Johnson in 1946, and they were the parents of eight children. He later married Kay Frances Turner in 1980, who survives him. He is also survived by his children: Rev. John H. Spencer, Jr. and his wife Debra; Rev. Simeon D. Spencer and wife Glynis; Dr. Marjorie Spencer Campbell and husband Willie, Lillian M. Spencer; Jannis M. Glover and husband Donald and Dr. Faye Spencer Maor and husband Terver. He is also survived by two step-sons: Dr. Otis S. Johnson and Paul L. Johnson and wife Angeline; twelve grandchildren, and one great granddaughter.  Indeed, Dr. Spencer's willingness to share his faith had a positive impact on everyone with whom he came in contact. He will be missed by his family, friends, and the many lives he touched through his ministry.                          ____________________
