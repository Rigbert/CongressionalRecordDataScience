Speaker, this weekend the world watched the close of the Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Our Nation distinguished itself.  Right next door, in the nation of Ukraine, another Olympic struggle was going on as tens of thousands of young people, the future of that country of Ukraine, rose in peaceful assembly and achieved their goal of removing corrupt leadership and of offering the hope that life in Ukraine could be better for all.  May I encourage the leaders of Ukraine's Parliament, the Verkovna Rada, to rise to this occasion, to embrace all of that great country, to keep the peace, to move toward democratic reform, so that the full potential of that remarkable place on this Earth can be reached for the first time in modern history.  May Ukraine extend west and south and east and north. Her power is yet to be fully realized, and we congratulate those who are moving toward peaceful progress in that nation.  May God go with you.                          ____________________
