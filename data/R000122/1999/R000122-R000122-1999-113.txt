 As I indicated, the true cost is 4.8 percent over 5 years. ``That is less than 1 percent a year.'' That is what Senator Lott said on ``Meet The Press.'' Indeed, if you calculate that down to a monthly cost, it is about $2 extra a month to the average family paying health care premiums. It is not going to cause a huge eruption of costs.  It is also to me somewhat disconcerting to think that the insurance industry is worried about people losing their health care coverage. They raise costs every day. They will raise costs to protect their profits.  What this legislation wants to do is guarantee that there is quality in the American health care system.  Make no mistake, this amendment is calculated and designed to undercut all the protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is calculated within 2 years to undercut and remove all of the protections that are so necessary to the American family, which we are fighting for.  This would be a recipe also to reward those companies that have excessive costs, and it would be virtually impossible to figure out what costs are associated with their need for profits versus what costs are associated with the increase in quality in the system. They would be doing the audits. They would essentially be exempting themselves. We are giving them a key to let them out of the responsibilities to their patients and to their consumers. We can't do that.  This is just another red herring, another ruse, and another device to prevent the American people from achieving what they definitely want--rights in the health care system.
