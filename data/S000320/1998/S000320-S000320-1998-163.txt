 President, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 took important steps to begin to combat the financial problems that have plagued the Medicare system for some time. However, the BBA included a provision that may disqualify Medicare beneficiaries who receive home health care stemming from their need for venipuncture services. Many Alabamians who rely on the Medicare home health care program have contacted me expressing their concern with this provision. Much of the concern has resulted from a lack of information as to the true effects of this provision.  Therefore, I rise today to offer the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998. This legislation will provide an eighteen month moratorium on the venipuncture provision included in last year's BBA, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study to determine what the specific effects will be of doing away with venipuncture as a qualifying skill for home health care.  In addition, this legislation provides a window of time for Congress to address any problems found by HHS, and craft an appropriate solution that protects the seniors who receive home health care, without perpetuating fraud and abuse in the system. But perhaps the most important aspect of the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act is that it will provide much needed piece of mind to many of our seniors. Mr. President, we owe it to our constituents to separate fact from fiction with regard to this matter, and fully inform them of the effects of the venipuncture provision contained in last year's BBA.  If administered correctly, home health care can be a cost effective alternative to nursing home and hospital based care. This legislation protects the Medicare home health care system by providing specific statutory action to root out fraud and abuse in the program, while ensuring that the seniors who truly need home care receive it. I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998.                                 ______                                       By
