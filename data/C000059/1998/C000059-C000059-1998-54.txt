Speaker, early this year several news organizations in the southern California area conducted a poll to identify issues of concern to the citizens of that region. Improving the education system was far and away the highest priority among those polled. A staggering 80 percent of respondents supported requiring that teachers take competency tests on a regular basis. The survey clearly illustrated that most Americans want training for teachers so they are better equipped for the classroom.  This week in the House we will be considering H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments, which establishes a competitive grant system designed to improve the quality of teacher training in colleges and universities. The bill would hold institutions of higher education accountable for preparing teachers in the subjects in which they plan to teach.  Mr. Speaker, today's youths are tomorrow's leaders. We must give them every opportunity to succeed. I urge all of my colleagues to support education reform and support H.R. 6.                          ____________________
