 President, I did not know Senator Packwood well, but I have watched him. I heard him on CNN last evening. I have heard him on other shows. I have listened to him, as the leader and the Senator from Wyoming have pointed out, explain complicated issues in a vital and easily understood way. I have listened as the heads of various women's organizations have indicated their respect for him and for his long record of help.  I recognize that service in this institution is not easy, that people are held to a standard, and after all, we are just mere reflections of everyone around us. We are complete with moles and warts and our own problems. So this is not a happy day for me. I do not believe it is a happy day for the U.S. Senate.  I do believe it is a day of some courage and bravery on the part of Senator Packwood, because even those of us who did not know him well know of his love for this body--you could see it, it is palpable, it is there--and his respect for this body as an institution. I really think that kind of performance goes beyond any party label, and it goes beyond any trial and tribulation.  My father used to always say to me, ``Dianne, do not let a man be known for the last thing he does. Let him be known for the best thing he does.''  I think that is a legacy that hopefully is being written here this afternoon. This is a sad day in a chapter of history of the U.S. Senate, but it says one thing: We do have our failings, and we do make our mistakes. But it is a sign of a wise man, and even a giant man, who stands and does what has to be done and goes on to fight another day.  I thank you, Senator Packwood, for a long and distinguished service to the U.S. Senate.
