 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2830, the so-called Pension Protection Act. It should be pointed out that H.R. 2830 is opposed by AARP, by the Pension Rights Center, and pension advocates across the country. While I recognize that the Republican leadership included some modest provisions to attract some union support, H.R. 2830 still has a number of provisions that will jeopardize the retirement security of millions of American workers.  Among other harmful provisions, this bill would legalize age discrimination in cash balance pension conversions. Year after year, Congress has voted against cash balance pension conversions because of the harm they have caused older workers.  Mr. Speaker, we do not tolerate discrimination in this country based on race, gender, religion, or disability; and we must not tolerate discrimination based on age with regard to pensions.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what H.R. 2830 does. According to the GAO, cash balance conversions without protections slash the pension benefits of an average 50-year-old by $238 a month. Younger workers are also hurt. As the GAO reported, a typical 30-year-old would see his or her pension benefits slashed by $59 a month under a cash balance conversion. H.R. 2830 would legitimize these harmful pension cuts by legalizing cash balance conversions without requiring employers to protect older workers. That is wrong.  Mr. Speaker, let me read to you what the AARP and the Pension Rights Center have to say about this legislation. According to the AARP: ``We cannot support legislation that would clarify the legal status of cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older, long-service workers involved in cash balance plan conversions.''  I urge a ``no'' vote.
