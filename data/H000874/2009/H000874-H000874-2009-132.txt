As a result, I wanted to let Members know that when we finish the business that is scheduled for today, which includes the water bill that we will be considering later today after the Homeland Security bill, we will then not plan to be here on Friday. I know that disappoints all of you.  It does disappoint me because I'm very focused, and we are working very hard with the Senate to try to get the appropriations bills done individually. I'm not a fan of omnibuses. I don't think anybody here is either. But as a result of being unable to move the Interior appropriation bill, my view was that originally we had scheduled the water bill for tomorrow, but it is our belief that we can consider both of them today which would then not require Members to be here on Friday.  You can lodge your complaints to me later.                Announcement By the Speaker Pro Tempore
