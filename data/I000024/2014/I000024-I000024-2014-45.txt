Kettle who died on August 12, 2007 of wounds suffered from a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Nangarhar province near Kuzkalakhel, Afghanistan.  Born August 26, 1975 and listing Madill, OK as his home of record, Jeff was a product of Texas City, TX. Military service ran in his family with his grandfather, uncles, brother, and father also completing service time. ``Jeff was the ultimate warrior,'' said Ronald Kettle, noting his son joined the Army in 1993 right after graduating from high school. He was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group based at Fort Bragg, NC and was on his fourth deployment.  A memorial service was held August 31, 2007, at Calvary Baptist Church in Texas City, TX. Jeff was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on August 22, 2007. His flag-draped coffin was carried to the grave site by a six-man casket team of soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment. In the brief ceremony, relatives including his parents and his wife recited the Lord's Prayer. His father said his son, 31, wished to be at Arlington because ``he wanted to be buried among heroes.''  Jeff is survived by his parents Ron and Cindy Kettle, his wife Brandi Kettle, two sons Jeffrey and Logan, grandmother Anne Moore, and two brothers Ryan and Clay Kettle.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Jeff's family. He lived alife of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                        Captain Torre R.
