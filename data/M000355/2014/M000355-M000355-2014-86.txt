  Jeremy hails from Magoffin County, and graduated from Magoffin County High School in 2004. The attacks of September 11, 2001, had a profound impact on Jeremy, and inspired him to enlist in the Marine Corps after graduating at the age of 18.  After completing basic training, combat training, and tank school, Jeremy was deployed to Ramadi as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Despite being wounded on this first tour, for which he received the Purple Heart, he remained determined to serve his country. Jeremy returned to Iraq for a second tour, this time in Fallujah and, as in his previous tour, participated in counter-insurgency missions.  Both Jeremy's uncle and grandfather served in the U.S. Army, and for Jeremy it just made sense to continue that legacy of service. As he puts it--``pretty much whenever I saw our Nation needed people to defend our Nation, I felt I needed to take the call, and that's what I did.''  Jeremy's honorable service to this country is deserving of the praise of this body. Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Jeremy Holbrook.  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing Holbrook's two tours in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]               Holbrook Inspired by 9/11 to Join Marines                           (By Heather Oney)       The attacks of 9/11 inspired Jeremy Holbrook to join the      Marines, which took him on two tours of Iraq.       At 18 years old in 2004, Holbrook enlisted with the      Marines, making his family sad, but proud, he said. Since his      grandfather and uncle had both been in the Army, he said it      just seemed like the right thing to do.       ``Pretty much, whenever I saw our nation needed people to      defend our nation, I felt I needed to take the call and      that's what I did,'' Holbrook said.       The Magoffin County High School grad went to boot camp at      the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South      Carolina in July 2004, graduating from there in October 2004.      He had his combat training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina,      then tank school in Fort Knox, Kentucky, assigned to the M1A1      Abrams Tank Crew. He trained for Operation Iraqi Freedom at      Twentynine Palms, California.       Holbrook did two combat tours in Iraq, the first time in      Ramadi, Iraq, running counter-insurgency missions, and the      second time to Fallujah, Iraq, where he continued counter-     insurgency missions and route clearing.       Based in an old Iraqi Army barracks, Holbrook said the      living conditions were dingy and rundown, with no running      water or toilets. With temperatures climbing upward of 150      degrees during the day and 110 degrees at     night, he said they would actually get cold at night.       In a normal day he said they would go into a city and look      for insurgents. If found, they would try to eliminate them,      all while trying to protect and liberate the Iraqi people,      Holbrook said.       ``We slept when we could, ate when we could, and there      wasn't much time for a bath,'' Holbrook remembers.       Even though he was wounded in his first tour, receiving the      Purple Heart, he still went back for the second tour,      deployed for seven months each time. In addition to the      Purple Heart, he also received the National Defense Medal,      Iraqi Freedom Medal, Combat Action Medal, Sea Service      Deployment Ribbon and Global War on Terrorism Medal.       Holbrook said the hardest thing he had to deal with when he      returned to the States was coping with the loss of a friend,      who was killed during their first tour together.       Holbrook is married to Britani Holbrook, and has three      kids, Gavin, Austin and Bentley.                               ____________________
