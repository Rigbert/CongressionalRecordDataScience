President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I know of his personal interest in this issue. He has offered legislation before. Today we are considering S. 2061, which has been offered initially by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Ensign.  It is important to note that this bill, which was brought directly to the floor, has not been the subject of any committee hearings. In fact, there has been no effort, to my knowledge, to sit down and find a bipartisan compromise or sponsorship for this legislation. This bill was presented to the Senate a few days before we went into recess, and now it is being called this day.  What is interesting, as well, is that there are announcements from the Republican leadership that we will quickly move after the vote on this bill to other issues, and they have been enunciated.
