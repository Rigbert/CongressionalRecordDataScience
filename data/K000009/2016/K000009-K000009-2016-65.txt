I agree with his opposition to this amendment.  Why blame one of the best parts of our government, in my opinion, for Congress not doing its job? I am always impressed with the Energy Information Administration. Their data is stellar. They are professionally run. The business community looks to them. Frankly, the global energy community looks to them.  I think the amendment is shortsighted and would eliminate one of the best, most important sources of information that guides all of our decisions. They are so precise. The data that they present also can be easily understood. They have maps. They have charts. They have continuous data over a number of years.  I think the gentleman wants to solve a problem, but I think that one could say that this amendment might be penny wise and pound foolish because, if you have had any experience with the Energy Information Administration, you know how excellent they really are and their work is.  We depend on it in order to make solid decisions to save money or to make decisions that are sound rather than unsound. Don't rip the heart outof one of the most important administrations that we have at the Federal level on the energy front.  I thank the chairman for yielding.  I would urge that this amendment be defeated.
