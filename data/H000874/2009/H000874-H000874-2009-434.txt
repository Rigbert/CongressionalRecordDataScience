That rule, I haven't talked to the committee Chair, I haven't talked to Mr. Waxman, nor have I talked to Ms. Slaughter about the rule, so I don't want to represent what form the rule will be in. But it will not be a suspension bill.  Furthermore, I think the gentleman's observation is a valid observation. We have many new Members who did not consider it. We are hopeful and working towards having that bill online available on Monday for a full 48 hours before we would bring it forward on the floor for Members to see and the public to see and all the Members of the House to see.
