President, I wish to make one comment. We are on the bill, and I compliment Senators Grassley and Baucus for the great work they have done. We have put together a good bill, and it is necessary to go out to the proper committee, the Finance Committee, to see what we can do to enhance this bill and make it a little bit more robust. They have done a great job, and I compliment them on that.  I yield the floor.
