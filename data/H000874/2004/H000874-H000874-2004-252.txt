Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I really could take 30 minutes to try to correct what the gentleman from Wisconsin has been saying.  First of all, he is a very bright young man. I like him. And it is your money, he says. Now, that is the mantra, and that mantra I have heard for 20-plus years. And, of course, it is your money. And by the way, it is my money, too. I pay more taxes effectively than the Vice President of the United States, who made almost 10 times as much as I make, but I am not poor-mouthing that. And, by the way, the gentleman talks about these large corporations. They do not really care what the rate is because, as we notice, I say to the gentleman, 60 percent of them do not pay any taxes because of their preference items.                              {time}  1215  An aside that the Republican majority has made the Tax Code extraordinarily more complicated over the last 3\1/2\ years, extraordinarily more complicated over the last 3\1/2\ years, let me call to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), some facts.  A, Mr. Armey said you own this town. You have the President, you have the Senate, you have the House. Now, I have been here a lot longer than the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan).  He talks about debt. Under Ronald Reagan, we raised the debt level 17 times. Under George Bush, the first, in 4 years we raised the debt limit 10 times. Under this President, we have raised the debt limit by $1.5 trillion over 3 years. Over 8 years, under President Clinton we raised the debt limit five times for $1.58 trillion. The difference, however, is that under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the first, we added about $2 trillion to the debt. Under this President, we have added about $1.5 trillion to the debt, and under Bill Clinton, over 8 years, less debt and net $79 billion worth of debt, not trillions, net. Why? Because for 4 years of the last 4 years of the Clinton administration we created surpluses.  Secondly, the gentleman and all the Republicans talk about it is spending that is the problem. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) says that spending is the problem. I would like to have the gentleman's attention because I know he is going to find these figures very edifying and interesting because he talked about spending, that is a legitimate issue to raise; and I want to call the gentleman's attention to the administration's budget numbers.  We have it from 1962 to today. Under Ronald Reagan's Presidency, a, we spent 22.5 percent of GDP on average, some years higher, some years a little lower, under Ronald Reagan, never below 21 percent. Let me remind my colleagues that not a penny was spent in America during Ronald Reagan's term of office without his signature, not one. We never overrode a veto. The Democrats never imposed spending that the President did not sign off, not once. So we understand nondefense discretionary spending was 3.4 percent under Ronald Reagan.  Under George Bush, the first, it was 21.9 percent of GDP. Again, he never had a bill veto overridden stopping spending. He signed every nickel of that expenditure, 3.3 percent on nondefense discretionary spending.  Under George Bush, the second, we have done 19.85, almost 20 percent, and 3.5 percent, Dick Armey, they control this town, 3.5 percent of that was on nondefense discretionary spending. I will tell my friend from Wisconsin this fact is going to amaze him. We spent less GDP under Clinton for 8 years and we spent less on discretionary spending, less on discretionary spending, and I heard the gentlewoman from Tennessee about an hour ago saying we have created 1 million jobs since last August. We created 23 million jobs in 8 years or about 4 million a year on average under Bill Clinton.  So, when we are talking about the facts, we ought to know the facts because the facts belie what the gentleman from Wisconsin is proposing. That is why we are here, because we believe my colleagues' policy is not only fiscally wrong but it is also immoral. My friends on the Republican side want to create the impression that they are the only ones who support this 10 percent bracket. They are not. We want to make it permanent, but we do not want to impose a tax.  He talked about various people who are going to get tax increases. Under their bill, 290 million Americans are going to get a tax increase, but guess what. They will not get it immediately. We are going to delay it a little bit, not only past the next election but maybe past a couple of elections after that. Why? Because interest rates are going to go up, taxes are going to go up to pay the interest on this debt that my colleagues are creating, over $200 billion of additional debt in this bill alone.  That is all we are saying. We are for this policy. We are for keeping this 10 percent bracket. We want to assist those at the bottom rungs in our society, build themselves up, grow their families, have a better opportunity to pay for the education of their children and their mortgage payments and buy their cars and have a better quality of life. We want that, but we do not want to give them a bill for it 10 years from now that says guess what, you have got a big interest that you have got to pay.  I would urge my colleagues to look at the facts. Look at what we did under a piece of legislation passed in 1993, one passed in 1990 and, yes, one passed in a bipartisan way in 1997, which led to the creation of surpluses.  Let me close by this, and I do not have as much time as I would like, but Chairman Greenspan said just the other day, who is not a Democrat, ``Our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances. The free lunch has still to be invented.''  Vote for this substitute. My colleagues will vote for the policy and responsible fiscal policy at the same time.
