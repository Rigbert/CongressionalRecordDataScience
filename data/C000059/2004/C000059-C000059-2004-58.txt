Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona, and surrounding communities, has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Wayne Keith is one of these individuals. On March 27, 2004, Wayne will be honored at the annual YMCA Ira D ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner.  Wayne has been an active member of the community since he moved here in 1969. He began work as the general manager of ALCOA's Premium Casting Division in Corona. There is hardly an organization that hasn't benefited from his participation. Wayne has served as President of the Corona Rotary Club, the Western Municipal Water District and the Navy League. He has been on the Board of Directors of United Way, Corona Chamber of Commerce, Corona Community Hospital Foundation, UCR Foundation, Good Samaritan Boys Club and California Manufacturers Association.  A longtime member of the First Congregational Church, he has held a number of church positions from choir member to vice president of the board of directors. Wayne has also donated countless hours to Peppermint Ridge, serving three terms on its board of directors and chairing several committees. He also directed renovations of the Woman's Improvement Club clubhouse, and chaired fundraising activities for the Corona-Norco Family YMCA.  Wayne began his career in 1945 with ALCOA after receiving his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. He stayed with ALCOA over 40 years. During his career he was active in professional associations, has written on the subject of aluminum, and is co-holder of a patent for stair treads.  For all his volunteer efforts, Wayne has been recognized with several awards. In 1975, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce; received the Chamber's ``George'' Award; was chosen, along with his wife Evie, Corona Community Hospital Volunteers of the Year; and was recipient of the Golden Hinge Award--only the second one given--by Peppermint Ridge.  Wayne has set a standard of excellence and commitment in his work in the community. His tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the ``Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award.''                          ____________________
