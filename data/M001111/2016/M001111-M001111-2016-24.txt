 President, I am here today to support the strong statement from the Senator from North Dakota and the strong support for a fully functioning Export-Import Bank because it creates American jobs and helps our businesses, large and small, and, in fact, reduces our national debt. But right now, political posturing has handicapped the Ex-Im Bank, one of our countries most reliable tools to increase America's economic competitiveness in our global economy.  In my home State of Washington, there are nearly 100 businesses, the majority of them small or medium-sized, that used the Bank's services last year to help sell their products overseas. We are talking about everything from apples to airplane parts, beer, wine, software, medical training supplies, and beyond.  The reality is that people in other countries want American-made products. That is a great thing because these businesses support tens of thousands of jobs in our country and keep our economy moving.  The Export-Import Bank is the right kind of investment because it expands the access of American businesses to emerging foreign markets that create jobs right here at home.  Do you know what it costs taxpayers? Not a single penny. In fact, the Ex-Im Bank reduces our national debt.  So here is the bottom line. The Bank creates jobs. It strengthens our businesses. It helps our economy grow from the middle out, not just the top down.  So it is time for my colleagues to put ideology aside, to allow this proven program to operate at its full capacity, and to allow a vote that we were denied today to get the Ex-Im Board operating again because it is critical that the Bank continue to receive the strong bipartisan support we have seen in the past as we work to build on its success.  I yield the floor.
