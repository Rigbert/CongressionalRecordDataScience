 President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1237, the Child Pornography Prevention Act, introduced by Senator Hatch. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this very important piece of legislation, which would close loopholes in the current child pornography statutes created by computer technology. Now, due to the marvels of modern technology, child pornographers can use computers to create synthetic child pornography which is so realistic and life-like that no expert can distinguish it from traditional kiddie porn. S. 1237 would close that gap.  But the bill has not come up for a vote yet, even though the bill was put on the calendar over a month ago. Why is that? Why has not the Senate moved to pass this legislation quickly and send it to the House as the 104th Congress comes to an end?  The reason, Mr. President, is that some Senators from the other side of the aisle will not let the bill come up for a vote because they oppose stiff new mandatory penalties for child pornographers.  In the Judiciary Committee, I offered an amendment which would create a three-strikes-and-you're-out penalty structure for the production of child pornography. First time offenders will receive a 10-year minimum sentence. For a second offense, there would be a 15-year minimum sentence, and for a third offense, there would be a minimum sentence of 30 years to life. My amendment passed the committee after much debate.  But now, some Senators from the other side of the aisle are using senatorial privilege in order to have my amendment stripped out of the bill without ever having a vote on the matter. These Senators are literally holding the Senate hostage. In contrast,Senators on my side of the aisle have informally offered to have another vote on this issue. But to no avail.  Mr. President, this is outrageous. I believe that the American people want tougher penalties for child molesters and child pornographers. And I am proud to have taken a leadership role on the issue. To the Democrat Senators who oppose minimum sentences for child pornographers, I say let's have a vote. Secret tricks like holds should not be used to drop the bottom out of the penalties for child pornographers.  I think that this is shameful, Mr. President. And I believe that the American people have a right to know why the Child Pornography Prevention Act is bottled up on the Senate floor. The roadblock to passage of this vitally important bill with tougher child pornography penalties is not the Republican caucus. It is not my side of the aisle which is blocking this bill trying to lower the penalties for child pornographers.  If the bill does not pass this year, the fault will rest squarely on the shoulders of the other side of the aisle.  I remain ready to vote on this matter. I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to come out and debate minimum sentences for child pornographers.                          ____________________
