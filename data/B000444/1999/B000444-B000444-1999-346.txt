 President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry? Is Senator Durbin next on the list after me? The reason I ask is, Senator Durbin apparently agreed to switch spots with Senator Kerry.  Mr. McCAIN. After Senator Biden is Senator Kerry, Senator Warner, Senator Nickles, Senator Durbin, then Senator Dorgan, Senator Lieberman, Senator Cleland, Senator Levin, Senator Hollings, and Senator Brownback.
