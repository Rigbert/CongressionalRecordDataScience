Speaker, the recent events in Venezuela have given the American people yet another example of the way that oil distorts U.S. foreign policy. Most Americans do not realize it, but Venezuela is a crucial supplier of oil to the United States. According to the CIA, petroleum dominates the Venezuelan economy, accounting for approximately one-third of its economy and 80 percent of its export earnings. In fact, Venezuela ranks third on the list of countries that provide with us petroleum, approximately 1.5 million barrels every day, or more than half of its total production.  Stanley Weiss, founder and chairman of Business Executives for National Security, a nonpartisan organization of business leaders, wrote recently in the Los Angeles Times that the United States imports twice as much oil from Canada and Venezuela as it does from the Persian Gulf. And Venezuela is particularly important as a source of reformulated gasoline, which is required in many American cities that are struggling to meet USEPA emission standards for clean air.  Every time an American citizen pulls up to a Citgo gas pump, they are pumping dollars into the Venezuelan national oil company known as Pedevesa. And it was labor unrest at the Pedevesa facilities throughout Venezuela that helped to spur the 1-day coup against Venezuelan President Hugh Chavez.  So important is Venezuelan oil to the world's market that the price of oil dropped precipitously after Chavez was deposed and rebounded just as quickly when he was restored to power by the people of Venezuela.  The Bush administration, which is dominated by oil in much the same manner as the Venezuelan economy, could barely contain its glee when President Chavez was overthrown in a coup d'etat. Meanwhile, every other government in this hemisphere reacted negatively to the overthrow of a democratically elected government. By putting the interests of the oil economy first and democratic rule second, the Bush administration not only found itself out of step with every other government in Latin America but foolishly forfeited the high moral ground.  Now the administration has a lot of sorting out to do. It has to explain to Congress about what really happened in Venezuela. Did the Bush administration actively encourage antidemocratic forces to overthrow a leader with whom we happen to disagree? Did the Bush administration give a wink and a nod to the coup plotters? Under what authority was the Bush administration acting when U.S. military advisers found themselves on the side of the insurgents? When was that action authorized by the Congress of the United States? When did President Bush learn about the attempted coup and direction was given to U.S. diplomats, military officials, and advisers in the region? What did they receive from the White House, the State Department or the Defense Department? What relationship does the President, Vice President, or any of his advisers have with any oil interests in Venezuela? On whose order did the Bush administration officials choose not to speak out against the overthrow of a democratically elected president from a nation that is America's third largest oil supplier?  The United States simply must occupy the moral high ground. We are engaged in a worldwide battle against terrorism and antidemocratic forces. We are trying to show the rest of the world what it means to stand up for democratic values. Not to support a legitimately elected government, no matter how much we may disagree with its president, has damaged the perception of the United States as a standard bearer for legitimate elections and democratic governments.  The Organization of American States took a position diametrically opposed to this country's position. I hope the Committee on International Relations demands a full explanation by the Bush administration so there is no repeat of this sorry performance. President Chavez should understand that Americans believe in democracy and view Venezuela as a friend, not just as an oil well. And the American people can take from this latest sordid experience another lesson in the many ways in which dependence on foreign oil distorts our politics and our policy.  Mr. Speaker, I submit herewith for the Record two articles, one from the Toledo Blade that talks about the administration's flip-flop in our policy towards Venezuela, and also a time line and related article from the New York Times on ``2 days that Shook Venezuela: The Fall, and Return, of President Hugo Chavez.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 20, 2002]   2 Days That Shook Venezuela: The Fall, and Return, of Hugo Chavez       The killings at the anti-Chavez demonstration rocked the      country, reviving memories of the violent events in 1989,      known as the Caracazo, in which hundreds were killed by      government forces. Venezuelans across the political spectrum      swore that such violence would never take place again.       According to witnesses, shots were fired from several      buildings as well as from a bridge one block from the      presidential palace, which overlooks the route of the march.      One of the buildings that witnesses identified as a source of      gunfire contains the offices of Freddy Bernal, the mayor of      the borough that includes downtown Caracas and one of the      leaders of the Bolivarian Circles.       Eddie Ramiez, an executive with the state oil company, was      in a part of the march that came close to the presidential      palace. ``Shots were fired from a building,'' he said. ``I      think there were people there waiting for us, and some crazy      person started to shoot.''       None of the snipers who fired from rooftops (as opposed to      the bridge) have been identified, with pro-Chavez forces      arguing that     much of the gunfire was directed at Miraflores Palace and      that some anti-Chavez demonstrators were also armed.       Since Mr. Chavez's return to power last Sunday, his      followers have sought to place the blame for the killings on      the Metropolitan Police, which reports to one of his main      political adversaries, Alfredo Pena, the mayor of Caracas.      However, after an independent investigation, the country's      two main human rights groups concluded that the shootings      took place ``to minimize the action of the opposition with      the acquiescence of organisms of the state,'' and police and      military officers.       Gen. Nestor Gonzalez, an ally of Mr. Chavez who broke with      the president early last week, said that the military high      command already had information at midday that there would be      an attack on the anti-Chavez march. He said this week that      the top commanders learned of the plans from ``a general who      had personally infiltrated in the Bolivarian Circles.''       As the confrontation in the streets raged, Mr. Chavez      ordered all television stations to join a national network      and began delivering a speech warning Venezuelans ``not to      fall into provocation.'' But independent stations split the      screen so as to continue broadcasting the violence near the      palace. Their transmissions signals were cut, and public      opinion began turning against Mr. Chavez.       Feeling vulnerable, Mr. Chavez ordered tanks and troops to      move to the palace from army headquarters at Fort Tiuna, in      Caracas. But military commanders, fearing a repetition of the      1989 bloodshed, told the president that they would not obey      him. ``The result would have been a massacre,'' General      Gonzalez said. Military dissidents who had plotted against      Mr. Chavez had sought out business leaders thought to be      sympathetic. they included Pedro Carmona Estanga, the      president of Fedecamaras, the main national business      confederation.       Entreaties were also made to the American Embassy here but      it appears they did not meet with encouragement.       ``They were always impeccable at the embassy, from the      ambassador on down,'' said a businessman who was a witness to      several ``what if'' conversations. ``I can't tell you the      number of times they made it clear that they would not      countenance a coup. There was no winking going on, either.      They would always say, ``We do not want a rupture.''       Other anti-Chavez groups also traveled to the United States      to meet with Mr. Cisneros, the media magnate who has business      interests there, and with American officials. The Bush      Administration's two top officials for Latin American policy,      Assistant Secretary of State Otto Reich and John Maisto, the      national security adviser for Latin America, are both former      ambassadors to Venezuela and have maintained close ties with      business, political and news media leaders here.       So early on Thursday night top military officers, including      the army commander, Gen. Efrain Vazquez Velasco, were      confident when they delivered an ultimatum to Mr. Chavez: you      must quit. Cornered, Mr. Chavez said he was unwilling to      resign but would agree to ``abandon his functions,'' a      slightly different procedure under Venezuelan law that would      require the approval of the National Assembly, in which Mr.      Chavez has a majority.       The key figure in the hours of negotiations that followed      was the armed forces commander, Gen. Lucas Rincon Romero,      whose true loyalties still are not clear. Early on Friday, he      announced that Mr. Chavez had ``resigned,'' which led 90      minutes later to Mr. Carmona being named as head of a      military-supported transitional government.       That part is still confusing to me,'' Mr. Carmona said of      General Rincon's actions and statements this week, after he      was placed under house arrest and General Rincon was once      again at Mr. Chavez side, apparently forgiven by the      president. ``There are facts that are still in a gray area.''       By midmorning on Friday, Mr. Chavez, himself a former army      colonel who in 1992 led a failed coup attempt, looked to be      finished. He was being held in military custody at Fort      Tiuna; Cuba was beginning efforts that would have allowed him      to go into exile there, and the Bush administration was      already signaling its support for the new government.       On Friday morning, the day Mr. Carmona claimed power, Mr.      Reich, the assistant secretary, summoned ambassadors from      Latin America and the Caribbean to his office. The      representative from Brazil read a communique that stated that      his country could not condone a rupture of democratic rule in      Venezuela, diplomats said.       They said Mr. Reich responded that the ouster of Mr. Chavez      was not a rupture of democratic rule because he had resigned.      ``He stressed the position that Chavez was responsible'' for      his fate, ``and said we had to support the new government,''      said one Latin American envoy.       Almost immediately, though, Mr. Carmona began making the      political blunders that would quickly bring him down. After      working hand in hand for months with Carlos Ortega, the      leader of the Venezuelan Workers' Federation, the country's      main labor union group, he named a cabinet that had no labor      representatives and was tilted heavily toward a discredited      conservative party.       In addition, Mr. Carmona fanned military rivalries by      naming two navy officers to the cabinet, including Adm.      Hector Ramirez Perez as minister of defense instead of      General Vasquez Velasco, and none from the army.       ``There were many more people with aspirations than space      to accommodate them, and they all seemed ready to jump ship      when they felt they were being excluded,'' said Janet Kelly,      a political science professor and commentator here.       But the biggest mistake was a decree, announced at Mr.      Carmona's swearing-in on Friday afternoon, that dissolved the      National Assembly, fired the Supreme Court and called for new      presidential elections only after a year. The effect was to      suspend the Constitution, which generated immediate      opposition to the new government, both at home and in the      rest of Latin America.       ``In hindsight, it was the most idiotic thing that could      have been done,'' said a person who was at Miraflores for the      ceremony. ``But we had just come out of an ambush and we were      venting our distaste for the people who occupied those      positions, so everyone applauded the dissolution.''       As Mr. Carmona spoke, military officers were jostling for      position behind him, trying to make sure they would appear in      photographs in the papers the next day, spectators recalled.      But some civilian political leaders were already unhappy with      the look of things, and ducked out of the ceremony.       By Saturday morning, it was clear that Mr. Carmona's      transition government was floundering. Ambassador Shapiro had      breakfast with him at 9 a.m., and told him that dissolving      Congress was an error and should be reconsidered.       The government's image was further undetermined by raids on      the home of some key Chavez supporters. Among those singled      out were Tarek William Saab, who as chairman of the      congressional Foreign Relations Committee was regarded as Mr.      Chavez's main link to Iraq, Iran and Libya; and Ramon      Rodriguez Chacin, who as minister of the interior and justice      was in charge of the state spy apparatus.       At the same time, though, Mr. Chavez's supporters in the      poor neighborhoods of western Caracas were taking to the      streets. By early afternoon, thousands were congregating      outside Miraflores, demanding that Mr. Chavez be restored.       At Fort Tiuna, though, some 30 generals and admirals were      still arguing about who should get what post in the Carmona      government. ``This was grave for Carmona,'' said Gen. Rafael      Montero, a former minister of defense sympathetic to the      anti-Chavez forces. ``He didn't have the advice he needed.''       With the high command distracted, the presidential guard,      which was thought to be loyal to Mr. Chavez but had still not      been replaced, was able to retake control of Miraflores. ``We      never abandoned the president,'' said Col. Gonzalo Millan a      member of the palace guard. He added, ``Kings are the only      ones who do things by decree, but no one here is a king.''       In the interior of the country, unit commanders were also      beginning to defy the desk generals and to declare their      support for Mr. Chavez. At 1:30 p.m., Gen. Raul Baduel,      commander of a paratrooper brigade in Maracay in which Mr.      Chavez himself had once served, and four other senior field      officers announced they were rebelling against the new      government and began to organize a plan to ``rescue'' Mr.      Chavez from his captors.       Though he had by now been moved from Caracas to a naval      base on the coast, Mr. Chavez was still refusing to sign a      document of resignation. When a sympathetic corporal named      Juan Bautista Rodriguez, a member of the unit watching over      the deposed president, learned of Mr. Chavez's position, he      offered to smuggle out a message to that effect to encourage      the Chavez forces. ``I put it at the bottom of a trash can to      disguise it,'' Mr. Chavez said this week. ``Later I learned      that the soldier had recovered it. I don't know how he did      it, but he discreetly transmitted a fax to someone who got      the message to Miraflores.''       With the balance clearly shifting in favor of Mr. Chavez,      who had by now been moved to the Caribbean island of La      Orchila, the same military officers who had overthrown him      began to distance themselves from Mr. Carmona. At 4:30 p.m.      General Vazquez Velasco, still irate at not having been named      defense minister, told Mr. Carmona that military support of      his government would be withdrawn unless he revoked the      offending decree dissolving congress.       Mr. Carmona acted about half an hour later, but by then it      was too late. A few blocks away from the palace, the pro-     Chavez National Assembly was already convening to appoint      Diosdado Cabello, Mr. Chavez's vice president, as interim      president, as established by the Constitution.       Around 10 o'clock, Mr. Carmona stepped down and the      uprising was effectively over. Four Air Force helicopters      headed to La Orchila to pick up Mr. Chavez, who arrived in      triumph back at Miraflores around 3:00 a.m. on Sunday.       ``I was absolutely sure, completely certain, that we would      be back,'' Mr. Chavez said in a speech to his jubilant      supporters. ``But you know what? The only thing I couldn't      imagine was that we would return so rapidly.''                                       ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, Apr. 21, 2002]                        Divisions Over Venezuela         Flip-flop pits dislike for Chavez, issue of democracy                           (By Frida Ghitis)       Washington.--The news from Venezuela blew like a cool      breeze on a sweltering summer day for U.S. leaders in      Washington following those developments.       Administration officials, tense and tired from watching the      unraveling of the Middle East; edgy from suddenly facing      domestic criticism that President Bush's policies on      terrorism were losing their moral clarity with his call for      Israel to stop its actions against Palestinians; weary from      threats by Muslim oil producers to suspend oil shipments if      the United States didn't get Israel to stop attacking      Palestinians, suddenly found reason to rejoice. The word from      Venezuela brought a welcome bit of news. The troublesome,      often irritating president of the South American country, had      moved aside. A new president was taking over. At last, some      good news!       Not so fast. What occurred in Venezuela and, more      importantly, the way Washington reacted to it, has become a      major embarrassment for the Bush administration, which found      itself on the defensive, deny charges that, at the very      least, it knew about the coup before it happened. Even if      those charges are proved to be false, Washington's rejoicing      over a bungled coup that kept the Venezuelan out of office      for only 48 hours, left the administration open to charges      that it turned its back on democracy.       Most think of the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, as the      principal source of America's oil. But Venezuela, on the      northeastern corner of South America, is one of the world's      major oil producers. The country is the third largest      provider of oil to the United States, exporting about 1.5      million barrels to America every day. Venezuela, a member      of OPEC, long had been one of the organization's least      disciplined members, going over its quota frequently and      thus making it almost impossible for the oil cartel to      control prices. That all changed when the colorful Hugo      Chavez came to power.       Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper who had once led a failed      military coup of his own, was elected president      democratically with promises of bringing radical change to a      country that, although awash in petroleum, suffers from      horrific poverty. Just months before he took power in      Caracas, a barrel of oil was selling for about $10, less than      half today's price. President Chavez immediately set to      transform his country, and to revitalize the oil cartel.       Enjoying enormous popular support, Mr. Chavez tore down and      then rebuilt government institutions. He had a new      constitution written after his chosen delegates were approved      as the drafters of the document. He gained control of the      judiciary and the legislature, and he stacked just about      every part of government with his supporters, many of them      military men. In the process, Mr. Chavez managed to insult      the church, calling priests ``devils in vestments.'' He      routinely attacked the rich, calling them oligarchs who      should move to Miami. Most observers agreed, Mr. Chavez was      concentrating powers into his own hands, severely crippling      democratic institutions in his country. But he did it all      within the law.       Then Mr. Chavez set out to work on the world oil markets.      He paid visits to Muammar Kaddafi of Libya, to Saddam Hussein      in Baghdad, while continuing to develop a deeply personal      friendship with Fidel Castro of Cuba, constantly irritating      Washington. Mr. Chavez helped OPEC set production quotas and      stick to them. He was instrumental in producing a tightening      of oil supplies that brought oil prices to new levels.       It's not surprising then, that when Venezuela announced a      few days ago that Hugo Chavez was no longer its president,      oil prices took a sudden drop--about 6 percent (They went      back up after he was reinstated). The timing, for the      United States and many others, could not have been better.      Oil prices had gone up 25 percent this year alone, as the      American economy picks up steam, and as tensions in the      Middle East continue to mount. Only recently, Saddam      announced that he was stopping shipments of oil as a      gesture of support for the Palestinians, and Iranian      President Mohammed Khatami (the ``moderate'' Iranian)      reiterated his country's call for Muslim countries to stop      selling oil for 30 days, also in support of the      Palestinians.       What superb timing by the masses in Caracas! On April 11, a      large protest by Venezuelan workers, angry over Mr. Chavez's      installation of a new board of directors of the traditionally      independent national oil company, spun out of control.      Tensions had been building for months. The country is sharply      divided, with Mr. Chavez's populist rhetoric intensifying      class differences. Major military figures had come forth      calling for his resignation, and what was once a sky-high      approval rating had dipped to about 30 percent. When the      protests were met with gunfire from Chavez supporters, the      military stepped in and took over. They installed Pedro      Carmona Estanga, a business leader who didn't last long.       The head of the country's largest business association was      declared president, with an announcement that Mr. Chavez had      resigned. But Chavez supporters refused to believe their man      had folded. A top executive at the oil company said the      country would start pumping more oil, probably exceeding its      OPEC quota.       It is unlikely that a single Latin American president felt      that Mr. Chavez really would be missed. And yet, the      Organization of American States condemned the Venezuelan      coup. Almost all democratically elected leaders in the      Americas made it clear that, like him or not, Mr. Chavez      legally, democratically had been elected president.      Removing him constituted an affront against the principle      of democracy, a principle worth preserving, even when one      disagrees with the outcome of the process. The president      of Mexico declared that he would not recognize the new      government. Statements throughout the hemisphere condemned      what appeared to be a coup. The United States, however,      did not speak out against the overthrow of a      democratically elected president. American officials      stated that Mr. Chavez himself was responsible for the      events that lead to his ouster.       The United States did itself enormous damage. Latin America      and, for that matter, much of the Third World, where the      image of America as a nation that supported despotic regimes      that suited its goals during the Cold War has been changing      very slowly. When the United States sent troops to Haiti to      ``restore democracy'' many in the hemisphere believed perhaps      America was truly standing up for the democracy it claimed to      hold so dear. That image now has been set back.       Worse yet, many in Latin America believe that the Bush      administration, with a sharp focus on controlling oil      markets, played an important part in the failed coup.      Washington is denying it ever lent even tacit support to      plotters although it admits that Chavez adversaries did seek      support, and that the man who took office for a short time      after deposing Mr. Chavez was, in fact, in contact with Otto      J. Reich at the State Department. Mr. Reich is in charge of      Inter-American affairs at the State Department.       The government says the United States did nothing to      encourage the assault on democracy. And yet, it is guilty, at      the very least, of badly mishandling the crisis in Caracas.      The mistakes of mid-April may take years to repair.                                  ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, Apr. 21, 2002]                Latin Policy Chief Gives Little to Foes       Washington.--Reacting to criticism of the reaction to the      resignation and revival of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,      the Bush administration's chief policy-maker for Latin      America, Otto J. Reich, came back swinging. ``We have      reviewed our actions since last Thursday [April 11],'' he      said. ``I find very little that I would do differently.''       Such is the confidence of Mr. Reich, a former ambassador to      Venezuela whose conservative credentials and combative      demeanor have made him popular among Republicans and stirred      the suspicions of Democrats.       After a few short months, Mr. Reich is facing his second      crisis in Latin America (the first was the collapse of the      Argentina economy, and he has taken a hands-off approach to      it). He is thoughtful and meticulous, with experience in the      region as a development agency official, diplomat, and      businessman.       He also is a fierce partisan who cedes little ground to his      opponents, particularly those who fail to share his concern      over the threats posed by President Fidel Castro of Cuba and,      more recently, by Mr. Chavez, who has built close ties with      Castro.       In January, after Senate Democrats denied Mr. Reich a      hearing on the Latin policy post and refused to confirm him,      President Bush granted him a recess appointment, which allows      him to serve until the end of the congressional session--and      beyond, if reappointed.       Secretary of State Colin Powell fully backs Mr. Reich, said      the secretary's spokesman, Philip Reeker, calling him a ``key      player''.       Some of the animus toward Mr. Reich stems from his      involvement in what became known as the Iran-control scandal      in the Reagan administration. As director of the State      Department's Office of Public Diplomacy, Mr. Reich tried to      influence public opinion in support of the Nicaraguan      contras, the General Accounting Office found, by resorting to      ``prohibited covert propaganda'' like preparing newspaper      opinion articles for pro-contra authors.       Mr. Reich has denied wrong-doing and never was charged.      Recently, in his first major policy speech as assistant      secretary, he made light of the controversy, greeting the      ``former colleagues'' and ``unindicted co-conspirators'' in      the crowd. Then he complained, ``That was supposed to get a      better laugh than that.''       Otto Juan Reich was born in 1945 in Cuba, which he fled as      a teenager. He thrived in his adoptive country, earning a      bachelor's degree at the University of North Carolina and a      master's in Latin American studies at Georgetown University.       His uncompromising views on Cuba have made him a pillar of      support for the American trade embargo of four decades.       His appointment was championed by Cuban exiles, who      supported Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, and viewed as a      setback to advocates of more open contracts with Havana. He      has criticized corruption in Latin America and has advocated      free trade.       When the crisis flared up in Venezuela, Mr. Reich, who had      made no secret of his disdain for Mr. Chavez, was ready to      respond. He had been the Venezuela envoy in the late `80s.      After that, as a lobbyist he numbered among his clients Mobil      Oil, which has interest in Venezuela.       ``My entire life I've done things that have prepared me for      this job,`` Mr. Reich said last week.       Mr. Reich said the administration had had no involvement or      knowledge--indeed had been operating under an ``information      blackout'' in the first hours of the revolt on April 11.       He defended his decision on the next day to establish      contact with Pedro Carmona Estanga, the business leader who      sought to replace Mr. Chavez. He said the administration      would have been criticized even more harshly had it failed to      warn Mr. Carmona of its desire to see democratic processes      respected.       ``I think it would be irresponsible not to do it,'' Mr.      Reich said.                          ____________________
