  On November 4, 1995, after a major peace rally, then-Prime Minister Rabin was gunned-down by an Israeli nationalist. Rabin's brutal assassination ended the life of a man who lived for peace.  Today, with renewed terrorism and violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories, leaders should look to the example of Mr. Rabin, who forged peace against long odds. His assassin may have ended his life, but his message must live on.  During Mr. Rabin's first term as Israel's Prime Minister, he laid the foundation for peace with Egypt by concluding the Sinai Interim Agreement on September 1, 1975.  The eventual 1979 Camp David Peace Treaty officially ended hostilities between the two nations. Importantly, Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel. Today, because of Mr. Rabin's work, Egypt and Israel remain at peace.  During Mr. Rabin's second term as Prime Minister, he continued to seek peace with Israel's neighbors. He led the effort to sign the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority, and which serves as a framework for the creation of a Palestinian state today.  For their efforts, Mr. Rabin, Yasir Arafat and Shimon Peres won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize.  That same year, Israel and Jordan also signed a peace treaty, making Jordan the second Arab state to establish peace with Israel.  On this, the twentieth anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, I offer my condolences to his family. May they continue to find solace in the legacy of a leader who sought peace when others sought war.  May leaders all around the world look to him for inspiration on how to lead courageously and chart a more peaceful future for one's people.                          ____________________
