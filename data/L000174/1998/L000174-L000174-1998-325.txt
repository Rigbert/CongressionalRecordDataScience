President, today I rise to recognize two very special Vermont business people. Tom and Sally Fegley are the owners and founders of Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates of Brattleboro, Vermont. For the past two years I have been pleased to nominate Tom and Sally for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Person of the Year award for the state of Vermont. This year, I am proud to announce that Tom and Sally Fegley are the recipients of this prestigious award.  Eight and a half years ago, the Fegleys had the courage to move to Vermont and risk their lives' savings to undertake their start-up business in chocolates, a field in which neither of them had any previous experience. With hard work and intense dedication they have built this business to more than $1 million in gross sales in 1997. Their products are sold in all fifty states and they are exported all over the world, including Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, South Africa and the Netherlands. Tom and Sally's entrepreneurial savvy has helped to spread the distinctive high quality of Vermont specialty foods across the globe.  The Fegley's chocolates are so unique they have received five federal trademarks for their chocolates ranging from ``Vermont Pasture Patties'' to ``Cowlicks.'' In addition, their products have won eight national awards and have received media coverage ranging from ``Good Morning, America'' and ``The Today Show'' to such magazines as Bon Appetit, Fine Cooking, and Mademoiselle, as well as newspapers including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.  I remember the first time that Marcelle and I visited Tom and Sally's shop in 1992. We were especially impressed with its old-fashioned atmosphere and Vermont country charm. A few years ago, Tom and Sally decided to combine the sale of their handmade chocolates and candies with the sale of Vermont folkart. This gallery displays the handicrafts of Vermonters as the Fegleys display the fruits of their own handicraft. This innovative combination makes visiting Tom and Sally's a unique and charming experience while promoting Vermont's distinct character.  Not only have Tom and Sally made an imprint on Vermont's specialty food industry, but they have made an even larger contribution to their community. Perhaps the Fegleys should be recognized more for what they do for others than for their business success. From donating chocolates to local charities, to helping a local apple orchard after vandals destroyed the apple trees, Tom and Sally's involvement and contributions have expanded beyond the business industry and have made them important members of Vermont's communities.  I am pleased that the Fegleys have been named 1998 Vermont Small Business Persons of the Year. I believe that they embody what Vermont is all about--a fine tradition of quality products with a strong sense of community.                          ____________________
