 President, it is my great pleasure to recognize Ms. Hazel Wolf of Seattle, Washington, in honor of her 101st birthday on Wednesday, March 10, 1999. Ms. Wolf, a great, great grand-mother, is a tireless advocate for conservation, environmental protection and social justice throughout the Pacific Northwest. A dedicated volunteer, community activist and leader, Ms. Wolf serves as an outstanding example for all Americans.  Ms. Wolf became involved in the Audubon Society in the early-1960s and had a hand in starting 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in Washington State, plus one in her birthplace of Victoria, British Columbia. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide conference to bring together environmentalists and Native American tribes. For three decades she has served as Secretary of the Seattle Audubon Society chapter, and for 17 years she has edited an environmental newsletter, ``Outdoors West''. In addition, she is among the founders of Seattle's Community Coalition for Environmental Justice. She is a frequent speaker at schools and environmental conferences throughout the Northwest.  In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious Medal of Excellence. The Seattle Audubon chapter has created the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for the Environment'' endowment, which will help educate youth about conservation. Ms. Wolf is also the recipient of the 1997 Chevron Conservation Award, the $2,000 prize from which she contributed to the Seattle Audubon Society. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a 116-acre wetland named after her and on the other side of the Cascade Mountains near Yakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name.  Hazel Wolf retired from her career as a legal secretary in 1965. She has proven repeatedly that significant and lasting contributions to society are a function neither of career nor of age, but of hard work, perseverance and vision. As her family and friends gather to celebrate her 101st birthday, I want to wish Ms. Wolf continued success and good health, and to thank her for being an inspiration to me and countless others. Happy Birthday, Hazel.                          ____________________
