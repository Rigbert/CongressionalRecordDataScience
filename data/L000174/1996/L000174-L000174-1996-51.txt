President, it is the understanding of welfare conferees regarding the reconciliation bill that that bill exempts electronic benefits transfers from coverage of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. The Department of Agriculture is empowered to establish regulations which will provide some protections against recipients' loss of benefits through electronic transfer systems. We encourage the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] to develop similar regulations which will require procedures to minimize the losses of benefits for aid to families with dependent children recipients. It is also the conferees' understanding that nothing in this bill in any way prevents or discourages HHS from promulgating these essential regulations.
