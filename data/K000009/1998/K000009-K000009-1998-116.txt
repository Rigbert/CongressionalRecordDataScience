Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Sophie Madej, a remarkable woman, a Polish-American from Chicago who recently closed the doors to her neighborhood diner, The Busy Bee Restaurant. Ms. Madej's Busy Bee was a beloved community gathering place for 33 years. Ms. Madej purchased the restaurant in 1965, fourteen years after she courageously immigrated to the United States from Germany. Her country of birth was Poland though, a land which she was forced to flee in 1943 due to the Nazi's labor laws. Ms. Madej, who recently turned seventy on July 5, plans on visiting her homeland during her retirement.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I submit today, for the record, an article from The Chicago Sun-Times that acknowledges the work of Sophie Madej and the closing of her Busy Bee Restaurant. Although, the Busy Bee will be missed, all of those who dined there will have many lasting memories. May I wish Ms. Madej continued happiness and success.                          ____________________
