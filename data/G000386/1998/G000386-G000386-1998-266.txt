 President, on behalf of the leader, I will announce today's business. Today, the Senate will resume the defense authorization bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate amendments to the defense bill under short time agreements.  As ordered, at 3 o'clock, the Senate will begin 2 hours of debate on the nomination of Susan Mollway to be U.S. district judge. It is expected that the first vote of today's session will occur at 5 p.m. on the confirmation of that nomination.  As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed on Friday to the DOD bill. The cloture vote will occur tomorrow, Tuesday, June 23, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments. The cloture vote will not necessarily be the first vote of Tuesday's session, so Members may expect early morning votes on amendments to the defense bill.  The majority leader would like to remind all Members that the Independence Day recess is fast approaching. The cooperation of all Members will be necessary for the Senate to complete work on many important items, including appropriations bills, the Higher Education Act, the Department of Defense authorization bill, the conference reports on the Coverdell education bill and the IRS reform bill, and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
