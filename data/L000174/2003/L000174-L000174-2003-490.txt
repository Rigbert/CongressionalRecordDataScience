President, I rise today to speak about a truly remarkable Vermonter who delivers ``justice on wheels'' to victims of domestic abuse.  Wynona Ward is the founder and director of Have Justice--Will Travel, HJWT, an innovative, mobile, multi-service program that assists rural victims of domestic violence through the legal process. She accomplishes this by combining her present profession as an attorney with her experiences as a truck driver to provide a variety of services--including free legal aid, in-home counseling, and transportation to and from court hearings and other social service appointments to rural families trapped in the generational cycle of abuse.  Based on her pioneering and inspirational work on behalf of domestic violence victims and their families, Wynona has been selected by Lifetime Television to be honored in ``Lifetime's Achievement Awards: Women Changing the World,'' which will air tonight. An independent panel of judges reviewed thousands of nominations before selecting six women for the honor. Wynona received the ``Champion Award,'' presented to a woman who overcame ``seemingly insurmountable odds to create a positive change for herself or others.''  Wynona was born into a poor family where alcoholism and abuse was routine--her father beat her mother and his 5 children, and sexually assaulted his daughters. Family violence was an accepted way of life then in rural Vermont. Local doctors treated the black-and-blues and other injuries thatfrequently appeared on the bodies of Wynona, her mother and her siblings, but they never once asked how those bruises got there. No law required that they be reported, and even if suspected abuse were reported, law officials would hesitate to interfere with goings on in the home. The family had no choice but to suffer in secret.  To escape her abusive father, Wynona married young and then worked 15 years with her husband, Harold, in their own trucking business driving their 18-wheeler tractor-trailer unit cross-country. Years later, she received word from home that the abuse she had known was beginning for the next generation of her family. Wynona decided to take action by revealing the family secret so that her family could no longer deny that abuse existed, and volunteered as the victim's advocate for the child who had been sexually abused. Her experience led her to her current career after realizing how traumatizing and confusing the legal system can be for victims and their families.  After she turned 40, Wynona entered the Adult Degree Program at Vermont College of Norwich University. She and Harold continued to run their trucking business, and as they crossed the U.S., she completed her B.A. on a laptop in the living compartment of their truck. She then entered Vermont Law School, and in April 2000, she passed the bar and was sworn in as a licensed Vermont Attorney.  Drawing on her personal experience as a survivor of childhood domestic abuse, Wynona created a new way to bridge the legal, geographical, psychological, cultural and economic gaps that exist for battered women and their children. She came up with the concept of Have Justice--Will Travel from the knowledge that battered rural women living in isolation often lack education or job skills and access to telephones and transportation. They need comprehensive assistance in achieving self-reliance and independence. HJWT serves about 50 clients a year, and offers assistance to several hundred more women not only in Vermont but those in rural areas throughout the United States.  ``Have Justice--Will Travel'' has been successful in serving women and children throughout the State of Vermont. It is a shining example for grassroots domestic violence assistance on a national level. I have met this extraordinary woman many times, and I never fail to be inspired and humbled by her dramatic personal story and her venture into a non-traditional career. I salute Wynona Ward today as a true champion.                          ____________________
