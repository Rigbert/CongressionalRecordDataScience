Speaker, reclaiming my time, everybody likes to talk about the Senate. What the gentleman has ignored is that I said the bill is in committee and in 340 days has not been brought to this floor. If that is the gentleman's policy, he has not brought it to the floor for consideration.  By the way, when he talks about a broader issue of immigration, we agree with him. He has not brought a comprehensive immigration reform bill to the floor, either.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
