Speaker, I had the great privilege of coming to Congress in 1981. Some of my colleagues on the floor were here when I came. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) and I came in the same class. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the dean of the Massachusetts delegation, was already here. Those who came after 1987 lost an extraordinary experience, and that experience was to serve in this House with one of America's great political leaders, so defined by Bob Dole. His name, of course, was Thomas P. O'Neill. He was a large man physically, but his heart was much larger, and his commitment to people even larger still.  Those of us who came to the Congress at that time obviously met Tip, serving under Speaker O'Neill and with him. But shortly thereafter, we had an extraordinary privilege, and that privilege was to meet his partner. Mildred A. O'Neill, affectionately known to all of us as Millie, became, in many respects, at least for those who were young enough to consider her as such, as sort of the den mother of the Democratic House. She was a wonderful, warm, committed, devoted human being. She was the kind of human being that everybody would want to be born and have as their grandmother or their mother, period, because she was filled with love and caring for humankind. And my, how she loved our Speaker. And my, how our Speaker loved her.  We talk about family values. It is easy to talk about family values, but I suggest that no one has lived family values any more than Tip O'Neill and Millie O'Neill.  Millie O'Neill was born in 1914, the same year that my mother was born. My mother, unfortunately, passed away in 1975 at a too-young age. Millie O'Neill lived until just a day ago. She died at the age of 89, having seen extraordinary history in her State and in her country and, indeed, with her husband, had impacted on that history in a most positive way.  When Tip O'Neill left the Congress, or shortly before, there was a poll taken in the South. And the two most popular figures in the United States, political figures at that time, were Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill in the South.  Now, obviously, they disagreed on many issues. So what was the cause of that support and popularity? It was because they were both viewed as two men of principle and the courage of their convictions. People could disagree with either one, but there was that respect for their character that was reflected. Millie O'Neill was a critical component of the character of her husband. They had been married for over half a century. Tip in his book referenced how loyal, how important Millie was to his life, both at times of triumph and times of trial.  Mr. Speaker, I count myself uniquely privileged to have come to Congress in time to know and become a friend of Mildred A. O'Neill. I believe she loved each and every one of us; and there is no doubt in my mind, Mr. Speaker, that each and every one of us loved her.  Let me say that I was also advantaged because, on the other side of the aisle, there was a leader who shared the compassion and commitment to this institution that Tip had, and that was Bob Michel. Bob has a wonderful wife, Corrine. She is ill today, and I know that she, too, and Bob Michel will grieve for the loss of their friend. It was a time, frankly, I say to my colleagues, when Bob Michel and Tip O'Neill knew that they were friends, knew that they had different views; but both were committed to this institution, and their wives, Millie and Corrine, were fast and true friends as well. America has lost a great American, a great grandmother, a greatmother, and a great supporter of this institution.                          ____________________
