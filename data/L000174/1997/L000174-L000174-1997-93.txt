President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a profoundly disturbing report issued by Human Rights Watch on July 18 about the abduction of children by a heavily armed Ugandan rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army.  While the precise number of children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army is unknown, estimates indicate that over the past 2 years, 3 to 5 thousand children have escaped from the rebel group. It is reported that an equal number of abducted children remain in captivity and an unknown number have died.  According to Human Rights Watch, abduction is only the beginning of the extreme violence and degradation faced by these children. Often as young as 8 years old, the children are tortured, raped, and sometimes killed by members of the Lord's Resistance Army. They are forced to take part in combat, serving as front line forces in battles against the Ugandan Army and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. The children also tell of being made to beat and kill fellow captives who have been apprehended in their efforts to escape. The physical and emotional trauma resulting from such experiences can cause lifelong problems to those children that do survive.  The abduction of children for military purposes not only violates the provisions of common article 3 of the Geneva conventions of 1949, international standards established by protocol II to the Geneva conventions of 1949, and the Convention of the Rights of the Child, it violates the most basic principles of human morality.  It is reported that the camps established by the Ugandan Government to contend with displaced children and their families are extremely inadequate. Crowded conditions and a lack of food and sanitation facilities have resulted in malnutrition, disease, and death among those who have sought refuge in these camps. Trauma counseling centers for children who have escaped from the rebels are sorely in need of basic supplies and qualified staff. Human Rights Watch reports that the children who are told to leave in order to make room for new arrivals often have nowhere to go and no means of support.  Mr. President, the phenomenon of the child soldier is growing not only in Uganda, but around the world. If a more concerted effort is not made to address the outrageous abuses these children face, Uganda and the rest of the international community will be contending with the consequences far in the future.                          ____________________
