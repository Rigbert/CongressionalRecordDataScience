 President, I believe the bottom line here is balance. The balance is, who should bear the cost of fraud? That is the question before the Senate today. Who should bear the cost of fraud?  Should it be the perpetrators, or should it be the victims? It should be the perpetrators, and never the victims. I think that is a bottom line of American jurisprudence.  This bill, if it were to pass, would change that, unless we adopted the amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself, Senators Bryan, Boxer, and Sarbanes.  This amendment makes sense. Why do we think the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission supports it? We do not need any more Keatings in America. We did not need anything close to that in America. We do not need to pass a bill up here without protection of the innocent people that invest. We should never, never, Mr. President, try to protect the perpetrators of wrong in America.  I believe this amendment makes a lot of sense. I urge my colleagues at the proper time to vote for it.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
