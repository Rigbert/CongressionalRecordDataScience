 You have a whole lot of people who do not have access to a dentist, which these Federally Qualified Health Centers now provide, and mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs.  So I thank my friend from Illinois. I am sure the Senator and I are going to work together to make sure we, in fact, are successful in keeping people out of the emergency room, keeping them out of the hospital, by enabling them to get the medical care they need when they need it. I look forward to working with my friend on that.
