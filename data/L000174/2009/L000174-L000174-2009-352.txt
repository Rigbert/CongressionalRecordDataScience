I would urge them to come to the floor so we can move forward, as most of the amendments pending or about to be pending have absolutely nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, have nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the bill on the floor, have everything to do with a bill that is coming up next week from the Banking Committee. So I would urge the Banking Committee to come to the floor and speak to the amendments that are all within the jurisdiction of their committee.  I mention this because if we don't, the other alternative is to accept everything and go immediately to final passage. I don't think that would be responsible because then the fraud bill that virtually everybody in this body, Republicans and Democrats, supports is going to die because it won't go past the other body. I realize every Senator has a right to offer any amendment he or she wants, but at some point we have to be realistic. If we are against the people who are committing fraud on the American taxpayers, something for which all of us have made speeches that we are in favor of stopping them--newspapers from the right to the left have editorialized in favor of stopping them--let's be honest and actually pass a bill that does it.
