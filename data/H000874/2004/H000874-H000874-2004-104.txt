But to some degree, we ourselves have created 10,000 pages in which Americans normally look to how do I reduce my obligation in taxes. That is a normal thing for people to do, and the fact that we have made it so complicated allows some people to take advantage of loopholes that perhaps were not contemplated but exist; and the unfairness then is not only to our working-class, middle-class families but also to those competitors of theirs who do not take advantage of those loopholes, who keep jobs in America, who are paying their fair share of taxes here in America.  So tax fairness is not only tax fairness in terms of middle-class taxpayers but, frankly, all taxpayers so they can have the confidence that their liability based upon the income that they make will be proportionately the same as their competitor, as their fellow citizen.
