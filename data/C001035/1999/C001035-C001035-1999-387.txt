President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee. As the Senate's only physician, he brings a unique perspective and a very useful perspective to these important health care issues. He has been a leader in working to improve still further on the work that was done in the HELP Committee.  The task force has been working on this issue for some time. We first started working on the issue in January of last year. We met every week for many months. That is an indication of our determination to produce a balanced bill that will really make a difference to millions of Americans.  Our efforts did not cease. Once we went to the HELP Committee, we continued our work, and we are continuing our work today. That is why we have come up with this amendment to further strengthen and improve the legislation reported by the HELP Committee.  I yield as much time as he would like to the chairman of the HELP Committee, the Senator from Vermont.
