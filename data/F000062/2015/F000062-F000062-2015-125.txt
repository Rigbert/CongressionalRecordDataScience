 President, I thank both Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their remarks. I particularly wish to thank Senator McCain, whose life experience, for me, has been a guidepost. I don't know anyone in this body who is more standup--and can sometimes be more stubborn, but this all comes into play as an important thing--and stands for the real, true, major issues this country faces.  I will never forget a conversation I had with him on the plane back from Guantanamo. When he spoke in the Kennedy Caucus Room and used the tap language he learned as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and to see this man, so many years since that time, tap out messages that were meant for prison mates in other cells with such speed and alacrity certainly indicated that this was a very deep impression which was made on his life. I think the fact that he has shared that with others, including me, is very important.  I want Senator McCain to know how much I appreciate his work on this and how grateful we are for his service to this country. He has unique courage and unique stamina, and maybe that is just all-American. Again, I thank the Senator from Arizona very much for his work, and the same for Senator Reed, the ranking member on this committee. Senator Reed is military-American through and through. Having his support has been terrific.  Again, I thank both of them very much. It was a pleasure to work with both of my colleagues, and I hope this passes.
