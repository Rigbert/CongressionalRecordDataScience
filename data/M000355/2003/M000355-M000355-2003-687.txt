 President, briefly, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his contribution to this debate. We were discussing off the floor the fact that Wyoming got added to the crisis list--today, actually. Talk about a State in which the distances are great and the problems are compounded by it; Wyoming has to be at the top of the list. I thank the Senator.  I yield the floor.
