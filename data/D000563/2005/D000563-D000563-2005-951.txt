If I understand what the minority leader has said to the Senate, we have pending amendments before the Senate on the Department of Defense authorization bill which will not survive, are not likely to survive, cannot even be considered because of this procedural decision by the majority leader, by Senator Frist. And if I understand what the Senator from Nevada has said, he has said that included in the amendments which will fall, will not be considered this week, would be an amendment he wants to offer to help totally disabled veterans, an amendment by Senator Nelson of Florida to provide funds for the widows and orphans of those who die in combat, an amendment by Senator Kerry to provide for housing for 1 year for the family of a soldier who dies in combat, the amendment by Senator Murray to provide childcare for soldiers' families when the soldier is deployed overseas, and my amendment to make up the pay difference for National Guard and Reserve who are activated and lose money from their civilian pay. And if I understand the Senator from Nevada, he is saying these amendments, these five or six I have read, we have been told we won't have time to consider this week.  If I understand the Senator from Nevada, he has said we don't have time to deal with the totally disabled veterans, the widows and orphans of those who fall in combat, and those Guard and Reserve members who are activated, we don't have time for that because we have to move to a bill for the gun lobby, for the National Rifle Association.  If I understand what the Senator from Nevada says, it is more important for us to do our best for the gun lobbyists in their three-piece suits than for the men and women in uniform who are fighting and dying for our country. That seems to me to be the agenda and the priority of the majority leader who has come to the floor today.  Is that my understanding of what the Senator from Nevada has said?
