President, I am going to be brief because I know Chairman Hatch and I are going to be propounding some unanimous consent requests here in a moment.  On this currency issue, I want it understood that this is a serious, serious issue, and it is absolutely essential that our trade laws include tough enforceable currency rules and that we put in place those rules without doing damage to American monetary policy or to our ability to tackle the big economic challenges in the days ahead.  The Senate has a choice between the amendment offered by Senator Hatch and me and the amendment offered by Senator Portman and Senator Stabenow. My view is this. The Portman amendment could outsource the question of the Federal Reserve's intent and decisionmaking to the whims of an international tribunal. This could take tools out of the economic toolbox that we could need--need greatly--during a potential financial crisis. We hope it will never happen, but the bottom line is the Congress must not set up the possibility of collateral damage for the Fed and our dollar.  The right solution, which Chairman Hatch and I have worked to offer as an alternative, will make sure that America gets the upside of cracking down on currency manipulators and avoids the downside of limiting the Federal Reserve's toolkit of monetary policy. Our view is that we strike the right balance. We make sure that we are going to have the widest array of effective tools available, including strong, enforceable rules. I think we ought to take that route. The alternative could subject our country to disputes over our own monetary policies. That means, as I indicated, that the alternative--the Portman-Stabenow amendment--would, in effect, outsource questions of the Federal Reserve's intent to the whims of an international tribunal.  Now, the Portman amendment tries to carve out domestic monetary policy. It sure sounds like a good idea. But when we have opened ourselves up to attack over our policies, other countries will not have to take our word that our policies are on the up and up. Even with that carve-out, other countries can still come after us.  For example, many countries argued that our quantitative easing policy unfairly devalued the dollar. They were dead wrong on that. But the Senate shouldn't do anything that could strengthen the hand of those countries that want to attack our monetary policies.  Now that Chairman Hatch is here, I wish to propound a unanimous consent request.  Over the past few days, Chairman Hatch and I have been working in a bipartisan and cooperative fashion to come up with a balanced package of amendments that can be voted on. I very much appreciate the work of the chairman and his bipartisan leadership and particularly of my northwest colleague, Senator Murray. It appears regrettable that we have come up short, but for the benefit of colleagues, I wish to propound a unanimous consent request that would be acceptable to our side. These are amendments that I believe are important for the Senate to consider as part of this debate.  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the following first-degree amendments to the Hatch substitute be made pending during today's session of the Senate and that no other first-degree amendments be in order:  Cruz-Grassley No. 1384 on immigration; Menendez No. 1430 on trafficking; Sullivan No. 1246 on fish and shellfish; Warren No. 1328 on financial services; Daines No. 1418 on Indian tribes; Donnelly No. 1406 on training programs; Sessions No. 1233 on congressional approval; Boxer No. 1371 on minimum wage; Paul No. 1383 on bonuses for cost cutters; Manchin No. 1413 on State effects; Paul No. 1408 on auditing the Fed; Cardin No. 1230 on human rights; Brown-Portman No. 1252 on leveling playing field; Whitehouse No. 1387 on unregulated fishing; Markey No. 1308 on clean air and water; Merkley No. 1404 on food information; Casey-Murphy No. 1436 on Buy American; Baldwin No. 1317 on trade remedy; Bennet No. 1309 on poverty/hunger;  Further, that the time until 5 p.m. today be equally divided in the usual form; that at 5 p.m. today the Senate vote in relation to the following amendments in the order listed: Hatch-Wyden No. 1411 on currency; Portman-Stabenow No. 1299 on currency; Warren No. 1327 on ISDS; Flake No. 1243 on striking TAA; Brown No. 1251 on China docking; Cruz-Grassley No. 1384 on immigration; Menendez No. 1430 on trafficking; Sullivan No. 1246 on fish and shellfish; Warren No. 1328 on financial services; Daines No. 1418 on Indian tribes; Donnelly No. 1406 on training programs; Boxer No. 1371 on minimum wage; Manchin No. 1413 on State effects; Cardin No. 1230 on human rights; Brown-Portman No. 1252 on level playing field; Whitehouse No. 1387 on unregulated fishing; Markey No. 1308 on clean air and water; Merkley No. 1404 on food information; Casey-Murphy No. 1436 on Buy American; Baldwin No. 1317 on trade remedy; Bennet No. 1309 on poverty/hunger;  Further, that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the votes; that all after the Brown amendment No. 1251 be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption; that upon disposition of the Bennet amendment No. 1309, all other pending amendments, including Sessions No. 1233, Paul No. 1383, Paul No. 1408, Inhofe No. 1312, McCain No. 1226, and Shaheen No. 1227, to the Hatch substitute be withdrawn; that all postcloture time be considered expired; and the Senate vote on the adoption of the Hatch substitute amendment, as amended; finally, if cloture is invoked on H.R. 1314, all postcloture time be yielded back, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended.
