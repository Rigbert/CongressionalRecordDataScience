President, the advent of nuclear power more than 50 years ago brought with it both great promise and great responsibility. Our ability to harness the power of the atom has paid substantial dividends for our society, but it has also left us with the formidable challenge of safely storing the byproducts of nuclear power generation. This is a challenge our Nation must meet so that future generations are not endangered by today's nuclear waste.  Presently, all of the spent fuel from nuclear power plants and research reactors throughout the country remains on-site at each reactor. None of these facilities was designed to safely store that waste on a permanent basis, and leaving spent fuel in temporary storage around the Nation poses both a security threat and an environmental hazard. In Illinois, nearly half of our electricity is generated from nuclear power. Our State contains seven nuclear powerplants, two nuclear research reactors, and more commercial nuclear waste than any other State.  We need to find a safe and permanent way to store this material, and such a storage site has been proposed at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I have been to Yucca Mountain, which is located 90 miles from Las Vegas on Federal land at the remote Nevada nuclear test site. The waste would be stored more than 600 feet underground but more than 500 feet above the water table, sealed in steel containers placed under a titanium shield. A security force at the Nevada test site is in place to protect the area, and the airspace around Yucca Mountain is already restricted.  When this issue has come before Congress in the past, I have opposed efforts to move waste to a temporary facility at Yucca Mountain before there was a scientific determination of whether waste could be safely stored there on a permanent basis. I had no interest in moving this waste to a temporary place, only to move it again when a permanent repository is finally determined. I also opposed earlier measures that would have mandated dangerously low standards for environmental protection at the site.  Recently, however, I have been encouraged by the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency has established radiation and groundwater contamination standards for the Yucca Mountain storage site. These standards were derived from recommendations by experts at the National Academy of Sciences and were developed after extensive public comment and scientific analysis. All of these standards greatly exceed the standards debated by Congress in the two previous bills I opposed. Under three bills Congress considered in the past on this issue, the EPA would have been required to issue a single standard limiting the lifetime risk of premature cancer death to 1 in 1,000, or .001. The current EPA standard assumes a risk of 8.5 in 1,000,000, or .0000085. Furthermore, these bills would have prohibited a standard for groundwater, which EPA has now put in place. If the Department of Energy is able to move forward with a licensing application for Yucca Mountain, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be charged with making sure that the Department of Energy proves it can meet the EPA's standards. If it cannot prove this, the Yucca Mountain project cannot move forward.  No site will ever be perfect for the storage of high-level nuclear waste, but I believe the studies which have already been conducted and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission review still to come provide sufficient assurances that Yucca Mountain is the most appropriate site available and should be used as the permanent national nuclear waste repository.  I am still concerned, however, with the movement of thousands of tons of nuclear waste across the country to Nevada. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Illinois would rank seventh in truck shipments in what is called the ``mostly truck scenario.'' The same Energy Department analysis concludes that Illinois would rank sixth in rail shipments in the ``mostly rail scenario.'' Although waste has been shipped through Illinois and other states in the past, approving Yucca Mountain would initiate the largest waste shipping campaign in the history of our country, both in terms of the number of shipments and the amount of miles traveled for high level nuclear waste.  Unless we scrutinize safety factors and security risks, the large-scale transportation of radioactive materials has the potential to cause a host of serious challenges to cities and communities along shipping routes. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has expressed concerns about the transportation plan, and I am submitting for the Record a letter sent to President Bush on this matter, signed by Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and 17 other mayors. This issue is all the more important in light of the terrorist threats we are likely to face in the years ahead.  Illinois is home to one of the busiest transportation corridors in the Nation, putting our State squarely at the intersection of the nuclear crossroads. With the safety of Illinoisans at stake, finding the safest way to move nuclear waste to a location where it poses the least risk is imperative.  That is why I am introducing legislation in the Senate that would direct the Federal Government to develop a comprehensive safety program for nuclear waste transportation. This legislation would require the waste containment casks to be tested to ensure they could withstand intense fires, high-speed collisions and other threats that may occur during transport. My bill also would require States to be consulted on the selection of transportation routes and would require a 2-week advance notification of waste shipments. I also would ban inland waterway shipments of nuclear waste, require dedicated trains and establish a minimum number of trained escorts to accompany each nuclear waste convoy. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues who share my interest in this legislation.  Congress should move forward with making Yucca Mountain the central repository for our Nation's nuclear waste. It is, I am convinced, the best solution to a complicated problem we have debated for decades. But before shipments to Yucca Mountain begin, we need to establish a transportation plan to ensure the safety and security of the communities that lie in the path of those shipments, and we must begin that work today.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                The U.S. Conference of Mayors,                                                February 23, 2002.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Your approval of Yucca Mountain in      Nevada as a nuclear waste repository was a historic moment in      the history of the project. Quite literally, it is the      culmination of over 50 years of scientific research and      analysis. Since the Atomic Energy Act was passed in 1954, the      federal government has been searching for methods to dispose      of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.       As a single largest federal government project in the      history of the United States, we acknowledge that the Yucca      Mountain project has detractors and supporters. Regardless of      the final repository location, we have serious concerns about      the transportation of spent nuclear fuel from reactors all      over the country to Yucca Mountain or any other repository.       So far, the preliminary estimates that have been released      call for up to 10 shipments of nuclear fuel each day for      close to 40 years. These shipments will travel through      America's cities past our schools, homes and places of      business.       In 1996, The United States Conference of Mayors adopted      policy on the transportation of radioactive waste that calls      for the federal government to fund training and equipment      that will be needed by local emergency response personnel      along transportation routes, to upgrade medical facilities      which would treat victims of transportation accidents, and to      upgrade highway and railroad or highway bypasses to ensure      safe transportation corridors. It also calls on the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission to certify shipping transportation      containers after a public process that includes both physical      testing and computer modeling to ensure that the containers      can withstand severe accidents.       As mayors, we are concerned that the Department of Energy      (DOE) has not yet fully researched the methods for the      transportation of nuclear waste. A recent incident that      illustrates our concern is the 2001 Baltimore Tunnel fire.      Five days passed before fire fighters could gain access to      the blaze     and control the flames. Several studies have been done to      determine the environmental impact if that train had been      carrying spent nuclear fuel--and the results have been      disturbing.       Given the long-term nature of the Yucca project, it seems      only natural that the DOE would include transportation      analysis and an environmental impact study in its final      report. We respectfully request that the Office of the      President of the United States initiate one.       As the mayors of potentially affected cities, we urge you      to continue your dedication to public safety and homeland      security by supporting a thorough study on nuclear waste      transportation to the final repository.       We look forward to working with you on this very important      issue.           Sincerely,       (Signed by 18 mayors.)
