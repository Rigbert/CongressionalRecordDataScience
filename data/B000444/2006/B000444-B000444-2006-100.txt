 President, I realize that particularly the Presiding Officer and my friends from New Hampshire and Washington State are probably tired of hearing me stand up year after year since 9/11 and talk about rail security or the lack thereof in the United States of America. This amendment is about rail security.  The funding made available in this amendment is, unfortunately, something that I have, with others, fought for without success since 9/11. In fact, immediately after 9/11, I introduced legislation that is very similar to the amendment I am offering today that would provide critical resources to enhance rail security and rail infrastructure. Almost 5 years later, after introducing the legislation in the 108th Congress and the 109th Congress, we have done virtually nothing.  In March of 2004, our allies in Spain suffered an attack on their rail system that killed 191 people. We did nothing. We did nothing at home. Just over 1 year ago, terrorists in London killed 52 people and injured over 700, mostly on rail. We did virtually nothing. The attack in London occurred just 1 week before we had a debate on the 2006 Homeland Security budget. Unbelievably, we approved only $150 million for rail and transit, with only $7 million going to Amtrak, which carries, by the way, 64,000 passengers per day--hardly, I would say, a serious effort.  Just yesterday, in Mumbai, India, there was another attack on rail. So far there are 190 confirmed dead, 714 people injured. To state the obvious, I am sure every one of my colleagues feels as I do, but our thoughts and prayers are with those who were harmed in yesterday's attack. As they described in today's New York Times and I am sure every other paper in the Nation, there was baggage and body parts strewn for hundreds and hundreds of yards around the site of the explosion. Coincidentally, here at home we are debating again the appropriations bill for Homeland Security.  I wonder how long we can dodge the bullet. I wonder how long it will be that we can avoid accountability for what we are not doing to protect our rail and transit system. I don't know what it is going to take for us to wake up and take this threat seriously. Certainly everyone understands here at home that the threat is real and it is at home. The FBI has warned us of the threat to our rails. In fact, the Central Intelligence Agency has found photos of rail stations and rail crossings in safe houses in Afghanistan. I am sure they weren't doing that for a geography project for their kids. It was about looking at targets in America.  Remember when we saw that they had taken photos of American buildings, what we did? We immediately mobilized our security forces around those buildings here in the United States, because we knew if they had photos of those buildings tacked up on the walls they must be thinking of them as targets. What do we need? Do we need someone from al-Qaida to write us a note and say: ``By the way, folks, we are planning on attacking your rail system''? ``We are not going to tell you when, but we are going to attack yourrail system.'' What do we need? What do we need to be able to jog the--not ``conscience,'' that may be the wrong word--jog this body into a sense of reality?  We have still done virtually nothing. Since 9/11 the administration invested over $25 billion in aviation security, primarily to screen passengers. I voted for that, I agree with that--$25 billion. During the same period, less than $600 million has been allocated for rail and transit systems that carry a whole heck of a lot more passengers. This year's budget includes an additional $6 billion for aviation security, which I support. Only $150 million has been allocated for rail and transit security. Out of the $150 million allocated for rail and transit funding this year, $7 million went to Amtrak. I don't think that is a serious effort--again, 64,000 people a day.  I understand you can't protect every single inch of our vast rail structure but we can do some pretty commonsense things, some block-and-tackle things that we know will make us a lot safer. I can't stop anyone, nor are we likely to be able to stop anyone, from putting an IED that is fashioned in America on a track somewhere between here and Wilmington, DE, when I take the train every day. I am not asking for that. But I will tell you what we can do. What we can do is go to those areas we know are prime targets, where hundreds if not thousands of people could die if al-Qaida or any of their copycat organizations decided to move on rail and were successful.  Take a walk over to Union Station. Union Station is just down the street in that direction. I walk to it or drive to it every single night the Senate is in session. I come from it every day. It is the single most visited place in Washington. Do you hear me? The single most visited place in Washington, DC. More people are in and out of that station than are at any museum, than visit the Congress, the White House, the FBI. It is the single most visited place in Washington, DC.  Take a look. As I say to security people, get with me on an Amfleet train. Not an Acela, because they don't have the old kind of caboose on it. Stand in the last car and look out the window as you pull out of the train station. Tell me how many cameras you observe. Tell me how many cops you see. Tell me how many bits of protection--whether it is fencing or alarm systems--that are on the switching devices that are in that yard. Tell me how many folks you see wandering the yard where you see trains stacked up, where people can cross around just a plain old chain-link fence and put some C2 up underneath an existing train.  Or travel from Washington south. You go underneath the Supreme Court. You go underneath one of the House office buildings. Tell me what you see. Are there any guards patrolling that area? I am not going to say, because people will say to me, You are just giving terrorists information. I promise you, they already know it. You would be stunned how few law enforcement officers are on duty at any one time in that entire infrastructure.  My amendment simply makes the investment that the experts who have testified have repeatedly told us is needed. It would provide an additional $1.1 billion for rail security upgrades. Out of this amount we would provide $670 million to upgrade the tunnels along the Northeast corridor to add ventilation, lighting, escape routes, in some cases cameras, and the ability to be able to patrol those tunnels.  I will not take the time because my colleagues have heard me do it 1,000 times. The tunnel that goes from here heading to Boston--in fact, it goes through the State of Maryland, through Baltimore--it was built, I think, in 1869. Next time you ride through it, look and see if you see any ventilation. Tell me what you see in terms of lighting. Tell me what you see about any prospect of someone being able to escape from that tunnel. Tell me if you see any security going in and out of that tunnel.  It seems like a long time ago, I have been doing it so long, there was a fire in a tunnel. It was just a plain old fire, not a rail tunnel, another tunnel going into Baltimore. The fire shut down all the harbor, and it shut down all of south Baltimore.  If you go up into New York, you have six tunnels sitting under New York City without any appreciable work being done on any of them since, roughly, 1918. Ask any expert about ventilation. Why am I talking about ventilation? Drop sarin gas in that tunnel, drop another chemical in that tunnel, and tell me what happens without any ventilation to suck it out. Tell me what you see in those tunnels. Ask those experts what chance there is of escape. I will go back to that in a minute.  There is $250 million to be allocated to general security upgrades for freight rail operations, including transport of hazardous material. I had an amendment here on another bill not long ago because I asked the Naval Research Institute, NRI, to answer a question for me. Again, I apologize to my colleagues from Washington and New Hampshire for continuing to repeat this, but I asked the question: What would happen if a chlorine gas tanker exploded in a metropolitan area?  Remember, I guess it was a year or year and a half ago, one exploded up in the Dakotas--not near any big city. They had to evacuate several towns in the region. I said, What would happen?  The standard chlorine gas tanker on rails is about 90 tons. What happens if one of those were exploded? They said it would kill or injure up to 100,000 people.  I had an amendment. Why don't we allow the cities to be able to divert these hazardous cars around the cities. It got voted down--I actually did get a vote on it--because it would somehow increase the cost of doing business. It would increase the cost of doing business.  Maybe I am missing something here. The only thing I can believe is that most of my colleagues also think that this is not likely to happen, that these guys aren't going to go after transit, they are not going to go after freight rail, they are not going to go after passenger rail. They really don't mean it so we don't really have to worry.  It reminds me of that Calypso song that was popular about a decade go, ``Don't worry, be happy.''  Yet if we look around the world, bombings and attacks on rail systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They are carried out by terrorist groups. Before 9/11 when we saw these terrorist activities happening in Europe and other parts of the world, we just seemed impervious to it. ``It can't happen here. It won't happen here.''  I made a speech on September 10. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Foreign Policy in the 21st Century: Defining Our Interests in a                              Changing World       My mother wanted me to be a priest or a politician, and for      the longest time I didn't think you could do both. But you      can. Any rate, obviously not a lot of Irish-Catholics in this      room.       Well, what I want to know before we begin is--Chestnut Hill      Academy is here, I'm told, from Philadelphia. And what I want      to know is, when I went to a Catholic boys' school in      Claymont, Delaware, called Archmere, Chestnut Hill Academy      used to occasionally beat us--more occasionally than was      necessary. And I want to know, are you guys here in support      or opposition? What's the deal?       Welcome, fellas. I don't know why you're here, but it's      nice to see you all here. Thank you for being here.       It is true, I am now the chairman of the Foreign Relations      Committee--through no fault of my own. My dad has an      expression: It's better to be lucky than good. I am chairman      because one man in Vermont decided he was going to leave one      political party and giving my party the ability to organize      the Senate. For that, I am grateful, but I want you to know I      understand that this could change any day.       By the way, the president and I agree on a lot of things,      and we sincerely do. I thought the president's first trip to      Europe quelled a lot of concerns and nerves on the part of      our European friends, who are always upset and always nervous      with any transition in power in the United States. I think      the president did an extremely good job in the incident      relating to our, quote, ``spy plane'' being down. I think the      president has done some very, very good things.       I do have a profound disagreement with the president's view      of national missile defense and whether or not, at the end of      the day, it would make us more or less secure.       At the end of the Cold War, when the wall came down, we      found ourselves on the brink of extraordinary changes. All of      us were wondering what it would mean and where this would      lead. Was it the beginning of something or the end of      something? And if it was     the beginning, were we, the United States, the only remaining      superpower, going to get it right?       On that night, we were all idealists, but a new day dawned      and a harsh reality came into focus. It became clear that      long-standing ethnic, religious, tribunal and nationalistic      divisions had not changed, while America's place in the world      had changed profoundly.       From that day on, we inherited a profound obligation of      leadership, and an even more profound obligation to get it      right in the Middle East, in the Balkans, in Europe and Asia,      in our hemisphere, in our commitments, our treaties and in      our defense policy--missile or otherwise.       Now, the spotlight remains on us and is brighter than ever.      We're at a pivotal moment when American values and principles      have taken center stage like no other time in our history in      the global theater. How we perform on that stage is as much      about our honor, our decency, our pride, as it is about our      strategic policy.       So before we go raising the starting gun that will begin a      new arm's race in the world, before we dip into the Social      Security trust fund to satisfy the administration's almost      theological allegiance to missile defense at the expense of      more earth-bound military and international treaties, before      we watch China build up its nuclear arsenal and see an arm's      race in Asia and in the sub-continent, before we squander the      best opportunity we've had in a generation to modernize our      conventional nuclear forces, let's look at the real threats      we face home and abroad. Let's re-engage and rethink and meet      our obligations with a strength and resolve that befits our      place in this new world.       American foreign policy should not be based primarily on      the principle of national self-interest that defines strength      as rigid adherence to inflexible theory, or positive results      as emotionally satisfying unilateral action.       I don't believe our national interests can be furthered,      let alone achieved, in splendid indifference to the rest of      the world's views of our policies. Our interests are      furthered when we meet our international obligations and when      we keep our treaties. They're furthered when we maintain      an unequal military, able to deter any threat at any place      at any time and anywhere, when we keep our economy strong,      when we make wise choices that solves real problems, when      we stand bound together as democracies--multi-racial,      multi-ethnic, multi-religious beacons of hope--not some      dark house next door.       President Reagan's image of a ``shining city on a hill''      held out America as an ideal to millions and millions of      people around the world, a nation that reaches out to its      allies and adversaries alike, with undiluted, unequivocal      message that democracy works, freedom is worth the fight, and      that America will always be a reliable friend of those who      take the risk of achieving the goals of democracy.       We can't forget or simply disregard the responsibilities      that flow from our ideals. We can't lose sight of the fact      that leadership requires engagement, and partnership demands      inclusivity. Let there be no mistake, America must remain at      the table because walking away comes at a price. Our European      allies should never think that America ignores international      opinion or that we're ready to go it alone when we feel like      it. They should never think that our commitment to a vital      multi-national institutions, or projects, which are built      upon common values and common concerns--and that includes      NATO--has diminished.       We became a European power in the 20th century, and out of      our self-interest, we must remain a European power in the      21st century. We've got to get it right in Europe. We have to      stay engaged in the Balkans--as this administration appears      to be doing--and bring them, the Balkans, into the European      community. It's in our naked self-interest.       But let's understand that our foreign policy is as much      about American values as it is about complex multinational      treaties or arcane intricacies of strategic policy.       When I think of the moral imperative of American      leadership, I think of an America founded upon the      unshakable, bedrock democratic principles, but willing to      accept the principal ideals and cultural dynamics and genuine      concerns of our allies; a nation that has a powerful sense of      place in the geopolitical scheme of things--one that is      tough-minded when it comes to our own security, yet has broad      enough vision and a strong enough will to contribute to      peaceful solutions where age-old strains of nationalism and      religious-based divisions wreak havoc; a government that      doesn't abandon arms control treaties with the excuse that      they are relics of the Cold War.       I might note parenthetically, I think many of those      uttering that phrase are in fact themselves the relics of the      Cold War. They have not come to understand the wall is down      and the last time they were in power it was up. Half this      city doesn't realize that.       And not abandon these agreements as relics of the Cold War      because it's (inaudible) to honor them because we've      negotiated them in good faith, we signed and ratified them,      and because they have stood the test of time in serving our      national interest and other nation's expect us to keep our      promises; a unique and strong nation that isn't confused      about its role and responsibilities and doesn't walk away      from the table, but sits down, rolls up its sleeves and      convinces the world of our position; a nation that thinks big      and sees freedom in global economic growth as consensus      ideals.       I think of America vastly different--so unburdened of the      old Cold War fears and feelings that it's willing to do a      little soul-searching. Are we a nation of our word or not? Do      we keep our treaties or don't we? Are we willing to lead the      hard way, because leadership isn't easy and requires us      convincing others? Diplomacy isn't easy. Multilateral policy      initiatives aren't easy.       Or are we willing to end four decades of arms control      agreements to go it alone--a kind of bully nation sometimes a      little wrong-headed, but ready to make unilateral decisions      in what we perceive to be our self-interest, and to hell with      our treaties, our commitments and the world?       Are we really prepared to raise the starting gun in the new      arms race in a potentially more dangerous world? Because,      make no mistakes about it, folks, if we deploy a missile      defense system that's being contemplated, we could do just      that.       Step back from the ABM Treaty, go full steam ahead and      deploy a missile defense system, and we'll be raising the      starting gun. If the president continues to go headlong,      headstrong on this theological mission to develop his missile      defense system, if he does what he says and drops      objections to China's missile buildup, not only will we      have raised the starting gun, we'll have pulled back the      hammer.       Let's stop this nonsense before we end up pulling the      trigger.       China now has about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles,      but according to press reports, the National Intelligence      Council thinks that China might deploy up to 200 warheads,      develop sophisticated decoys and perhaps move to multiple      warheads in response to a missile defense system.       It seems to me it's absolute lunacy for us to invite China      to expand its arsenal and resume nuclear testing, not to      mention that moving forward with missile defense could      jeopardize Chinese cooperation on the Korean Peninsula.       Let me remind you all that there are two types of      modernization they talk about. And there's no doubt the      Chinese are going to modernize. But up to recently, what most      people thought the modernization meant and our community      thought it meant was moving, for example, from liquid fuel      rockets to solid fuel rockets. Moving from systems that were      not mobile at all to more mobile systems.       Not increasing, as the press has reported, 10-fold more      than they would have if we build a national missile defense.      Not MIRVing their missiles, meaning put more than one atom      bomb or hydrogen bomb on top of an ICBM. The most      destabilizing weapon that exists.       I found it interesting, on MacNeil-Lehrer, Secretary      Rumsfeld saying that it wasn't the question of MIRVing that      was important, it was a question of the total number of      missiles.       Well, George--President Bush, the first President Bush--     understood that it was more than that. We fought for years      and years to do away with the big SS-18 Soviet missiles. Why?      Because they're what we saw, I say to the gentleman from      Chestnut Hill Academy, they're what we call a use-or-lose      weapon.       Because they have such an incredible concentration of      power, you assume that they will be struck first. Therefore,      if there is a warning that you're under attack, which      sometimes they're mistaken, they're on a hair trigger and you      must launch them or lose them.       That's why we're so fearful that the Russians will keep      their MIRVed systems, because they have such a porous defense      system. They have such a porous early warning system. And as      a nun I used to have would say, in a slightly different      context, ``the only nuclear war that's worse than one that is      intended is one that wasn't intended.''       In Seoul, I spoke with President Kim Dae-jung of South      Korea about ways to bring North Korea, which is the new      bogeyman that we're all looking at now, which is the      justification for this pell-mell race to produce the      international missile defense, how to bring them into the      family of nations.       He urged me to encourage the administration to engage North      Korea in senior-level dialogue and not allow a theological      commitment to missile defense to blind us to the prospects of      signing a verifiable agreement to end North Korea's      development, deployment and export of long-range missiles.       Yesterday, Dr. Rice, on Meet the Press--she and I were on      Meet the Press--she talked about how ubiquitous these long-     range missile systems were. I don't know what she's talking      about. We're getting briefed by two different groups of CIA      people, I guess, because none of these rogue nations have      that capacity yet. They may get it. It is maybe within their      reach, but it does not exist now.       If we spur on an aggressive Chinese buildup, including the      need to test--and you know why they will have to test. When      you put more than one--I know most of you know this, but it's      worth repeating--you put more than one atom or hydrogen      weapon on top of a rocket, it requires more throw weight in      that rocket. It has to be more powerful.       So practically what you have to do is you have to make      smaller, more compact missile warheads. And in order to be      able to be sure they work, you've got to test them. So if, in      fact, the Chinese are going to move to a modernized system      that requires--that's going to contemplate MIRVed ICBMs,      they're going to have to test.       That's why I got so upset by the statement read by the      press account that we appeared to be willing to trade off, in      return for them not objecting to our building the national      missile defense system, the possibility that we would look      the other way when China tested and that we understood they      were going to have a considerable buildup.       That's what I call a self-fulfilling prophesy.       And let me ask you the question: Consider what India is      likely to do if China tests. Those of you who know the      subcontinent know that there's been an incredible political      tug to have another test of their, quote, ``hydrogen      weapon,'' because they believe the world does not believe      that they successfully tested one, and they want the world to      believe they have one.       And what do you think happens when India tests, if China      tests?       What do you think happens in Pakistan? Pakistan, I believe,      would ratchet up its production. And consider that Taiwan,      the two Koreas or Japan or all of them could build their own      nuclear weapons. Japan has the capacity within one year to      become a nuclear power.       That greatest generation that Tom Brokaw speaks of, my      mother and father's generation, did two incredibly good      things, and I mean this as not an insult, to particularly my      German friend. Germany is a non-nuclear power and Japan is a      non-nuclear power. That's good for the world. I want to be no      party to setting in motion a series of events that will cause      the Japanese Diet to reconsider whether they should rely upon      the nuclear umbrella of the United States.       And as the former chancellor of Germany, Helmut Schmidt,      once said to me, sitting in his office 15 years ago, he said,      ``You don't understand, Joe, my son's generation does not      feel the same sense of obligation or guilt that mine does.''       Are we so dead set positive that a missile defense system      furthers our national interest that we're willing to risk an      arms race? So sure of the science that we're willing to      weaponize space and nuclearize Asia?       Are we so sure of the feasibility that we'll divert      potentially hundreds of billions of dollars from the real      needs of our military?       Look, the fact is we could weaponize space or we could buy      339 F-22s to replace our aging F-15 fleet for $62 billion. We      could replace aging F-16s, A-10s, A-14s with a Joint Strike      Fighter for the cost of $223 billion. We could replace the      Cobra and Kiowa warrior helicopters for $39 billion. I could      go on and on.       But in short, we could provide our Army, our Navy, Air      Force and Marines virtually everything they need in the      immediate future for a more stealth, more significant lift      capacity military to deal with the real threats we face and      still spend less on all of that than we will spend on the      national missile defense system.       We're facing a difficult budget fight with a consequence of      the turndown in the economy, the business cycle, the $1.3      trillion tax cut, or all of the above, and we can't have our      cake and eat it too. The administration would like us to      think it's all possible, but it's not all possible.       According to the Congressional Budget Office, we may have      already dipped into the Social Security trust fund, which we      used to do regularly in years past, but which we all promised      we wouldn't do anymore, we would have a lock box. And that      $21 billion or more will be consumed from that lock box in      the next three years. This is a very different economic      picture than projections of just a few months ago.       Missile defense has to be weighed carefully against all      other spending and all other military priorities, which we're      not debating or doing right now. And in truth, our real      security needs are much more earthbound and far less costly      than national missile defense.       If you combine the $1.3 trillion tax cut with what we've      spent on a full-blown missile defense shield, we could start      to modernize our conventional forces, build a stealthier,      more mobile, more self-sufficient military that I believe is      needed in the 21st century, and make significant impact on      rectifying what is going to be a gigantic problem in 10      years in Social Security.       Let's be clear: When it comes to defense, it's not the      president's missile defense or nothing, as the way it's being      posed. We should improve military personnel retention and      overall readiness; bring on the next generation of fighter      aircraft, the next generation of helicopters, the next      generation of destroyers; and be fully prepared for the next      generation of engagement.       And while we're at it, we may fix the plumbing in the      barracks at Taipei, which I just visited, which the night      before I came, because they are so aged and we don't have the      money to fix them, they had to bring in water hoses from      outside to allow the women and men in there to be able to      shave, to be able to use the bathrooms, let alone drink any      water. Visit the conditions in which our active military are      living now--two and three in a room. You think when you drop      your kid off at a college dormitory and you're paying 30      grand to send him to a prestigious school is hard to take,      take a look at the conditions they live in. And why are we      not responding to it? We don't have the money, we are told.       My dad used to say, and still says, ``Son, if everything is      equally important to you, nothing is important to you.'' Our      priorities, I think, are a little out of whack. I've said,      and I'll say it again, we should be fully funding the      military and defending ourselves at home and abroad against      the more likely threats of short-range cruise missiles or      biological terrorism.       Last week, the Foreign Relations Committee began hearings      on how to build a so-called ``homeland'' defense and to      protect our military from bioterrorism pathogens and chemical      attacks; on how we can deploy a missile defense system that      doesn't trade off conventional modernization of our military      for a fantasy of some system that remains more flawed than      feasible; on how we can jump-start the destruction of      Russia's massive chemical weapons stockpile and secure all      our nuclear materials.       The very day they send up a budget that tells they are      going to increase by 8-point-some billion our missile defense      initiative, they cut the program that exists between us and      Russia to help them destroy their chemical weapons, keep      their scientists from being for sale and destroy their      nuclear weapons.       I've said, and I'll say it again, we should work with      Russia and China and all of our allies to stem proliferation      of weapons of mass destruction; we should try to rely on some      mutual deterrence, rather than thinking we can replace it,      because, in fact, deterrence works.       We should support research and development in boost phase      interceptors that would avoid the countermeasures and would      be more acceptable to Russia and China, limiting the      possibility of ending Russia's adherence to START II and      lessening the prospects of a new arms race in Asia than what      we are now proposing.       We should strive through hard-nosed diplomacy to delay and      eliminate the long-range ballistic threat by ending North      Korea's program and its sale of long-range missile      technology. We should build a combined offensive and      defensive system that we know works before we deploy it. And      we should amend the ABM Treaty and not walk away from it.       Having said that, let's put the cost and the effectiveness      of this missile defense system being discussed today in some      context so that everyone understands exactly what we're      talking about. The cheapest realistic system suggested,      national missile defense system, limited national missile      defense system suggested by this administration, which relies      on the same midcourse interceptors the Clinton administration      proposed, would cost at a minimum $60 billion over 20 years      and most suggest it would be closer to $100 billion.       And remember, this is only for a system that's incapable of      shooting down a missile carrying biological weapons,      incapable of shooting down a missile carrying chemical      weapons, at least for now incapable of shooting down a      missile with an unsophisticated tumbling warhead that will      look just like a tumbling trajectory.       In order to combat what are known as countermeasures, such      as those decoys or the submunitions that carry biological      weapons, the administration proposes a layered defense. That      means, a missile defense that begins with a boost phase      interceptor, that is, catching the rocket as it takes off      from behind, at its slowest point and nearest point;      continues with a midcourse interceptor, that is, getting      it out there in the atmosphere and a bullet hitting a      bullet; and finishes with a terminal defense as it's      coming down.       Now, you think the midcourse system we're working on is      expensive. Help me calculate the cost of a layered missile      defense, where we haven't even begun some of the research.       One recent estimate for that system is a quarter trillion      dollars, and I think that, too, is a conservative figure,      because the truth is that the administration has yet to      comprehend the full complexities and the technological      challenges of a layered defense. If you doubt me, ask folks      like General Welch and others who used to run the show.       In my view, that full-blown layered missile defense system,      which doesn't address a single real issue on the ground, is      more likely to cost a half a trillion dollars. And what will      it get us? For half a trillion dollars we may get a layered      defense system that's not been defined yet. If it includes      space-based lasers, you've now weaponized outer space, which      invites other countermeasures to attack the satellites on      which we depend for information and communications.       But it still won't be 100 percent effective. Secretary      Rumsfeld, speaking about our national missile defense system      on the Lehrer NewsHour earlier this year, said that a system      would not have to be 90 or even 80 percent effective, but      only 70 percent effective. Secretary Rumsfeld, in referring      to a, quote, ``0.7 success rate,'' said, and I quote,      ``That's plenty.''       Folks, 30 percent failure for any national defense system      could be called plenty of things, but plenty successful is      not one of them. Think about it.       (Applause)       Let's say President Richard Ryan becomes president of the      United States. And the head of a rogue state tells him, which      is how the scenario goes, ``I'm invading my neighborhood      today. And if you try to stop me, I'll fire my ICBMs at      you.'' Never mind that he won't do that because he knows he'd      be annihilated within a matter of 30 minutes. But President      Ryan turns to his national security adviser, as I always do,      Carl Wiser, and says, ``Carl, what do I do?''       And Carl says, ``Don't worry, we have a missile defense      system. And unlike Rumsfeld's 0.7, ours is 0.9 effective.''       President Ryan says, ``Oh. There's a 10 percent chance then      of losing Detroit?''       And Carl says, ``Well that depends. If they fire seven      missiles, the odds of losing at least one city will be 50-50.      Because guess what: 0.9 means that not 90 percent fired will      get through, 0.9 means that for every missile fired, that      single missile has a nine out of 10 chance of getting      through. You get to seven, it's about a 50-50 chance that one      gets through. If you do the 0.7, you fire two missiles,      there's an equal chance one is going to get through.''       So now President Ryan says, ``You know, these guys that      designed this system are right. This enables me to not be      blackmailed. I'm supposed to feel like I have freedom of      action thanks to this defense.''       And Carl says, ``Hey look, Rumsfeld told Jim Lehrer that 70      percent effectiveness would be enough, at least initially.      And with that system there's a 50-50 chance of losing at      least one city if that rogue state fires two missiles. We're      better off than we were.''       And I assume that this scenario which they lay out means,      where Ryan is president, he's going to say, ``You know, I      really have some flexibility now. I'm only going to lose      Detroit or San Francisco or Cleveland or Dallas, so I can      really move here with dispatch. I've got flexibility. I don't      have upon deterrence.''       Now, I know you think I'm being a wise guy here, but      sometimes it's useful to reduce this complex nuclear      theological discussion to reality. If I'm president, does      that give me more flexibility?       Does that allow me to say, ``I'm only going to lose one or      two population centers, therefore I have more flexibility to      do anything other than say, `If you do, we will annihilate      you'?''       I also find it fascinating, this whole premise is based      upon the notion that defense no longer works. Deterrence no      longer works.       Now, I say this, and there's a television audience      listening: Help educate me. Name me a time in the last 500      years when the leader of a nation-state has said, ``I know I      face virtual annihilation if I take the following action, but      I'm go ahead, and I'm going to do it anyway.''       Saddam Hussein, the certifiable maniac--when George I said      to him, ``If you do we will take you out,'' what did he do      with 500,000 forces marching on Baghdad? He had those Scud      missiles everybody talks about as a justification for      building the system. He had chemical weapons. He had      biological weapons. Why did he not use them if deterrence      does not work?       I just find the basic premise upon which this whole      argument rests and the sense of urgency a little wanting.      Think about it. We will have spent potentially up to a half a      trillion dollars for a system that might work nine out of 10      times, assuming the administration knows how to build it,      that, one, won't give the president the freedom of action.       One, that won't give the Pentagon what it really needs,      won't modernize our conventional forces, and without being      able to say, ``Yes, we've saved Social Security for even one      more day.'' That's the system we're going to build.       Remember now, folks, they don't know what it looks like,      they don't even have it on paper, they have tested a system      in one mode that, God bless our incredible technology, it      worked, and I vote to pay for them to continue to do that      research. But they're willing to pull out of an ABM Treaty      that sends the signal to the rest of the world the end of      arms control has arrived. And what protection do we have in      the near term, let alone down the road?       Sure, we'll do all we can to defend ourselves against any      threat, nobody denies that, but even the Joint Chiefs says      that a strategic nuclear attack is less likely than a      regional conflict, a major theater war, terrorist attacks at      home or abroad, or any number of other real issues. We'll      have diverted all that money to address the least likely      threat, while the real threat comes to this country in the      hold of a ship, the belly of a plane, or smuggled into a city      in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack.       And I ask you, you want to do us damage, are you more      likely to send a missile you're not sure can reach us with a      biological or chemical weapon because you don't have the      throw weight to put a nuclear weapon on it and no one's      anticipating that in the near term, with a return address      saying, ``It came from us, here's where we are?'' Or are you      more likely to put somebody with a backpack crossing the      border from Vancouver down to Seattle, or coming up the New      York Harbor with a rusty old ship with an atom bomb sitting      in the hull? Which are you more likely to do? And what      defense do we have against those other things?       Watch these hearings we're about to have. We don't have, as      the testimony showed, a public health infrastructure to deal      with the existing pathogens that are around now. We don't      have the investment, the capability to identify or deal with      an anthrax attack. We do not have, as Ambassador to Japan      now, Howard Baker, and his committee said, the ability to      curtail the availability of chemical weapons lying around the      Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union and Russia, because      they don't know what to do with it.       They showed us a report where they showed us photographs of      things that look like large outhouses, clapboard buildings,      with no windows and padlocks on the door, that have as many      chemical weapons in that building to destroy the bulk of the      East Coast--and we're not spending the money to help them      corral and destroy that in the name of this search? The cost      estimate was $30 billion over 10 years in this bipartisan      commission, and it was listed as the most urgent threat to      the United States of America.       The truth is, technology will keep outpacing our capacity      to build an effective system, which may well be obsolete or      penetrable by the time it's done. And that means we'll      continually increase our capability, and in turn, so will      those who are trying to penetrate it. And so the new arms      race begins.       Forty-nine Nobel Prize-winning scientists sent a letter to      President Clinton last year opposing the deployment of the      limited antiballistic missile system the president was      contemplating, and I'll quote from the letter. Quote: ``The      system would offer little protection, would do grave harm to      this nation's core security interest,'' end of quote.       They went on to say, and I quote--these are now, we're      talking about 49 Nobel laureates--``We and other independent      scientists have long argued that antiballistic missile      systems, particularly those attempting to intercept reentry      vehicles in space, will inevitably lose in an arms race of      improvements in offensive capability.''       That night in 1989 when the wall came down and we wondered      where it would lead, another arms race was the furthest thing      from any of our minds. The idea that our allies would      question our commitment and our resolve, even our motives,      was unthinkable.       Our place in the world seemed secure. The world was looking      to us to demonstrate leadership, and it still is.       Let's think about how we felt that night. The feeling that      something good was happening and something even better was on      the horizon. It was as if the world had awoken from a long,      bad dream into a new era in which old values and old      prejudices would no longer prevail, and new values and new      ideals, wherever they were to be found, would be found and      make us all more secure.       Folks, let's not now raise the starting gun on a new arm's      race that is sure, I promise you, to make my children and my      grandchildren and these students assembled here feel less      secure than we feel today.       Thank you very much for listening.
