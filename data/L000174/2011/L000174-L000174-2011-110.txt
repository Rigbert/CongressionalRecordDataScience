President, I rise in my capacity as chair of the Judiciary Committee to say I oppose amendment No. 860. It is a one-size-fits-all approach. It would have catastrophic consequences to the Justice Department and on the important work the Justice Department does in supporting local law enforcement, crime victims, and justice across the country.  I have worked with my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, on many issues. We have been able to, in a bipartisan way, develop accountability measures to ensure that particular grants administered by the Department of Justice operate efficiently and effectively. That is particularly important at a time of budget austerity. We have done it in specific contexts when those measures make a lot of sense.  For example, in the course of our negotiations of a bipartisan version of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, we worked out specific proposals. Nonetheless, six of the eight Republicans on the Judiciary Committee opposed this bill.  But one size does not fit all. Measures that make sense in one program cannot willy-nilly be applied to others without careful consideration of the consequences to the programs and, to the intended beneficiaries in local law enforcement, and crime victims.  A one-size-fits-all measure actually might harm rather than help important functions at the Department of Justice.  For example, this amendment would prevent grants to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. I know some have criticized some aspects of the Boys and Girls Clubs, and I would be happy to work with any Senator to work out these issues. But the Boys and Girls Clubs of America do great work.  I remember one police chief in my State, when asked if I could help him get a couple more police officers to help out because of crime problems, said: No. Get me a Boys and Girls Club. Get me a place for young people to go.  I know in Vermont they do a great deal, as they do in most States. If there are reforms that should be made, let's do them, but not just cut out the funding in a one-size-fits-all way at a time when we are doing everything possible to give young people a different goal than going out into a life where they might do things none of us would agree with.  This amendment would greatly restrict the Department of Justice's ability to spend funds for salaries of its own people. Is that going to lead to huge cuts in prosecutors and agents? Are we going to be imposing a salary cap on top of the one the President has already imposed? Are we going to be losing some of our best people? Are we going to be unable to develop experienced law enforcement officers or prosecutors?  I know, in law enforcement and prosecution, we value experience. We do not want to go for the lowest common denominator. We want people who are experienced.  Again, a willy-nilly amendment does not help.  The amendment includes a grant-matching requirement. But in some programs, grant matching is not a good idea. Let me tell you about one, legislation that former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I put together. It has worked very well. It is the Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program for local jurisdictions. We have, in some local jurisdictions, the ability to waive matching provisions.  We have seen a rise in the number of assaults and murders of police officers across this country. Many officers' lives have been saved because they have had bulletproof vests under the Leahy program. They would have died otherwise. But they are in small departments, in small departments in States that could not afford the $500 or $600 per bulletproof vest. Yet we expect these police officers to be out at 3 o'clock in the morning, usually with no backup. But if they are in a small, rural park in West Virginia or Vermont or all these other States, they do not have any backup. They are out there alone. We ought to give them the kind of protection they need.  I want our police officers in rural communities who do not have the budgeting of a big city department to have this kind of protection. So if we put a matching requirement by fiat--again, one-size-fits-all--we have a lot of rural police departments that are going to be badly hurt.  What about crime victims? Crime victims have already suffered great loss. Are we going to say: We can help you out, but pony up some money. Pony up a matching requirement, and then we will come in and help you. We are going to spend a fortune on the guywe lock up who committed a crime. We will spend $30,000, $35,000 a year on that person. We are not going to ask for any matching money from the criminal. But we are going to say to the victim: We can help you, but, sorry--I know you lost all this money; I know you have been beaten, you have been bruised, you have been injured--you have to come up with some money before we can help you. The guy who did it, we will take care of him. We will pay for that. But we cannot help you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was a prosecutor for 8 years. I know how these victims suffer. They are usually the forgotten person in the criminal justice system. The headlines are: So and so was arrested. They are marched off. We are going to prosecute them. That is good. They should be. I prosecuted a lot of those people. But the victim is the one forgotten. Victims and others most in need of assistance are those least likely to be able to provide matching funds. Rural communities, small nonprofit providers, tribes, and States that are facing their own problems should not have another funding mandate put on them from Washington.  The new matching requirement and other requirements in this amendment would impose new burdens on all money going to State and local law enforcement through the COPS Program and many of the Byrne-JAG programs. It would prevent many police departments from hiring and keeping the officers they need. That is why the National District Attorneys Association and the National Association of Police Organizations have expressed their opposition to this amendment.  At one time, I had the honor of serving as vice president of the National District Attorneys Association. They care. They care about law enforcement. They care about prosecutors. They care about victims. We ought to listen to them.  It also would burden grants awarded through the Debbie Smith Act to reduce backlogs in testing rape kits. There are rapists who go free because we do not have the money to test the rape kits. Tell that to a victim. Tell that to the victim: We do not have the money to go get the person who did this. I am not going to vote in a way that I am going to be telling that victim: We cannot help you. We cannot test that rape kit.  The Debbie Smith grant program has received bipartisan support. It helps to ensure that rape victims will not have to continue to live in fear because somebody said: It is going to take a few months to test this because we do not have the money. By the way, lock your door. He might come back.  I am not going to vote for that.  The matching requirement would be devastating to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which works hard every day to keep our children safe from those who would do them harm. It is hard to think of any work more important than protecting our children from the evils of abuse and exploitation, but this amendment would make that work much harder because the National Center receives Justice Department grants, but it does not have matching funds.  Time is running out. I could tell some stories. I could tell some stories about what happens to these children who are exploited and abused, and it would have everybody in tears. It did me when I saw them as a prosecutor, and it does every day when I read these reports as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  My God, if we can go and try to protect people around the world, let's protect our children here at home.  I agree with Senator Grassley that we need rigorous accountability measures. Of course, we should. We do this in our hearings every week in the Judiciary Committee. GAO does it. The inspector general does it. But do not do a one-size-fits-all that is going to say to our victims, that is going to say to rape victims, that is going to say to exploited children or that is going to say to our police officers, who are told to go out there without a bulletproof vest but to defend you and me in the middle of the night: Sorry, sorry, sorry. The wealthiest Nation on Earth cannot help you.  No; I oppose this amendment.  I yield the floor.                     Amendment No. 879, as Modified
