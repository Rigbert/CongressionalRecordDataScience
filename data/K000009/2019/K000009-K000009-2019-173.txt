This bill will allow the Coast Guard expanded authority to partner with the Department of Education and the Department of Defense to improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education for America's elementary and secondary school students and their teachers.  Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States--our prosperity and security--depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem and workforce. Given the Coast Guard's mission of coastal defense and maritime law enforcement, daily activity relies significantly on STEM skills. The ability to work with the Department of Education and Department of Defense on youth STEM programs will increase exposure and engagement to the adventures and intriguing opportunities of the Coast Guard's mission.  Specifically, the Coast Guard Youth STEM Programs Expansion Act will allow the Coast Guard to coordinate with the Department of Education to establish programs to improve STEM knowledge and skills for elementary and secondary school students and faculty. It will allow the Coast Guard to cooperate and coordinate with the Department of Defense, particularly through the very successful DOD STARBASE Program. It will also allow the Coast Guard to expand beyond traditional STEM skills to focus on expertise particularly important to their own mission, including limnology, marine science, and oceanography.  Basic STEM concepts are best learned at an early age--in elementary and secondary school--and are the essential prerequisites for career technical training, advanced college-level and graduate study, and success in workplaces. With the range of federal agencies partnered to coordinate federal STEM initiatives, the Coast Guard too has a vested interest in advancing this important mission.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and its goal of expanding the Coast Guard's efforts to engage and expose American youth to vital STEM education and workforce skills.                          ____________________
