President, I rise today to submit a resolution honoring the academic achievements and excellence of Lincoln Park High School in Chicago, Illinois, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.  Educating America's youth is a difficult and often overlooked task. For the students of today to become the leaders of tommorrow, education is critical. It is the foundation on which a student builds his or her future. With our ever changing world, education is the key that unlocks the door of opportunity. Therefore, it is an honor to acknowledge this institution for its great service over the last century.  Since 1899, Lincoln Park High School has been an educational leader in Chicago, maintaining a standard of excellence that should be looked upon as a model. Furthermore, Lincoln Park High School has been consistently among the top public high schools in test scores and other measures of achievement, and has been racially integrated throughout its history.  I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, in presenting this resolution recognizing Lincoln Park High School as a model for educational institutions throughout the United States.
