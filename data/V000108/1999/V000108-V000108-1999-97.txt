On this Veterans Day, a special ceremony titled, ``Salute 1999: An American Patriotic Celebration'' will be held at the Radisson Star Plaza Theatre in Merrillville, Indiana. This celebration of patriotism and pride will honor eight local veterans for their dedicated military service. Those veterans that will be honored include: Stanley Bliznik, Eliseo Castaneda,Alonzo Swann, Jr., Charles Swisher, Zenon Lukosius, Marion Brzezinski, Walter O'Keefe, and Douglas Dettman.  Stanley Bliznik of Highland, Indiana, is a World War II Veteran of the United States Army. He served our country from October 7, 1941 to July 31, 1945 as a member of the Army's 20th Combat Engineer Battalion. Eliseo Castaneda of East Chicago, Indiana, is a United States Marine Corps Veteran. He enlisted in the Marines in July of 1948 and was discharged July, 1952. He arrived in Pusan, Korea the first day of September 1950 and participated in the Pusan Perimeter action, the battle of Kimpo Air Field, and the battle securing Seoul, South Korea. Serving in the Navy during World War II, Alonzo Swann, Jr., of Gary, Indiana is a fine example of one of our American heroes. He received the Victory Medal, American Theater Medal, Purple Heart, Bronze Star Combat V, Asiatic Pacific Medal three stars, Philippine Liberation Ribbon two stars, and the Navy Cross for his dedicated military service. Additionally, Charles Swisher of Crown Point, Indiana, served in the United States Army during World War II on the battlefield in France. He served as a member of the 976th Field Artillery Battalion. Zenon Lukosius of South Holland, Illinois, courageously served our country during World War II. As a member of the United States Navy, Lukosius defended against enemy planes, helped bombard enemy shores, and was involved in the capture of enemy submarines. Marion Brzezinski of Highland, Indiana, served in the United States Army until he was discharged in September of 1945.

The great sacrifice made by these eight men and those who served our country has resulted in the freedom and prosperity of our country and in countries around the world. The responsibility rests within each of us to build upon the valiant efforts that these men and women who fought for this country have displayed, so that the United States and the world will be a more free and prosperous place. To properly honor the heroism of our troops, we must make the most of our freedom secured by their efforts.  In addition to the eight veterans who are to be honored at this patriotic celebration, I would also like to commend all of those who served this country for their bravery, courage, and undying commitment to patriotism and democracy. May God bless them all.  We will forever be indebted to our veterans and their families for the sacrifices they made so that we can enjoy our freedom. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in saluting these eight men and the other veterans who have fought for our great country.                          ____________________
