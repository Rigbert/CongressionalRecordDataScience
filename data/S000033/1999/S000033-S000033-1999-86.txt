''  We are hearing this from States all over the country. If my colleague thinks this is a good idea, then I think it should go through the normal process. My friend over there talked about the normal process. Take it through the authorization committee, debate it, have input from the States, and if people feel that it works, then we may want to go to it. I have my doubts about it. But to suddenly spring this on the States, with the result I think a number of States will not be able to participate in this important program, is wrong; and I would strongly ask for support of the Sanders amendment.
