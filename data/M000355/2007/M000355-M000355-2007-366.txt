 President, I do not know if the majority leader was preoccupied or not, but let me say again, we were prepared to go to conference on the 9/11 bill the Friday before the recess, and the request was not made by my good friend, which is fine. I would say, again, we are prepared to go to conference on the 9/11 bill. I would suggest we have our floor staffs work out the language. I do not think there is any reason why we could not do that today.
