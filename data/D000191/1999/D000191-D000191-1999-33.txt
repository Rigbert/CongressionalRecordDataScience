Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, there is no surplus in this year's budget. We are still running a deficit. On top of it, we have got a $5.6-trillion debt, $17,000 for every American from the tiniest baby to the oldest senior citizen in a nursing home. But here we are after midnight talking about a $1-trillion dollar tax cut.  Now, this is based on this future and possibly allusive surplus. That is based on a probably rosy economic scenario. We have done this mistake before. Are we going to do it again?  Now, it is also, and listen up, it is predicated upon further cuts in veterans' health care, further cuts in education and student loans, cuts in Medicare, and it puts Social Security at risk. Yet the Republicans say it is their money, they earned it, and we should give it back.  Well, who is ``they''? That is the key question. Who is the ``they'' to whom we are giving the money back? Let us look at that.  Well, ``they'' happens to be the top one percent of income earners in this country. The people earning a minimum of $300,000 a year and up, they are going to get a $54,000 tax cut on average. That is where those wonderful high numbers come out. Those people, well, they are going to have to get a Brinks truck to handle theirs.  Now, they do not have to worry about veterans' health care. They are not very worried about student loans. Their kids are not eligible. They are not worried about cuts in Medicare, and they do not care about Social Security.  Now, the families who have to make up for the cuts in veterans' health care and in student loans and in Medicare and are worried about Social Security, that is 80 percent of the taxpaying Americans. Every family that earns $63,000 a year or less, what will they get? They will get $310 on average, 90 cents a day.  Now, can we replace those benefits with that? No.
