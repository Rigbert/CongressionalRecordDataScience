Speaker, I rise to commemorate 100 years of AAA Northwest Ohio. For a century, the company has provided quality service to people throughout its region.  Prior to the formation of AAA, a series of small automobile clubs served the 23,000 automobile owners across the country. In 1902 as more people began to own cars, these clubs formed into the federation American Automobile Association, AAA. In that same year, fifteen Toledoans came together to form the Toledo Automobile Club, later renamed AAA Northwest Ohio. Its first president was Dr. Lewis Liffrin. By 1947 the club boasted 10,000 members. Only 15 years later, in 1962, that number had reached 50,000 and in 1989 the milestone of 100,000 members was achieved. Today, AAA Northwest Ohio is over 150,000 members strong.  With its mission to offer the community ``exceptional customer service and diverse member benefits along with a commitment to public safety'' AAA Northwest Ohio strives to put the customer first. The association provides roadside emergency assistance, a full service travel and insurance agency, and its unique ``triptik'' maps for travelers.  I am pleased to recognize the invaluable service AAA Northwest has provided to its customers, and congratulate its employees past and present for a century of dedication and commitment to quality.                          ____________________
