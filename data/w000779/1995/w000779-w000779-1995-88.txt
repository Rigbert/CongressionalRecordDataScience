Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  First, if the gentleman from Louisiana feels his legislation already takes care of things, I cannot understand why he is objecting so strenuously to mine. I want to make it clear that this legislation now sets out a double standard that treats development interests better than the typical homeowner. Development interests get compensated if their property values are merely diminished, but the neighboring homeowners have to meet a higher standard, requiring physical damage to their properties for the exemption in the bill to apply.  What I would say to my colleagues is if they vote against this amendment, they are saying that developers can come to government agencies and get permits where the developers are going to be hurting neighboring homes, your constituents. When the constituents come to you and complain, and there are far more of them than there are of the developers, you should be ready to tell them why the developer's right to develop is more important than that typical homeowner's right to enjoy their home.  That is what this amendment is all about, trying to provide some balance. The gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Tauzin] is right in saying that there are examples of takings that warrant compensation, but there are also examples where in that process, the typical homeowner, who lives every day in a fashion that is not regulated by the wetlands law or the reclamation law, can be hurt in the process.  We are saying in considering compensation, factor in that typical homeowner. I would suggest to my colleagues that if they vote against this amendment, when they have problems in their community, there are homeowners who are going to come and ask why you rejected this opportunity to provide them some protection.
