President, I am introducing today, along with my colleague, Senator Smith, the ``Friends of the Children National Demonstration Act'' to authorize funding for Friends of the Children. The companion of this bill is being introduced in the House today by Congressman Earl Blumenauer.  This innovative program is truly a best practice in the field of youth development. Friends of the Children was started in Portland, OR, and was modeled on extensive research indicating that the strongest protective factor for highly disadvantaged children is an on-going relationship with a supportive, caring adult. Today, Friends of the Children is the only program in the Nation that provides carefully screened full-time professional mentors to disadvantaged youth for 12 years starting in kindergarten or first grade. Friends of the Children's first class of students is now graduating. These young people have outperformed their peer group of disadvantaged youth in every respect. They are in school, have passing grades, have not been incarcerated, do not abuse drugs or alcohol, and have not become involved in gang violence.  Let me share the story of one of these friends. In 1993, a first grader named Demarcus joined the Friends of the Children-Portland program in an attempt to overcome a family history of substance abuse and violence. His mother was raising three children as a single parent and she was overwhelmed. As a participant in the Friends of the Children program, Demarcus was matched with a ``Friend,'' Ruben, who has been his mentor for the past eight years. Ruben and Demarcus have developed a strong relationship through activities ranging from playing basketball to having serious conversations about life and preparing for the future. Ruben has helpedDemarcus develop anger management skills and maturity. While many of Demarcus's friends and family have been incarcerated or have been victims of gun violence, Demarcus is a success story. Now 17 years old, he is a responsible young man who makes good choices and knows that actions have consequences. When he graduates from high school, he hopes to work toward becoming a pilot, either by joining the military or attending college. Friends of the Children mentors have been major supporters of Demarcus and his goal to attain higher education. The mentors have helped him grow into the focused young adult he is today.  Last week in Portland, the first class of Friends of the Children, including Demarcus, graduated from the program. By all accounts these children have beaten the odds and are success stories. Twelve years ago these young people were identified by their elementary schools as most likely to fail. Today, they are soon-to-be high school graduates.  Currently, Friends of the Children serves over 600 children in 11 communities across the United States. ``The Friends of the Children National Demonstration Act'' will establish a national demonstration project to promote learning about successful early and sustained childhood interventions. This bill would authorize funding for Friends of the Children activities and local program operations at existing sites, ongoing evaluation, and dissemination of findings for the benefit of policy makers and other youth-serving programs.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and make a commitment to improving the lives of disadvantaged children and youth.                                 ______                                       By
