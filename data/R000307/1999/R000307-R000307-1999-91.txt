President, I ask unanimous consent, with respect to S. 1059, S. 1060, S. 1061, and S. 1062 just passed by the Senate, that if the Senate receives a message with respect to any one of these bills from the House of Representatives, the Senate disagree with the House on its amendment or amendments to the Senate-passed bill and agree to or request a conference, as appropriate, with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees; and that the foregoing occur without any intervening action or debate.
