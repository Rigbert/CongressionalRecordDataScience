Speaker, Speaker Newt Gingrich announced last week that if political gridlock in Washington results in closing down Federal services to our Nation, so be it.  The Speaker also went on to say that he, as the Speaker, is prepared to force America into a default on its debt for the first time in our history if he does not get his way.  Mr. Speaker, too many politicians on Capitol Hill are talking about a political train wreck as if we are playing with toy trains. A shutdown of Federal services is a serious matter. Members of Congress should take it seriously.  That is why I have introduced legislation that would cut off the paychecks of Members of Congress and the President if the Federal Government shuts down because of budgetary gridlock. No budget, no pay. If we do not finish the job, we do not get paid. It is just that simple.  We were sent to Washington to solve problems, to work together, to do things in a constructive way. Gridlock and train wrecks are politics as usual. If the political leaders in this town fail, the salaries of Congress and the President should be the first on the budget chopping block.                          ____________________
