 President, I commend my friend and colleague, the former chairman of the committee, the ranking Democrat, Senator Lautenberg, and his staff. I believe, as he said, we worked a lot of hours, but our staff has put in, together, many more hours. I want to recognize and thank Wally Burnett, who is the staff director on the subcommittee, also Peter Rogoff whom Senator Lautenberg has just mentioned, Elizabeth Letchworth, Jay Kimmitt, Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, Steve Cortese, and all the others who contributed to this.  We think we have a pretty good bill. We have to go to conference and work it out. Let's hope we can do it.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
