President, the Y2K bill demonstrates successful bipartisanship and cooperation, and how well Congress can work together when it wants to. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, Senators Hatch, Bennett, Dodd, Thompson, Kyl and I, along with others, have worked with the Administration and the House of Representatives to create and pass this legislation. I thank them for their hard work and dedication to this issue.  Four-hundred and forty-nine days from now, millions of computers controlling our air traffic, recording stock and credit card transactions, running electric and telephone systems, tracking bank deposits and monitoring hospital patients may crash in befuddlement. All of this is due to the short-sighted omission of a couple of digits, a one and a nine, from computer chips. Passage of this bill is a signal to the world that by acting now, we can work together to avoid these problems.  The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will not eliminate the millennium bug--regrettably, no legislation could do that. However, it will greatly increase the chances that industry, university and government experts will work cooperatively to come up with the solutions.  One of the scariest aspects of the Y2K bug has been the silence of businesses and industries in the face of this common enemy. Liability concerns have muted industry experts, dashing the best hopes for developing fixes for this problem. The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act was designed to overcome this isolation and create a free flow of constructive information.  The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will encourage the sharing of knowledge and working together to create solutions. This bill does not give companies liability protection for their products or services. Rather, for a limited time it will provide adjusted procedures for the exchange of Year 2000 information. This is our best bet to ensuring that services and products will continue operating after midnight on December 31, 1999.  This bill also includes a provision I proposed that will assist consumers, small businesses and local governments. It charters a national information clearinghouse and website as a starting point to provide rapid and accurate information about solving Y2K problems. This will be a needed tool for small businesses, local governments and citizens so they can prepare for the millennium.  I want to thank the President and Vice President for their foresight in this issue, and the corporate leaders who worked together with us to get this done. Major industries--from telecommunications, electric, computer, transportation, energy, health, insurance and many others--pitched in and listened to each other and worked together. I congratulate and thank Senators for their unanimous support for this measure. It is reassuring to know that even in the midst of other dramas, Congress can come together to tackle fundamental issues confronting our national economy and security. I look forward to the President signing this important legislation.                          ____________________
