 President, I rise in support of my two colleagues' viewpoints on the value of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program and its national resource center. The hearings that my colleague from Louisiana and I have conducted over the years have provided significant evidence that the ombudsman program is critical in protecting the rights of older and disabled individuals living in long-term care facilities.  Training and technical assistance are among the critical variables in determining the quality of services that ombudsmen are able to provide. Additional funds appropriated for the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center would be used to increase the capacity of the Center to develop and coordinate training systems and other skills-building opportunities for State, local and volunteer ombudsmen. The Center has an exemplary track record and this will improve program consistency among states and enhance program effectiveness.
