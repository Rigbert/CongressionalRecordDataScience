Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great Irish-American success story, Judge Gerard Devlin of Prince George's County, Maryland. Judge Devlin is called Jerry by his friends of which I am fortunate to be one. I have known Jerry for over thirty years, since I was an intern in Senator Brewster's office and Jerry was an elevator operator in the Capitol.  I have valued Jerry's friendship over those three decades and have always enjoyed his boisterous and comic Irish sensibility. We have also shared a close professional relationship and Jerry was always a faithful ally through our days in the Young Democrats, the Maryland General Assembly and beyond.  I pay tribute to Jerry today not simply because he is a good and old friend but to thank him upon the occasion of his retirement. His distinguished career in public service is not matched by many and his affable and courteous manner is appreciated by all.  Jerry was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts on May 29, 1933. He attended public schools in Dorchester and Boston, and served in U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1957. He went on to Boston College and Suffolk University, and graduated from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1969. He also earned his masters from the University of Maryland in 1970.  Jerry began his career in public service as a staff member in the United States House of Representatives in 1959 and later worked in the United States Senate. His service was not limited to the national level however. He served his local community for five years as a member of the Prince George's County Board of Election Supervisors from 1964 to 1969, and as a member of the Charter Review Commission of the city of Bowie.  Jerry also served his community as a teacher to Prince George's County's youth at Gonzaga High School, Bowie State University, and Prince George's Community College.  In 1975, Jerry took his talent to the Maryland General Assembly where I had the pleasure of serving with him for six years. He was a member of the House of Delegates for eleven years and was named Freshman Legislator of the Year by the Maryland Young Democrats in 1975. He was also named Legislator of the Year by the Prince George's Municipal Association in 1983, 1985, and 1986.  Jerry stepped down from his position as Associate Judge in the 5th District Court of Maryland this past September and retired from a long and praiseworthy career in civic affairs. During his tenure as a judge, Jerry was well-liked and respected by both bench and bar for his even-handedness and wisdom. He had a good feel for fundamental fairness and through it all his Irish wit and humor shone through.  Judge Bob Sweeney, the former Chief Judge of the Maryland District Court, said this of Jerry, ``One of the ten things that a good judge needs is courage. For a judge that means doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing. Jerry Devlin personifies that type of courage.''  Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat today an Irish Blessing for my dear friend Jerry Devlin to thank him for his years of service and to wish him well in retirement: May your blessings outnumber the shamrocks that grow,/And may trouble avoid you wherever you go./May the road rise up to meet you,/May the wind be always at your back,/May the sun shine down upon your face,/And the rain fall soft upon your fields,/Until we meet again,/May God hold you in the hollow of his hand.  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great Irish American who gave forty years of public service to Prince George's County and the state of Maryland.                          ____________________
