President, yesterday I introduced legislation to reauthorize the National Environment Education Act. I am joined by most of the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and will probably have all of those Members as cosponsors of this legislation in a very short time.  The reason I am doing this is that there has been a lot of criticism that we are getting that there is too much emanating from Washington on our environmental laws and environmental education. People have said we are brainwashing our children. I feel that the better way to do this is to have this money going to the local level so that the curriculum can be determined by the local level.  I can remember several scary stories about students coming home from school in the Northwest who happened to be sons or daughters of people working in the lumber industry saying that it is sinful to cut down any tree, and this type of thing. This is the type of thing that has to be stopped. I believe the only way we are going to be able to successfully do this is to reauthorize this legislation so that the safeguards are built in that anything that is used in the education of our young people has to be based on scientific facts and not just the normal scare type of things that we have been getting. So I believe we will be able to control this program.  This, incidentally, was introduced at the same time by Congressman Klug in the House of Representatives.  Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to reauthorize the National Environmental Education Act. I am joined by my colleagues Senators Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Kempthorne, Moynihan, and Reid. And I am joined on the House side by my colleague, Congressman Scott Klug of Wisconsin, who introduced an identical bill in the House yesterday.  This bill will reauthorize the educational efforts at the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation and the EPA's Office of Environmental Education. These programs support environmental education at the local level. They provide grant money and seed money to encourage local primary and secondary schools and universities to educate children on environmental issues.  With the importance of the environment and the continuing debate on how best to protect it, it is vital to educateour children so that they truly understand how the environment functions.  Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized for being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental advocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an environmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. They also accuse the Federal Government of setting one curriculum standard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is not how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I have taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way. In fact, this legislation will prevent this from happening.  The programs that this act reauthorizes have targeted the majority of their grants at the local level, allowing the teachers in our community schools to design their environmental programs to teach our children, and this is where the decisions should be made. In addition, the grants have not been used for advocacy or to lobby the Government, as other grant programs have been accused of doing.  This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it cleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. And second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to ensure its integrity in the future.  I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs are balanced and scientifically sound. It is important that environmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced manner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not be instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for themselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and information. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and not emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this in the past, this is an important safeguard to protect the future of environmental education.  Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to be used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the grant process to lobby the Government, there are other programs which have been accused of this and this language will ensure that this program never becomes a vehicle for the executive branch to lobby Congress.  This bill also makes a number of housekeeping changes to the programs which are supported by both the EPA and the Education Foundation which will both streamline and programs and make them more efficient.  The grants that have been awarded under this program have gone to a number of local groups. In Oklahoma alone such organizations as the Stillwater 4-H Foundation; Roosevelt Elementary School in Norman, OK; Oklahoma State University; the Kaw Nation of Oklahoma; and the Osage County Oklahoma Conservation District have received grants for environmental education under these programs.  This is an important piece of legislation, and I hope both the Senate and the House can act quickly to reauthorize these programs.                          ____________________
