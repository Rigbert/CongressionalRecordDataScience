Speaker, there they go again, Fantasy Island. The Republican majority would rather fight for the wealthiest interests in America than agree to eliminating the estate tax for 98 percent of Americans. They would rather put at risk the soundness of our economy, the stability of social security, the reliability of Medicare, and the ability to pay down the debt while investing in our children's education than give up on a plan that gives a $10.5 million average cut to 329 estates, and a $50 billion cut to the top 2 percent of estates. That is the truth.  The truth is more than half of the benefits of this Republican bill will go to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all Americans. I support the Democratic alternative which gives all estates relief now, not 10 years from now, as this bill does.  The President was right to veto this bill. He wants and I want a tax relief bill which is fiscally responsible and is targeted for the majority of working families. This bill would drain more than $50 billion annually to benefit just thousands of families while taking resources that should be used to strengthen social security and Medicare for millions of families.                              {time}  1500  I want tax cuts which will protect family farms and small businesses, but that will also help families send their kids to college, provide for long-term care, pay for child care, and help communities build badly needed schools.  We can do this, Mr. Speaker, if the Republican leadership will sit down at the table of democracy and reach agreement with those of us who were also elected to reason with one another on behalf of the American people.  If the majority will unlock itself from the grip of the special interest, we can legislate constructively and cooperatively on behalf of all of the people and just not for a very few of the people. Let us sustain this veto.
