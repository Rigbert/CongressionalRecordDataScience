President, the senior Senator from Utah has laid out very well the reasons for the changes proposed in the House and proposed by his and my bill. He also said something we should all think about. A couple of minutes ago, he said: Assuming everybody is following the rules today, are they going to follow the rules tomorrow or next year or the year after?  When he mentioned that, he also mentioned my years as a prosecutor. Let me tell a short story. I became one of the officers of the National District Attorneys Association and eventually vice president. A number of us had occasion to meet the then-Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. I thought back to some of the frightening things he said about investigating people because of their political beliefs. You could tell Communists because they were all ``hippies driving Volkswagens'' was one of the things he said; secondly, that the New York Times was getting too leftist in some of its editorials and was coming very close to being a Communist paper, and he was making plans to investigate it as such. Think about that for a moment. The New York Times had criticized him editorially, and he was thinking he should investigate it as a Communist paper.  Not long thereafter, he died. We found out more and more about the secret files he had on everybody, from Presidents to Members of Congress. What if a J. Edgar Hoover had the kinds of tools that are available today? That would be my response to the Senator from Utah, and that is why I totally agree with him that we have to think about not just today but what might happen in the future.  For years, Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has been used by the NSA to justify the bulk collection of innocent Americans' phone records. Americans were appropriately outraged when they learned about this massive intrusion into their privacy.  Look at what happened last week. The highly respected Federal Second Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed what we have known for some time: The NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records is unlawful, it is not essential, and it must end. That basically says it all. It is unlawful, it is not essential, and it should end.  Under the government's interpretation of Section 215, the NSA or FBI can obtain any tangible thing so long as it is ``relevant'' to an authorized investigation. Think for a moment back to J. Edgar Hoover--and I do not by any means equate the current Director of the FBI or his predecessors with what happened back then, but if you have somebody with that mindset.  In the name of fighting terrorism, the government convinced a secret court that it needed to collect billions of phone records of innocent Americans--not because those phone records were relevant to any specific counterterrorism investigation but, rather, because the NSA wanted to sift through them in the future. This is an extraordinarily broad reading of the statute--one that I can say, as someone who was here at the time, that Congress never intended--and the Second Circuit rightfully held that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is ``unprecedented and unwarranted.'' Such an interpretation of ``relevance'' has no logical limits.  This debate is not just about phone records. If we accept that the government can collect all of our phone records because it may want to sift through them someday to look for some possible connection to terrorists, where will it end?  We know that for years the NSA collected metadata about billions of emails sent by innocent Americans using the same justification. Should we allow the government to sweep up all of our credit card records, all of our banking or medical records, our firearms or ammunition purchases? Or how about anything we have ever posted on Facebook or anything we have ever searched for on Google or any other search engine? Who wants to tell their constituents that they support putting all this information into government databases?  I say enough is enough. I do not accept that the government will be careful in safeguarding this secret data--so careful that they allowed a private contractor named Edward Snowden to walk away with all this material. What is to stop anybody else from doing exactly the same thing?  During one of the six Judiciary Committee hearings that I convened on these issues last Congress, I asked the then-Deputy Attorney General whether there was any limit to this interpretation of Section 215. I did not get a satisfactory answer--that is, until the Second Circuit ruled last week and correctly laid out the implication of this theory. They said that if the government's interpretation of Section 215 is correct, the government could use Section 215 to collect and store in bulk ``any other existing metadata available anywhere in the private sector, including metadata associated with financial records, medical records, and electronic communications (including e-mail and social media information) relating to all Americans.'' I don't think you are going to find many Americans anywhere in the political spectrum who want to give this government or any other government that kind of power because nothing under the government's interpretation would stop it from collecting and storing in bulk any of this information.  The potential significance of this interpretation is staggering. It is no wonder that groups as disparate as the ACLU and the National Rifle Association have joined together to file a lawsuit in the Second Circuit to stop this bulk collection program.  Congress finally has the opportunity to make real reforms not only to Section 215 but to other parts of FISA that can be used to conduct bulk collection. Tomorrow, the House will consider the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Senator Lee and I have introduced an identical bill in the Senate. If enacted, our bill will be the most significant reform to government surveillance authorities since the USA PATRIOT Act was passed nearly 14 years ago. Our bill will end the NSA's bulk collection program under Section 215. It also guarantees unprecedented transparency about government surveillance programs, allows the FISA Court to appoint an amicus to assist it in significant cases, and strengthens judicial review of the gag orders imposed on recipients of national security letters.  The USA FREEDOM Act is actually a very commonsense bill. That is why Senator Lee and I were able to join together on it. He is right--we come from different political philosophies, different parts of the country, and obviously we don't agree on all things, but we agreed on this because it makes common sense and it is something that should bring together Republicans and Democrats. It was crafted with significant input from privacy and civil liberties groups, the intelligence community, and the technology industry. It has support from Members of Congress and groups from across the political spectrum.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record editorials from the Washington Times, the Washington Post, USA TODAY, and the Los Angeles Times in support of the USA FREEDOM Act.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Times, May 7, 2015]                        Big Brother Takes a Hit The courts give an assist to repealing intrusions into the privacy of                                 everyone       Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has      made it clear to his colleagues that he wants the USA Patriot      Act, including the controversial parts of the legislation      scheduled to expire at the end of June, fully extended. He's      seems ready to do whatever he can to get his way.       The USA Patriot Act was enacted in the days following Sept.      11, when the nation trembled on the verge of panic, with      little debate and little opposition in Congress. The Patriot      Act has been recognized since on both left and right as      unfortunate legislation that granted too much power to the      government to snoop into the lives, calls and emails of      everyone in the name of national security.       Mr. McConnell thought he could force the Senate to either      let the law lapse, to panic everyone again, or get an      extension without modification until the year 2020. Even as      Mr. McConnell praised the National Security Agency's reliance      on the act to justify the collection of telephonic      ``metadata'' from millions of Americans, the 2nd U.S. Circuit      Court of Appeals was writing the decision, released Thursday,      declaring the government program, first revealed by Edward      Snowden, illegal because the language of the act cannot be      read to justify such sweeping government action.       The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties      Union and joined by groups,     including the National Rifle Association, and welcomed by      civil libertarians across the land. To continue the program,      the Obama administration would presumably have to persuade      Congress to adopt language specifically authorizing the NSA      to collect and hold such data. That attempt might be      forthcoming.       The court's decision gives a boost to the advocates for the      USA Freedom Act, which would modify the Patriot Act. The      Freedom Act is expected to pass in the House and Mr.      McConnell's strategy to kill it in the Senate may not work      now, given the appeals court's decision.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate      Judiciary Committee, read the 97-page opinion and said,      ``Congress should take up and pass the bipartisan USA Freedom      Act, which would ban bulk collection under Section 215 and      enact other meaningful surveillance reforms.''       The opinion of the liberal senator from Vermont is shared      by the conservative Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, an      author of the Patriot Act who has since regretted its excess.      He joined the ACLU lawsuit as ``a friend of the court,'' and      said Thursday that ``it's time for Congress to pass the USA      Freedom Act in order to protect both civil liberties and      national security with legally authorized surveillance.''       When the chips are down, blind partisanship, with genuine      cooperation, can still be put aside.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2015]               New Rules for the National Security Agency       For months, Congress has debated the National Security      Agency's telephone metadata collection program, without      legislative result. Now two factors have combined to make      that frustrating situation even less sustainable. The      legislative authority that first the George W. Bush      administration and then the Obama administration cited for      the program, Section 215 of the Patriot Act, is expiring on      June 1. And, on Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      2nd Circuit ruled that their interpretation of Section 215      was wrong anyway.       Congress needs to respond, and the sooner the better. To be      sure, the court's ruling has no immediate practical impact,      since the three-judge panel considered it superfluous to stop      the program less than a month before Section 215 expires. The      court's reasoning, though, could, and should, influence the      debate. Judge Gerard E. Lynch's opinion noted that the NSA's      mass storage of data, basically just in case it should be      needed for a subsequent inquiry, stretched the statute's      permission of information-gathering ``relevant to an      authorized investigation'' beyond ``any accepted      understanding of the term.''       Intelligence and law enforcement must be able to gather and      analyze telephone metadata, but that requirement of national      security can, and must, be balanced by robust protections of      privacy and civil liberties. Under the current system, those      protections consist of the NSA's own internal limitations on      access to the database, subject to supervision by the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)--which operates in      secret and considers arguments only from the government. A      democratic society requires more explicit, transparent      protections.       There is, fortunately, a promising reform proposal readily      available: the USA Freedom bill, which enjoys bipartisan      support in both chambers as well as broad endorsement from      President Obama--and the affected private industries as well.      In a nutshell, it would abandon the bulk collection of the      NSA's metadata, and warrantless searches of it, in favor of a      system under which telecommunications firms retained the      information, subject to specific requests from the      government. Those queries, in turn, would have to be approved      by the FISC. Along with the bill's provisions mandating      greater disclosure about the FISC's proceedings, the      legislation would go a long way toward enhancing public      confidence in the NSA's operations, at only modest cost, if      any, to public safety.       The measure has passed the House Judiciary Committee by a      vote of 25 to 2. In the Senate, it failed to muster 60 votes      last year when Democrats were in the majority, and its      prospects appear even dimmer now that the Republicans are in      control; their leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) favors      reauthorizing Section 215 as-is.       Mr. McConnell's view--that the statute does, indeed,      authorize bulk metadata collection--was legally tenable,      barely, before the 2nd Circuit's opinion. Now he should      revise it. If the Senate renews Section 215 at all, it should      only be a short-term extension to buy time for intensive      legislating after June 1--with a view toward enacting reform      promptly. If the anti-terrorism effort is to be sustainable,      Congress must give the intelligence agencies, and the public,      a fresh, clear and, above all, sustainable set of      instructions.                                  ____                     [From USA Today, May 10, 2015]              Patriot Act Calls for Compromise in Congress     proposal on nsa and phone records would go a long way toward                     rebalancing security and liberty       In the years since the USA Patriot Act was approved in the      frantic days following 9/11, it has become steadily more      apparent that the law and the way it was applied were an      overreaction to those horrific events.       The most flagrant abuse is the government's collection of      staggering amounts of phone ``metadata'' on virtually every      American. That program--which collects the number you call,      when you call and how long you talk--was secret until Edward      Snowden's leaks confirmed it in 2013.       Last Thursday, a federal appeals court--the highest to rule      on the issue--found that the program is illegal. You'd think      the unambiguous ruling from a unanimous three-judge panel      would finally force changes to the bulk collection program.       But that's not necessarily going to happen, even though a      compromise has emerged in Congress that would go a long way      toward rebalancing security and liberty.       Under the compromise, the data would remain with the phone      companies instead of the government. Requests to access the      database would have to be far more limited, and each would      require approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court.       The new procedure would eliminate some of the phone      collection program's most intrusive features, while keeping      the security it offers at a time when the terrorist group      Islamic State brings new threats. The measure has support      from Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives,      and a long list of civil liberties and privacy groups.       It would also satisfy the court, which didn't dispute      Congress' right to create such a program, just the executive      branch's right to do so without Congress' assent.       Yet instead of embracing the compromise, Senate Majority      Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican presidential hopeful Sen.      Marco Rubio of Florida, and others are working to sabotage      it. They want the Senate to ensure that the program will      continue just as it is after parts of the Patriot Act expire      at the end of this month.       While the phone program's benefits are dubious, its costs      are clear. Several major tech companies have said that      privacy intrusions have hurt U.S. companies. Meanwhile,      innocent Americans suffer an assault to their privacy each      day the government collects data on their calls. And if this      sort of collection goes on, history demonstrates the      government is likely to abuse it.       As the appeals court ruling warned, if the government's      interpretation were correct in stretching the law to collect      phone data, it could use the same interpretation to ``collect      and store in bulk any other existing metadata available      anywhere,'' including financial records, medical records,      email and social media.       Choosing between privacy and security in these dangerous      times is difficult. But, despite what supporters of bulk      collection insist, lawmakers don't have to choose.       A carefully built compromise allows access to phone      records, but with genuine privacy safeguards. The nation      would be no less secure. And the civil liberties on which the      nation was built would be better protected.                                  ____               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 6, 2015]               The USA Freedom Act: A Smaller Big Brother       Last fall, Congress was on the verge of doing away with the      most troubling invasion of privacy revealed by Edward      Snowden: the National Security Agency's indiscriminate      collection of the telephone records of millions of Americans.      But then opponents cited the emergence of Islamic State as a      reason for preserving the status quo. The Senate failed to      muster the 60 votes needed to proceed with the so-called USA      Freedom Act.       But the legislation has staged a comeback. Last week the      House Judiciary Committee approved a bill of the same name      that would end bulk collection--leaving phone records in the      possession of telecommunications providers. The government      could search telephone records only by convincing a court      that there was ``reasonable, articulable suspicion'' that a      specific search term--such as a telephone number--was      associated with international terrorism. And rules would be      tightened so that investigators couldn't search records from,      say, an entire state, city or ZIP Code.       Americans were understandably alarmed in 2013 when Snowden      revealed that information about the sources, destination and      duration of their phone calls was being vacuumed up by the      NSA and stored by the government, which could then ``query''      the database without court approval for numbers connected to      suspected terrorists. After initially defending the program,      President Obama modified it a bit, but he left it to Congress      to make the fundamental change of ending bulk collection.       We had hoped that Congress would take a fresh look at      whether this program is necessary at all, given a      presidential task force's conclusion that it was ``not      essential to preventing attacks.'' But if Congress is      determined to continue the program, it must establish      safeguards. The bill does this, though there is room for      improvement. For example, unlike last year's Senate bill,      this measure doesn't require the government to destroy      information it obtains about individuals who aren't the      target of an investigation or suspected agents of a foreign      government or terrorist organization.       Approval is likely in the House, but prospects in the      Senate are more doubtful. Senate Majority Leader Mitch      McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that ending bulk collection of      phone records would amount to ``tying our hands behind our      backs.''       That was, and is, a specious objection. Under this      legislation, the government can     continue to search telephone records when there is a      reasonable suspicion of a connection to terrorism. But it      will no longer be able to warehouse those records, and it      will have to satisfy a court that it isn't on a fishing      expedition. Those are eminently reasonable restrictions--     unless you believe that the war against Islamic State and      similar groups means that Americans must sacrifice their      right to privacy in perpetuity.
