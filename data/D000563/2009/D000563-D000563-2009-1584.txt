President, today, along with Senators Whitehouse, Murray, Cardin and Dodd, I am introducing a bill to triple the number of Foreign Service officers working with USAID.  As we take stock of America's image in the world, it's clear that we need to do more to help countries stabilize their society and their economy.  Our own security depends on the stability of far-flung places beyond our borders.  America's generosity and ability to help other countries is becoming more important to the effectiveness of our foreign policy.  In the U.S., the responsibility for development falls largely to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.  USAID was founded by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization with the primary goal of long term economic and social development efforts overseas.  During its first decade, it had more than 5,000 Foreign Service Officers serving all over the world, often in the most difficult of conditions.  Today--at a time when the U.S. needs to show its leadership overseas more than ever--USAID operates with just 1,000 Foreign Service Officers.  With so few people to deploy, our hands are tied and we're missing opportunities to build bridges and foster diplomacy.  For example, more than seven years after U.S. took military action in Afghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaeda continue to undermine progress toward a more stable state.  Our military has done a heroic job in Afghanistan. But success in Afghanistan also depends on improving the lives of the Afghan people--jobs, agriculture, stability, and a functional government.  We have not done enough to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. And the military cannot bear this burden alone.  The last time I went to Afghanistan there were only six American agricultural experts for the entire country--I think today there are only slightly more.  For a nation with an agricultural economy and record poppy harvest, we have been able to lend just a handful of agricultural development experts.  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates understands this critical need to partner our military efforts with civilian development expertise. Last month he said:       The problem is that the civil side of our government--the      Foreign Service and foreign-policy side, including our aid      for international development--[has] been systematically      starved of resources for a quarter of a century or more . . .      We have not provided the resources necessary, first of all,      for our diplomacy around the world; and second, for      communicating to the rest of the world what we are about and      who we are as a people.  Many people on both sides of the aisle agree that USAID is no longer equipped to do its job effectively. We simply are not meeting the international development goals of the United States.  USAID has been shortchanged--and America's efforts abroad have suffered as a result.  Now we have a lot of needs here at home, to be sure. But one important lesson of the last few years is that America must be engaged if we are to remain a leader in world affairs.  The Increasing America's Global Development Capacity Act of 2009 would take the first step toward putting the Agency for International Development on firmer footing. As Secretary Clinton said in her remarks to USAID employees last week, it is ironic that that our very best young military leaders are given unfettered resources to spend as they see fit to build a school, to open a health clinic, to pave a road, and our diplomats and development experts have to go through miles of paperwork to spend ten cents. Secretary Clinton said, and I agree, that this is not a sensible approach.  The bill would authorize USAID to hire an additional 700 Foreign Service Officers this year. This would basically double the current number of development officers available to work in targeted countries.  This is fundamental to rebuilding the agency's capacity.  Senator Leahy, Chair of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, shares a commitment to rebuilding USAID. I am heartened by the Subcommittee's recommended increase in funding for USAID's operating expenses for fiscal year 2009. This was a priority for me in the bill, and Chairman Leahy has been very supportive.  My bill also would establish a goal of hiring an additional 1,300 Foreign Service Officers by 2012.  After three years, USAID would have more than 3,000 talented, committed Americans serving in the world's most difficult locations helping to improve the lives of others. It won't be the 5,000 experts of the 1960s, but it will be a big improvement from today.  With a stronger development work force, we can send talented public servants to help improve child and maternal health, treat people with AIDS, TB and malaria, provide clean water and sanitation, help farmers and women start or improve their business, and assist reformers and civic leaders to build stronger democratic institutions.  We all recall the renewed interest in public service that emerged after 9/11--many of those people have answered the call, and I bet there are as many more who would welcome an opportunity to serve.  Foreign development assistance is as important a foreign policy tool as diplomacy and defense.  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is perhaps the most persuasive advocate for rebuilding our civilian development capacity. He argues that we need to engage in non-military ways to pursue global development goals.  The civilian instruments of national security--diplomacy, development assistance, sharing expertise on civil society--are becoming more and more important.  Secretary Gates argues that these tools are good for the world's poor, our national security, and our country.  I agree.  Let us take one concrete step to rebuild that important civilian capacity, which would help improve our ability to help the world's poorest countries and people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 355       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing America's Global      Development Capacity Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) foreign development assistance is an important foreign      policy tool in addition to diplomacy and defense;       (2) development assistance is part of any comprehensive      United States response to regional conflicts, terrorist      threats, weapons proliferation, disease pandemics, and      persistent widespread poverty;       (3) in 2002 and 2006, the United States National Security      Strategy included global development, along with defense and      diplomacy, as the 3 pillars of national security;       (4) in its early years, the United States Agency for      International Development (referred to in this Act as      ``USAID'') had more than 5,000 full-time Foreign Service      Officers;       (5) in 2008, USAID had slightly more than 1,000 full-time      Foreign Service Officers;       (6) the budget at USAID, calculated in real dollars, has      dropped 27 percent since 1985;       (7) this decline in personnel and operating budgets has      diminished the capacity of USAID to provide development      assistance and implement foreign assistance programs; and     SEC. 3. HIRING OF ADDITIONAL FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS AS                    USAID EMPLOYEES.       (a) Initial Hirings.--Except as provided under subsection      (c), not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Administrator of USAID (referred to in this      section as the ``Administrator'') shall increase by not less      than 700 the total number of full-time Foreign Service      Officers employed by USAID compared to the number of such      officers employed by USAID on September 30, 2008. These      officers shall be used to enhance the ability of USAID to--       (1) carry out development activities around the world by      providing USAID with additional human resources and expertise      needed to meet important development and humanitarian needs      around the world;       (2) strengthen the institutional capacity of USAID as the      lead development agency of the United States; and       (3) more effectively help developing nations to become more      stable, healthy, democratic, prosperous, and self-sufficient.       (b) Subsequent Hirings.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided under subsection (c),      during the 2-year period beginning 1 year after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall increase      by not less than 1,300 the total number of full-time Foreign      Service Officers over the number of such officers at the      beginning of such 2-year period to carry out the activities      described in subsection (a), contingent upon sufficient      appropriations.       (2) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit a      strategy to Congress that includes--       (A) a plan to create a professional training program that      will provide new and current USAID employees with technical,      management, leadership, and language skills;       (B) a staffing plan for the subsequent 5 years; and       (C) a description of further resources and statutory      changes necessary to implement the proposed training and      staffing plans.       (c) Exception.--If the Administrator determines that USAID      has competing needs that are more urgent than the hirings      described in subsection (a) or (b), or finds a shortage of      qualified individuals for such hirings, the Administrator may      reduce the number of such hirings and use the available funds      for competing needs if the Administrator submits a report      describing such competing needs and, if applicable, the      nature of the shortage, to--       (1) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;       (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;       (3) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of      Representatives; and       (4) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of      Representatives.                                 ______                                       By
