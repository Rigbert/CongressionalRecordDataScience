These are careful, appropriate, and effective steps. The Coburn amendment would mandate sweeping cuts which would decimate programs. The amendment is opposed by law enforcement, including the National Association of Police Organizations, and by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women.  Of course we all want to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. But this amendment is not the way to do it. The amendment purports to be based on findings by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO, but it misconstrues those findings. The amendment states that the GAO identified $3.9 billion in ``duplicative'' grants programs. That is simply not the case. The July 2012 GAO report states that the total amount of grants awarded by the Justice Department in fiscal year 2010 was only $3.6 billion. You cannot have $3.9 billion in duplication when the total amount of grant money awarded was less than that.  More importantly, the GAO report did not actually conclude that there was duplication. The July report said there was ``the potential risk of unnecessary duplication'' and recommended that the Justice Department conduct an assessment to determine if grant programs could be consolidated to mitigate that risk. The GAO did not recommend any funding cuts and certainly did not recommend the $780 million cut that this amendment would require. As I have noted, our bill already includes a 17-percent cut in authorizations.  The amendment offered by Senator Coburn requires the Department of Justice to gut key grant programs. It would mandate that the Department cut at least $780 million from its grant programs, many of which provide critical funding to law enforcement and victim service providers. This would have devastating effects on victims of rape and domestic violence, and I urge Senators to vote against it.  The amendment tries to sugarcoat the damage it will do by reference to untested rape kits. In fact, it is the amendment that is duplicative. We have established the Debbie Smith Act to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits and the Leahy-Crapo bill already includes measures to reduce the backlog through core VAWA programs and through the inclusion of the SAFER Act.  By gutting grant programs to law enforcement and victims, the Coburn amendment does not help victims of rape, who rely on victim service providers funded with these grants and on law enforcement who count on Federal support. Mandating vast cuts in programs for victims and law enforcement at a time when those programs are already being squeezed is bad policy. These grant programs save lives. The amendment is bad for victims and bad for law enforcement. I urge Senators to oppose it.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in opposition to amendment No. 15 to S. 47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Association                                of Police Organizations, Inc.,                          Alexandria, Virginia, February 11, 2013.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the National Association      of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing 241,000 rank-     and-file officers from across the United States, I write to      you to inform you that we strongly oppose proposed Amendment      15, offered by Senator Coburn, to the Violence Against Women      Act Reauthorization of 2013 (S. 47).       This amendment would mandate cuts of $780 million or more      from Department of Justice grant programs. Those cuts would      have to come from programs that help victims of crime, like      the Violence Against Women Act, or from aid to state and      local law enforcement, among other important grant programs.       Mandating vast cuts in programs for victims and law      enforcement at a time when those programs are already being      squeezed is bad policy. State and local governments rely on      vital federal assistance, including for bullet proof vests      and other life-saving equipment.       This VAWA reauthorization already reduces authorization      levels and adds important accountability measures. These are      careful, appropriate, and effective steps. The Coburn      amendment would add sweeping and unprincipled mandated cuts      which would decimate programs. For these reasons, we must      strongly oppose it.           Sincerely,                                               William J. Johnson,     Executive Director.                                  ____         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2013.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Task Force to End Sexual      and Domestic Violence represents thousands of national,      tribal, state, territorial and local organizations, as well      as survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault, and stalking. We are committed to securing an end to      violence against women. National Task Force to End Sexual and      Domestic Violence agrees that more funding should be made      available for the rape kit backlog and other critical victim      services and notes that significant provisions to do this and      address the crime of rape are already included in S. 47.       On the other hand, the National Task Force to End Sexual      and Domestic Violence is opposed to Amendment No. 15 to S.      47, proposed by Senator Coburn. Senator Coburn's amendment      has the ostensible goal of saving money on administrative      costs in order to redirect those funds to address the      nation's rape kit backlog. But the amendment's mandates would      ultimately cost so much money themselves--that they could not      generate the proposed savings promised to alleviate the rape      kit backlog.       This amendment would mandate cuts of more than $700 million      to Department of Justice grant programs, eviscerating      services to victims of all crimes and decimating justice      system responses to crime.       This amendment also requires a top to bottom review of      every program in the Department of Justice, every staff      position in the Department of Justice, and every staff person      hired by every contractor engaged by the Department of      Justice. An audit of this scope is simply unworkable and      would drain valuable resources that would otherwise support      law enforcement agencies, courts, prosecutors' office, and      victim services, leaving     victims of all forms of crime vulnerable to great harm.       The audit proposed in Amendment No. 15 would require the      Department of Justice to investigate every one of its      approximately 110,000 employees, including U.S. Attorneys,      FBI agents, federal marshals, ATF employees, federal prison      employees, in search of supposed duplications and waste. The      U.S. Department of Justice has 38 agencies and is the largest      law enforcement agency in this country; to hamper its      incredibly important work fighting crime every day with an      audit that may or may not yield proof of duplication or      waste, is an injustice to all of the people the Justice      Department is bound to protect and serve. A review of this      size and scope would clearly cost hundreds of millions of      dollars, a growth of government functions that is      unconscionable in a time of fiscal crisis.       There is an easier and much less expensive way to reduce      administrative costs in order to dedicate more funding to      direct services--and that is accomplished in S. 47. S. 47      consolidates 13 existing programs in the Office on Violence      Against Women into 4 programs. S. 47 already addresses      duplication and potential waste in Violence Against Women      Act-funded programs through these consolidations. S. 47 will      free up more funds for direct services by consolidating      administrative functions--and will preserve desperately      needed services.       Amendment No. 15 will require the Department of Justice to      spend hundreds of millions of dollars that could otherwise go      toward direct services, meaning fewer victims served and more      programs closing. We ask you and your fellow Senators to vote      NO on Amendment No. 15.           Sincerely,     The Member Programs of the National Task Force to End Sexual                                             and Domestic Violence.
