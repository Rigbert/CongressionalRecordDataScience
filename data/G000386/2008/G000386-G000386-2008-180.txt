 President, I am pleased to introduce today the Preserving Access to Medicare Act of 2008.  If we do not act very quickly, the physicians who treat Medicare patients will face a 10.6 percent pay cut, effective July 1.  It is not in the best interest of America's seniors who depend on Medicare for their doctors to take such a significant cut.  Such a dramatic cut will affect access that seniors have to their doctors.  The bill we are introducing today provides a 0.5 percent physician update for the remainder of 2008 and a 1.1 percent update for 2009.  This increase is identical to the one the majority is looking to proceed to tomorrow.  Preserving access to health care for Medicare beneficiaries is a first priority, but it is not the only thing we are accomplishing in this bill.  The bill will also improve the quality of care in Medicare. It increases the physician quality reporting bonus from 1.5 percent to 2 percent for 2009 and 2010.  The bill retains the Physician Assistance and Quality Improvement (PAQI) fund to specifically help avert future physician cuts.  It promotes value-based purchasing, e-prescribing, and electronic health records.  It includes a responsible rural package, including a rural home health add-on payment.  It returns the ownership of oxygen equipment to the supplier, not the beneficiary.  The bill extends section 1011 of the Medicare Modernization Act for two years at a total of $400 million.  It phases out the duplicative Indirect Medical Education payments from Medicare Advantage.  The bill makes reforms to Medicare Advantage marketing practices to curb abusive activities. It requires all MA plans to report on quality.  I also want to devote a moment to what the bill we are introducing today does not do.  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill we are introducing today does not make cuts to payments for power wheelchairs.  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill we are introducing today does not reduce payments for oxygen.  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill we are introducing today does not make large, unwarranted cuts to Medicare Advantage, altering policy decisions designed to maximize patient choice.  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill we are introducing today does not eliminate the PAQI fund, which Congress specifically created to help avert future physician cuts.  Unlike the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow, the bill we are introducing today does not expand eligibility for low-income Medicare programs, which would increase long-term entitlement spending and expand coverage under an already unsustainable program.  While well intentioned, this is not the right time for entitlement expansions like this.  The Medicare program is headed for a fiscal crisis that demands comprehensive reform.  Many would also like to add income-relating Part D subsidies to this bill as well. That change would make high income seniors shoulder a greater share of their Part D premium just like already happens today with premiums under Part B of Medicare.  These kind of changes need to be done. The other side has told us that they cannot support increasing premiums on high income seniors in order to provide greater assistance to lower income seniors.  Many on our side are disappointed by their position.  So it seems we will need to reserve those reforms on premiums until we are working on comprehensive Medicare reform in some future bill.  Finally, let me turn to the most critical difference between the bill we are introducing today and the bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow.  The bill we are introducing today can be signed into law. The President will sign our bill.  The bill the majority wants to proceed to tomorrow--if it somehow wereto make it to the President's desk--will be vetoed.  Republicans were not the ones that walked away from the negotiations and put a timely outcome of this effort in jeopardy.  I am ready to sit down on a bipartisan basis to find a compromise that protects seniors' access to Medicare and that can be signed into law.  Today we are introducing a bill that accomplishes that.  Tomorrow we are voting to proceed to a bill that does not.  I hope we can move beyond this political exercise soon to accomplish what seniors are counting on us to do.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:               Preserving Access to Medicare Act of 2008                     TITLE I--MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTSSubtitle A--Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2008  Sec. 101.

Section 123. Revocation of Unique Deeming Authority of the Joint                                Commission       This provision would revoke the unique statutory authority      granted to the Joint Commission of Healthcare Organizations      (JCAHO) to accredit hospitals for participation in Medicare.

Subtitle C--Other Provisions Relating to Part B                 Section 131. Physician Payment Update       Replaces the scheduled 10.1 percent cut to the Medicare      physician reimbursement rate with an 18-month update.

Section 152. Renal Dialysis Provisions       Provides a 1.0 percent update to the composite rate for      renal dialysis services as of January 1, 2009, and another      1.0 percent update as of January 1, 2010.

Subtitle E--Provisions Relating to Part C  Section 161. Phase-out of Indirect Medicare Education Payments from                   Payments to Medicare Advantage Plans       Phases out inclusion of payments for indirect medical      education (IME) in Medicare Advantage payments.

Revisions Relating to Specialized Medicare Advantage Plans                      for Special Needs Individuals       Extends the authority of specialized plans to target      enrollment to certain populations through 2009. Lifts the      moratorium on new plans and expanded service areas for      special needs plans serving institutionalized populations and      beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid      (``dual-eligibles''). All special needs plans must meet      additional requirements; 90 percent of new enrollment for all      plans would have to be special needs individuals and special      needs plans would have to have models of care targeted to the      special needs populations they served. Special needs plans      for dual Medicare- and Medicaid-eligibles would have three      years to reach agreement with the states in which they      operated. SNPs targeting dual-eligibles would have to protect      enrollees from cost-sharing the state would have covered had      these enrollees remained in fee-for-service Medicare. Retains      the moratorium for special needs plans serving those with      severe or disabling chronic conditions.  Section 164.

Section 166. MedPAC Study and Report on Medicare Advantage Payments       Instructs MedPAC to study and report to Congress on ways to      reimburse Medicare Advantage plans that do not rely on      county-level Medicare payment area equivalents.  Section 167. Marketing of Medicare Advantage Plans and Prescription                                Drug Plans       Prohibits Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans      from: paying cash for enrollment; offering gifts to potential      enrollees; door-to-door sales, cold-calling, or other such      personal contact; marketing non-health related products to      potential enrollees; conducting a marketing appointment      without an advance agreement; marketing in healthcare-     provider offices; or any marketing activity prohibited by the      Secretary. In addition, MA and prescription drug plans must      confirm that individuals have enrolled in and understand the      plan. MA and prescription drug plans must use state-licensed      and appointed marketing representatives. MA and prescription      drug plans must comply with state requests for information      about licensed agent or brokers. Requires the Secretary to      issue rules governing commissions and other compensation.      Requires training and testing of marketing representatives.

Section 172. Use of Part D Data       Gives the Secretary authority to use Medicare Part D data      for improving public health and conducting congressional      oversight. Section 173. Inclusion of Medicare Providers and Suppliers in Federal              Payment Levy and Administrative Offset Program       Allows Treasury Department to levy a proportion of a      Medicare provider's reimbursement against outstanding tax      debt.                           TITLE II--MEDICAID     Section 201. Extension of Transitional Medical Assistance and                      Abstinence Education Programs       Extends the Transitional Medical Assistance program (TMA)      through September 30, 2009.

Most of      the grant money must be used to provide outreach to      beneficiaries who may be eligible for Medicare savings      programs or low-income subsidies.  Section 304. Extension of Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health                Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens       Extends Federal reimbursement of emergency health services      furnished to undocumented aliens under section 1011 of the      MMA through FY 2010 for $200 million per year.                          ____________________
