That is a timely bill. I am glad we are considering it.  At another time, we will address the issue of increased cost of college education for working families and the failure of the Republican leadership to schedule opportunities for tax deductions and reductions in student loan costs for these students.  Of course, the energy issue is the issue I ran into all across Illinois. We have seen a doubling of gasoline prices under the Bush administration, there is a severe hardship on families and businesses, and still we have no energy policy to address this issue from this Republican-dominated Congress.
