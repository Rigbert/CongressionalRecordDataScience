Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I congratulate St. John the Baptist Church in Gary, Indiana, as they celebrate their 85th anniversary. They will be celebrating this special event on September 28, 2003, with a morning mass, a candlelight service in the afternoon, followed by a dinner in the evening honoring long time members with awards and recognition.  St. John the Baptist Church was first organized on July 10, 1918, by Reverend J. R. Butler. Over the many years of St. John's history, there have been many influential pastors that have led the congregation in faith and spiritual growth. Some of these inspirational pastors were Reverend A. J. Allen, Reverend T. L. Ballou, Reverend Leon Davis, Reverend Ivor Moore, Reverend Julius James, and the current pastor, Reverend Raymond McDonald, II.  It was during the 38th year of St. John's service to the Northwest Indiana community, and under the pastorate of Reverend Julius James, that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made his first visit to Gary, Indiana. It was also during this time that St. John's began its 144 unit non-for-profit housing development, St. John Homes, which supported fair employment and housing in Gary. Pastor James is most remembered and revered for his implementation of the Ecumenical Celebration, which honors the lifetime legacy and goodwill of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Reverend McDonald has continued this celebration and legacy.  Reverend McDonald, along with his parishioners, has given selflessly to the citizens of Gary by actively pursuing the church's mission of ``Serving People Between Sundays'' through a variety of community outreach programs. Some of these programs include weekly feeding programs where thousands of people are given nourishment, the Community Anchor's Program which helps form future leaders through after school programs, and the Golden Eagles Seniors' Program which fosters community involvement by senior citizens of Northwest Indiana.  Reverend McDonald and his congregation continue their vision for a new church building in the hope to even better serve the needs of the citizens of Gary and all of Northwest Indiana. By offering service and guidance to others, the members of St. John the Baptist Church have proven their sincere dedication and motivation for assisting others in need.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. John the Baptist Church of Gary, Indiana on their 85h anniversary. They deserve the highest commendation for their devotion and commitment to all the citizens of the First Congressional District of Indiana.                          ____________________
