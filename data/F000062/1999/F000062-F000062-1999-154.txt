 President, I rise today to express my thanks and appreciation to Ambassador James Sasser for the excellent job he has done as United States ambassador to China. After more than three years of dedicated service, Ambassador Sasser will be stepping down from his position.  Ambassador Sasser served during an interesting, often strenuous, period of U.S.-China relations. Drawing on his experiences as a distinguished three term United States Senator and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he worked tirelessly to ensure that the United States remained engaged with China to promote stability, openness, and prosperity in that country. Even Henry Kissinger, who initially expressed misgivings about Ambassador Sasser's appointment, recently remarked, ``I have known no American ambassador who has done a better or more passionate job on Sino-U.S. relations than Ambassador Sasser.''  Even during the bad times, when relations soured, Ambassador Sasser has maintained a high level of communication with Chinese leaders and provided a calm and steady influence. He recognized that no single issue can make or break U.S.-China relations and that open and frank dialogue is essential to promoting American values, especially those in the area of human rights.  Though he served with distinction for more than three years, perhaps Ambassador Sasser's finest hour came only a few weeks ago. After the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, tens of thousands of angry protesters gathered in front of the American embassy in Beijing and hurled bricks and rocks at the building. The situation was dangerously close to spinning out of control and the lives of those inside the embassy were potentially in danger. Rather than seek cover in a safer place, Ambassador Sasser stayed.  Near the end of his service, he provided us with a lasting image of poise, strength, and courage. His actions were indeed inspiring to those that were with him in Beijing and also to those of us who were watching as the events unfolded on television. He represented the finest of Americans who serve their country in embassies and consulates around the world--he was a diplomat who would not give up his post.  Again, I congratulate Ambassador Sasser for a job well done and wish him the best for his future endeavors.                          ____________________
