President, I congratulate Congresswoman Karen McCarthy of Missouri, who has worked so hard on this legislation. It provides congressional approval to an interstate compact that is important to her and to the people of Kansas City. I know that she helped establish the Kansas and Missouri Metropolitan Culture District for local efforts to benefit Kansas City and that she has championed this effort to obtain the constitutionally required congressional consent to the compact between Missouri and Kansas in this regard. I am glad the Senate is responding favorably to her efforts and commend her leadership in moving this measure through Congress.
