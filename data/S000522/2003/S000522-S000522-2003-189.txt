Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 277) expressing support for freedom in Hong Kong.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 277       Whereas Hong Kong has long been the world's freest economy,      renowned for its rule of law and its jealous protection of      civil rights and civil liberties;       Whereas the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration explicitly      guarantees that all of Hong Kong's freedoms, including press      freedom, religious freedom, and freedom of association, will      continue for at least 50 years;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      pledged to respect Hong Kong's Basic Law of 1990, which      explicitly protects freedom of speech, of the press and of      publication, of association, of assembly, of procession, of      demonstration, and of communication;       Whereas the Basic Law also explicitly protects freedom of      conscience, religious belief, and of religious expression;       Whereas Hong Kong's traditional rule of law, which has      guaranteed all of these civil rights and civil liberties, is      essential to its continued freedom, and the erosion of that      rule of law bodes ill for the maintenance and expansion of      both economic freedom and individual civil rights;       Whereas in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992      Congress declared: ``The human rights of the people of Hong      Kong are of great importance to the United States and are      directly relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong. A      fully successful transition in the exercise of sovereignty      over Hong Kong must safeguard human rights in and of      themselves. Human rights also serve as a basis for Hong      Kong's continued economic prosperity.'';       Whereas since Hong Kong became a Special Administrative      Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on July 1,      1997, the Hong Kong authorities have changed the system of      electing representatives to the Legislative Council, added      appointed members to District Councils, invited the central      government to reverse Hong Kong courts, and declined to      permit the entry of some American visitors and other foreign      nationals whose views are opposed by the People's Republic of      China;       Whereas, despite the provisions of the Basic Law which call      for a gradual and orderly process toward democratic election      of the legislature and chief executive, and which call for      universal suffrage, the Government of the Hong Kong SAR and      the People's Republic of China have stymied this process;       Whereas the traditional liberties of Hong Kong's 7,000,000      people are now immediately threatened by Hong Kong's proposed      ``Article 23'' laws, which were drafted under strong pressure      from the Government of the People's Republic of China,      dealing with sedition, treason, and subversion against the      Chinese Communist Party, and the theft of state secrets;       Whereas the proposed legislation would give the Hong Kong      Government discretion to imprison individuals for      ``attempting to commit'' the undefined crime of      ``subversion''; would criminalize not only membership in, but      even attendance at meetings of, organizations not approved by      Beijing; and would threaten freedom of religion, membership      in authentic trade unions, political activity of all kinds,      and a wide range of public and private expression;       Whereas the proposed legislation would give Hong Kong's      Secretary for Security, an appointee of the Government of the      People's Republic of China, broad authority to ban      organizations it deemed in opposition to the national      interest, thereby threatening religious organizations such as      the Falun Gong and the Roman Catholic Church;       Whereas under the proposed legislation such basic and      fundamental procedural rights as notice and opportunity to be      heard could be waived by the appointee of the Government of      the People's Republic of China in     Hong Kong if honoring these rights ``would not be      practicable'';       Whereas the People's Republic of China's history of      arbitrary application of its own criminal law against      dissenters, and its pattern of imprisoning and exiling those      with whom it disagrees, provide strong reasons to oppose the      expansion of Beijing's ability to use its discretion against      Hong Kong's freedoms;       Whereas similar subversion laws in the People's Republic of      China are regularly used to convict and imprison journalists,      labor activists, Internet entrepreneurs, and academics;       Whereas broad segments of the Hong Kong community have      expressed strong concerns about, and opposition to, the      proposed new laws;       Whereas those members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council      elected by universal suffrage oppose the proposed new laws,      but are powerless to stop them against the majority of votes      controlled directly and indirectly by the Government of the      People's Republic of China;       Whereas the scheduled consideration of these proposals to      restrict Hong Kong's freedoms in the Legislative Council on      July 9, 2003, makes the threat to its people clear and      imminent; and       Whereas it is the duty of freedom loving people everywhere      to stand with the people of Hong Kong against this dangerous      erosion of its long-held and cherished rights: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) condemns any restriction of the freedom of thought,      expression, or association in Hong Kong, consistent with the      United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992;       (2) recognizes that because Hong Kong exercises      considerable influence in international affairs, as a      developed economy, financial center, trading entrepot and      shipping center, reductions in the existing freedom of the      Hong Kong people would be of global significance;       (3) urges the Hong Kong Government and the People's      Republic of China to withdraw the proposed implementation of      Article 23 of the Basic Law insofar as it would reduce the      basic human freedoms of the people of Hong Kong;       (4) calls upon the People's Republic of China, the National      People's Congress, and any other groups appointed by the      Government of the People's Republic of China to leave all      revisions of Hong Kong law to a legislature elected by      universal suffrage;       (5) urges immediate elections for the Legislative Council      of Hong Kong according to rules approved by the Hong Kong      people through an election-law convention, referendum, or      both;       (6) calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of      China to fully respect the autonomy and independence of the      chief executive, the civil service, the judiciary, the police      of Hong Kong, and the Independent Commission Against      Corruption; and       (7) calls upon the United States Government, other      governments, the people of the United States, and the people      of the world to support freedom in Hong Kong by--       (A) making clear statements against any limitations on      existing human freedoms in Hong Kong; and       (B) transmitting those statements to the people and the      Government of the People's Republic of China.
