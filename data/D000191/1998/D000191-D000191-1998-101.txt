Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ``Aviation Consumer Right To Know Act,'' legislation to give consumers access to important airline industry information.  Twenty years after the deregulation of the airline industry a debate is raging about its benefits to consumers. Deregulation proponents tout the benefits of free market competition. However, to truly enjoy any of these benefits, consumers must have access to accurate information so they can make fully informed choices.  Although there is much debate about the impact of deregulation, it is quite clear that it is almost impossible for consumers to gain full access to information about the airline industry. The dizzying array of airline prices change constantly and inexplicably. The full selection of fares remains a mystery to consumers. Even travel agents do not have access to all available fares.  Many passengers are further bewildered when they book travel on one airline only to find upon boarding that they are actually flying on a totally different airline. Domestic code-sharing agreements, primarily between larger airlines and small regional airlines, allow one airline to book tickets on another without disclosing this information to consumers.  To make booking travel easier, many consumers turn to travel agents for help. However, what most consumers do not know is that travel agents often get special incentives to book the majority of air travel sold through their agency on a particular airline. Travel agents are not currently required to disclose this information to customers. Travel agents provide an important service to the flying public by deciphering the baffling airline fare structure but consumers should also be aware that this information is not always unbiased.  Another area of frustration to consumers is the lack of accurate, consistent and realistic information about frequent flyer programs. Despite the popularity of frequent flyer programs, consumers find that when they actually choose to redeem awards, the destinations and times they want are not available. Many travelers choose an airline because of its frequent flyer program and it is important to fully disclose this type of information.  My bill would give consumers the information they need to make informed choices about what airlines to patronize. The Aviation Consumer Right To Know Act will, (1) require airlines and travel agents to disclose the actual air service carrier if it differs from the carrier issuing the ticket, (2) require travel agents to disclose any special incentives they get for booking travel on a particular airline, (3) require airlines to disclose all available fares, (4) require airlines to keep records on the likelihood of redeeming frequent flyer benefits for specific city-pairs.  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation.                          ____________________
