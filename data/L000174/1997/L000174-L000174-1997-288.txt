We have a political climate where many of my colleagues bash the Federal judiciary on a daily basis and propose legislation that threatens a time-honored independence of the Federal judiciary. I think our Nation's judges deserve our respect, admiration, and support--not our disdain, scorn, and antipathy. Anywhere you go in the world you will find that one of the things that stands out, one of the things admired most about the United States, is the independence of our Federal judiciary.  For the past 200 years, they protected the freedoms and fundamental rights we all take for granted. You could ask, where would our cherished rights like first amendment-protected free speech and the right of religious freedom be without the Federal courts? It is ironic that the right of free speech that the Federal judiciary bashers take for granted in the war against judges has been protected time and time again by those very same judges.  It is our independent judiciary that handed down landmark decisions like Brown versus Board of Education. Without our independent judiciary, how long would African-American children have to suffer deplorable conditions in substandard schools? I remember after Brown versus Board of Education, we had the bumper stickers and billboards, ``Impeach Earl Warren,'' and ``Impeach the Supreme Court.'' Well, only because they were politically independent could they hand down a decision so unpopular at the time, but so recognized today universally as the right decision. I shudder to think where we would be today with Federal judges who are tied to the political whims of the moment. We should talk about where the country would be without independent Federal judges.
