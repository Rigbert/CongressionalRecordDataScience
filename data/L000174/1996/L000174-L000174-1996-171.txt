Snowe and Mr. Cohen; the Senators from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg and Mr. Smith; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords; and Senators Moynihan, Kennedy, and Kerry regarding the northern forest stewardship.  If the managers are in a position to accept this, I am willing to offer it and go forward. If they prefer we wait until a later time, I am willing to do that. I just understand some people want to get some things moving forward. So I ask the distinguished managers, if that is the case, I will offer it on behalf of those Senators, otherwise I will withhold until a later time.
