Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak briefly on section 312 which says that an approved Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP) that addresses the conservation needs of listed threatened or endangered species obviates the need to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. I would like to remind my colleagues of congressional intentand statutory direction when we established INRMPs in the 1997 Amendments to the Sikes Act.  I strongly believe that we need to provide our men and women being sent ``in harm's way'' the most thorough and realistic readiness training as possible on our military installations. Let me also express my firm belief that military preparedness and sound stewardship of our natural resources, is not mutually exclusive, they are mutually beneficial. Appropriate land and natural resource management of our installations provides not only for sustainable use for military readiness, but for conservation of our natural resources on public lands under military department jurisdiction. This is the underlying philosophy of the amendments I sponsored to the Sikes Act in 1997 that directed the Secretary of Defense to prepare and implement INRMP's in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and respective State fish and wildlife agencies.  Specifically, the Sikes Act directs the Secretary of each military department to prepare and implement an INRMP for each military installation in the United States under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense unless the Secretary determines that the absence of significant natural resources on a particular installation makes preparation of such a plan inappropriate. Section 670a(a)(2) directs that each INRMP shall be prepared ``in cooperation'' with the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and with the head of each appropriate State fish and wildlife agency for the State in which the military installation is located. This section further provides that the resulting INRMP for the military installation ``shall reflect the mutual agreement of the parties concerning conservation, protection and management of fish and wildlife resources.''  I understand that DOD has, in practice, not always involved the other statutory parties in development of an INRMP at an early stage, but instead sought their concurrence to a completed draft. While such a policy might comport with the statutory direction as to ``mutual agreement of the parties,'' it does not comport with the ``preparation in cooperation with'' directive. Cooperation of the statutory parties, begun at the earliest stages of development of an INRMP, is the contemplation of the statute. Such cooperation should go far to reconcile potential differences, and I would like to remind the Department of Defense that we expect the process explicitly contemplated in the Sikes Act to be undertaken by the Department. While there are exemplary INRMPs reflecting this sincere level of involvement, the Department needs to re-commit itself to Congress' direction in the 1997 amendments to the Sikes Act by involving all three parties at the beginning, during development, and during implementation of INRMPs. Consensus building and problem solving throughout the process will most likely facilitate the ``mutual agreement'' required by the statute of the three parties.  Finally, I would like to express my strong concerns about the evolution of environmental management practices. I'm strongly against INRMPs becoming something like the environmental impact studies that are required today. Today, EIS documents have become a black hole of time, money and bureaucracy. EIS documents were once two-page documents of environmental consequences. Now EIS documents are thousands of pages long, cost millions of dollars and take years to prepare. Even when good faith efforts have been made to address the minutiae of endless environmental issues in the EIS process, the documents are often subject to litigation, being overturned or disregarded. I want to make it very clear that the creation of the INRMPs where not intended to become a continual EIS process, or as a justification for endless studies on environmental stewardship and management.
