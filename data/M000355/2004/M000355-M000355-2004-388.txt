 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. J. Res. 39, the Burma import restrictions bill. I further ask unanimous consent that the statutory time limit be yielded back, and the joint resolution be read a third time and placed back on the Senate calendar. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to the immediate consideration of H. J. Res. 97, the House Burma resolution, and that all time be yielded back, and the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution, with no intervening action or debate.
