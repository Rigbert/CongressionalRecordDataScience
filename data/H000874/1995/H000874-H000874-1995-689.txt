Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to recognize an outstanding citizen of Prince George's County, MD. Ms. Jill Moss Greenberg, a resident of Hyattsville, was recently named one of six women throughout the entire State of Maryland to be inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame.  I have known Jill for a number of years and have worked very closely with her on the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as in my capacity as chairman of the Helsinki Commission in seeking the release of Jewish refuseniks from the former Soviet Union. Over the years she has been instrumental in forging change throughout our county, our State, our Nation and on the international level--change that has benefited the lives of many people. She is truly worthy of this honor.  Recently, Ms. Andrea Novotny of the Prince George's Journal wrote of the outstanding contributions Jill Moss Greenberg has made in garnering this recognition and I am pleased to share this article with my colleagues and urge them all to join me in congratulating one of Maryland's Women's Hall of Fame honorees--Jill Moss Greenberg.                   Honoree Recalls Her Activist Past                          (By Andrea Novotny)       Twenty years ago, women could not have credit cards in      their name and faced expulsion from school for running on the      ``boys' track.''       But Jill Moss Greenberg, 52, of Hyattsville, a self-     described civil rights and feminist pioneer, worked to change      those and other gender, race and socio-economic inequities.      She is one of six women who on Tuesday were named honorees of      the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame, established by the      Maryland Commission for Women in 1985.       ``People don't even think of it now. But it was a hard      fight to get to where we are today. . . . No one should be a      second-class citizen. We are working to create a society      where no one is marginalized and no one is a footnote. The      whole is greater than the parts, and every individual has the      potential of creating great change,'' Greenberg said.       ``There are a lot of laws on the books, but it is a      constant struggle to make them real in the lives of everyday      people. We have to assure that those accomplishments remain      and that we continue to go forward for the rest.''       Greenberg began tackling social problems as a teenager,      joining the Civil Rights movement while still in junior high      school. By middle school, she was volunteering on the      presidential campaign of Adlai Stevenson, who she believed      shared her vision of civil liberty.       Greenberg's efforts with a friend to remove barriers for      the disabled led to the creation of one of the first      preschools for disabled children in the United States. She      was in her junior year in college.       ``From the time I was very young, my family raised me with      the values that each person could make a difference.      Something can always be done about social inequities,''      Greenberg said.       She now works as director of multicultural education at the      Mid-Atlantic Equity Consortium, providing assistance to      school systems in five states on issues involving gender and      race. ``Racial minorities and women not only have a glass      ceiling, but they have to clean it too,'' Greenberg noted.      ``. . . As Frederick Douglass said, `you can't have change      without a struggle.'''       Greenberg, a Maryland resident for 24 years, led the effort      to form the county's Commission for Women in 1972. At that      time she was also working with the state's Commission for      Women to help women participate in the legislative process.       Greenberg played a significant role in the passage of the      Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, the Equal Credit Opportunity      Act and Title IX, a federal law that requires federally      funded schools to provide equal opportunities in athletics      for male and female students.       But overcoming barriers wasn't easy.       ``So many people opposed civil rights and civil equity back      then,'' Greenberg recalled. She first had to win the support      of former Congresswoman Gladys Noon Spellman, who was      expelled from high school for running on the school's only      track, then designated for boys.       ``People thought Title IX would defeminize females and      demasculinize males. Other congressmen said if it became law,      our daughters would have to shower with boys. But they were      missing the point. It wasn't just about athletic equity, it      was about learning to win and lose and letting others      experience the things that prepared them for life,''      Greenberg said. ``The education girls receive determines      their employment and life-long existence.       ``Our goal now is not just to put different genders, races      and cultures in a classroom, but to have them treated equally      within that environment,'' Greenberg said. She learned      cultural and religious sensitivity working with the county      school system's task forces on black male achievement and      multicultural education and serving on the regional board of      the National Conference of Christians and Jews.       Greenberg founded the Maryland Women's History Project and      the Black History at Your Door Step Project to recognize      historical contributions of women and members of racial      minorities.       ``In a 500-page social studies text-book, only seven pages      were dedicated to women. When women finally won suffrage, 75      years ago, the books said they were `given' the vote--not      that they achieved it through great struggle,'' Greenberg      said.       ``We need to create respect for each other so we can      understand and value diversity.''       Greenberg cautions against over-simplifying complex issues      facing today's multicultural society and she says finding      solutions is an ongoing challenge.       ``Do we stand for what our country is about or what is      comfortable? We need to be able to have the courage to stand      up for our convictions,'' Greenberg said. ``We still see a      lot of inequity, but when people who share the same vision      work together, they become a powerful force in creating      change.''                               ____________________
