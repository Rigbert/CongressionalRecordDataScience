 President, I rise today in support of the amendment in the form of a substitute to H.R. 3433.  Many people with disabilities who have been out of the workforce are eager to return to work. However, because of the risks of losing cash benefits and health insurance provided through the Social Security Disability Insurance program and the Supplemental Security Income program many beneficiaries are discouraged from entering or re-entering the workforce. The intent of these programs was never to demoralize or dishearten Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. We must look at ways to overcome this attitude.  Thanks to the disability reform proposal developed by Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy many of the barriers facing people with disabilities will be addressed. Several provisions in the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute to H.R. 3433 tackle the problems of loss of cash benefits and health insurance which can prevent beneficiaries from being able to support themselves once they begin working. The substitute legislation would provide working individuals with disabilities access to additional services under the Medicaid program, such as personal assistance and prescription drugs. These services are vital to many people on SSDI and SSI. Furthermore, this proposal would provide improved access to rehabilitation opportunities for beneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs.  The most encouraging parts of this proposal are those that eliminate work disincentives and facilitate self-sufficiency among those with disabilities. This legislation prohibits using work activity as the only basis for triggering a continuing disability review. Moreover, the proposal put forth by my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, would expedite the process of eligibility determinations of individuals who have been on disability insurance but who lost it because they were working. Also, the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute creates incentives for both disabled beneficiaries and providers of vocational rehabilitation to secure jobs for those who want to work. It is my hope that this will eliminate shuffling these people from vocational rehabilitation programs to state programs without them being able to make any real progress.  Finally, I want to say how glad I am to see that a component of the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute includes a proposal to ensure that local prisoners will not receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. I sponsored legislation in the beginning of the 105th Congress to prevent this needless waste of taxpayer dollars by closing a loophole in the law. Criminals should not be allowed to ``double dip'' and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food and clothing while they are part of a prison system which provides these necessities already. This proposal would protect the financial soundness of the Social Security Disability Insurance program for the people it is meant to assist.  The work Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have put forth on this bill characterizes the bipartisanship necessary to pass the proposal into law. I am glad to lend my support tothe Senate substitute legislation to H.R. 3433. I look forward to passage of this legislation.                          ____________________
