Res. 118 and I would like to recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), as well as the chairman of the Committee on Rules and all the other members of the Committee on Rules, for their hard work on this fair rule.  As the sponsor of H.J. Res. 41, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) has played a leadership role on issues such as tax fairness and simplification and deserves credit for his persistence and leadership in advancing the proposed constitutional amendment that is before the House today.  Madam Speaker, this rule is similar to past rules providing for the consideration of proposed constitutional amendments. The rule provides for 2 hours of thorough debate and an opportunity for the minority to offer a substitute amendment. I believe this is a fair rule, which will provide ample time for debate and amendment, and I urge Members to support this rule.
