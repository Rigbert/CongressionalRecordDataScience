 President, let me indicate I probably will give some of that time to one of my colleagues on this side of the aisle and use the leader time. But I will have a very brief statement right before the vote.  I commend the majority leader and all of us for working together, frankly, to get this bill down to the President at the earliest possible time.  I yield the floor.
