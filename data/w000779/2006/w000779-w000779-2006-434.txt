President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi. I particularly thank him for his extraordinarily supportive statement and forall the help he has given me over this decade. It probably would be my preference to have a recorded vote at this time, particularly since I have had the good fortune to have had such a supportive statement from the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules.  Is there a problem with having a recorded vote on the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment at this time?
