Speaker, it is my pleasure to extend my sincere congratulations to Hoosier Boys' Town as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. In particular, I would like to congratulate Hoosier Boy's Town Executive Director, Anita Dygert-Gearheart, board of directors, staff, and volunteers, who should be proud of the outstanding service their efforts have provided the young people of Indiana's First Congressional District. Hoosier Boys' Town is beginning its 4-day anniversary celebration today on its campus in Schererville, IN. The Hoosier Boys' Town Board of Directors, residents, staff, former residents, friends, and volunteers, have invited the general public to join them in celebrating the organization's 50 years of service and commitment to the communities of northwest Indiana.  Founded in July 1947, Hoosier Boys' Town was established by a beloved priest from East Chicago, IN, Msgr. Michael Compagna, in an effort to help disadvantaged youth fully utilize ``their God-given potential.'' Msgr. Compagna's vision was to create a village composed of small cottages, with facilities offering emotionally disturbed boys a supportive and loving family environment. After 3 years of internal debate, Hoosier Boys' Town became a reality as it opened in the form of a home for disadvantaged boys, where Father Compagna's mission of providing a healthy environment for children in need materialized through the administration's guiding beliefs in individual worth and the value of education and community.  Over the years, Hoosier Boys' Town has upheld Monsignor Campagna's mission through its continued devotion to children at risk of failing in society. The organization currently administers an array of programs geared toward children experiencing problems of neglect, abuse, chemical dependency, abandonment, and learning disability. Countless youths and their families find a caring haven in the community-based residential, educational, and treatment centers of Hoosier Boys' Town, which focus on the enhancement of body, mind, and spirit. Hoosier Boys' Town success in positively changing the lives of young people has not gone unnoticed, for the organization has recently received accreditation of its services by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children, Inc. Accreditation attests that the services provided by Hoosier Boys' Town fulfill the community's needs in a safe, professional, and quality-conscious manner.  While the progress Hoosier Boys' Town has made from the time of its inception is apparent, the organization is fully aware that a vision for the future is necessary for continued growth and service. Hoosier Boys' Town's vision includes the expressed goal of becoming the premier residential treatment facility in northwest Indiana for children and their families. In order to achieve this goal, the organization is launching its first ever Capital Campaign, which is expected to raise the $2.5 million needed to build a multipurpose building, serving as both an education and dining facility. Currently, Hoosier Boys' Town educate 40 to 50 young people each day and serves approximately 400 meals daily.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Hoosier Boys' Town on the occasion of its 50th anniversary celebration. The hard work and dedication everyone involved with this distinguished organization has put forth is truly inspirational.                          ____________________
