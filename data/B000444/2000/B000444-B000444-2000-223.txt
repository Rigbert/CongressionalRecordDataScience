 President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the Senate. Although I will vote in support of the bill, I feel compelled to express my reservations concerning the mandatory budgetary provisions that are included in this conference agreement. It should be understood by all here today that these provisions should not be used to reduce funding for other essential transportation programs, most importantly Amtrak.  I realize the importance of passing this legislation that provides necessary funding for aviation programs over the next three years. This bill has been a long time coming and I understand it has been carefully and diligently crafted between the conferees. I believe we need additional funding for the improvement of our airports and to permit us to take advantage of the best technologies to improve passenger safety.  However, I don't believe that other transportation programs such as Amtrak should suffer as a result of the budgetary agreement that has been included in this bill. I have long been a supporter of Amtrak and am dedicated to making sure that the Federal Government lives up to its promise to provide Amtrak with sufficient support to preserve passenger rail service in this country and enable Amtrak to reach operating self-sufficiency. Because of this I want to make it clear that I'm voting for this FAA reauthorization bill with the understanding that the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, have made assurances that they will protect Amtrak from budgetary threats that may follow from this legislation.
