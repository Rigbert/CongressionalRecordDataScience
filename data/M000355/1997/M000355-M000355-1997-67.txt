 FEINGOLD. I am about to ask a question--are not identical to those in the bill last year. In fact, I would ask the Senator from Kentucky if he is aware that the provisions we have just put in the modification are different than any that we have introduced before?  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say, Mr. President, that I am aware the bill has been evolving. I am aware issue advocacy is different now, in the revised bill, than it was originally.
