 President I am a strong supporter of the American farmer. I represent the largest farm State in this Nation and I believe in protecting the family farmer and helping to provide for rural America.  California's farm economy produces approximately $30 billion annually and I take pride in the great number and vast diversity of crops the State produces.  From the vegetables in the Imperial Valley to the dairy farms in the Central Valley and the wineries of Napa Valley, the State of California produces more of what goes on America's dinner table than anywhere else.  In March, I visited the great Central Valley of California to hear what my constituents had to say about the agricultural policy we craft here in Washington, DC.  I heard how much farmers depend on the programs in the farm bill and I am pleased that the Senate will be voting on the farm bill conference report today. Even though I have some concerns about what is in the conference report and this is by no means a perfect bill, I will vote to send this legislation to the President's desk because virtually every California farm and nutrition group has lined up to support it.  However, I want to highlight my serious concern over an egregious ethanol program in this farm bill that was included at the last minute in conference.  Mr. President, only 2 weeks ago the Senate passed a terrible energy bill that mandates three times the amount of ethanol we produce in our fuel supply. Now after mandating a market for ethanol in the energy bill we are providing billions of dollars in subsidies to corn farmers in this farm bill.  On top of the subsidies to the corn growers in the Midwest, and the mandated market for ethanol, and high trade barriers that protect the domestic ethanol industry, now, in a provision in this farm bill, we will be subsidizing the expansion of ethanol production through the ``Bioenergy Program.''  Many may wonder what the Bioenergy Program is. The Bioenergy Program, created in 2000 by the Department of Agriculture, provides cash payments to promote additional production of ethanol and biodiesel. Bioenergy includes: Ethanol, made mostly from corn; and biodiesel, made mostly from soybeans.  Congress has never authorized this program until now. The farm bill authorizes spending $150 million annually over the next 4 years for a total authorization of $600 million. The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the program will not be fully subscribed and therefore scores the program lower at $204 million.  Essentially, the Bioenergy Program pays subsidies to firms when they purchase additional corn to make more ethanol or soybeans to make more biodiesel. For example, if a company increases its ethanol production by 1,000 gallons, the government will reimburse the firm $320 for the additional corn it took to make these 1,000 gallons of ethanol.  At best, this is an incentive to help small ethanol producers expand their production of ethanol. At worst, this is another government payout to ethanol firms like ADM to subsidize corn they would buy anyway to make their product.  In 2001, 26 ethanol firms, all based in the Midwest, received payments from USDA under the Bioenergy Program. Archers Daniels Midland received the most, $7.5 million out of $32.7 million in total payments or 23 percent of the overall amount. Under the Bioenergy Program authorized in the farm bill, ADM will continue to be eligible to receive $7.5 million each year for the next 4 years, a total of $30 million by 2006. ADM has sales of over $20 billion annually, yet under this Bioenergy Program, the government is subsidizing its expansion and growth.  Consider the following:  No. 1. The Government already subsidizes farmers who grow corn, which is used to make ethanol.  No. 2. The Government subsidizes producers of ethanol by giving firms a 5.3 cent ``tax break'' from the 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline.  No. 3. In the recent energy bill, the Senate mandated a market for ethanol that will force three times the amount we produce into the fuel supply by 2012.  No. 4. Domestic ethanol producers are protected from foreign competition by a high 54-cent per gallon trade barrier.  No. 5. On top of all this, why is Congress subsidizing ethanol producers to expand?  There is new information on the environmental and health impact of ethanol.  During the debate on the energy bill, I mentioned that I have grave concerns about the long-term effects of nearly tripling the amount of ethanol in our gasoline supply because the impact on the environment and public health is largely unknown.  Although the scientific opinion is not unanimous, existing evidence suggests that: one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more smog pollution than reformulated gas without it; and two, ethanol enables the toxic chemicals in gasoline to seep further into groundwater and even faster than conventional gasoline.  And this week new evidence from the Environmental Protection Agency casts an even darker shadow on ethanol's environmental record. A letter was made public this week disclosing that toxic emissions from ethanol plants appear more dangerous than previously thought.  I wish we had known about EPA's recent testing of ethanol plant emissions while the Senate was debating the ethanol mandate in the Senate Energy Bill.  I would like to insert this letter for the Record and read from it.  The letter is to Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol lobby. It is from Stephen Rothblatt, the head of EPA's air and radiation division in Region 5. Region 5 covers part of the Midwest.  The letter begins:       Recent testing performed at several ethanol production      facilities indicates emissions of volatile organic compounds      and carbon monoxide many times greater than that stated by      the companies in the permitting process.  This finding by EPA raises new questions about the harm ethanol can cause the environment. Previously, emissions from ethanol plants were thought to be relatively benign. Under current law, ethanol plants are not considered ``major sources'' of volatile organic compound, VOC, emissions and they face a less stringent permitting process.  However, the recent findings alluded to by EPA in this letter indicate that ethanol plants may now be major sources of VOC emissions and therefore subject to a more stringent permitting process. VOC emissions are of great concern because they contribute to the formation of ozone, the main component of smog.  And these new findings are not confined to one or two plants. The letter indicates that emissions of carbon monoxide, methanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and other carcinogens at levels many times greater than the plant permits allow ``are not unique to the tested facilities, but rather common to most, if not all, ethanol facilities.''  In response to this letter from EPA, I wrote Administrator Whitman and I would like to include the two letters I sent yesterday in the Record.  I have asked the Administrator why the agency's findings did not surface until this week, and I asked EPA to report on the increase in emissions we can expect from ethanol plants if we triple the amount of ethanol that needs to be produced, as the Senate Energy Bill would require.  I am also particularly concerned about a part in the letter that mentions EPA's desire to ``quickly address both State and Federal concerns and resolve them on terms most favorable to the industry.'' Why would EPA want to resolve this on terms most favorable to the industry when it is children, the elderly, and people with respiratory problems who will suffer most from these harmful emissions?  It appears EPA is attempting to placate the ethanol industry because instead of enforcing the Clean Air Act by citing the ethanol plants for violations, EPA is trying to meet with ethanol industry representatives to resolve the matter quietly.  I am concerned that the EPA will not crackdown on ethanol plants forcefully because, according to this letter, the agency's primary goal is to satisfy the industry and not the public interest.  I hope the EPA will be able to complete a full scientific and health study on the impact of these ethanol plant emissions on the air we breathe. And I hope the agency will be forthcoming with the scientific results that led to this April 24th letter.  I believe the testing conducted by the Region 5 office raises important questions on the health and environmental consequences of more ethanol production and use.  It is clear to me that there is a lot about ethanol we do not know yet. I am very concerned about the mandate we passed in the energy bill.  I am also concerned about this egregious provision in the farm bill that pays ethanol producers like ADM to buy more corn. This provision is unacceptable and I would hope that in the future when we authorize new ethanol programs, they are the subject of extensive hearings and debate, not just slipped into the conference report without notice.  Having said all this, I would just like to take a few moments to highlight the provisions in the farm bill that will benefit California and explain why I support this legislation.  First, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee who have spend a tremendous amount of time on this bill. And I want to thank all the members of the Conference Committee who spent the last three months hashing out the differences between the House and Senate bill.  Mr. President, this farm bill will help provide economic stability for producers, make farmers and ranchers more competitive in world markets, and give needed assistance to rural areas.  For California commodity crops like rice, cotton, and wheat, the farm bill provides loan rates and fixed direct payments to provide an effective safety net for our producers. Growers, lenders, and rural areas of California have anxiously been waiting for the farm bill to be signed into law. This bill will alleviate a great deal of uncertainty for commodity producers.  I am also pleased that this farm bill will increase conservation funding by $17.1 billion over the next decade. California will make great use of the programs authorized in this farm bill to enhance wild habitat, create new wetlands, clean up farm runoff, and curb suburban sprawl.  For growers of California's fruits, vegetables, and nuts there are funding increases for the purchase of speciality crops, including $94 million for apples, and more funding for the Market Access Program.  MAP funds are sought by many California growers to develop markets for their products overseas.  I am happy to report that funding for the Market Access Program, MAP, will be authorized well above the current level of $90 million annually. MAP funding will be ramped up to $200 million by 2006. Dollar for dollar MAP funding is one of the best uses of money in this farm bill.  For California dairy farmers, the bill extends the milk price support program through 2006 at $9.90 per hundredweight.  One of the most controversial parts of the farm bill throughout this debate has been the dairy section. The original Senate bill agreed to in the Agriculture Committee was drafted to benefit Northeastern dairy farmers at the expense of California and other States. This so-called ``national pooling'' proposal would have cost California dairy farmers $1.5 billion over 9 years and driven up prices for consumers by $1.5 billion over 9 years.  After a great deal of negotiation in the Senate and again in conference, I believe we have achieved something California dairy farmers can live with. We could not get everything we wanted, but dairy groups in California are supportive of the provisions in the bill.  For example, Michael Marsh, CEO of Western United Dairymen writes, ``This bill has received more than a year of debate. The conferees worked hard to balance the needs of diverse agricultural interests and produce a consensus bill. We believe the bill is equitable and balanced.''  The farm bill funds research at $1.3 billion over the next 10 years to combat pest and disease threats and to stimulate scientific advances in agriculture. California is at the forefront of advances in agricultural research and the State will benefit greatly from the research funding in this bill.  For example, the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems program is authorized at an average of $200 million annually.  This program awards research grants to California universities such as UC Davis on a competitive basis and usually a large percentage of the funding goes to California research labs and projects.  The farm bill provides $6.4 billion for nutrition. For California, nutrition groups estimate this legislation will deliver more than $1.7 billion to food stamp recipients in the State.  The farm bill also simplifies the food stamp program and restores benefits to legal immigrants. By making all legal immigrant children eligible for food stamps and making adult legal immigrants eligible for food stamps after they have resided in the United States for 5 years, California will be relieved of some of the costs shifted to the State after the 1996 welfare reform bill.  The following groups are among those who have written to me to ask that I support this farm bill: the California Farm Bureau; National Conference of State Legislatures; California Citrus Mutual; Western United Dairymen; the Alliance of Western Milk Producers; California Food Policy Advocates; the California Grape & Tree Fruit League; United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association; the California Strawberry Commission; Calcot--the major cooperative representing California and Arizona cotton growers; the California Rice Commission; the Sacramento Central Labor Council AFL-CIO; the Milk Producers Council; the Nature Conservancy; National Farmers Union; the Children's Defense Fund; and many of the major food banks in California.  I believe this broad support demonstrates that the farm bill conferees were able to reach adequate compromises on most issues.  I would also like to highlight a few special provisions for California that the conferees agreed to:  No. 1. The farm bill includes provision to strengthen produce smuggling penalties.  The conference report included language from a bill I introduced last year to strengthen penalties for criminal violations of plant smuggling laws. This provision in the farm bill conference report will protect agriculture from the invasion of foreign species by strengthening criminal penalties for organized smuggling of fruits, plants, and vegetables into the United States. Under current law, violators are charged low fines for violating plant smuggling laws--simply a minor cost of doing business, not an effective deterrent.  No. 2. The farm bill includes provision to give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to reallocate sugar export quota shortfalls.  The conference report includes a compromise worked out with Senator Harkin, Senator Lugar, and Senator Breaux that would give the Secretary of Agriculture the option to reallocate any shortfall in exported sugar from supplying countries to other nations that would export more sugar cane to the United States.  This may help C Sugar, a struggling refinery in Crockett, CA, obtain more sugar cane from abroad to refine. In the past, C has had to temporarily shutdown and lay off some of its workers because they do not have enough sugar cane to refine. This is a small step, but it may help some.  No. 3. The farm bill includes provision extending a crop insurance pilot program to California.  The farm bill conference report includes a provision to allow California growers to qualify for Adjusted Gross Revenue Crop Insurance--a unique risk management tool provided by USDA to give producers a ``self-help'' option of insuring a potion of their farm income. Adjusted Gross Revenue Crop Insurance provides protection against low revenue due to unavoidable catastrophes.  The program was first made available on a pilot basis in 1999. This year is the fourth year the program has been available and now California will join 17 other States where the program is currently offered. This program will benefit California specialty crop producers.  No. 4. The farm bill includes provision to allow California to grow, refine, and market sugar cane.  The conference report includes a provision that will allow California to join Hawaii, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida as a State with a sugarcane allocation. Growers in the Imperial Valley in California have been growing sugar cane for about 4 years now with the hopes they would be able to revive the area's stagnant industry. California farmers will now be able to grow, refine, and market sugarcane--adding to the State's great and diverse agricultural production.  Although this farm bill is far from a perfect bill, I am supporting it because I believe sending it back to conference would be counterproductive. Our farmers need a farm bill now and I believe this legislation will be well received in agricultural areas across this nation.  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2002.     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,     Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency,          1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.       Dear Administrator Whitman: I was surprised to read that      the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) called for a      meeting this week with ethanol industry officials to discuss      findings by the agency that factories that convert corn into      the ethanol are releasing carbon monoxide, methanol,      formaldehyde, acetic acid, and carcinogens at levels many      times greater than previously thought.       It is interesting to me that EPA's study into these harmful      ethanol emissions was disclosed in an April 24 letter to the      industry's trade group, yet the correspondence was not made      public until this week. Why the delay? I am also concerned      that the EPA might use the unusual forum of an industry      meeting to cut a special deal for the ethanol industry      outside the regular EPA process of plant investigations for      emissions violations.       I believe that the science is pretty clear that the      environmental record on ethanol is mixed and smog increases      as a product of more ethanol use.       Therefore, based on the new information from EPA that      ``most, if not all, ethanol facilities'' and releasing carbon      monoxide, methanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and      carcinogens, I would like to ask how much these toxins will      be increased across the United States if we triple the amount      of ethanol currently produced--the scenario mandated by      recent passage of the Senate Energy Bill. Since this energy      legislation is     now being considered in a conference committee, I am asking      for an expedited response from your agency.       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.           Sincerely,     Dianne Feinstein.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2002.     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,     Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency,          1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.       Dear Administrator Whitman: To follow up on my earlier      letter today, I am writing to request that the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) provide my office with the scientific      data from the recent tests performed on several ethanol      facilities by your Region 5 office.       I would like to know more specifically what EPA has      discovered about carbon monoxide, methanol, formaldehyde,      acetic acid, and other carcinogenic emissions from ethanol      plants.       I am also particularly concerned that your agency has      chosen to remedy these harmful ethanol emissions by meeting      only with industry representatives. The April 24th letter      from EPA to the Renewable Fuels Association invites ethanol      industry representatives to meet and says, ``this approach      can give certainty to the industry by quickly addressing both      state and federal concerns and resolving them on terms most      favorable to the industry.'' Why would EPA want to address      this on terms most favorable to the industry when it is      children, the elderly, and people with respiratory problems      who will suffer most from these harmful emissions?       Please send me the ``stack tests'' that led to the April      24th letter as soon as possible. Thank you for your immediate      attention to this matter.           Sincerely,     Dianne Feinstein.                                  ____                                     U.S. Environmental Protection                                             Agency, Region 5,                                      Chicago, IL, April 24, 2002.     Bob Dinneen,     President, Renewable Fuels Association, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Dinneen: Recent testing performed at several      ethanol production facilities indicates emissions of volatile      organic compounds and carbon monoxide many times greater than      that stated by the companies in the permitting process. As a      result, we believe that these facilities were not properly      permitted and controlled with respect to a number of      pollutants as they were initially constructed or modified. We      expect that this circumstance is not unique to the tested      facilities, but rather is common to most, if not all, ethanol      facilities.       Normally, U.S. EPA would remedy the violations at each of      these facilities, individually, through a lengthy period of      information-gathering followed by the traditional enforcement      process. By this letter, we would like to invite      representatives of the Renewable Fuels Association and Region      5 ethanol production facilities to attend a brief meeting on      May 6, 2002 from 1:00-3:00 pm at our Chicago office on the      3rd floor in Room 328 for the purpose of gauging your      interest in exploring an expedited resolution to these      issues. We feel that this approach can give certainty to the      industry by quickly addressing both state and federal      concerns and resolving them on terms most favorable to the      industry.       We expect that this initial meeting will last no more than      two (2) hours and will consist of a presentation, by the      regulatory agencies, which describes the issues and our      proposed path toward resolution. If you have any questions,      Ms. Cynthia King, of our Office of Regional Counsel, can be      reached at (312) 886-6831.           Very Truly Yours,                                                Stephen Rothblatt.
