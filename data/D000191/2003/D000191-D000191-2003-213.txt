  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives will vote to borrow $75 billion adding to our $6 trillion mountain of Federal debt. Maybe we would not have to borrow that money if we asked the wealthy people if we could cancel, ask them to contribute a little bit to this crisis, but we will not do that here. What are we going to spend the $75 billion on? $10 billion of foreign aid including $1 billion for Turkey, and remember howhelpful they have been, $1 billion for Turkey which their ambassador says is a unilateral act on the part of the United States of America. They have not asked for it and they do not want it, but we are going to give them that billion. We are going to borrow it, and give it to them.  Billions to rebuild Iraq including 6,000 schools. Universal health care is going to be implemented in Iraq. We already have a request for a proposal online from the United States Government to provide that.  What about here at home? What about our schools? What about the 44 million Americans that do not have health care? Not a penny of emergency spending in this bill for them. And then finally we have of course port security, first responders. Where are the funds we need to defend our country and where is the money the airline workers have been waiting for? For 18 months we promised them they would get money next week, 18 months ago.                          ____________________
