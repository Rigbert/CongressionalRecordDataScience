Speaker, on June 4th we commemorated the tenth anniversary of the massacre of thousands of students and workers at Tiananmen Square. We also remember the thousands injured, as well as the tens of thousands arrested and sentenced to prison or labor camps on that fateful day. We honor their bravery and courage, and the ultimate sacrifice which they made in the name of democracy and human rights.  Ten years ago today, the forward march of reform in China came to a halt; crushed by the steel tread of tanks, trampled by the boots of soldiers. The human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate during the past decade. As recently as last week, the Washington Post reported the arrest of Yang Tao, one of the student leaders of the 1989 demonstration. This was clearly an effort by the Chinese leadership to discourage further protest on the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. Beijing has also attempted to silence the internet, another medium through which the memory of that tragic day will certainly be refreshed.  These efforts to erase the events of 1989 from popular conscience, Mr. Speaker, also include a strategy of redirecting the rage of the Chinese people by distorting the truth about the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.  Today we send a clear message, not only to Beijing, but to the people of China. The United States has not forgotten, and will never forget, the events that transpired ten years ago in Tiananmen Square. We support those who continue their valiant struggle for democracy.                          ____________________
