I think what we are dealing with when we look at the Republican tax break bill is the Republican ``loxbox''--it smells fishy--because in the year 2005 they start dipping right into Social Security. They are taking money out of the Social Security surplus to give tax breaks to wealthy people.  I ask the Senator from New York--I am sure I can speak for people from Illinois as well--as you go around the State of New York and ask people what our priorities should be, if we are going to have a surplus, how many of them have said to you: Well, let's give tax breaks to Donald Trump and let's take money out of the Social Security surplus?
