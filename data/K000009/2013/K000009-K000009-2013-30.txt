Speaker, I rise today to call on House Republicans to end the Federal Government shutdown.  The shutdown is causing significant negative impacts on our economy, jobs, and consumer confidence across our country. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits jumped by 66,000 this week. Local economies across our Nation are losing $76 million a day from people not able to visit our Nation's parks. Just in one location, the closing of Zion National Park in Utah has cost the surrounding community over $3.5 million in lost visitor spending.  The Head Start program already has turned away over 7,000 children across this country. U.S. consumer confidence has deteriorated in October to its weakest in 9 months, since the first Federal shutdown over 17 years ago. The Federal shutdown is stalling almost 130 highway and bridge projects in 35 States, which means lost jobs.  Mr. Speaker, let's end this uncertainty for our Nation. Let's stop the battering of jobs in this economy. Bring a clean continuing resolution to the floor and reopen the government of the United States.                          ____________________
