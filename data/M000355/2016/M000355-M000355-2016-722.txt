 President, we continue to process judicial nominations, and we have done so even when a majority of the Republican conference did not support the nominee, as was the case with the district court nominee from Maryland, whom we confirmed before the recess. That is an example of a judge confirmed that a majority of Republicans did not approve of.  Just this past Monday, the first day after the recess, we confirmed two more article III judicial nominees. We tried to confirm them before the recess, by the way, but our Democratic colleagues would not clear them.  President Obama has had many more judicial nominees confirmed than President Bush did at the same point in his Presidency. We will continue to process his judicial nominations, but the minority is not going to dictate to the majority when and how we will do so.  I object.
