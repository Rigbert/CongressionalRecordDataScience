Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, once again, my friend from Massachusetts has the foresight to be proactive instead of reactive.  It is my understanding that the National Marine Fisheries Service has indicated that the current Fishery Management Plan for lobster may be withdrawn. If this does occur, it would mean that the current restrictions on the sale and transportation of undersized lobster would no longer be in effect.  Current law prohibits the sale, shipment, and transport of American lobsters smaller than the minimum size established in the Federal American Lobster Fishery Management Plan.  The gentleman's amendment provides the necessary measures to ensure that the current restrictions are not removed, by allowing the minimum size established by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to serve as a baseline in the absence of a Federal Fishery Management Plan.  I support the gentleman's amendment and urge the adoption of the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds].  The amendment was agreed to.             amendment offered by mr. miller of california
