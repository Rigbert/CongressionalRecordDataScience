Chairman, that is right. Actually, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Maxine Waters, was down here earlier and had to go back to a markup. She is supporting this legislation.  The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Dick Gephardt, our minority leader, will be supporting the Rohrabacher substitute.  The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. David Bonior, on our side of the aisle will be supporting the substitute. So frankly, I think this issue goes down to the point of who has actually read the legislation and who has not, and most Members do not serve on the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property of the Committee on the Judiciary. Therefore, they have not had an opportunity to follow some of the machinations.  I respect the gentlewoman's work on this measure. I know how hard she has worked on it, I know she has been accommodating to many of the changes we have been trying to make.  Mr. Chairman, the bill is not where we would like it to be yet, and therefore I remain supporting the Rohrabacher substitute, but we have broad bipartisan support on our side of the issue, and I look forward to the vote.
