Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that if a message transmitting a Presidential veto is laid before the House on Monday, November 5, 2007, then after the message is read and the objections of the President are spread at large upon the Journal, further consideration of the veto message and the bill shall be postponed until the following day, Tuesday, November 6, 2007.
