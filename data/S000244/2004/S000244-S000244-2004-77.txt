Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 389) honoring the young victims of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing, recognizing the historical significance of the tragic event, and commending the efforts of law enforcement personnel to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice on the occasion of its 40th anniversary.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 389       Whereas the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church of Birmingham,      Alabama was constructed in 1911 and served as a center for      African-American life in the city and a rallying point for      the civil rights movement during the 1960s;       Whereas on Sunday, September 15, 1963, segregationists      protesting the mandatory integration of Birmingham's public      schools     firebombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church;       Whereas the blast killed Addie Mae Collins, age 14, Denise      McNair, age 11, Carole Robertson, age 14, and Cynthia Wesley,      age 14, all members of the Church, while they were preparing      for Sunday service;       Whereas September 15, 1963 has been called the darkest day      in the history of Birmingham and one of the darkest days of      the entire civil rights movement;       Whereas this act of terrorism raised national and      international awareness of the African-American civil rights      struggle and galvanized those dedicated to the cause of civil      rights;       Whereas Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and      the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the wake of the bombing;       Whereas the 4 men suspected of the bombing, Bobby Frank      Cherry, Herman Cash, Thomas Blanton, and Robert Chambliss,      were not immediately prosecuted because authorities believed      it impossible to obtain a conviction in the heated racial      climate of the mid-1960s;       Whereas Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley successfully      prosecuted Robert Chambliss 13 years after the bombing;       Whereas after the indictment and conviction of Robert      Chambliss the bombing investigation was closed;       Whereas the investigation was reopened in 1995 due to the      efforts of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Rob      Langford and local African-American leaders;       Whereas in 2001 and 2002 a joint Federal and State task      force, under the supervision of United States Attorney      Douglas Jones and Alabama Attorney General William Pryor,      successfully prosecuted Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry      with the assistance of State and local law enforcement      personnel; and       Whereas the bombing, the prosecution of the offenders, and      the cause of civil rights in general have become national and      international concerns: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives, on the      occasion of the 40th anniversary of the bombing of the      Sixteenth Street Baptist Church of Birmingham, Alabama;       (1) honors the memory of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair,      Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley;       (2) recognizes the historical significance of the bombing      and the enduring impact it has had on the cause of civil      rights everywhere;       (3) commends the efforts of the Alabama Attorney General's      office for its successful prosecution of Robert Chambliss in      1977, the efforts of the joint Federal and State task force      for the successful prosecution of Bobby Frank Cherry and      Thomas Blanton in 2001 and 2002, and the efforts of all other      law enforcement personnel who worked to bring the persons      responsible for the bombing to justice.
