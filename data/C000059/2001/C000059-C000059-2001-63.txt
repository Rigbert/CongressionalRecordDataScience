Speaker, I am honored today to pay tribute to a man who has given time and time again to the children, parents and communities of Riverside, CA. An individual whose dedication and unselfish public service has made Riverside a better place to live and work. Dr. Damon Castillo, Jr. is one of these individuals and much, much more.  On January 20, 2001 Dr. Castillo was honored as the outgoing 2000 President of the Greater Riverside Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In his capacity as President, Damon brought his belief that in partnership with the local businesses and the communities our schools can build a solid foundation of literacy knowledge permitting all students to succeed well into the next millennium.  Dr. Damon Castillo, Jr. has 29 years of experience in the field of education, including teaching, administration, personnel management and district superintendent. As Superintendent of the Alvord Unified School District in Riverside, a district serving almost 17,000 students, Damon oversaw the passage of a school bond in the amount of $57 million. That school bond measure, combined with state funds, allowed the Alvord Unified School District to receive a total of $100 million for modernization and growth needs. Additionally, during his position as superintendent, the district continuation school was recognized by the state as a ``Model Continuation School.'' One elementary school was also recognized as a California Distinguished School--the first in the district's history.  Damon's history of involvement in the community have also included: Member of the Board of Directors of the United Way of the Inland Valleys, President-elect of the Arlington Rotary Club, Member of the Riverside City Council's Downtown Specific Plan Committee and as a member of my Hispanic Task Force. Recognitions have included the 1998 Inland Empire Hispanic Image Awards, 1998 Greater Riverside Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Community Service Award, 1999 Minority Male Award and the 1999 Presidential Citation for Educational leadership.  His outstanding work to promote Hispanic businesses, community organizations and students of the Inland Empire make me proud to call him a community member and fellow American. I know that all of the Inland Empire, including myself, are grateful for his contributions to the betterment of the community and salute Damon as the outgoing 2000 President. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of the Inland Empire in the future.                          ____________________
