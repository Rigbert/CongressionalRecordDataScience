 President, it is my honor to pay tribute today to 20 outstanding young scholars and recipients of the 2008 Davidson Fellows Award, a scholarship granted to exceptional students to assist them in pursuing higher education. The Davidson Institute for Talent Development distributes grants to highly gifted individuals under the age of 18 who have demonstrated academically rigorous projects that demonstrate a potential to make a significant positive contribution to society. Mr. President, allow me to introduce the recipients and elaborate on their noteworthy accomplishments.  Akhil Mathew, a 16-year-old from Madison, NJ, proved a single filter, or system of weights, can decode only a finite number of rationals. Akhil's work is relevant to signal processing, analog-to-digital conversion, and representing numbers in an alternative way.  From Gaithersburg, MD, 17-year-old Sikandar Porter-Gill developed a novel process to clean wastewater and produce methane for use as an alternative form of energy by engineering bio-catalyzed microbial fuel cells to degrade organic material in wastewater. Sikandar's research is a promising step toward pursuing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy source.  A 17-year-old from Setuaket, NY, Christine Shrock, studied a region of the HIV protease, a protein crucial in the replication of HIV. She found that this region is a promising target for drugs to bind to change the shape of the protease, preventing it from performing its function. Christine's research is an important contribution to the development of a new class of drugs to reduce the number of infections and deaths caused by HIV.  Philip Streich, a 17-year-old from Platteville, WI, showed that carbon nanotubes are thermodynamically soluble, contradicting the generally held assumption that they were universally insoluble. He designed and custom built a unique photon-counting spectrometer that is more sensitive and precise than any commercially available. Philip's work has broad applications in the field of nanotechnology engineering.  At just 14 years old, Conrad Tao from New York, NY, has made classical music relevant to younger generations through his performances that display a vast knowledge, deep understanding, and mature interpretation of the repertoire. A composer, pianist, and violinist attending the Juilliard Pre-College Division, he has been featured on NPR's ``From the Top,'' performed at Carnegie Hall and has received five consecutive American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, ASCAP, Morton Gould Young Composer Awards.  Michael Cherkassky from Minneapolis, MN, compared the application of several machine learning methods to real-life medical data sets in order to understand the generalization capability of the estimated models, advancing the current predictive diagnostic model. Michael, who is 16 years old, also compared the diagnostic accuracy of two classification methods, allowing physicians to obtain more accurate diagnostic conclusions while advancing patient care.  Twelve-year-old Hilda Huang from Palo Alto, CA, has determined to change the way people feel about Johann Sebastian Bach. Performing on the harpsichord and piano, Hilda aims to bring Bach to everyone, especially young people who may be unfamiliar with his music. Her many accomplishments include performances on NPR's ``From the Top'' and at Carnegie Hall.  Jasmine Miller, a 17-year-old from Nashville, TN, examined her generation's interactions with technology and the impact of digital media on our identities. Through a one-act play, creative essays, and a novel excerpt, Jasmine explored the uncharted minds of the current generation of American youth.  At age 17, Saraswathi Shukla from Princeton, NJ, has conducted an in-depth study of sound and music in Franz-Anton Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism. Combining history, music, language, and literature, she examined the role of music in Mesmer's therapeutic seances in the context of broader changes in the popular perception of sound in pre-Revolution Paris. The importance of sound in mesmerism presents new ways to analyze scientific theories of this period.  Seventeen-year-old August Siena Thomas from Montague, MA, examined the ways in which personal and political histories are purposefully reimagined and rewritten. Through a historical novel, literary reflection, drama, and historical interpretation, August observed the manner in which interpretation of history remain fluid and reflected on how writers have used malice, ambition, flattery, and imagination through the ages to shape the way history is written.  Vijay Venkatesh, a 17-year-old from Laguna Niguel, CA, won the grand prize at the Los Angeles Music Spotlight Awards and the second prize at the Virginia Waring International Piano Solo Intermediate Competition. Vijay views music as a gift to move the world, serving as a common link to touch humanity, and believes it is his duty as a performer to assure the audience of the joy and love that transcend life's struggles.  Only 12 years old from Beaverton, OR, William Yuan invented a novel solar panel that enables light absorption from visible to ultraviolet light, doubling the light-electricity conversion efficiency. William also developed a model for solar towers and a computer program to simulate and optimize the tower parameters, providing 500 times more light absorption than commercially available solar cells and 9 times more than the cutting-edge, three-dimensional solar cell.  At age 17, Charles Zhang from Oakland Township, MI, has researched anddeveloped a prototype for renewable battery power that harvests energy from mechanical vibrations with a larger magnitude and efficiency of AC voltage. His prototype can be used as a primary power source in wireless structural monitoring sensors for bridges, implantable medical devices, tire pressure monitoring systems and portable devices.  Another 17-year-old, from Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, Nathan Georgette, developed a mathematical model intended to reduce the costs of stopping viral disease outbreaks in impoverished nations. He used mathematical modeling to generate a formula to calculate in real time the minimum number of vaccines needed to stop a measles outbreak. Nathan's research represents a new approach to understanding the dynamic effects of infectious disease spread and gradual immunization.  Seventeen-year-old Molly Hensley-Clancy from Minneapolis, MN, explored the primal human instinct of storytelling through the eyes and minds of young girls, demonstrating that geographic and linguistic differences do not change the universality of dreams, thoughts, and troubles. She believes the more we notice the commonalities that bind us together as human beings, rather than what sets us apart, the less we will be able to ignore those who are suffering among us.  Kyle Hutzler, a 16-year-old from Huntingtown, MD, authored a substantial policy paper on education reform, recommending that successful school reform must incorporate choice, autonomy, and accountability, along with the empowerment of parents, students, and teachers. His work articulates a vision for restructuring with specific proposals ranging from classroom organization and curriculum, to funding and teacher pay.  At 17 years old, Michael Leap from Okemos, MI, has examined the role of science in our society by synthesizing and applying several complex philosophical concepts to basic questions about science in everyday life. With the thesis that conventional views of science, truth, and nature only function from a self-referential viewpoint, he presents new, transversal perspectives in hopes that this critical examination will lead to a greater understanding of the world at large.  Divya Nag, a 17-year-old from El Dorado Hills, CA, developed both a thermal analysis technique to quantify the effects of forest fires and a novel ratio to determine organic matter loss in on-site situations. By using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and x-ray diffraction, Divya determined soil ignition temperatures and soil compositions before and after burning. These techniques can be used in evaluating the efficacy of prescribed burning and forest management.  Seventeen-year-old Avanthi Raghavan from Orlando, FL, studied mechanisms of protein transport critical to the survival and pathogenicity of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, which infects human red blood cells and causes malaria. By using confocal microscopy, Avanthi characterized the role of the SNARE proteins PfSec22 and PfBet1, thus identifying potentially exploitable targets for the future development of parasite-specific drugs.  Sarah Waliany, a 16-year-old from Arcadia, CA, discovered that expression of the gene t-Darpp can make Her-2 positive breast tumor cells become resistant to the drug Herceptin. Sarah demonstrated that t-Darpp alters a critical signaling pathway that regulates growth and survival in cells. Sarah's work shows that blocking the t-Darpp gene can eventually lead to more effective breast cancer treatment.  Mr. President, today each of these 20 young scholars deserve our praise for the commitment they have demonstrated to enriching our understanding in the fields of music, science, literature, and technology. These 20 young people also deserve our admiration for their desire to improve the lives of individuals worldwide by addressing issues of practical import. Finally, these young people deserve our gratitude for the shining example they have set for us by the excellence of their work and their desire to work on the behalf of others. I would also like to thank the Davidson Institute for the support and direction they provide to this group of our country's young leaders. The knowledge of such dedicated and gifted young Americans gives me great hope and comfort for the future. Clearly, the future of our country rests in capable hands.                          ____________________
