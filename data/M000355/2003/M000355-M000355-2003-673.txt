 If we were able to get on the bill, it would obviously be open to amendment and we would see how the Senate felt, that some issue ought to be addressed.  The Senator from Nevada, the floor leader on this subject, says 19 States are currently in crisis and 25 are on the way to crisis, while only 6 of our 50 States are OK as far as the price of medical malpractice premiums not driving physicians out of work is concerned.  It has been incredibly stated on the other side of the aisle by numerous speakers that this crisis has nothing to do with runaway judgments. I don't know how you can reach that conclusion. The people at CBO and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Joint Economic Committee, insurance commissioners, actuaries, all believe this crisis is related to runaway judgments.  California, which we keep referring to, has the model system after which the underlying bill has been modeled. My friends on the other side of the aisle think this crisis has been created by something else. They have been suggesting it is bad returns from the stock market or insurance company collusion, or a cadre of quacks who are causing problems for medicine. I don't know whether all of that has made some contribution, but we know there is one solution that works, and that is the California approach. That is what is in the underlying bill.  We ought to at least recognize this is a national crisis, a national problem that ought to be dealt with at the national level. We will have an opportunity to find out whether the Senate agrees with that shortly when we vote on cloture on the motion to proceed. I hope the Senate will give us an opportunity to get to the underlying bill. It would then be open to all kinds of amendments and we could begin to proceed, as we normally do in the Senate, in crafting legislation to deal with national problems.  We urge our colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed.
