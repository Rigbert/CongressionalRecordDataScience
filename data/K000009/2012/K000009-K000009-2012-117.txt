Speaker, in our continuing efforts to turn the tragic events at Newtown to high purpose, I include two articles from the USA Today newspaper, one entitled ``A Boy Lost in the Shadows'', and another, ``Newtown Puts Mental Services in Spotlight.''  These articles remind me of a conversation a few years ago with a caring grade school teacher from my own district who became quite frustrated with the local school system's inability to help her manage the behavior of a child in her elementary classroom. The child, several times a day, became uncontrollable, moving about the classroom, throwing tantrums, screaming loudly, often falling to the floor, thus causing great confusion in the class. Despite the teacher's repeated attempts to help the child, it became obvious professional help was needed. A complicating factor became family members who were in denial that anything out of the ordinary was actually occurring with the child, despite the constant disruption, acting out, anger, and anti-social behavior the child was demonstrating. After repeated attempts that took three years, and let me emphasize three years, the teacher was able to have the child referred to behavioral specialists and placed in a more appropriate learning environment. That situation alone made me wonder about the manner in which we as a society make help available to children who exhibit destructive behaviors that are harmful to themselves and potentially to others.  Mr. Speaker, as a society, we seem to lack the methods to identify troubled youth and put them on a proper path to healing, if healing is possible. Too often, a child is left floundering due to our collective inabilities to help them find a constructive path forward. For example, many of our local boards of education often are not properly equipped to identify and assist children who are uncivil or who are completely alienated from their surroundings. Some families, too, seem unaware of their child's behaviors as unusual or potentially destructive. As the article I inserted in the Record yesterday reports, some parents are so overwhelmed in caring for children with special behavioral conditions, they simply don't know what else to do. Then again, too often there is no one to call to help.  Through the Commission President Obama proposed be formed to address the conditions that led to Newtown's tragedy, surely that Commission should invite a cross section of Americans to share their knowledge about what led to the mass killings that have harmed so many in our nation over the past decade, and what we must do as a society to prevent future tragedies. We can all envision a future where the incredible intelligence and goodwill of the citizens of our nation can lead us to a better day if we provide a forum to listen carefully to the voices among us who grapple with these challenges daily.                  [From USA Today, December 17, 2012]                       A Boy Lost in the Shadows             (By Donna Leinwand Leger and Yamiche Alcindor)       Sandy Hook, Conn. Adam Lanza left only the faintest      impression on classmates, neighbors and the people of Newtown      before he killed his mother and shot his way into Sandy Hook      Elementary, where he killed 20 children and six teachers      before turning the gun on himself.       Lanza, 20, skulked through the hallways of Newtown High      School in over-sized button-down shirts, eyes perpetually      downcast. His name appears a few times on the honor roll      published in the weekly Newtown Bee, but his picture is      absent from The Newtown Nighthawk yearbook.       ``He was very withdrawn,'' said Tracy Dunn, 20, who      graduated from Newtown High School in 2010, Lanza's class.       Dunn, a junior at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and      Health Sciences, said she never saw him talk with anyone or      hang out with friends. He spent time with computers and      cameras in the technology room and belonged to the Tech Club.       ``He would always have his head down walking to class with      his briefcase--kind of scurrying.'' she said. ``He never sat      down or said anything to kids at this locker. He was just      there in the background.''       Andrew Lapple, who sat next to Lanza in homeroom their      senior year at Newtown High, told the Hartford Courant that      Lanza ``never really talked at all'' and walked the corridors      at school clutching his laptop.       ``He walked down the halls, against the wall almost like he      was afraid of people,'' Lapple said. ``He was definitely kind      of strange, but you'd never think he'd do something like      this.''       Lanza grew up in Sandy Hook in a sprawling colonial house      with his parents, Nancy and Peter, and an older brother,      Ryan, 24. His parents divorced in 2009 after a long      separation, and his father has remarried. Family friends and      relatives say much of his education was home schooling by his      mother.       He attended Reed Intermediate School for sixth grade and      appears in a 2003 yearbook photo. In the a 2005 yearbook for      Newtown Middle School, he's listed with the seventh grade      without a picture under ``camera shy,'' but he isn't listed      in the eighth-grade class the next year. His name surfaces at      Newtown High School in 2008 as a sophomore.       Marsha Moskowitz of Sandy Hook drove the school bus that      took Lanza to Newtown Middle. She remembers him as ``quiet,      shy and reserved.''       His mother clashed with school officials and eventually      removed Adam from public school and home-schooled him, her      former sister-in-law, Marsha Lanza of Chicago, told a CBS      News affiliate.       Lanza had trouble with her youngest son for years, and her      friend Louise Tambascio, owner of My Place Pizza &      Restaurant. He was diagnosed with a disorder on the autism      spectrum called Asperger syndrome, she said. Psychologist      Elizabeth Laugeson, an assistant clinical professor at the      University of California-Los Angeles, had no knowledge of      Adam Lanza's case but said, ``There really is no clear      association between Asperger's and violent behavior.''       Nancy Lanza stopped into My Place once or twice a week but      rarely talked about her younger son, Tambascio said. Ryan,      the older son, bused table at the restaurant for two years.      He is outgoing and personable, she said. The brothers haven't      spoken in two years, she said.       ``Ryan who was the complete opposite of his brother,'' she      said. Adam ``always had his face down. He would never look      you in the eye.''       Police say the three guns used in the massacre were      purchased legally and registered to Nancy Lanza, whom friends      described as a gun and shooting aficionado. Tambascio said      shooting was ``a hobby.''       She ``had nothing to do with what her son did. She's a good      person, goodhearted. She would do anything for you,''      Tambascio said.       Nancy Lanza ``liked the single-mindedness of shooting,''      her landscaper, Dan Holmes told The Washington Post, Holmes      said she mentioned taking her son to the firing range to      practice. Holmes never entered the house or saw her son, but      she did once bring an antique rifle outside to show him, he      told the Post.       The shooter's father, Peter Lanza of Stamford, said the      family is ``in a state of disbelief.''       ``We, too, are asking why,'' he said in a written      statement. ``Like so many of you, we are saddened, but      struggling to make sense of what has transpired.''       The Lanzas' neighbors on Yogananda Street say it's puzzling      that on such a close-knit block where residents throw      barbecues for newcomers, so few of them knew Adam Lanza or      had ever seen him.       ``It's a mystery. Nobody knows them, which is odd for this      neighborhood,'' Len Strocchia said. ``Everyone knows each      other through the children, the school bus. The community      here is kids.''       Neighbor Dave Lapp said he had little to tell the FBI and      State Police when they called on Friday night. ``We walked by      their house with the dog every day, and we don't know them.      We've never even seen them,'' Lapp said.       Dunn, Adam Lanza's classmate, fears that may have been at      the root of the problem.       ``Maybe if someone had tried to reach out to Adam--maybe he      needed a friend. Maybe this wouldn't have happened,'' Dunn      said. ``He's just one kid who slipped through the cracks.''                                  ____                  [From USA Today, December 17, 2012]                Newtown Puts Mental Service in Spotlight                             (By Liz Szabo)       Families and doctors who treat the mentally ill say they      hope Friday's tragedy in Newtown, Conn., will refocus the      nation's attention on improving mental health services.       Police have not released details about the motives or      mental state of shooter Adam Lanza. But perpetrators of      similar mass shootings--at Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois      University and an event in Tuscon for former congresswoman      Gabrielle Giffords--all had serious mental health conditions.       ``We wait for things like this to happen and then everyone      talks about mental health,'' says Priscilla Dass-Brailsford,      an associate professor of psychology at Georgetown University      Medical Center. ``But they quickly forget.''       There are hundreds of multiple-casualty shootings a year,      says forensic psychologist Dewey Cornell, director of the      Virginia Youth Violence Project. People have become so      desensitized that they pay no attention, he says, yet mental      illness contributes to domestic violence, child abuse, drug      addiction, homelessness and incarceration. Investing in      mental health care could help prevent tragedies, he says.       ``Mental health has shrunk down to the level of short-term      crisis management,'' Cornell says. ``We can't think about the      gunman in the parking lot and what to do with him. We have to      get involved a lot earlier.''       Schools and communities ``have cut their mental health      services to the bone. We're paying a price for it.''                          ____________________
