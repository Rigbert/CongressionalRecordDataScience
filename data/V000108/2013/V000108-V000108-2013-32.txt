 The gentleman who is in opposition mentions that the administration mentions the United States Constitution. The fact is we have a constitutional responsibility. With the passage of more than a decade and a changing world--and I would agree with the gentleman, something else may be in store--we ought to revisit that issue. We ought to exercise our constitutional, congressional prerogative and have a full debate.  Again, the gentleman is providing over 1\1/2\ years. In such a serious issue, I think even this Congress could come to grips with that type of fundamental issue and resolve the future.  So I strongly support what the gentleman is doing and appreciate his amendment.
