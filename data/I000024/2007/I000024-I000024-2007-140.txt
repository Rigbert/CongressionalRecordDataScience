President, there have been some misconceptions about this amendment. First, my State of Oklahoma is a corn State. It is a livestock State. If my colleagues will look at the groups of people that have joined in and said we need to have this safety valve, it is virtually everyone: the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Chicken Council, port producers, Restaurant Association--all of these recognizing that in the event something should happen with a severe drought--and these are easy to predict--we should have some kind of a trigger that would allow the mandate to be reduced.  All this does is simply provide that if the USDA determines because of weather patterns there is going to be a real problem in the crop of corn, the mandated limit can be reduced by as much as 15 percent. In other words, we are still going to have an 85-percent mandate.  I suggest my colleagues look very carefully at this amendment. This is going to offer some assistance in the event of a serious drought or something that will affect the corn crop in America.  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.
