President, tomorrow we are going to have some significant votes in the Senate on issues of great importance, not the least of which is the Defense appropriations bill, one of the most important bills we consider in the course of our calendar year. This is the bill to provide the resources for our troops--literally, their pay, the equipment they need, the training they need, new weapons they need, the fundamentals we need to keep our Nation safe.  This has usually been a very bipartisan bill. Having served on the Appropriations Committee, I have seen it in the past with strong support from both sides of the aisle and rarely a real partisan issue. This time, however, this bill has been modified and changed. Added to this bill are provisions which have nothing to do with our Nation's defense.
