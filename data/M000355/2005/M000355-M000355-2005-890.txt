 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday, tomorrow, July 15, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 150, H.R. 3057. I further ask that the committee-reported substitute be agreed to and considered as original text for the purposes of further amendment, and that no points of order be waived by virtue of this agreement.
