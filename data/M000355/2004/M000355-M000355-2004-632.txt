4 million Americans who earn their livelihood in our country while working for foreign corporations.  This amendment is very simple. It delays the effective date of the outsourcing provisions until the Secretary of Commerce certifies the amendment made by this title will not result in the loss of more jobs than it will protect and will not cause harm to the United States economy. In short, it is a do-no-harm provision. Remember, 6.4 million Americans have their jobs in the United States as a result of foreign companies doing business here.  Senator Dodd's fundamental goal of encouraging and protecting American jobs is certainly a sound one. No one can argue with that. However, it may jeopardize many more jobs in the process of trying to achieve a laudable goal. These 6.4 million Americans depend on salaries from foreign corporations to feed their children, provide them shelter, education, and health care.  If America erects a global jobs barrier, nations around this world may retaliate in kind. This would put at risk those 6.4 million jobs I have been talking about. These are real numbers, real jobs, and real families put at risk.  Yesterday, the Senator from Connecticut stated he was told over the next decade over 3 million American jobs may be outsourced. Unfortunately, with American jobs at stake we cannot risk what is or what may be. What is, right now, is the existence of 6.4 million American jobs, not over the next decade but right now, real numbers calculated by the Census Bureau.  Let's just take Kentucky, for example. We have 104,100 people in my State employed by foreign companies or their affiliates. That is a lot of jobs in a State of 4 million people. It is a huge number of jobs.  In Connecticut, 116,000--even more than in Kentucky--jobs are held by citizens of Connecticut who are working for foreign corporations doing business in Connecticut. These pale in comparison to what is at stake in the State of Massachusetts--223,300 jobs--Massachusetts citizens working in Massachusetts for foreign corporations--an astonishing number, indeed. Again, in Massachusetts, nearly a quarter of a million workers, their families and their children, are put at risk potentially by the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut--real jobs and real families facing real unemployment and real hardship.  For the sake of these jobs, I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment I have just offered. The underlying legislation is the JOBS bill. That is what this underlying bill is all about: American jobs.  It is counter to this legislation and our duties here as Members of this body to take action which puts 6.4 million American workers' jobs at risk. That is not what we ought to be doing on the floor of the Senate.  Finally, let's just drive the point home by looking on a State-by-State basis at how many jobs are in the United States as a result of foreign corporations doing business in our various States.  Let's start at the top of the alphabet: Alabama,76,800 jobs; Alaska, 11,600 jobs;Arizona, 75,200 jobs; Arkansas, 40,400 jobs; California, 737,600 jobs--the number of people in California in jobs as a result of foreign corporations doing work in California; in Colorado, 101,000 jobs; in Connecticut, as I mentioned earlier, 116,000 jobs; in Delaware, 33,400 jobs; in the District of Columbia, 17,100 jobs; in Florida, 306,900 jobs--Floridians working for foreign corporations; in Georgia, 223,900 jobs; in Hawaii, 43,300 jobs; in Idaho, 14,200 jobs; in Illinois, 317,100 jobs; in Indiana, 165,900 jobs; in Iowa, 40,300 jobs; in Kansas, 60,600 jobs; as I mentioned earlier, in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, 104,100 jobs; in Louisiana, 61,100 jobs; in Maine, 33,400 jobs; in Maryland, 110,400 jobs; as I mentioned earlier, in Massachusetts, 223,300 jobs; in Michigan, 246,500 jobs; in Minnesota, 103,100 jobs; in Mississippi, 23,900 jobs; in Missouri, 105,100 jobs; in Montana, 6,800 jobs; in Nebraska, 21,800 jobs; in Nevada, 35,700 jobs; in New Hampshire, 45,900 jobs; in New Jersey, 269,100 jobs; in New Mexico, 16,300 jobs; in New York, 471,600 jobs; in North Carolina, 261,600 jobs; in North Dakota, 8,600 jobs; in Ohio, 259,400 jobs; in Oklahoma, 41,800 jobs; in Oregon, 62,300 jobs; in Pennsylvania, 280,800 jobs; in Rhode Island, 24,400 jobs; in South Carolina, 137,600 jobs; in South Dakota, 6,900 jobs; in Tennessee, 148,600 jobs; in Texas almost a half million--437,900--jobs; in Utah, 37,400 jobs; in Vermont, 11,600 jobs; in Virginia, 179,200 jobs; in Washington, 104,200 jobs; in West Virginia, 27,600 jobs; in Wisconsin, 106,800 jobs; in Wyoming, 7,800 jobs.  There is an enormous number of Americans--6.4 million Americans--working in America, working in our country, employed by foreign corporations. We do not want to gamble with that. Outsourcing is a matter of concern, but we are proud of the insourcing that is going on, too, and the fact there is an enormous number of foreign corporations that have come into our country because they think it has a good business environment, because they want to employ Americans to produce products here in our country.  Mr. President, I hope this amendment on behalf of the majority leader and myself will be adopted.
