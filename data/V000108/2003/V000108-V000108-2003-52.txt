Speaker, it is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I recognize and congratulate Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana on their 90th anniversary. Throughout its 90 years, Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church has provided a welcoming worship and gathering space for all residents of Northwest Indiana.  SS Constantine and Helen and its forefathers began their foundation in Gary, Indiana in 1906 in the dream of preserving the Greek heritage and faith in America. The first steps to making this dream a reality began in the spring of 1911, when an initial meeting was held to discuss the need for a worship spacefor the small handful of Greek families that settled in Northwest Indiana. The name was later chosen to signify the importance of Saint Constantine, the Roman Emperor who permitted the freedom of practicing Christianity in the Fourth Century, as well as Saint Helen, Saint Constantine's mother, in their fight for the preservation of their heritage and Greek culture.  In 1913, the first worship services were held in a rented store building, and SS Constantine and Helen became the first Greek Church in the City of Gary. Following two years of leadership by visiting priests from Chicago, Reverend Nicholas Mandilas became the first permanent pastor for the church. In 1919, after years of traveling around the Midwest searching for financial help, and worshiping in tents in the dead of winter, the congregation's valiant and dedicated efforts led them to the opening of their first church building on Easter Sunday. Approximately 50 years later, another church building was constructed in Merrillville, Indiana and the Cultural Center was opened to the residents of Northwest Indiana.  Being a member of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA), Lodge 78, I am a strong advocate for the preservation and promotion of the ideals and morals of Hellenism throughout all of Northwest Indiana. Throughout its 90 years of service and dedication, Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church has offered the inspiration to be good citizens of the community, practice faith freely, and educate our youth so that the Greek heritage may never be forgotten.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church as they celebrate their 90th anniversary. Their sincere dedication and devotion to the residents of Northwest Indiana deserves the highest commendation and recognition.                          ____________________
