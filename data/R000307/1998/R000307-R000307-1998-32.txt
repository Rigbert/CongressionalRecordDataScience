LOTT. With regard to his unanimous consent request, I have no idea of the ramifications of the unanimous consent request he just asked. I don't know what is involved there. We already passed the agriculture appropriations bill. There was action taken on that particular item.  I would not be able to agree to that at this point without checking with Senators that have been involved in that legislation with that amendment.  So there is no need in holding up the Senate any further. If the Senator wants to object, he can do so.  I am going to also ask unanimous consent that he go ahead and move on the H-1B issue which has been worked out previously in conference by both sides of the Capitol by both parties. This is an issue that we need to get resolved.  I thought that we had a reasonable resolution of the issue.
