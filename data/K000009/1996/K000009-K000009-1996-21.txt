Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and rise in very strong support of the committee bill and oppose the Kolbe amendment, which was defeated in the full committee.  The language in the bill is fair, it is reasonable, and without question it is in our national interest.  The issue here really is why should we not as lawmakers ensure that the bidding process in this Government procurement activity is conducted in a fair manner at fair value offers. That is all it says.  It is somewhat curious, although it is not curious to those who have watched Japan over the years, that for a system that should cost somewhere between maybe $80 million and $100 million, the bid comes in at $35 million. Kind of interesting the way Japan behaves on the international market.  Mr. Chairman, if we go and read a recent book by the President's chief economic advisor, Laura Tyson, and I do not think she knew we would be debating this, but in her book, ``Who's Bashing Whom,'' she gives us a window on what Japan really does and how they compete, and I quote directly.  She says:       At the root of the ability of Japanese firms to compete      aggressively on price, even when it means selling products      below cost and running losses, are the unique structural      features of the Japanese economy. The companies competing      with--U.S. firms like--Cray and Motorola have deep pockets      and long time horizons. They can afford to cross-subsidize      losses in one market with profits from another. They continue      to benefit from a variety of promotional policies and from      lax enforcement of regulations or restrictive business      practices. They also continue to benefit from the insulated      nature of the Japanese market, fostered by these and other      structural impediments. In short, the pricing behavior of      Japanese companies is a natural outgrowth of Japan's business      and government environment.  We know it is a protected environment. There is not a person in this institution that would call Japan a free trader.  I know that the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe] is a complete free trader. I am a fair trader. There is no way anybody could call Japan a free trader.  Now, if we look at this particular market, and I can still remember Norm Mineta when he served here laboring over those agreements with Japan trying to get 5-percent access in the market, 10-percent access, maybe 12 percent, and then Japan would violate those agreements. There is not any question Japan has a habit well recognized of underbidding in almost every market.  Look at what they did to us on the airport, the new airport out there, Osaka. We could not get U.S. firms to be able to bid into that construction.  So it is not just in supercomputers. It is in construction. It certainly is in the automotive industry. The results are painfully clear to the American people if they are not painfully clear to every Member of Congress here. That is we have maintained a $50 billion to $60 billion trade deficit now, annually, annually, in this decade growing every year regardless of what the exchange rate is.  I remember one of my dear friends, the gentleman from Florida, Sam Gibbons, said to me: Well, if only the exchange rate, U.S. dollar to the yen, would go down from 240 to maybe 250 yen to the dollar. Why, we could just crack the Japanese market.  You know what? It never happened. And then the yen went down to 90, and the trade deficit kept going up. It does not matter whether Japan has got pneumonia or whether she is the most strident economy on the face of the earth in any given year. The trade deficit just keeps going on.  I would just have to say, let us wake up. Let us wake up. Let this Congress not be bound up in legalisms and procedures that we knot ourselves up into. Let us look at the bottom line, and let us do everything we can in order to ensure that the bidding practices in this situation are completely fair.  In many ways, supercomputers translate into national security. Let us not be naive. Support the committee bill. Oppose the Kolbe amendment, and stand up, for a change, for fair bidding practices.                              {time}  1830
