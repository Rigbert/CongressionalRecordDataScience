  On this fateful day, which proved to be such a decisive turning point for the allied victory in Europe, thousands of allied forces were killed or wounded in the invasion. While we are sadly losing more and more members of the ``greatest generation'' with each passing year--including the last of the original Navajo code talkers whom we lost just yesterday--the heroism of these brave Americans can never be forgotten.  I have one constituent, Bob Williams from Boone County, KY, who jumped on D-day, jumped again 50 years later, and was on the front cover of Time magazine. I saw him earlier this year, and he says he is not going to jump again because his wife will not let him, but Bob Williams is still in good shape 70 years after the day he jumped into the night of D-day.  Tomorrow I will be honored to commemorate the most important anniversary by meeting with a number of Kentucky heroes--veterans from World War II and the Korean war--who will be visiting the national monuments built here in the Nation's Capital to honor their service and sacrifice.
