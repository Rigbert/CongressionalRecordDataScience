Financial aid offices find ways for students to afford tuition and textbooks, housing offices provide safe places for students to live, and tutoring centers provide academic supports for students who are struggling to keep up in class. But there is another critical service that many students require to succeed, and it is much less frequently discussed. I am talking about mental health services and outreach provided by college counseling centers.  For a long time, we have overlooked the mental health needs of students on college campuses. We know now that many mental illnesses start to manifest in this period when young people leave the security of home and regular medical care. The responsibility for the students' well-being often shifts from parents to students, and the students aren't always completely prepared. It is easier for a young person's problems to go unnoticed when he or she is away at college than when they are at home, in the company of parents, old friends, and high school teachers. College also provides a new opportunity for young people to experiment with drugs or alcohol.  The consequences of not detecting or addressing mental health needs among students are real. Forty-five percent of college students report having felt so depressed that it was difficult to function. Ten percent have contemplated suicide. We have even seen tragedies on the scale of shootings at Northern Illinois University in February 2008 and at Virginia Tech in April 2007. These heartbreaking and traumatic incidents demonstrated the tragic consequences of mental instability and helped us recognize we need to do more to support students during what can be very tough years.  Fortunately, many students can succeed in college if they have appropriate counseling services and access to needed medications. These services make a real impact. Students who seek help are 6 times less likely to kill themselves. Colleges are welcoming students today who 10 or 20 years ago would not have been able to attend school due to mental illness, but who can today because of advances in treatment.  But while the needs for mental health services on campus are rising, colleges are facing financial pressures and having trouble meeting this demand. As I have travelled around my State, I have learned just how thin colleges and universities are stretched when it comes to providing. counseling and other support services to students.  Take Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. SIUC has 8 full-time counselors for 21,000 students. That is one counselor for every 2,500 students. The recommended ratio is one counselor for every 1,500 students. And there is another problem. Like many rural communities, Carbondale only has one community mental health agency. That agency is overwhelmed by the mental health needs of the community and refuses to serve students from SIUC. The campus counseling center is the only mental health option for students. The eight hard-working counselors at SIUC do their best under impossible conditions. They triage students who come in seeking help so that the ones who might be a threat to themselves or others are seen first. The waitlist of students seeking services has reached 45 students.  The story is the same across the country. Colleges are trying to fill in the gaps, but because of the shortage of counselors, students' needs are overlooked. A recent survey of college counseling centers indicates that the average ratio of professional-staff-to-students is 1 to 1,952, and at 4-year public universities it is 1 to 2,607 students. Although interest in mental-health services is high, the recession has put pressure on administrators to cut budgets wherever they can. At times, counseling centers are in the cross hairs. Ten percent of survey respondents said their budgets were cut during the 2007-8 academic year, half said their budgets stayed the same, and nearly a quarter reported that their funds increased by 3 percent or less.  With so many students looking for help and so few counselors to see them, counseling centers have to cut back on outreach. Without outreach, the chances of finding students who need help but do not ask for it go down. This is a serious problem. We know that some students exhibit warning signs of a tortured mental state. But faculty and students do not always know how or where to express their concerns. Outreach efforts by campus counseling centers can help educate the community about warning signs to look for as well as how to intervene. Of the students who committed suicide across the country in 2007, only 22 percent had received counseling on campus. That means that of the 1,000 college students who took their own lives, 800 may never have looked for help. How many of those young lives could have been saved if our college counseling centers had the resources they needed to identify those students and help them? Our students deserve better.  We need to help schools meet the needs of their students, and that's why I'm introducing the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act today. This bill would create a grant program to provide funding for colleges and universities to improve their mental health services. Colleges could use the funding to hire personnel, increase outreach, and educate the campus community about mental health. The bill also would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a public, nation-wide campaign to educate campus communities about mental health.  Reflecting on the loss of his own son, the well-known minister Rev. William Sloan Coffin once said, ``When parents die, they take with them a portion of the past. But when children die, they take away the future as well.'' I hope the bill I am introducing today will help prevent the unnecessary loss of more young lives and bright futures.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 682       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus      Improvement Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The 2007 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors      found that the average ratio of counselors to students on      campus is nearly 1 to 2,000 and is often far higher on large      campuses. The International Association of Counseling      Services accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per      1,000 to 1,500 students.       (2) College counselors report that 8.5 percent of enrolled      students sought counseling in the past year, totaling an      estimated 1,600,000 students.       (3) Over 90 percent of counseling directors believe there      is an increase in the number of students coming to campus      with severe psychological problems. The majority of      counseling directors report concerns that the demand for      services is growing without an increase in resources.       (4) A 2008 American College Health Association survey      revealed that 43 percent of students at colleges and      universities report having felt so depressed it was difficult      to function, and one out of every 11 students seriously      considered suicide within the past year.       (5) Research conducted between 1989 and 2002 found that      students seen for anxiety disorders doubled, for depression      tripled, and for serious suicidal intention tripled.       (6) Many students who need help never receive it.      Counseling directors report that, of the students who      committed suicide on their campuses, only 22 percent were      current or former counseling center clients. Directors did      not know the previous psychiatric history of 60 percent of      those students.       (7) A survey conducted by the University of Idaho Student      Counseling Center in 2000 found that 77 percent of students      who responded reported that they were more likely to stay in      school because of counseling and that their school      performance would have declined without counseling.       (8) A 6-year longitudinal study of college students found      that personal and emotional adjustment was an important      factor in retention and predicted attrition as well as, or      better than, academic adjustment (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt,      1994).
