 As I understand, in this bill, there is a requirement that Puerto Rico, a territory that has been experiencing a 10-year depression, a territory in which over half of the children are living in poverty, a territory in which many schools have been shut down, where people have been laid off, where unemployment is sky high, that within this legislation, there is the imposition that the people of Puerto Rico are going to have to pay for this control board to the tune--and I don't understand this--of $370 million. You have a board of seven people. No. 1, how in God's Name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million? Yes, you need staff and you need all that stuff, but $370 million to run a small bureaucracy sounds to be totally off the charts. Then, to tell the people of Puerto Rico, you are going to have to shut down schools, you are going to have to shut down health services, we may take away the pensions of your workers, and, oh, by the way, you are going to have to pay $370 million in order to fund this control board--am I missing anything here? I know this sounds so absurd that people may think I am misleading them, but am I missing anything here or is that the reality?
