President, this is taken directly out of the BRAC language. It is critical that we find ourselves in a situation where we are going to be able to actively interpret the intent of the BRAC Commissioners. Eight Commissioners, and they used the same criteria everywhere they went. They visited all the installations. They were in Oklahoma. It was very tense. We have five installations in Oklahoma. They went to all of them. These people worked for years to try to come up with conclusions, so I am going to read some of the conclusions they have, and then I would like to yield to the Senator from Georgia, if it is his desire to be heard on this subject.
