He has been waiting a long time, as well.  I am a supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill, this iteration, as with all others. It is an important step in the right direction. However, I believe the biggest problem is that campaigning in America has become a never-ending money chase. There is an election the first Tuesday in November. People sleep in on Wednesday and all the fundraising starts all over again on Thursday. It is truly a permanent campaign.  If I had my way, if I could write my version of what the Senate ought to do on campaign finance, we would look at some sort of approach along the lines of what is used in several countries in Europe. They confine their elections to several months over a period of a couple of years. Money can be raised. It has to be disclosed. It is spent. They have their election, and, heaven forbid, after a few months of campaigning, they go back to tackling the issues that all Members get an election certificate for--to improve health care, education, to try to stuff the nuclear genie back into the bottle, to create an opportunity for people who work hard and play by the rules.  We are, obviously, not going to get that kind of reform, although I have been amazed in the last few days when I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle say they like that and wish there was a bipartisan Senate task force to look at something similar. That really would be reform. We could spend most of our time doing a job for which we were elected.  For now, we are limited to steps that can be taken immediately that are effective. I have come to the floor this afternoon to talk about a step that Senator Jeff Bingaman and I have developed. It is an important step in the view of Senator Bingaman and myself. It limits negative campaigning.  My view from personal experience is negative ads are similar to a virus.They infect everyone with whom they come in contact. In the special election to replace Bob Packwood in the Senate, unfortunately I didn't say no to some of those media consultants who told me to win, I had to just rip in to our colleague, my friend, Senator Gordon Smith, with negative ads. I should have known immediately that all those negative ads run contrary to everything I got involved with when I began the Gray Panthers in Oregon to try to practice good government, but I didn't step in when I should have on the negative ads, and I regret it to this day.  With a month to go before that special election, I did tell my consultants I could not stand any longer the stench of the negative ads, and I told them to take them off the air. Moreover, I apologized to the people of Oregon. I said I made an error in judgment and it would not happen again. I ran my 1998 campaign, I am proud to be able to say, without mentioning my opponent at all.  I believe candidates ought to stand by their ads. They ought to be directly responsible for their ads. What Senator Bingaman and I will propose later this week is an approach we call ``stand by your ad.'' Specifically, the Bingaman-Wyden proposal says a candidate who mentions his or her opponent in a campaign ad must do so in person in order to get the lowest unit rate for advertising. Under current Federal communications law, broadcasters are required to sell commercial air time to candidates for Federal office at the lowest available price, known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. That means for 45 days prior to a primary or primary runoff, for 60 days prior to a general election. In effect, everybody else in town--the car dealership, the restaurant, the tire manufacturer--has to subsidize politics. Their ad costs are greater because broadcasters have to give these cheaper rates during the election cycle.  I think it is time to hold candidates personally responsible for their ads. I am amazed to find that all across the political spectrum I am joined in support of this idea. For example, in the House of Representatives, my Oregon colleague, Greg Walden, is a broadcaster by profession. He doesn't think this is bureaucratic or hard to comply with. He introduced in the House, as I did in the Senate, the ``stand by your ad'' approach that says candidates who mention their opponent have to do it in person to get the lowest unit rate. No first amendment violation here.  I recently received from the Library of Congress a legal opinion stating it would be constitutional to put in place the Bingaman-Wyden amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that legal opinion be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                          Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1999.     Memorandum To : Honorable Ron Wyden. Attention: Jeff Gagne,          Legislative Assistant.     From: L. Paige Whitaker, Legislative Attorney, American Law          Division.     Subject: Constitutionality of Conditioning Receipt of Lowest          Unit Rate for Federal Candidate Broadcast Communications          on Compliance With Attribution Requirements.       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request      for an analysis of the constitutionality of a proposed      amendment to S. 1593 (106th Cong.), ``McCain/Feingold II,''      which would amend 47 U.S.C. Sec. 315(b) to restrict the      availability of the lowest unit rate for campaign      advertising, in which a federal candidate directly references      an opponent, to only those radio and television broadcasts      where the candidate personally makes the reference. That is,      in the case of a television broadcast directly referencing an      opponent, the candidate would be required to make a personal      appearance and, in the case of a radio broadcast directly      referencing an opponent, the candidate would be required to      make a personal audio statement identifying the candidate, in      order to qualify for the lowest unit rate. Such personal      appearance and personal audio statements are often referred      to as broadcast attribution requirements.       In the landmark decision, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme      Court made it clear that the right to associate is a ``basic      constitutional freedom'' \1\ and that any action that may      have the effect of curtailing that freedom to associate would      be subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\2\ The Court      further asserted that while the right of political      association is not absolute,\3\ it can only be limited by      substantial governmental interests such as the prevention of      corruption or the appearance thereof.\4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976) (quoting Kusper v. Pontikes, 414      U.S. 51, 57 (1973) ).     \2\ Id. at 25 (quoting NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460-61      (1958) ).     \3\ Id. (citing CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 567      (1973) ).     \4\ Id. at 27-28.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Employing this analysis, the Court in Buckley upheld the      disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act      (FECA), noting that the ``ability of the citizenry to make      informed choices among candidates for office is essential.''      \5\ Also of relevance, the Buckley Court upheld the FECA      presidential public financing provisions, which condition a      candidate's receipt of public funding on the candidate      voluntarily agreeing to limit spending.\6\ The Court found      that the provisions did not infringe on free speech, but      rather constituted a proper means of promoting the general      welfare by actually encouraging public discussion and      participation in the electoral process.\7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \5\ Id. at 14-15.     \6\ Id. at 57, fin. 65 (noting that ``[j]ust as a candidate      may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he      chooses to accept, he may decide to forgo private fundraising      and accept public funding.'')     \7\ Id. at 97-104 (finding also that conditioning receipt of      public funding on complying with spending limits was a less      onerous restriction than those in the ballot access cases      with respect to minor and new parties.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------       In view of the Supreme Court's holdings in Buckley v.      Valeo, it appears that the proposed amendment, to condition      federal candidate receipt of the lowest unit rate for      broadcast communications on candidates' voluntarily agreeing      to comply with certain attribution requirements, would be      upheld as constitutional. Similar to the FECA disclosure      requirements and presidential public financial provisions,      the proposal could be found to provide important candidate      information to the voting citizenry. Moreover similar to the      presidential public financing provisions, due to its      voluntary nature,\8\ the proposed amendment could be found      not to infringe on free speech, but rather to promote the      general welfare by increasing public discussion.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \8\ That is, a candidate could legally not choose to comply      with the broadcast attribution requirements and still      purchase broadcast time at a price higher than the lowest      unit rate.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       In addition, it appears that, requiring a radio or      television broadcaster to condition providing federal      candidates with the lowest unit rate for broadcast      communications on candidates' voluntarily agreeing to comply      with certain attribution requirements would also pass      constitutional muster under Supreme Court precedent upholding      reasonable access and equal time requirements.\9\ For      example, in C.B.S. v. Federal Communications Commission, The      Supreme Court considered a federal statute allowing the FCC      to revoke a broadcast license if the broadcaster willfully or      repeatedly failed to grant a federal office candidate      reasonable access to airtime or denied a federal office      candidate the ability to purchase reasonable amounts of      airtime. Although the Court did not rule that there is a      general right of candidate access to the broadcast media, the      majority held that the reasonable access statute      constitutionally provided, on an individual basis, legally      qualified federal office candidates with special access      rights.\10\ Moreover, as the Supreme Court found in Red Lion      Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., ``it does not violate the First      Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using      scarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire community,      obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of      great public concern.'' \11\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \9\ 47 U.S.C. Sec. 312(a)(7).     \10\ 453 U.S. 367 (1981). See also, Farmers Educational and      Cooperative Union v. WDAY, 360 U.S. 525 (1959) (upholding      F.C.C. equal time requirements.)     \11\ 395 U.S. 367, 394 (1969).       It is arguable that the subject proposal is a less onerous      burden on broadcast licensees than the equal time and      reasonable access provisions. As the Supreme Court has upheld      the constitutionality of the equal time and reasonable access      requirements, it is likely that the proposed requirement,      that broadcast licensees condition providing federal office      candidates with the lowest unit rate for broadcast      communications on candidate compliance with certain      attribution restrictions, would likewise be upheld.
