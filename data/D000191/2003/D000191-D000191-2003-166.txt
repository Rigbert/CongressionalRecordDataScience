Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition, although, I do not intend to speak in opposition.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I actually rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment. I represent a State that has topography which is foreign to many of the bureaucrats inside the Washington, D.C. Beltway, as do other Members from even more challenging terrain in Alaska and elsewhere, and it is hard for them to conceive that what looks on a map as a pretty straightforward route might happen to be a route that is not open in the wintertime or, even if it is open some of the time in the wintertime, it is often impassable; that even in the best of times it is over a mountain range, even though it is the shortest distance.  So I think common sense certainly being applied as an antidote to bureaucratic intransigence in this case is very well merited, and I congratulate the gentleman on his amendment. It is something I had missed in my perusal of the bill, and many others I know would be concerned for this. We thank him for his vigilance and the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar).  (
