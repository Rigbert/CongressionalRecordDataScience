Mr. Speaker, I just want to advise Members that one provision in this legislation deals with the United Nations Population Fund, and it says very clearly and unambiguously that unless the UNFPA gets out of China, they lose the $25 million that they are slated to get.  I want to remind colleagues that in China, it is illegal to have more than one child. Brothers and sisters are illegal. The Government is aggressively antibaby. Wei Jing Sheng, the great human rights activist who appeared before my subcommittee just a few weeks ago, said he could not believe, he said he was outraged that the U.N. Population Fund and U.N. personnel were working side by side with those family planning cadres, those oppressors of women, who enforce the one-child-per-couple policy in China with forced abortion.  Forced abortion was construed to be a crime against humanity at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. It is no less a crime against humanity today. Our conference report says that we are serious in dealing with those crimes against humanity and any organization like the U.N. Population Fund will lose its funding unless they get out of China.  Earlier the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) said that for 30 years we have been the leaders in family planning. That was no less true during the Reagan and Bush years when the Mexico City policy was in effect. We provided 40 percent--40 percent of all the population control aid during the Reagan and Bush years. That is a fact, that is not an opinion, with the Mexico City policy in full effect.  It is a red herring when Members on the other side stand up and say that we are holding hostage family planning. Monies flowed; people were given the opportunity to take that money and give out condoms and do all kinds of family planning, but a wall was erected between performing child abuse, killing unborn children, the promotion of violence against children and preventive means.  One hundred countries around the world protect their unborn children from the violence of abortion on demand. The main engine trying to topple those laws are these so-called family planning organizations. Some see it as their mission to nullify pro-life laws in other lands. Planned Parenthood, in their ``Vision 2000'' statement adopted in 1992, lays out an action plan to vanquish legal protection for unborn children in other nations.                             {time}   1615  Here is what it says in part. It declares that family planning organizations around the world, and I quote this, must bring ``pressure on governments and campaign for policy and legislative change to remove restrictions against abortion.''  We provide the money to these organizations that ``campaign'' and ``pressure'' governments to topple their pro-life laws. That is what this is all about. That is why my good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle would not sign the conference report. The pro-life safeguards in a compromise version were in there.  I think we have a moral obligation to say, if we are going to pour hundreds of millions into groups that advertise as family planners, let us have a truth in advertising. Let us separate abortion out of it, because abortion takes a life, a life of a child--it is not family planning.  Finally, just let me say, Mr. Speaker, this conference report and the work that went into it was a bipartisan process, 77 amendments in subcommittee, full committee, and on the floor of the House, and many, many conference meetings  We went through a give and take. We had Democratic staff and Republican staff studying and working on the provisions of this conference report.  It is another red herring to say that they were not part of it. Yes, maybe in the end, when it came to signing it, but that is because the pro-life Mexico City policy was in there.  Again I say, if we are going to send out roughly $400 million to abortion providers or family planning providers, and they wear the same hat as abortion providers, those of us who do not want to see any more babies die or any more women exploited or any more forced abortion in China must stand up and say, well, on this bill or any other bill that comes down the pike, we will be offering this language. It is absolutely not going to go away. We have compromised as far as we can go. We have half of Mexico City in here. It is a significant half, but it is only half.  It is about time the President and those on the abortion rights side met us halfway, and then those other issues could go forward unencumbered. Fail to meet us halfway--and we will fight and unceasingly raise this issue on every vehicle imaginable.
