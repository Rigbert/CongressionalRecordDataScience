  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President gave quite a speech Sunday night. More of the same failing policy with a new face and a new breathtaking price tag, $87 billion he wants to borrow now. And he wants to borrow $20.5 billion from the American people to rebuild the roads, bridges, ports, water and electric systems in Iraq.                              {time}  1015  Mr. Speaker, what about here at home? We have to say maybe we could use some investment here in the United States on our bridges, roads, ports, water and electric systems.  So the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) and I have introduced the American Parity Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it. The President would have to match dollar for dollar every dollar that he borrows from the American people to invest in Iraq, he has to invest a dollar here for the same purposes here in the United States of America. $20.5 billion for infrastructure in the United States could put a million people to work in this country andbegin to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure with our tax dollars as opposed to a nation far across the sea. I urge my colleagues to support the American Parity Act.                          ____________________
