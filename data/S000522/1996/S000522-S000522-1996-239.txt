Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House Committee on International Relations held a timely hearing on U.S. policy toward Bosnia which delved into charges that the Clinton administration tacitly allowed Iran to ship arms to Bosnia via Croatia. Unfortunately, there were more serious questions raised during the course of that hearing than were answered by administration representatives.  As the House sponsor of a bipartisan effort to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia, I am extremely concerned about the implications and consequences of such a policy should these allegations indeed be substantiated. It is ironic that President Clinton apparently was willing to turn a blind eye toward Iran while blocking a majority in the Congress--a bipartisan majority--that called for the United States--not Iran--to take the lead in upholding Bosnia's legitimate and fundamental right to defend itself.  Should the Bosnians have been given the means to defend themselves in the face of aggression and genocide? Absolutely. Should those arms have come from Iran? Absolutely not.  In the past few years, Members from both sides of the aisle put aside their differences to respond to the senseless slaughter of innocent civilians by well-armed Serb militants in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Repeatedly we raised our voices calling upon the President to display determined U.S. leadership in the face of aggression and genocide. These calls were repeatedly rebuffed. When we voted in overwhelming support to lift the arms embargo, we were told by the White House that such an action was not in the interest of the United States as it would lead to an ``Americanization'' of the conflict, result in the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops, and undermine the U.S. Security Council.  Mr. Speaker, when all is said and done, the fundamental issue at stake here--as in so many other instances--is one of leadership.  For nearly 3 years the Clinton administration, like the one before it, largely passed the buck on Bosnia. The Europeans, for their part, raised the specter of Islamic fundamentalism as an excuse for inaction. Mr. Speaker, it is inexplicable how turning a blind eye toward Iran--a terrorist state--was in the interest of the United States.  Regrettably, the international community and the United States refused to undertake meaningful action themselves to end the genocide or to provide the Bosnians with the means to defend themselves. By default at best, and with U.S. acquiescence at worst, Teheran was allowed to fill in the gap resulting from the failure of the Clinton administration to act and to lead. By turning a blind eye in this instance, President Clinton has unwittingly strengthened a small nationalist minority in Bosnia at the expense of those truly committed to the preservation of a multiethnic state; damaged our position in the United Nations; and potentially expose the 20,000 American troops he ordered to Bosnia to even greater danger.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the House leadership for pursuing this matter given its implications for U.S. interests in the Balkans and beyond.                          ____________________
