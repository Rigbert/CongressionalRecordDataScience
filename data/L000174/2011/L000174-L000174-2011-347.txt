President, I am disappointed that we have not been able to work out an agreement that will allow consideration of my amendment to the pending USA PATRIOT Act sunset extension legislation. I think that a bipartisan majority of the Senate would have supported our improvements. We have missed an opportunity to move forward to help keep our Nation secure while also strengthening our commitment to our core constitutional principles of individual liberty and privacy.
