Speaker, if the gentlewoman will engage in a colloquy to answer a question, the gentlewoman heard my representation. The chairman of the Committee on House Oversight, which you say is public, has indicated ours is simply a ministerial function; that the vote essentially is taken,that is true, and, because this committee is a 2 to 1 committee, the majority party always prevails.  Is the gentlewoman aware of the fact that apparently the chairman believes this is a decision of the Speaker, and has articulated that on the record, and that the vote is simply a pro forma?
