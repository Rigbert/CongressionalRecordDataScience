President, I would like to take this time to commemorate the 60th birthday of the Vermont Electric Cooperative. Beginning on that April day in 1939 when the co-op first brought electricity to a family farm in Eden, they have provided an indispensable service to generations of Vermonters who were missing out on the conveniences of electricity.  Mr. President, I ask that a short retrospective about the co-op which recently appeared in their newsletter be printed in the Record.  The material follows:                Happy Birthday Co-op!!--a Retrospective       Studying by lantern light, milking cows by hand, cutting      blocks of river ice for refrigeration--life in Colonial      America, perhaps?       In rural Vermont, this way of life was not so long ago and      there are plenty of Co-op members who remember all too well      those days before Vermont's Governor George Aiken pioneered      the federal legislation that spawned the birth of Vermont      Electric Cooperative.       This year, the Co-op celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of      its creation which brought to rural residents of Vermont the      conveniences of electricity which many Americans had been      enjoying for years.       More than anyone, Vermont's farmers looked forward to the      day when the power poles would march down the road to their      own barns and houses. Harold Putnam, of Cambridge, was one of      them.       ``Some of our neighbors closer to town were already on CVPS      and we were very anxious to get electricity to the barn and      the house. The gas lanterns we were using in the barn were      kind of dangerous, the gas-powered milking system didn't      always work and it was hard to keep things clean without a      constant supply of hot water.''       The Putnam farmhouse had running water from a spring by the      kitchen door to keep food cool. Harold's mother, Maybelle,      was especially looking forward to the day when the barn would      have its own hot water tank and the endless parade of milking      equipment through the kitchen to her sink would finally end,      recalled Harold's wife, Lois.       The Putnams relied on a gravity-fed system to bring cold      spring water into a tank in the barn which held milk cans.      Until the late 1930's, the Putnams, like many farmers in      Vermont, sold their cream to a local creamery. The Putnams      worked with the Cloverdale Creamery in Westford on Route 15,      where the Burlington and Lamoille Railroad had been stopping      since 1887. The cream was then shipped to Hartford,      Connecticut. The skimmed milk was fed to pigs and the family      sold pork. Just before the advent of VEC, the Putnams began      shipping fluid milk, which required not just the cool spring      water, but also a steady supply of ice.       ``We bought our ice from a neighbor who cut ice under the      Cambridge covered bridge (the long bridge now at the      Shelburne, Museum) or at Halfmoon Pond in Fletcher,'' Mr.      Putnam explained.       For the Putnams, switching to electricity was a fairly      simple matter: their barn was already equipped with a milk      pump that had been powered by the unreliable gas-powered      system. They wired just half the house at first to save      money.       Mr. Putnam took on the task of helping to secure easements      for the new Co-op line from the CVPS substation, then at the      junction of routes 15 and 104 in Cambridge, out to Poker Hill      Road in Underhill.       Twenty-five miles away from Cambridge, Evelyn and Ernest      Earle were milking 20 cows by hand in Eden where the entire      town was without electricity.       The Earles moved to their current home, just off route 118      between Eden and Belvidere, a year or so after they were      married in 1940. It had been the first house in Eden on the      Co-op's very first power line, and Mr. Earle was part of the      crew that dug the holes for the poles to carry that first      line in 1939.       The line that supplied power to what is now the Earle's      home originated at the first substation built specifically to      serve the Co-op. The house still has the wall brackets which      held the gas lamps. Most houses had a large table lamp as      well with several mantles that maximized the output of the      lamp, easily brightening up an entire room, Mrs. Earle said.       Richard Parker and his brother Henry, who grew up in      Lowell, wired many of the buildings served by the Co-op,      including those owned by both the Putnams and the Earles, and      were later long-time Co-op employees.       Richard Parker, then 21, remembers the day Governor Aiken      came to Eden and turned on the lights for the first VEC line.      The inaugural line ran from the new Eden substation through      the villages of Eden and Eden Mills, where the first Co-op      office was located, to Lowell.       ``It was quite a gathering--40 or 50 people. The Co-op had      tested the lines before-hand to make sure the lights were all      working. Governor Aiken threw the switch and the Co-op was in      business.''       It was a warm, sunny day in April 1939. It had taken less      than a year from the creation of the Co-op to the      construction of the first substation and transmission      line.                          ____________________
