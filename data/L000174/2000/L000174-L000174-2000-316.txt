President, a few months ago, I came to this floor to draw attention to a growing national crisis in the administration of capital punishment and to suggest some solutions. You will recall some of the shocking facts I described:       For every 7 people executed, 1 death row inmate is shown      some time after conviction to be innocent of the crime.       Many of those exonerated have come within hours of being      executed, and many have spent a decade or more in jail before      they were given a fair opportunity to establish their      innocence.       Capital defendants are frequently represented by lawyers      who lack the funds or the competence to do the job, or who      have been disbarred or suspended for misconduct, and, from      time to time, by lawyers who sleep through the trial, but the      courts turn a blind eye.       Inexpensive and practically foolproof means of proving      innocence are often denied to defendants.  The saddest fact of all, to me, is that the society facing this crisis is not a medieval one; it is America, today, in the 21st Century. As the Governor of Illinois told us when he placed a moratorium on the death penalty in his State earlier this year, something urgently needs to be done to remedy this situation. That is why I have been talking with Senators on both sides of the aisle and all sides of the capital punishment debate. That is why I have been searching for ways to reduce the risk of mistaken executions.  That is why I am so pleased that today, with my good friend, the juniorSenator from Oregon (Senator Gordon Smith), we are introducing the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act of 2000. This bill is a carefully crafted package of criminal justice reforms designed to protect the innocent and to ensure that if the death penalty is imposed, it is the result of informed and reasoned deliberation, not politics, luck, bias or guesswork.  Every American child is taught that justice is blind. It is important to remember what justice is supposed to be blind to. Justice should never be blind to the truth, it should never be blind to the evidence, and it should never be blind to the teachings of modern science. What justice should be blind to is ideology, politics, race and money.  Too often in this chamber, we find ourselves dividing along party or ideological lines. The bill that Senator Smith and I are introducing today is not about that, and it is not about whether in the abstract, you favor or disfavor the death penalty. It is about what kind of society we want America to be in the 21st Century.  I am optimistic about America's future. I have become all the more optimistic in the past few months as I have seen an outpouring of support across the political spectrum and across the country for common-sense measures to reduce the risk of executing the innocent.  Today, Senator Smith and I are joined by Senators from both sides of the aisle, by some who support capital punishment and by others who oppose it. On the Republican side, I want to thank my friend Senator Susan Collins of Maine and my fellow Vermonter, Senator Jim Jeffords. On the Democratic side, Senators Levin, Feingold, Moynihan, Akaka, Kerrey, and Wellstone. I also want to thank our House sponsors William Delahunt and Ray LaHood, along with their 39 cosponsors, both Democratic and Republican. Here on Capitol Hill it is our job to represent Americans. The scores of legislators who have sponsored this legislation clearly do represent Americans, both in their diversity and in their readiness to work together for common-sense solutions.  The outpouring of bipartisan support we have seen in Congress reflects an emerging public consensus. Opinion polls show Americans divided on the death penalty in the abstract. But they show overwhelmingly that Americans will not tolerate the execution of innocent people, and that Americans expect their justice system to provide everyone with a fair trial and a competent lawyer. A recent Gallup Poll found that 92 percent of Americans believe that people convicted before modern advances in DNA technology should be given the opportunity to obtain DNA testing if such tests might show their innocence.  I am also encouraged by the growing chorus of calls for reform of our capital punishment system by criminal justice experts and respected opinion leaders nationwide. George Will wrote in a April 6th column that ``skepticism is in order'' when it comes to capital punishment. Another conservative columnist, Bruce Fein, wrote in The Washington Times on April 25th:       A decent respect for life . . . demands scrupulous concern      for the reliability of verdicts in capital punishment trials.      Otherwise, the death penalty game is not worth the gamble of      executing the innocent--a shameful stain on any system of      justice--and life sentences (perhaps in solitary confinement)      should be the maximum.       Mr. Fein writes as one who served as a senior Justice      Department official in the Reagan Administration.  More recently, on May 11th, the Constitution Project at Georgetown University Law Center established a blue-ribbon National Committee to Prevent Wrongful Executions, comprised of supporters and opponents of the death penalty, Democrats and Republicans, including six former State and Federal judges, a former U.S. Attorney, two former State Attorneys General, and a former Director of the FBI. According to its mission statement, this Committee is ``united in [its] profound concern that, in recent years, and around the country, procedural safeguards and other assurances of fundamental fairness in the administration of capital punishment have been significantly diminished.'' Many of the concerns that the Committee has raised are addressed in the legislation that Senator Smith and I are introducing today.  Just yesterday, the editors of The Washington Times noted that ``the increased use of DNA analysis has in fact revealed some serious flaws in the way the justice system exacts the supreme penalty,'' and succinctly expressed the common sense view of nine out of ten Americans and the basic point that underlies our legislation: ``Surely no one could reasonably object to making sure we execute only the guilty.''  I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Times editorial be included in the Record at this point, together with the articles by George Will and Bruce Fein, and editorials dated February 19 and 28 from the New York Times and The Washington Post, both praising the Innocence Protection Act.  As I describe some of the major reforms proposed by our legislation, I ask you to consider these issues from the perspective of a capital juror, an ordinary citizen who is asked by his government to do one of the toughest things a citizen can do: sit in judgment on another person's life. You would not want to make the wrong decision. You would want the process to work so that you could make the right decision.  We need to enact real reforms to combat the very real risk in America today that an innocent person is being executed. I will now describe some of the major reforms proposed by our legislation.  More than any other development, improvements in DNA testing have provided the critical evidence to exonerate innocent people. In the last decade, scores of wrongfully convicted people have been released from prison--including many from death row--after DNA testing proved they could not have committed the crime for which they were convicted. In some cases the same DNA testing that vindicated the innocent helped catch the guilty.  As I already mentioned, 92 percent of Americans agree that we need to make DNA testing available in every appropriate case. But this legislation is not about public opinion polls--it is about saving innocent lives.  A few months ago, I met Kirk Bloodsworth, a former Marine who was convicted and sentenced to death in Maryland for a crime that he did not commit. Nine years later, DNA testing conclusively established his innocence.  On the same day, I met Clyde Charles. He spent 9 years pleading with the State of Louisiana for the DNA testing that eventually exonerated him. He missed the childhood of his daughter, he contracted diabetes and tuberculosis while in prison, and both of his parents died before his release.  Just last Wednesday, the Governor of Texas pardoned A.B. Butler, who served 17 years of a 99-year sentence for a sexual assault that he did not commit before he was finally cleared by DNA testing. Butler spent 10 years trying to have DNA testing done in his case.  One day later, the Governor of Virginia ordered new DNA testing for Earl Washington, a retarded man convicted of a rape-murder in 1982.  There are still significant numbers of convicted men and women in prisons throughout the country whose trials preceded modern DNA testing. If history is any guide, then some of these individuals are innocent of any crime.  If DNA testing can help establish innocence, there is no reason to deny testing, and every reason to grant it. This is not about guilty people trying to get off on legal technicalities. This is about innocent people trying to prove their innocence--and being thwarted by legal technicalities. Our bill will allow retroactive tests for people tried before DNA technology was available to them, and eliminate the procedural bars that may prevent the introduction of new, exculpatory DNA evidence. Our bill will also ensure that inmates are notified before a State destroys a rape kit or other biological evidence that may, through DNA testing, prove that an inmate was wrongfully convicted.  What possible reason could there be to deny people access to the evidence--often the only evidence--that could prove their innocence? Now that we have DNA fingerprinting that can prove a person's innocence, why should we as a society be willfully blind to the truth?  The sole argument I have heard advanced against the Leahy-Smith proposal is that it is somehow overly broad. As best I can understand this objection, the point seems to be that insome cases, DNA evidence will only confirm the jury's guilty verdict. That is the point that Virginia prosecutors have advanced in opposing DNA testing for death row inmate Derek Barnabei. But as the Washington Post pointed out in a March 20th editorial about the Barnabei case, the possibility that DNA testing will confirm an inmate's guilt is no reason to deny testing:       It is hard to see why a state, before putting someone to      death, would be unwilling to demonstrate a jury verdict's      consistency with all of the evidence. Indeed, this is      precisely the type of case in which the state should have no      choice. Under [the Innocence Protection Act], states would be      obligated in such circumstances to allow post-conviction DNA      testing. Such a law would not merely offer a layer of      protection to innocent people but would increase public      confidence in the convictions of guilty people.  I am grateful for the Post's endorsement.  As the Post has pointed out, this is a common sense reform. As opinion polls have shown, the idea of ensuring DNA testing is available in appropriate cases enjoys the support of the vast majority of Americans. And as the recent cases that I have discussed make clear, this is a matter of national urgency. I hope we can move forward expeditiously.  Post-conviction DNA testing is an essential safeguard that can save innocent lives when the trial process has failed to uncover the truth. As the Governor of New York has recognized, DNA testing also serves as a window into the systemic flaws of our capital punishment apparatus. In May, Governor Pataki proposed the creation of a panel to investigate the facts behind DNA exonerations and to determine what went wrong.  When DNA uncovers one miscarriage of justice after another, it is neither just nor sensible to stop at making post-conviction DNA testing more available. It is unjust because innocent people should not have to wait for years after trial to be exonerated and freed. It is not sensible because society should not have to wait for years to know the truth. When dozens of innocent people are being sentenced to death, and dozens of guilty people are working free because the State has convicted the wrong person, we must ask ourselves what went wrong in the trial process, and we must take what steps we can to make sure it does not happen again.  There is a recurring theme in wrongful conviction cases--incompetent and grossly underpaid defense counsel. That theme is well illustrated by the case of Federico Macias. He spent nine years on Texas's death row and came within two days of execution because his trial lawyer did almost nothing to prepare for trial. No doubt, being paid less than $12 an hour was a disincentive for the lawyer to conduct a more thorough investigation.  This lawyer failed to call available witnesses who could have refuted the State's case, and based his trial decisions on a fundamental misunderstanding of Texas law. The lawyer also admitted he did no investigation at all for the sentencing phase. His only preparation was to speak to his client and his client's wife during the lunch break of the sentencing proceeding.  Macias was eventually cleared of all charges and released from prison, thanks to volunteer work by a Washington lawyer who intervened just before the scheduled execution. Here is what the Federal Court of Appeals had to say when it overturned Macias's conviction:       We are left with the firm conviction that Macias was denied      his constitutional right to adequate counsel in a capital      case in which actual innocence was a close question. The      state paid defense counsel $11.84 per hour. Unfortunately,      the justice system got only what it paid for.  Federico Macias's case was not unique. In the Texas criminal justice system, there is a whole category of capital cases known as the sleeping lawyer cases, to which the majority of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has responded with apathy. This attitude was chillingly conveyed by one Texas judge who reasoned that, while the Constitution requires a defendant to be represented by a lawyer, it ``doesn't say the lawyer has to be awake.''  But this is not just a Texas problem, this is a nationwide problem. In case after case across the country, capital defendants have found their lives placed in the hands of lawyers who are hopelessly incompetent--lawyers who were drunk during the trial; lawyers who never bothered to investigate the case or even meet with their client before trial; and lawyers who were suspended or disbarred.  Oklahoma spent all of $3,200 on the defense of Ronald Keith Williamson; it got what it paid for when Williamson's lawyer failed to investigate and present to the jury a simple fact--the fact that another man had confessed to the murder. Both Williamson and his codefendant were eventually cleared of any crime.  In Illinois, Dennis Williams was defended by a lawyer who was simultaneously defending himself in disbarment proceedings. Williams was eventually exonerated in 1996, after 18 years on death row, with the help of three journalism students from Northwestern University.  That is not how the American adversarial system of criminal justice is meant to work. Americans on trial for their lives should not be condemned to rely on sleeping lawyers, drunk lawyers, disbarred lawyers, or lawyers who do not have the resources to do the job. In our society, lawyers and journalists both serve important fact-finding functions. But, as one of the Northwestern University journalism students so aptly said after proving the innocence of yet another death row inmate, Anthony Porter, ``Twenty-one-year-olds are not supposed to be responsible for finding the innocent people on death row.''  The need for competent and adequately funded lawyers to make our adversarial system work is not a novel insight, and the lack of such lawyers and funding is not a novel discovery. In 1991, Retired Chief Justice Harold Clarke of Georgia told the Georgia State Bar that:       Providing lawyers for poor people accused of crimes is a      state obligation. The Constitution teaches us that. But more      important, common sense and human decency tell us that. Yet      we haven't listened to those voices.  In repeated resolutions dating back to the 1980s, the Conference of Chief Justices has urged States to do more to ensure that capital defendants are provided quality representation. In 1995, for example, the Chief Justices resolved that each State should ``establish standards and a process that will assure the timely appointment of competent counsel, with adequate resources, to represent defendants in capital cases at each stage of such proceedings.''  As we enter the 21st century, a few States have heeded this advice. But many are still not listening to the voices of the people who know first hand what a mockery incompetent and underfunded defense lawyers can make of our criminal justice system. I have described two cases, from Texas and Oklahoma, in which the State grossly underfunded appointed counsel and got what it paid for. There are many more examples, including an Alabama case within the past year in which the court, after a full trial, limited the fee for investigating and defending against a charge of capital murder to about $4,000. After paying his investigator and paralegal, the lawyer pocketed $1,212, which worked out to $5.05 an hour--less than the minimum wage.  We should not sit back and rely on 21-year-old journalism students to save innocent people from execution. And a quarter of a century of experience with the death penalty since the Supreme Court restored it in 1976 teaches us that we cannot sit back and rely on the States to provide adequate counsel to those whom they seek to execute.  We in Congress can never guarantee that the innocent will not be convicted. But we have a responsibility, at a minimum, to ensure that when people in this country are on trial for their lives, they will be defended by lawyers who meet reasonable minimum standards of competence and who have sufficient funds to investigate the facts and prepare thoroughly for trial. That goal can be achieved by cooperation between the States and the Federal Government whereby we give the States money to fund their criminal justice systems conditioned on their meeting a floor of minimum standards, and leave the States free to improve on those standards if they are so inclined. That is what our bill seeks to achieve.  What do we owe to the innocent people who are able to win their releasefrom prison? How do we compensate them for all the years they spent behind bars, sometimes on death row, for all the lost wages, for all the pain and suffering. In most cases, there is no compensation, or at least not much. Federal law provides a miserly $5,000 in cases of unjust imprisonment, regardless of the time served. In the case of Clyde Charles, who spent 18 years in Louisiana's Angola prison, that would come out to about 75 cents a day. Is that what society owes to Clyde Charles, for the walls placed between him and his family for 18 years, for missing his daughter's childhood, and for the diabetes and tuberculosis he contracted in prison? Does that seem about right--75 cents a day?  How about nothing at all? In 36 States, people who have been unjustly convicted and incarcerated for crimes they did not commit are barred from recovering any damages against the State. Louisiana, which destroyed the life of Clyde Charles, has no compensation statute. The States that have compensation statutes generally put a cap on payments, although none sets the cap as low as the current Federal cap of $5,000.  Let us step back and put this situation in perspective. A few years ago, a Maryland jury found that three young men had been falsely imprisoned by a security guard at an Eddie Bauer clothing store. The guard detained these men for about 10 minutes on suspicion of shoplifting, and forced one of them to remove his shirt. How much did the jury award for those 10 minutes of false imprisonment? $1 million.  Now compare what happened to Walter McMillian. In 1986, in a small town in Alabama, an 18-year-old white woman was shot to death. Walter McMillian was a black man who lived in the next town. From the day of his arrest, McMillian was placed on death row. No physical evidence linked him to the crime, and several people testified at the trial that he could not have committed the murder because he was with them all day. All three witnesses who connected McMillian with the murder later recanted their testimony. The one supposed ``eyewitness'' said that prosecutors had pressured him to implicate McMillian in the crime.  The jury in the trial recommended a life sentence, but the judge overruled this recommendation and sentenced McMillian to death. His case went through four rounds of appeal, all of which were denied. New attorneys, not paid by the State of Alabama, voluntarily took over the case and eventually found that the prosecutors had illegally withheld exculpatory evidence. A story about the case appeared on 60 Minutes in November 1992. Finally, the State agreed to investigate its earlier handling of the case and admitted that a grave mistake had been made. McMillian was freed into the welcoming arms of his family and friends on March 3, 1993.  Despite many years of litigation, McMillian has never been given any recompense for the years he was unjustly held on death row. His attorney has taken the issue of just compensation all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but to no avail.  Let us take another example in another State. In Oklahoma, 4 inmates have been exonerated by DNA testing over the past few years. When you add it up, they spent about 40 years in prison. Two of them were on death row. One came within 5 days of execution. None has received compensation--not a dime.  Putting one's life back together after such an experience is difficult enough, even with financial support. Without such support, a wrongly convicted person might never be able to establish roots that would allow him to contribute to society.  We need to do more to help repair the lives that are shattered by wrongful convictions. The Innocence Protection Act does this by raising the Federal cap on compensation, and by pushing the States to provide meaningful compensation to any person who is unjustly convicted and sentenced to death.  Money damages will never compensate for the mental anguish of being falsely convicted, for the lost years, or for the day-to-day brutality and deprivations of prison. But we must do what we can. Society owes a moral debt to the wrongfully imprisoned; that debt should be paid.  Finally, we as a Nation need to go back to first principles when it comes to deciding who is eligible for the death penalty. The United States stands alongside Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as the only nations still executing people for crimes committed as juveniles. Is this the company that we want to keep?  The execution of juvenile offenders is also barred by several major human rights treaties, including the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights--perhaps the most important human rights documents in the world today. As a leader in the human rights community, it would be fitting if the United States agreed to respect the precepts of international humans rights law and comply with the terms of these treaties.  This country should also stop executing the mentally retarded. People with mental retardation have a diminished capacity to understand right from wrong. They are more prone to confess to crimes they did not commit simply to please their interrogators, and they are often unable to assist their lawyer in preparing a defense. Executing them is wrong; it is immoral. In addition, the execution of the mentally retarded, like the execution of juvenile offenders, severely damages U.S. standing in the international community.  Today, 13 States with capital punishment forbid the execution of defendants with mental retardation. The State Senator who sponsored the Nebraska bill in 1998 later said that it should not have been necessary because ``no civilized, mature society would ever entertain the possibility of executing anybody who was mentally retarded.''  The legislation that I introduce today proposes that the United States Congress speak as the conscience of the Nation in condemning the continued execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded.  There can be no longer be any question that our capital punishment system is in crisis. The Innocence Protection Act is the absolute minimum we must do to prevent and catch these mistakes and to restore the public's confidence in our criminal justice system.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a summary of the bill, and additional material be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2690       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing      (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged      as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying     criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene.       (2) Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can,      in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence      of a criminal defendant. In other cases, DNA testing may not      conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have      significant probative value to a finder of fact.       (3) While DNA testing is increasingly commonplace in      pretrial investigations today, it was not widely available in      cases tried prior to 1994. Moreover, new forensic DNA testing      procedures have made it possible to get results from minute      samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain      more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of      forensic DNA testing could produce. Consequently, in some      cases convicted inmates have been exonerated by new DNA tests      after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results.       (4) Since DNA testing is often feasible on relevant      biological material that is decades old, it can, in some      circumstances, prove that a conviction that predated the      development of DNA testing was based upon incorrect factual      findings. Uniquely, DNA evidence showing innocence, produced      decades after a conviction, provides a more reliable basis      for establishing a correct verdict than any evidence      proffered at the original trial. DNA testing, therefore, can      and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of      innocent men and women.       (5) In the past decade, there have been more than 65 post-     conviction exonerations in the United States and Canada based      upon DNA testing. At least 8 individuals sentenced to death      have been exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing,      some of whom came within days of being executed.       (6) The 2 States that have established statutory processes      for post-conviction DNA testing, Illinois and New York, have      the most post-conviction DNA exonerations, 14 and 7,      respectively.       (7) The advent of DNA testing raises serious concerns      regarding the prevalence of wrongful convictions, especially      wrongful convictions arising out of mistaken eyewitness      identification testimony. According to a 1996 Department of      Justice study entitled ``Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by      Science: Case Studies of Post-Conviction DNA Exonerations'',      in approximately 20 to 30 percent of the cases referred for      DNA testing, the results excluded the primary suspect.      Without DNA testing, many of these individuals might have      been wrongfully convicted.       (8) Laws in more than 30 States require that a motion for a      new trial based on newly discovered evidence of innocence be      filed within 6 months or less. These laws are premised on the      belief--inapplicable to DNA testing--that evidence becomes      less reliable over time. Such time limits have been used to      deny inmates access to DNA testing, even when guilt or      innocence could be conclusively established by such testing.      For example, in Dedge v. Florida, 723 So.2d 322 (Fla. Dist.      Ct. App. 1998), the court without opinion affirmed the denial      of a motion to release trial evidence for the purpose of DNA      testing. The trial court denied the motion as procedurally      barred under the 2-year limitation on claims of newly      discovered evidence established by the State of Florida,      which has since adopted a 6-month limitation on such claims.       (9) Even when DNA testing has been done and has      persuasively demonstrated the actual innocence of an inmate,      States have sometimes relied on time limits and other      procedural barriers to deny release.       (10) The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence,      a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and      comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific      experts, has issued a report entitled ``Recommendations For      Handling Post-Conviction DNA Applications'' that urges post-     conviction DNA testing in 2 carefully defined categories of      cases, notwithstanding procedural rules that could be invoked      to preclude such testing, and notwithstanding the inability      of the inmate to pay for the testing.       (11) The number of cases in which post-conviction DNA      testing is appropriate is relatively small and will decrease      as pretrial testing becomes more common and accessible.       (12) The cost of DNA testing has also decreased in recent      years. The typical case, involving the analysis of 8 samples,      currently costs between $2,400 and $5,000, depending upon      jurisdictional differences in personnel costs.       (13) In 1994, Congress authorized funding to improve the      quality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement      identification purposes. Since then, States have been awarded      over $50,000,000 in DNA-related grants.       (14) Although the Supreme Court has never announced a      standard for addressing constitutional claims of innocence,      in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority of the      Court expressed the view that, ``a truly persuasive      demonstration of `actual innocence' '' made after trial would      render imposition of punishment by a State unconstitutional.       (15) If biological material is not subjected to DNA testing      in appropriate cases, there is a significant risk that      persuasive evidence of innocence will not be detected and,      accordingly, that innocent persons will be unconstitutionally      incarcerated or executed.       (16) To prevent violations of the Constitution of the      United States that the Supreme Court anticipated in Herrera      v. Collins, it is necessary and proper to enact national      legislation that ensures that the Federal Government and the      States will permit DNA testing in appropriate cases.       (17) There is also a compelling need to ensure the      preservation of biological material for post-conviction DNA      testing. Since 1992, the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N.      Cardozo School of Law has received thousands of letters from      inmates who claim that DNA testing could prove them innocent.      In over 70 percent of those cases in which DNA testing could      have been dispositive of guilt or innocence if the biological      material were available, the material had been destroyed or      lost. In two-thirds of the cases in which the evidence was      found, and DNA testing conducted, the results have exonerated      the inmate.       (18) In at least 14 cases, post-conviction DNA testing that      has exonerated a wrongly convicted person has also provided      evidence leading to the apprehension of the actual      perpetrator, thereby enhancing public safety. This would not      have been possible if the biological evidence had been      destroyed.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--       (1) substantially implement the Recommendations of the      National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence in the      Federal criminal justice system, by ensuring the availability      of DNA testing in appropriate cases;       (2) prevent the imposition of unconstitutional punishments      through the exercise of power granted by clause 1 of section      8 and clause 2 of section 9 of article I of the Constitution      of the United States and section 5 of the 14th amendment to      the Constitution of the United States; and       (3) ensure that wrongfully convicted persons have an      opportunity to establish their innocence through DNA testing,      by requiring the preservation of DNA evidence for a limited      period.

Accommodation of State interests; certification        requirement       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, the Government shall not seek the death penalty in any      case initially brought before a district court of the United      States that sits in a State that does not prescribe,      authorize, or permit the imposition of such penalty for the      alleged conduct, except upon the certification in writing of      the Attorney General or the designee of the Attorney General      that--       ``(1) the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to      assume jurisdiction over the defendant with respect to the      alleged conduct;       ``(2) the State has requested that the Federal Government      assume jurisdiction; or       ``(3) the offense charged is an offense described in      section 32, 229, 351, 794, 1091, 1114, 1118, 1203, 1751,      1992, 2340A, or 2381, or chapter 113B.       ``(b) ``State Defined.--In this section, the term `State'      means each of the several States of the United States, the      District of Columbia, and the territories and possessions of      the United States.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for      chapter 228 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      adding at the end the following:``3599.

Section 408(l) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      848(l)), is amended by striking the first 2 sentences and      inserting the following: ``Upon a recommendation under      subsection (k) that the defendant should be sentenced to      death or life imprisonment without possibility of release,      the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly.      Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser sentence that is      authorized by law.''.     SEC. 403. RIGHT TO AN INFORMED JURY.       (a) Additional Requirements.--Section 20105 of the Violent      Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C.      13705) is amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting      the following:       ``(b) Additional Requirements.--To be eligible to receive a      grant under section 20103 or 20104, a State shall provide      assurances to the Attorney General that--       ``(1) the State has implemented policies that provide for      the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims; and       ``(2) in any capital case in which the jury has a role in      determining the sentence imposed on the defendant, the court,      at the request of the defendant, shall inform the jury of all      statutorily authorized sentencing options in the particular      case, including applicable parole eligibility rules and      terms.''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply with respect to any application for a grant under      section 20103 or 20104 of the Violent Crime Control and Law      Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13703; 13704) that is      submitted on or after the date that is 1 year after the date      of enactment of this Act.     SEC. 404. ANNUAL REPORTS.       (a) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney      General shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report      concerning the administration of capital punishment laws by      the Federal Government and the States.       (b) Report Elements.--The report required under subsection      (a) shall include substantially the same categories of      information as are included in the Bureau of Justice      Statistics Bulletin entitled ``Capital Punishment 1998''      (December 1999, NCJ 179012), and the following additional      categories of information:       (1) The percentage of death-eligible cases in which a death      sentence is sought, and the percentage in which it is      imposed.

SEC. 405. DISCRETIONARY APPELLATE REVIEW.       Section 2254(c) of title 28, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(c)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), if the highest court      of a State has discretion to decline appellate review of a      case or a claim, a petition asking that court to entertain a      case or a claim is not an available State court procedure.''.     SEC. 406. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE EXECUTION OF                    JUVENILE OFFENDERS AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED.       It is the sense of Congress that the death penalty is      disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of      decency when applied to a person who is mentally retarded or      who had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of the      offense.                                  ____      Innocence Protection Act of 2000--Section-by-Section Summary                                overview       The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 is a comprehensive      package of criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing the      risk that innocent persons may be executed. Most urgently,      the bill would (1) ensure that convicted offenders are      afforded an opportunity to prove their innocence through DNA      testing; (2) help States to provide competent legal services      at every stage of a death penalty prosecution; (3) enable      those who can prove their innocence to recover some measure      of compensation for their unjust incarceration; and (4)      provide the public with more reliable and detailed      information regarding the administration of the nation's      capital punishment laws.   title I--exonerating the innocent through federal post-conviction                                  review       Sec. 101. Findings and purposes. Legislative findings and      purposes in support of this title.       Sec. 102. DNA testing in Federal criminal justice system.      Establishes rules and procedures governing applications for      DNA testing by convicted offenders in the Federal system. An      applicant must allege that evidence to be tested (1) is      related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in      the applicant's conviction; (2) is in the government's actual      or constructive possession; and (3) was not previously      subjected to DNA testing, or to the form of DNA testing now      requested. The court may, in its discretion, appoint counsel      for an indigent applicant.       Because access to DNA testing is of no value unless      evidence containing DNA has been preserved, this section also      prohibits the government from destroying any biological      material in a criminal case while any person remains      incarcerated in connection with that case, unless such person      is notified of the government's intent to destroy the      material, and afforded at least 90 days to request DNA      testing under this title.       Sec. 103. DNA testing in State criminal justice system.      Conditions receipt of Federal grants for DNA-related programs      on an assurance that the State will adopt adequate procedures      for preserving biological material and making DNA testing      available to its inmates.       Sec. 104. Prohibition pursuant to section 5 of the 14th      amendment. Prohibits States from (1) denying requests for DNA      testing that could produce new exculpatory evidence or (2)      denying inmates a meaningful opportunity to prove their      innocence using the results of DNA testing. Creates an      authority to sue for declaratory or injunctive relief to      enforce these prohibitions.      title ii--ensuring competent legal services in capital cases       Sec. 201. Amendments to Byrne grant programs. Conditions      Federal funding under the Byrne grant programs--when such      funding equals or exceeds an amount that is $50 million      greater than the amount appropriated for such programs in FY      2000--on certification that the State has established and      maintains an ``effective system'' for providing competent      legal services to indigent defendants at every stage of death      penalty prosecution, from pre-trial proceedings through post-     conviction review. The Director of the Administrative Office      of the United States Courts is charged with specifying the      elements of an ``effective system,'' which must include a      centralized and independent authority for appointing      attorneys in capital cases, and adequate compensation and      reimbursement of such attorneys.       Sec. 202. Effect on procedural default rules. Provides that      certain procedural barriers to Federal habeas corpus review      shall not apply if the State failed to provide the petitioner      with adequate legal services.       Sec. 203. Capital representation grants. Amends the      Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A, to make more      Federal funding available to public agencies and private non-     profit organizations for purposes of enhancing     the availability and competence of counsel in capital cases,      encouraging the continuity of representation in such cases,      decreasing the cost of providing qualified death penalty      counsel, and increasing the efficiency with which capital      cases are resolved.             title iii--compensating the unjustly condemned       Sec. 301. Increased compensation in Federal cases. Raises      the total amount of damages that may be awarded against the      United States in cases of unjust imprisonment from $5,000 to      $50,000 a year in a non-death penalty case, or $100,000 a      year in a death penalty case. Identifies factors for court to      consider in assessing damages.       Sec. 302. Compensation in State death cases. Encourages      States to permit any person who was unjustly convicted and      sentenced to death to be awarded reasonable damages, upon      substantial proof of innocence and formal exoneration, by      adding a new condition for Federal funding to assist in      construction of correctional facility projects.                        title iv--miscellaneous       Sec. 401. Accommodation of State interests in Federal      death-penalty prosecutions. Protects the interests of States      (including the District of Columbia and any commonwealth,      territory or possession of the United States) by limiting the      Federal government's authority to seek the death penalty in      States that do not permit the imposition of such penalty.      Department of Justice guidelines provide that in cases of      concurrent jurisdiction, ``a Federal indictment for an      offense subject to the death penalty will be obtained only      when the Federal interest in the prosecution is more      substantial than the interests of the State or local      authorities.'' Section 401 builds on that principle by      requiring the Attorney General or her designee to certify      that (1) the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to      assume jurisdiction over the defendant; (2) the State has      requested that the Federal government assume jurisdiction; or      (3) the offense charged involves genocide; terrorism; use of      chemical weapons or weapons of mass-destruction; destruction      of aircraft, trains, or other instrumentalities or facilities      of interstate commerce; hostage taking; torture; espionage;      treason; the killing of certain high public officials; or      murder by a Federal prisoner.       Sec. 402. Alternative of life imprisonment without      possibility of release. Provides juries in Federal death      penalty prosecutions brought under the drug kingpin statute,      21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(l), the option of recommending life      imprisonment without possibility of release. This amendment      brings the drug kingpin statute into conformity with the more      recently-enacted death penalty procedures in title 18, which      govern most Federal death penalty prosecutions. See 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 3594.       Sec. 403. Right to an informed jury. Conditions Federal      truth-in-sentencing grants upon certification that, in any      capital case in which the jury has a role in determining the      defendant's sentence, the defendant has the right to have the      jury informed of all statutorily-authorized sentencing      options in the particular case, including applicable parole      eligibility rules and terms. The purpose is to give full      effect to the due process principles underlying the Supreme      Court's decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154      (1994), which held that a defendant who has been convicted of      a capital offense is entitled to an instruction informing the      sentencing jury that he is ineligible for parole under State      law.       Sec. 404. Annual reports. Directs the Justice Department to      prepare an annual report regarding the administration of the      nation's capital punishment laws. The report must be      submitted to Congress, distributed to the press and posted on      the Internet.       Sec. 405. Discretionary appellate review. Respects State      procedural rules by allowing Federal habeas corpus      petitioners to raise claims that State courts discouraged      them from raising when seeking discretionary review in the      State's highest court. Responds to the Supreme Court's      decision in O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 119 S. Ct. 1728 (1999),      which held that a State prisoner must present his claims to a      State supreme court in a petition for discretionary review in      order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C.      Sec. 2254(b)(1), (c).       Sec. 406. Sense of the Congress regarding the execution of      juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded. Expresses the      sense of the Congress that the death penalty is      disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of      decency when applied to juvenile offenders and the mentally      retarded.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, June 6, 2000]                         Thoughts on Executions       In his decision to halt Thursday evening's execution of a      convicted killer for a period of 30 days, Texas Gov. George      W. Bush did what had to be done. Where there is no shadow of      a doubt, the death penalty can sometimes be the right course      of action. Yet, where doubt, any doubt, remains, the      consequences are awesome. In the case of Ricky Nolan McGinn,      who was sentenced to death for raping and murdering his 13-     year-old stepdaughter in 1993, there seems to be some      uncertainty, in which case every means should be used to      establish the truth. When you take a man's life, you take      everything he's got. There simply is no way to make up for a      mistake made in the execution chamber.       Mr. Bush cannot be accused of being soft on criminals.      During his five and a half years in office, Mr. Bush has      presided over more executions than any other governor in the      country: 131, all told. Most famously, Mr. Bush refused to      reduce the sentence of Karla Faye Tucker in 1998. She had      been convicted of the particularly horrible execution-style      murder of two persons during a gas station robbery, and while      in prison had become a born-again Christian. Though religious      leaders such as Pat Robertson pleaded for her life, Mr. Bush      allowed the execution to go forward. The fact that he has      chosen to grant a 30-day reprieve in this one case can hardly      be said to indicate a change of heart on the death penalty.       Nevertheless, in the partisan heat of a presidential      election year, Mr. Bush has been accused of playing politics      with the death penalty. If this is the case, he is doing so      on the side of giving someone on death row a final chance.      This contrasts with Gov. Bill Clinton's decision to proceed      with the execution of a severely retarded Arkansas man during      the 1992 presidential election campaign, which was meant to      establish his tough-on-crime credentials.       But beyond the question of politics, there's science. Mr.      Bush is catching a nationwide movement, based on advances      that are making DNA testing increasingly sophisticated. The      increased use of DNA analysis has in fact revealed serious      flaws in the way the justice system exacts the supreme      penalty. The trend towards state moratoria on executions has      been led by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican. In      Illinois, during the course of the 23 years since the death      penalty was reinstated, a dozen persons have been put to      death--but 13 have been cleared of capital murder charges      through DNA testing after having been sentenced to death.      This is a stunning and sobering fact. Unless Illinois is      vastly different from the rest of the United States, that      statistic ought to produce second thoughts for everyone. (One      of those second thoughts might be that for every innocent man      executed, a guilty man is still out there, unpunished.)       We do not suggest here that the United States should stop      punishing the guilty to the fullest extent of the law, even      if that means death. However, if this country is to have the      death penalty, we must be as certain as is humanly possible      that executions are restricted to the guilty. States should      be encouraged to make sure that is the case. Even if 66      percent of Americans support the death penalty, it is no      argument to say (as some conservatives have done) that the      death of an innocent person here or there is not enough to      reconsider what we are doing. This argument has been put      forward by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Some have even argued that      this may be the price of the death penalty's deterrent      effect; Rep. Bill McCollum, Florida Republican, suggested as      much in an article for the Atlantic Monthly last year.       Perhaps the most cogent argument against the death penalty      is that it degrades the sensibilities of otherwise good and      reasonable men and women, who have come to believe in it so      obsessively that they would impose it on the innocent if that      is the only way to keep the death penalty in the law.       During a moratorium, the state would keep its electricity      and gas bills paid and its stockpiles of potassium chloride      intact against the day when the moratorium ends and      executions resume--presumably following improvements in the      way convictions are produced. Surely no one could reasonably      object to making sure we execute only the guilty.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 2000]                         Innocent On Death Row                          (By George F. Will)       ``Don't you worry about it,'' said the Oklahoma prosecutor      to the defense attorney. ``We're gonna needle your client.      You know, lethal injection, the needle. We're going to needle      Robert.''       Oklahoma almost did. Robert Miller spent nine years on      death row, during six of which the state had DNA test results      proving his sperm was not that of the man who raped and      killed the 92-year-old woman. The prosecutor said the tests      only proved that another man had been with Miller during the      crime. Finally, the weight of scientific evidence, wielded by      an implacable defense attorney, got Miller released and      another man indicted.       You could fill a book with such hair-curling true stories      of blighted lives and justice traduced. Three authors have      filled one. It should change the argument about capital      punishment and other aspects of the criminal justice system.      Conservatives, especially, should draw this lesson from the      book: Capital punishment, like the rest of the criminal      justice system, is a government program, so skepticism is in      order.       Horror, too, is a reasonable response to what Barry Scheck,      Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer demonstrate in ``Actual      Innocence: Five Days to Execution and Other Dispatches From      the Wrongly Convicted.'' You will not soon read a more      frightening book. It is a catalog of appalling miscarriages      of justice, some of them nearly lethal. Their cumulative      weight compels the conclusion that many innocent people are      in prison, and some innocent people have been executed.       Scheck and Neufeld (both members of O.J. Simpson's ``dream      team'' of defense attorneys) founded the pro-bono Innocence      Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York      to aid persons who convincingly claim to have been wrongly      convicted. Dwyer, winner of two Pulitzer Prizes,     is a columnist for the New York Daily News. Their book is a      heartbreaking and infuriating compendium of stories of lives      ruined by:       Forensic fraud, such as that by the medical examiner who,      in one death report, included the weight of the gallbladder      and spleen of a man from whom both organs had been surgically      removed long ago.       Mistaken identifications by eyewitnesses or victims, which      contributed to 84 percent of the convictions overturned by      the Innocence Project's DNA exonerations.       Criminal investigations, especially of the most heinous      crimes, that become ``echo chambers'' in which, because of      the normal human craving for retribution, the perceptions of      prosecutors and jurors are shaped by what they want to be      true. (The authors cite evidence that most juries will      convict even when admissions have been repudiated by the      defendant and contradicted by physical evidence.)       The sinnister culture of jailhouse snitches, who earn      reduced sentences by fabricating ``admissions'' by fellow      inmates to unsolved crimes.       Incompetent defense representation, such as that by the      Kentucky attorney in a capital case who gave his business      address as Kelly's Keg tavern.       The list of ways the criminal justice system misfires could      be extended, but some numbers tell the most serious story: In      the 24 years since the resumption of executions under Supreme      Court guidelines, about 620 have occurred, but 87 condemned      persons--one for every seven executed--had their convictions      vacated by exonerating evidence. In eight of these cases, and      in many more exonerations not involving death row inmates,      the evidence was from DNA.       One inescapable inference from these numbers is that some      of the 620 persons executed were innocent. Which is why,      after the exoneration of 13 prisoners on Illinois' death row      since 1987, for reasons including exculpatory DNA evidence,      Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, has imposed a moratorium on      executions.       Scheck, Neufeld and Dwyer note that when a plane crashes,      an intensive investigation is undertaken to locate the cause      and prevent recurrences. Why is there no comparable urgency      about demonstrable, multiplying failures in the criminal      justice system? They recommend many reforms, especially      pertaining to the use of DNA and the prevention of forensic      incompetence and fraud. Sen. Patrick Leahy's Innocence      Protection Act would enable inmates to get DNA testing      pertinent to a conviction or death sentence, and ensure that      courts will hear resulting evidence.       The good news is that science can increasingly serve the      defense of innocence. But there is other news.       Two powerful arguments for capital punishment are that it      saves lives, if its deterrence effect is not vitiated by      sporadic implementation, and it heightens society's valuation      of life by expressing proportionate anger at the taking of      life. But that valuation is lowered by careless or corrupt      administration of capital punishment, which ``Actual      Innocence'' powerfully suggests is intolerably common.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 25, 2000]                    Death Edict For the Guilty Only                             (By Bruce Fein)       Can reasonable people dispute that the government should      confine the death penalty to persons guilty of the crime      charged? And can reasonable people deny that the climbing      number of exonerations of death row inmates on the ground of      actual innocence creates chilling worries on that scores?       Those questions make both urgent and compelling enactment      of the cool-headed bill (S. 2071) by Sen. Patrick Leahy,      Vermont Democrat, to upgrade the reliability of verdicts in      capital cases.       Manifold reasons justify the death penalty (which the U.S.      Supreme Court has restricted to crimes of homicide):      retribution against offenders whose killings are earmarked by      shocking and barbaric wickedness, something akin to the Adolf      Eichmann example; to control prison inmates already laboring      under life sentences with no parole possibilities; to deter      the murder of police or crime witnesses in the hope of      escaping punishment of a lesser crime; and encouraging guilty      pleas contingent on cooperation with prosecutors in murder      conspiracy cases in exchange for a non-capital sentence.       Whether death sentences in general deter crime is hotly      disputed. but if they do, their effects would not even begin      to dent the crime problem.       A decent respect for life also demands scrupulous concern      for the reliability of verdicts in capital punishment trials.      Otherwise, the death penalty game is not worth the gamble of      executing the innocent--a shameful stain on any system of      Justice--and life sentences (perhaps in solitary confinement)      without parole should be the maximum.       The Leahy bill laudably aims to preserve the death penalty      by slashing the prevailing and highly worrisome risk of      executing the innocent through greater DNA testing and      competent defense counsel.       Unzip you ears to these facts. Since the Supreme Court in      1976 affirmed the constitutionality of the death penalty for      heinous and aggravated murders, 610 death sentences have been      implemented. Concurrently, 85 death row prisoners have been      released not for technical procedural flukes but because of      exculpatory evidence establishing their innocence. In other      words, for every seven executions approximately one capital      sentence has been levied on an innocent defendant.       Moreover, the detections of these grim injustices has been      more haphazard than systematic. The case Randall Dale Adams      and Antony Porter are emblematic.       The former was released after attracting the attention of      cinematic genius, Earl Morris. His gripping movie, ``The Thin      Blue Line,'' discredited the prosecution's case to a      nationally awakened audience.       Mr. Porter had lived with the Sword of Damocles for 16      years, and in 1998 his hourglass fell to 48 hours. He was      saved from wrongful execution by the plucky work of      Northwestern University undergraduate journalism students,      who proved Mr. Antony's innocence, a verdict that the      State of Illinois conceded.       Quirks and citizen altruism, however, are woefully      inadequate safeguards against executing the innocent. While      nothing in life is absolutely certain but death and taxes,      the Leahy bill would add two muscular measures to make the      truth-finding process in capital cases as reliable as is      reasonably feasible.       First, post-conviction DNA testing of biological material      would be available to an inmate through court order upon a      demonstration that the test could provide noncumulative      exculpatory evidence; that the material is actually or      constructively possessed by the government; and that no      previous DNA test had been conducted or that new DNA      techniques might reasonably yield more accurate and probative      evidence. Jurisdictions also would be directed to preserve      biological material gathered in the course of an      investigation during the period of the criminal's      incarceration for the purpose of possible DNA testing.       Of vastly greater importance to reliable death penalty      verdicts, however, is securing competent defense counsel in      lieu of incompetence or worse. The U.S. Supreme Court has      repeatedly celebrated the indispensability of reasonably      skilled lawyers to reliable verdicts. In the infamous      Scottsboro, Ala., criminal justice farce, Powell vs. Alabama      (1932), Justice George Sutherland, speaking for a unanimous      court, lectured: ``Left without the aid of counsel [the      accused] may be put on trial without a proper charge, and      convicted on incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to      the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill      and knowledge to prepare his defense, even though he has a      perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every      step of the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be      not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does      not know how to establish his innocence.''       Capital cases generally feature indigent defendants. And      their court-appointed lawyers are frequently deficient      because of austere rates of reimbursement or plain laziness.       For instance, the lawyer appointed to represent Ronald      Keith Williamson was uncurious about the fact that another      had confessed to the crime. He neglected to raise the      exculpatory confession at trial, Williamson was convicted,      and was later proven innocent through DNA testing after a      1997 federal appeals court decision overturned the trial      verdict because of inert or anemic lawyering.       The Leahy legislation would end this blight in death      penalty prosecutions by instructing the director of the      Administrative Office of the United States Courts to creating      a scheme for credentialing attorneys and providing reasonable      pay in capital prosecutions against indigent defendants.       Aren't executions too definitive to be left to chancy      discoveries of innocence? If the government does not want to      pay the price of turning square corners in capital cases,      shouldn't the prosecution accept a lesser maximum punishment?                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 2000]                         Innocent on Death Row       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has introduced a bill that seeks      to strengthen safeguards against wrongful executions. Those      who support capital punishment should be as determined as its      opponents to ensure that innocent people are not executed. By      that logic, this legislation should enjoy wide support.       The bill would require both state and federal courts to      permit post-conviction DNA testing in cases in which there is      a significant question of innocence. It also would encourage      states to retain biological evidence, thereby ensuring that      there is a material to test when innocence questions arise.      Perhaps more important, the bill would make federal criminal      justice funds to the states contingent on their improving      legal representation for the accused in all stages of death-     penalty litigation.       This is a critical reform, as the absence of competent      counsel is a pervasive theme in wrongful convictions. The      bill would raise the insultingly low limit for damages      against the federal government--$5,000 per year in jail--for      those wrongly convicted of federal crimes. And it would      encourage states to offer reasonable compensation as well.       These are common-sense improvements to the basic      infrastructure of the death penalty. For those who favor the      abolition of capital punishment, they may seem inadequate.      But by focusing only on protecting the innocent--not on a      broader agenda of halting all executions--Mr. Leahy places      the spotlight on what should be bedrock principle for all     who believe in due process. To support these reforms, one      need only believe that people accused of capital crimes      should have reasonably able counsel and that--when      substantial questions arise about the rightness of their      convictions--they should have the ability to prove their      innocence.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Feb. 19, 2000]                     New Looks at the Death Penalty       America is at last beginning to grapple honestly with the      profound flaws of the death penalty system. Late last month      Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, became the first      governor in a death penalty state to declare a moratorium on      executions, citing well-founded concerns about his state's      ``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting      them on death row.'' That has now been followed by moves in      Congress and the executive branch to review death penalty      policies from a national perspective.       Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin has urged President      Clinton to suspend all federal executions pending a review of      death penalty procedures similar to the one Governor Ryan has      initiated in Illinois. Problems of inadequate legal      representation, lack of access to DNA testing, police      misconduct, racial bias and even simple errors are not unique      to Illinois, Mr. Feingold noted.       The Justice Department has also initiated its own review to      determine whether the federal death penalty system unfairly      discriminates against racial minorities. At his news      conference this week, Mr. Clinton praised the death penalty      moratorium in Illinois, but indicated he thought a federal      moratorium was unnecessary. Mr. Feingold has urged him to      reconsider. Given his lame-duck status, the president can      afford to call a halt without worrying about being falsely      labeled soft on crime. Moreover, the fact that a Republican      governor was first to announce a moratorium should minimize      any concern about Vice President Al Gore being so labeled.       Congress need not wait for the administration to act. Last      week Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, introduced      legislation to address ``the growing national crisis'' in how      capital punishment is administered. This promising measure,      the Innocence Protection Act of 2000, stops short of      abolishing the death penalty, the course we hope the nation      will eventually follow. But key provisions would lessen the      chance of unfairness and deadly error by making DNA testing      available to both state and federal inmates, and by setting      national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are      appointed for capital defendants.       Without such protections, there is a grave possibility of      judicial error. Nationally, 612 people have been executed      since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in      1976. During the same period, 81 people in 21 states have      been found innocent and released from death row--some within      hours of being executed. That suggests that many who were      executed might also have been innocent.       Neither the states nor the courts are providing adequate      protection against awful miscarriages of justice. In Texas,      the nation's leader in executions, courts have upheld death      sentences in cases where defense lawyers slept during big      portions of the trial. Lately, Congress and the Supreme Court      have exacerbated the danger of mistaken executions by      curtailing appeal and habeas corpus rights. They have also      ignored the festering problem of inadequate legal      representation that caused the American Bar Association to      call for a death penalty moratorium three years ago. Even      death penalty supporters have to be troubled by a system      shown to have a high risk of executing the innocent.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2000]                        On Virginia's Death Row       Derek Barnabei evokes no sympathy. He is on death row in      Virginia for the rape and murder of his girlfriend, Sarah      Wisnosky, in 1993. The evidence of his guilt seems strong.      But that strong probability of guilt makes Virginia's      unwillingness to permit DNA testing of potentially key      evidence all the more puzzling. Mr. Barnabei has maintained      his innocence, and the case has a few troubling aspects. In      light of this, it only makes sense to test bloodstained      physical evidence retained but never tested by investigators.      Yet Virginia balks on the grounds that Mr. Barnabei's guilt      is so clear.       The likelihood is that the blood is Ms. Wisnosky's, which      would neither bolster nor undermine the jury's verdict in the      case. It also could be Mr. Barnabei's, which would reinforce      the integrity of the verdict. But the presence of someone      else's blood would make Mr. Barnabei's claims more credible.       It is hard to see why a state, before putting someone to      death, would be unwilling to demonstrate a jury verdict's      consistency with all of the evidence. Indeed, this is      precisely the type of case in which the state should have no      choice. Under a bill being pushed by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-     Vt.), states would be obligated in such circumstances to      allow post-conviction DNA testing. Such a law would not      merely offer a lawyer of protection to innocent people but      would increase public confidence in the convictions of guilty      people.
