 We have seen time and again that the FDA is not as good at this function as it should be. However, the reality is that the FDA needs to perform this function well because lives of American citizens and maybe around the world depend on it.  I wish to see a bill passed that prevents another Vioxx debacle. This Congress has an opportunity to make meaningful and positive changes. Let's not allow that opportunity to slip through our fingers.                                Medicare  Madam President, I have another set of remarks that I wish to make dealing with the issue that we had before the Senate today, and that we had a cloture vote on, S. 3. Members on the other side of the aisle, including the assistant majority leader, said that Republicans do not want this debate. What are they talking about, do not want a debate about anything dealing with Medicare prescription drugs and all those sorts of things?  This body has debated the so-called prohibition on Government negotiation. The Senate had four votes on this issue. What is rather amusing to me about the statement that we do not want the debate is that they did not seem to want the debate when the Senate considered S. 1.  S. 1 was the Senate version of the Medicare drug law. That bill had a noninterference clause in it just like the current law does. It is that clause that the other side has distorted to come up with the absurd claim that no negotiations occur under the Medicare drug benefit. Not once, I repeat, not once during the entire time that S. 1 was on the Senate floor in the year 2003 did anyone on the other side of the aisle bring up this issue.  That is because this is not an issue of merit, it is simply one born out of political pandering. The assistant majority leader also talked about how Medicare should look like the VA because the VA seems to get lower prices.  The VA gets lower prices because the Government passed a law to guarantee itself an automatic discount that no one else can get. By law, that price is automatically 24 percent less than the average price paid by basically all non-Federal purchasers. That is not negotiation, that is a federally mandated price dictation, or you might call it a 24-percent discount, but it is federally mandated.  I agree that the logical question then is: Why not have Medicare get that price? Experts who testified at the Senate Finance Committee, even the VA itself at a 2001 hearing before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs gave us the answer: They said that giving the Medicare VA prices will increase prices for veterans. Now, why would anybody in this body want to increase prices for veterans?  Now I wish to turn to how the VA uses its own pharmacy benefit manager or PBM as we refer to them. The pharmacy benefit manager for the VA--the VA has one. In 1995, as part of an effort to better manage and monitor drug usage and purchasing and utilization oversight across the entire Veterans' Administration, the VA established its own benefit manager.  The VA did it because it wanted to have its pharmacy operation work similar to the private sector. They did it because, as stated in the VA news release, they wanted to maximize a developing business strategy in the private sector. That business strategy was getting lower prices on drugs in the private sector.  So here we have people holding out the VA as a model, which uses its own PBM to negotiate, and at the same time they are saying: Using PBMs in Medicare is wrong.  Remember, that process has brought 35-percent lower costs on the 25 most used drugs by seniors under the Medicare Program. I cannot help but see how that is a bit of irony when people say they want Medicare to negotiate like the VA negotiates.  Well, the VA negotiates through its PBM. So the funny thing is, the VA actually negotiates similar to Medicare drug plans. You heard that right, but let me state it again. The VA system for negotiating is just like the one already used by Medicare through prescription drug plans that seniors join.  If the VA's PBM looked at itself in the mirror, it would see a Medicare drug plan's PBM staring right back at it. There is another important difference between the VA and Medicare. The VA prescription drug benefit is just one part of the VA's health care delivery system. It is a very different system than Medicare.  The VA system requires veterans to use VA hospitals, to use VA physicians, to use the VA national formulary, to use their pharmacies, and to use their mail order pharmacy. Now, don't get me wrong. The VA has a good system that works for veterans. But what it comes down to is choice. So I have a chart I want you to look at. Under the Medicare prescription drug benefit, beneficiaries have choices. They can choose the plan they want, a plan that covers all their medicines. They can choose the doctor and the hospital they want. They can go to their local pharmacy.  Even the VA recognizes this fact. On its own Web site in a ``frequently asked questions'' page, the VA does not recommend that veterans cancel or decline coverage in Medicare because a veteran may want to consider the flexibility afforded by enrolling in both the VA plan and the Medicare plan.  For example, veterans enrolled in both programs may obtain prescription drugs that are not on the VA formulary if prescribed by a non-VA physician and filled at a local pharmacy.  Making all Part D programs look like the VA and its formulary then will severely restrict access and will severely restrict choice to the 44 million Medicare beneficiaries. Now, the other side says: No. No. We are not going to limit access to drugs. Yes, as I pointed out this morning, every Democrat on the Finance Committee cast a vote against my amendment that would have prohibited the Secretary from creating a national preferred drug list.  I had thought, for all the talk about not allowing a Government formulary, the proponents of S. 3 would embrace aprovision banning preferred drug lists. If they do not want to limit beneficiaries' access to drugs, my amendment should have been easy for them to support.  But by voting against my amendment, they were voting in favor of the Government setting a preferred drug list. Now, the preferred drug list might sound like a good thing, but in reality it is not. It is a Government-controlled list of drugs that you can or cannot have because the Government is not going to pay for what they say you cannot have.  The preferred drug list then operates similar to a formulary. In my opinion, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. But that is not what the courts have found. So what does that mean for Medicare beneficiaries? It means that even though S. 3 prohibits the Secretary from using a formulary, it does not prohibit the Secretary from using a preferred drug list. It is clear now then from all this analysis and their votes on this amendment that supporters of this Senate bill want the Government to set a preferred drug list. They want the Government to determine for what seniors can get coverage.  A number of States have implemented preferred drug lists. Michigan, for example, has a preferred drug list. Here is what the Kaiser Family Foundation found in a 2003 case study on that preferred drug list:       Fearing opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, the      State sought virtually no input from providers, pharmacists,      beneficiaries and manufacturers.  Continuing the quote:       Ultimately the department [meaning Michigan] made only a      few changes to the list of drugs on the Michigan preferred      drug list in response to beneficiaries and provider concerns.  Both the Illinois House and the Illinois Senate resolutions were introduced in 2002 to establish a committee to oversee that State's preferred drug list.  The resolution noted that the creation of Illinois' preferred drug list ``could lead to unintended consequences such as inferior health care, increased hospitalizations and emergency care, increased admissions into long-term care, and unnecessary patient suffering and potentially death.''  In a statement about this bill, S. 345, the assistant majority leader said that: The Medicare-administered plan envisioned under this bill would have a preferred drug list.  So this morning I talked about fitting all of the pieces of a legislative puzzle together.  Here are some of those pieces: The bill approved by the House allows price controls. The bill that was before the Senate does not prohibit the Secretary from dictating the drugs beneficiaries can get. We have Senator Durbin's statement about his own bill and how he envisioned a preferred drug list.  So despite claims by those on the other side of the aisle, this bill is not harmless to senior citizens. If this Trojan horse attack succeeds in a Government takeover of the drug benefit, here is what seniors can look forward to: They can look forward to fewer choices. They can look forward to fewer opportunities to choose a plan that best meets their needs--the needs of 44 million senior citizens in America.  If the Senate bill were to pass, seniors will get only the drugs some Government bureaucrat determines they can have. All other Americans will see the prices of their prescription drugs going up. That is not me saying it. Professor Scott Morton of Yale University testified before the Senate Finance Committee to that mathematical fact, that if you have 44 million senior citizens, and you have the Government dictating the price, when you deal with that number of people, the price is going to go up for everybody. If that is what the other side calls harmless, I shudder to think what their definition of ``harmful'' might be.  We should have and did stop this bill in its tracks. Voting no was a vote against Government-controlled drug lists, Government setting prices, and Government restrictions on seniors' access to drugs. That was the right thing to do today, and I am glad the vote came out the way it did. I hope it stays that way because if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
