 President, let me describe where I believe we are on the foreign operations bill as of this motion to table.  According to the Senate Parliamentarian, based on precedence, beginning in 1898 and in subsequent votes as recently as 1984, either House has the option to recede on its amendment. Based on discussions with the Parliamentarian, it is my understanding that by tabling amendment No. 115, we have, in effect, receded our position on both the Kassebaum language and the Chris Smith language leaving no further amendments in disagreement.  This means no further action is required by the House on the foreign operations appropriations bill, unless it chooses to, and it can be enrolled by the House and sent to the President, again, if the House should choose to take that route.  I thank my colleagues, and I hope we have completed our action on this legislation.
