 President, I have had a chance now for a second time to hear the explanation of the amendment from the Senator from Rhode Island. I think he is a person who always acts in good faith on his amendments and other legislative activity. He is a very active member of the Aging Committee, which I chair, and I have had a chance to observe him there as being a very serious Senator. So I do not raise any questions with the motives of the Senator because I think he even sees a need for bankruptcy legislation.  But I still have to point out that I think the amendment, even if the intent is good, is just unworkable. I do not know whether we could have an amendment written to accomplish his goals that could be perfected enough to be workable--I should not draw that conclusion; that is a possibility--but I do believe that the language we have before us would fall into that category, because the modified amendment still requires bankruptcy judges to review underwriting standards. That is what the Senator from Rhode Island said earlier on the floor.  So I do not think that we know how this amendment will work. I do not know how you can make even a commonsense determination of whether lending practices are in good faith unless the judge begins to second-guess many credit-granting decisions.  As I have said, if the Senator from Rhode Island believes that there are too many credit card solicitations, then I think I should refer him to a letter that I read into the Record last week, which I am going to insert in the Record at this point as well, a letter from the junior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, who chairs the subcommittee of banking where I made an argument, from a procedural standpoint, that this amendment should be considered there, and that he has offered to hold hearings on this subject matter, and maybe even the goal that the Senator from Rhode Island seeks can be accomplished, but, more importantly, accomplished in a studied approach.  So I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record as justification on a procedure not to add this amendment to this bill but to have the Banking Committee consider this.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Committee on Banking, Housing,                                            and Urban Affairs,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1998.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the          Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chuck: It is my understanding that a number of      amendments relating to credit cards will be offered to S.      1301. Most, if not all, of these amendments will relate to      matters in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I Chair      the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the Banking      Committee.       I share the concerns that many have regarding multiple      credit card solicitations and solicitations to minors. In      fact earlier this year, my Subcommittee held a hearing on      bankruptcy issues, with representatives of the credit card      industry testifying. I have requested and received GAO      reports on such practices as high loan to value loans and the      sending of ``live'' loan checks.       As for many of the proposed amendments relating, however,      none have been passed by     the Committee. In fact, none have been considered by the      Committee. Further, none of the proponents of the amendments      have requested hearings on any of their legislative      proposals.       During consideration of the bankruptcy bill, please know      that I would be more than willing to hold a hearing or      hearings on any these proposals in my Subcommittee where they      rightfully should be considered under regular order.           Sincerely,                                              Lauch Faircloth,                                         Chairman, Subcommittee on                                           Financial Institutions.
