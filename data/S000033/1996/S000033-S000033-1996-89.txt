 Chairman, my friend from Washington will recall that last year, same time, same place, we had the same debate. The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] and myself and others said we think we are spending too much on the intelligence, and we had leaders from both political parties coming forward saying theyneed every single nickel. And what we are hearing today is, in fact, that there was an unaccounted-for slush fund of $4 billion that, in fact, was not needed.  We were right on the debate last time, and in due respect to my friend from Washington, his position was wrong.  So the question now comes before us this year. I am not here to pass blame on any Member of the Congress.
