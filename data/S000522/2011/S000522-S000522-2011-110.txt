Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Association of Private Special Education Centers (NAPSEC) for their 40 years of excellent service and academic dedication to our country's individuals with disabilities. NAPSEC's educational therapeutic services, combined with four decades of experience are invaluable to the education community across the United States and to the dozens of partners in my home state of New Jersey.  Established in 1971, NAPSEC represents private specialized education programs including early intervention services, school programs, residential therapeutic centers, and college experience and adult living programs for individuals with disabilities and their families. NAPSEC's hundreds of affiliates offer much needed services to publically and privately placed individuals who are otherwise unable to receive an appropriate public education. Member programs also serve the needs of individuals who have graduated from high school including adults over 21 years of age.  I am inspired by the quality of care and expertise NAPSEC's partners provide to America's students with disabilities, including those with autism. Again, I offer NAPSEC my sincerest congratulations on 40 years of service to the disabilities community and look forward to NAPSEC's continued progress in the future.                          ____________________
