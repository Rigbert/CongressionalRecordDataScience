President, unlike any Republican in the House or the Senate, I have voted for a balanced budget. We balanced the budget under President Clinton. Not only balanced the budget, started paying down the national debt. He was able to leave hundreds of billions of dollars in surplus to his successor, who determined with Republican votes to go to war in Iraq and pay for the war with a tax cut. That is why we had to borrow the money from China and Saudi Arabia. Not a single Republican voted for a real balanced budget when they had a chance to. In fact, it passed the Senate only because Vice President Gore came and broke the tie.  I was proud to have voted for that balanced budget. Not a gimmick, but a real balanced budget. We had to actually make tough choices. We did it. We balanced it. We had a surplus.  When we talk about amending our Nation's fundamental charter, the Constitution of the United States, it is not something Congress and the American people should feel forced to do in the face of a financial crisis. I take seriously my senatorial oath to support and defend the Constitution.  I know there are a lot of pressure groups demanding that elected representatives sign pledges about what they will and will not do. The pledge I follow, which is the one I was honored to make again at the beginning of this Congress, is to uphold the Constitution. That is what I intend to do as I represent the people of Vermont.  The House-passed bill, H.R. 2560, which the Senate is now considering, claims to impose a balanced budget on future Congresses, but it doesn't even contain the proposed constitutional amendment that supporters are seeking to adopt. Nor did the bill pass with two-thirds of the Republican-controlled House voting in favor.  That threshold is what is required for us to pass a constitutional amendment. The House vote was more than 50 votes short of that necessary number.  The process by which this bill has been brought to the floor of the Senate is an affront to the Constitution that we are sworn to protect and defend. Instead, the House still denies authority needed to meet the Nation's obligations until Congress passes a type of constitutional amendment that will actually make it more difficult for us to reduce our national debt. That kind of constitutional blackmail has no place in our democracy, no place in our laws.  I wonder whether anyone who respects the Constitution can support such an approach. Here is the convoluted language the House bill includes about an amendment to our Constitution:       H.J. Res. 1 in the form reported on June 23, 2011, S.J. Res      10 in the form introduced on March 31, 2011, or H.J. Res. 56      in the form introduced on April 7, 2011, a balanced budget      amendment to the Constitution, or a similar amendment if it      requires that total outlays not exceed total receipts, that      contains a spending limitation as a percentage of GDP, and      requires that tax increases be approved by a two-thirds vote      in both Houses of Congress.  The Founders didn't include a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget or a prohibition against incurring debt in our Constitution. They knew full well that would have been foolish, dangerous, and self-defeating for the Nation they were seeking to establish.  I respect the wisdom of the Founders and will uphold the Constitution, which has served this Nation so well for the last 223 years. Let's not be so vain as to think we know better than the Founders what the Constitution should prescribe.  I reject the notion that for political reasons we need to rush consideration of an ill-conceived and evolving proposal for a constitutional amendment. I will stand with the Founders. I will defend their work and our Constitution, and I will oppose the proposed series of constitutional amendments, which, incidentally, haven't even had a hearing.  Have we forgotten how the Revolutionary War was financed? Have we forgotten how the national government took on the debt of the states after the Revolutionary War? Have we forgotten that in 1792, just four years after the ratification of the Constitution, the budget deficit was 38 percent of revenues? Have we forgotten how President Jefferson financed the Louisiana Purchase expanding the country westward? Do we not remember what happened during the Civil War, how we emerged from the Great Depression, and won World War II? Do we not even recall that during the administration of the last Democratic President, we had balanced the budget after defeating a proposed constitutional amendment and were reducing the deficit with billions of surpluses?  Amendments to the Constitution of the United States are permanent. They are not bills or resolutions that can be abandoned or fixed. They are not just a bumper sticker or a sound bite. Each word matters to hundreds of millions of Americans and future generations.  I have never seen--and I have been here 37 years--the solemn duty of protecting the Constitution treated in such a cavalier manner. I wish those who so often say they revere the Constitution would show it the respect it deserves rather than treating it like a blog entry.  We have already seen scores of proposed constitutional amendments on budgetary matters. None has been adopted and for good reason. The Senate amendment referenced in the House bill is one of approximately 60 proposed so far this Congress. It remains a moving target, not a finished product worthy of consideration as an addition to our fundamental charter. The House bill itself proposed three different constitutional amendments and a catchall to include some proposal not yet introduced. Last night some members claimed that this catchall somehow allows flexibility. If we are going to limit the authority on the debt ceiling by requiring a constitutional amendment, there should not be ambiguity in what the amendment would actually do to hardworking Americans. This shows the lack of seriousness with which Republicans have approached this entire matter.  These partisan constitutional amendment proposals are inconsistent with the views of our Founding Fathers. George Washington did not want our Constitution to constrain the national government from being able to respond to events as warranted. He led this Nation into being and knew that financial constraints had no place in the Constitution. The Constitution expressly provides for the power ``to borrow money on the credit of the United States'' and for Congress ``to lay and collect taxes'' and duties and ``to pay the debts and provide for the general welfare of the United States.'' That is what Congress has been required to do since the outset and that is our responsibility today. We should be acting without further delay to preserve the credit of the United States and to provide for our people.  The proposed amendments are also inconsistent with the views of Alexander Hamilton, a key author of the Federalist Papers and the creator of the American financial system that allowed us to become the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. The United States was born in debt, of course, and debt has been needed to fund some of America's greatest chapters. Hamilton even termed national debt at times ``a national blessing.'' The Constitution allows for the Federal Government to borrow money at certain times, for wars, infrastructure building, and economic bad times. That fiscal policy can help drive development and unite the Nation. It should not be turned into a divisive wedge against the least powerful among us.  I am concerned this is another example of how some in recent years have sought to impose their view by unilateral objection to compromise with minority obstruction. That has, at times, seemed to be the rule in the last few years. Some have tried to undermine the legitimacy of President Obama. Filibusters and requirements for supermajorities have become routine. They have stymied congressional action on behalf of the American people.  This year should be a cautionary tale that convinces all Americans that the risks of default and ideological impasses to them, to interest rates, to financial markets, and to our household budgets are too great. We need only recall the game of chicken some played with the government shutdown earlier this year. The threat to push the United States into default on its obligations for the first time in our history is wrong. It is made possible by rules that empower a partisan minority.  I cannot help but think if we don't take the steps we should, we will see our interest rates go up. We will spend hundreds of billions of dollars in extra interest to China, which they can spend on infrastructure, medical research and education, but we won't have it here in the United States. That is what the other side seems to want.  We saw this before, in 1996, when a Government shutdown and a debt limit crisis went on for months as part of a partisan ``train wreck'' intended to extort President Clinton. It is happening, again, this year as some seek to gain political advantage over President Obama. The creditworthiness of the United States is too important to be sacrificed for partisan political advantage but that is what is being threatened. Indeed, this House-passed bill, with its proposed constitutional amendments, makes that more likely, not less.  Charles Fried, President Reagan's Solicitor General, said a few years ago that supermajority requirements ``are against the spirit and genius of our Constitution, which is a charter for democracy; that is, for majority rule.'' He was right then, when the Senate rejected an earlier constitutional amendment on budgetary matters, and that truth remains the same today.  We have seen the danger that irresponsible brinksmanship promotes. We should guard against building into the Constitution a supermajority requirement for fiscal policy. That invites political blackmail and gridlock. We have seen enough of that already.  I suggest that Congress should not subject our ability to govern to any greater hurdles that would empower the tyranny of the minority on economic policy. Instead of hamstringing Congress with more supermajority requirements, we should be looking for ways to increase our ability to take necessary action to deal with a fast changing and increasingly interdependent global economy.  The source of our budgetary problems does not lie with the Constitution. The Constitution remains sound. What is lacking is the political judgment and the courage to do what is right.  Having again sought to use the debt ceiling to create a political crisis, congressional Republicans refuse to enact a program of shared sacrifice to put us on a better financial path. In fact, Senate Republicans filibustered the debate of a resolution calling for such a plan.  It is telling that the Republican posture is now to require the Constitution to be amended.  The last time we balanced the budget, not a single Republican voted for that balanced budget, and yet it created enormous surpluses. These proposed constitutional amendments will not cut a single dime of debt from the Federal budget. Rather than deal with our problems, some want to require that we deface the Constitution with a measure that will, by its own terms, not be effective for 5 years, if it were to be adopted by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and then ratified by three-fourths of the States. Put another way, that is at least three election cycles from now. They get their bumper stickers today, but kick the can down the road for three election cycles.  Economists have noted that all of the last five Democratic Presidents have reduced public debt as a share of GDP. The last four Republican Presidents did the opposite with the country's indebtedness increasing during their administrations. During President Reagan and Bush's administrations the Federal debt more than tripled. During the Clinton administration, budgets were balanced and we were paying down the debt from the budget surplus being generated. Then, during the administration of George W. Bush the debt nearly doubled again to more than $10 trillion dollars.  We should not amend our Nation's fundamental charter of liberty to include arbitrary and inflexible requirements in order to look tough on spending, but without regard to the consequences.  A respected Republican Senator from Oregon, Mark Hatfield, had it right 15 years ago when he said that a ``balanced budget comes only through leadership and compromise.''  In 1992, the Senate and House took the hard votes to enact a budgetary plan that led us to a balanced budget and budget surpluses during President Clinton's time in office. Not a single congressional Republican supported the plan. They favored talking about constitutional amendments then, as well. The balance we achieved was later squandered by the next President, as his policies also wreaked havoc with the financial sector and threatened the entire economy. The near meltdown of the financial markets during the last year of the Bush administration and the resulting recession threatened to drive our economy and that of the world into depression just 3 years ago. President Obama and the Congress responded to pull it back from the brink.  In a recent editorial, USA Today put it this way:       [A] funny thing happened after that amendment failed in      1997. Thanks to prior deficit-reduction deals and a strong      economy, the federal government ran a surplus in 1998 and for      the next three years. Then an economic downturn, huge tax      cuts, two unfunded wars and unfunded expansion of Medicare      plunged the budget back into the red, where it has been ever      since.       The moral is, Congress doesn't need a constitutional      amendment to balance the budget. It just needs the will to do      it and the willingness to compromise over how. But rather      than make the tough decisions about spending cuts and revenue      increases, it's always easier to vote for a balanced budget      amendment.  I will ask that copies of this and other editorials and opinion pieces from leading newspapers be printed in the Record.  The House-passed bill is an end-run around the Constitution's requirements for amendment. It does not have the required support of two-thirds of even the House Chamber. Equally important, it is not necessary. Congress has the power now to take steps to avoid a government default and get us on the path to balancing the budget, just as we did at the end of the Clinton administration. This debate is a distraction from the hard work and hard choices that need to be made.  The good news is that we do not need to amend the Constitution to balance the budget. Never have. Never will.  The proposed constitutional amendments would also perpetuate bad policy. They are intended to enshrine tax breaks for millionaires and wealthy corporations. It is no wonder that Alexander Hamilton described supermajority vote requirements as ``poison.'' We need a balanced approach to fix the deficit problem. We cannot merely cut our way to balance any more than eliminating congressional earmarks will balance the budget. We will need to close the most egregious tax loopholes and everyone will have to sacrifice and contribute their fair share.  There should be no mistake: The proposed amendments to the Constitution are not just unnecessary, they are unwise, unsound, and dangerous. In my view, the House-passed bill and the proposed amendments it requires demeans our Constitution. Never in our history have we amended the Constitution--the work of our Founders--to impose budgetary restrictions or to require supermajorities for passing legislation. Yet now we are saying: Let's do it on a whim. Let's do it without any hearings. Let's do it because we can do it.  It would for the first time enshrine minority rule and undermine our constitutional democracy. It will destabilize the separation of powers among our three branches of Government and put into the hands of bureaucrats and judges the fiscal policy of the United States.  Who is to decide what the ``GDP'' was for a particular time period, what is to be included and what is not? How often do those estimates and artificial constructs get revised? Since when do economic surveys and extrapolations become embedded in the Constitution? What justifies the constitutional permanence of the number 18, as opposed to 17 or 18.5 or 20? Do we really want judges deciding whether an economics line written into the Constitution has been breached? What remedies could judges order if they find a breach? Who has standing to bring those challenges? None of these questions has been adequately debated or considered.  Alternatively, we could end up with future Congresses having to slash Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, unable to respond to natural disasters or national security emergencies. I note that the budget proposed this year by Representative Ryan and the House Republicans with all its draconian cuts and the end of Medicare as we know it would not satisfy this arbitrary limit. Nor would the budgets of President Reagan. Consider whether we could witness future Congresses unable to meet the arbitrary limit and going into violation of that unsound constitutional prescription and the Constitution itself?  At the beginning of our Republic, the national Government took on the debts of the States. These proposed constitutional amendments are a recipe for pushing costs and responsibilities onto the states. And doing so at a time when State governments need our help, not more unmet needs.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has considered several balanced budget amendments over the years. The Senate proposal this year is even more extreme than the version the Senate rejected in 1995 and again in 1997. It is reckless and foolish to rush Senate consideration of such a radical proposal to change our Constitution, without process or consideration.  All Senators swear an oath to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' That is our duty and responsibility. The pending amendments to the Constitution threaten the constitutional principles that have sustained our democratic form of government for more than 200 years. The Constitution allows America to flourish and adapt to new challenges. We have amended it only 17 times since the Bill of Rights was added.  Our Constitution deserves protection. I stand with the Constitution today and I will support the motion to table this ill-conceived legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the materials to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [From USA Today]      Our View: Budget Amendment Wrong Vehicle for Right Principle       In 1997, the Senate came within a single vote of passing a      constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget.      Backers made all the same arguments you'll hear today when      the House takes up a new version of the old elixir: An      amendment will finally force Congress to balance the budget,      we'll never have a balanced budget without one, and so on.       But a funny thing happened after that amendment failed in      1997. Thanks to prior deficit-reduction deals and a strong      economy, the federal government ran a surplus in 1998 and for      the next three years. Then an economic downturn, huge tax      cuts, two unfunded wars and an unfunded expansion of Medicare      plunged the budget back into the red, where it has been ever      since.       The moral is, Congress doesn't need a constitutional      amendment to balance the budget. It just needs the will to do      it and the willingness to compromise over how. But rather      than make the tough decisions about spending cuts and revenue      increases, it's always easier to vote for a balanced budget      amendment.       And not just any balanced budget amendment. Rather than      embrace the same legislation that almost passed in 1997 and      would surely attract Democratic votes this time around,      backers have made the latest version so extreme that it's      virtually certain not to pass both chambers of Congress, much      less the three-fourths of states required for ratification.       This new version--part of the Republicans' ``Cut, Cap and      Balance'' plan-- sets a permanent limit on spending equal to      18% of the economy, a level it hasn't achieved since 1966.      (The plan of conservative House Budget Committee Chairman      Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would leave spending at around 20% of GDP      for the next two decades as Baby Boomers retire.) Raising      taxes would require two-thirds of votes by the House and      Senate.       Reading between the lines, it's clear that many supporters      care less about cutting the deficit than about rewriting the      Constitution to embrace an economic theory that shrinks      government and makes it almost impossible to raise taxes.       Certainly, balancing the budget is a sound goal. We've been      supporting it in this space for more than 20 years. Congress      and successive presidents have demonstrated an inability to      match revenue and spending. Something has to be done to      change the incentives.       But the fatal flaw in virtually any balanced budget      amendment is that it ties the government's hands in times of      economic distress. When those sorts of crises hit, the      government needs to be able to move quickly to rescue major      financial institutions and deploy ``automatic stabilizers,''      such as unemployment benefits and food stamps that steady the      economy until private-sector forces can create a recovery.      Failure to intervene caused the Great Depression of the      1930s, and had a balanced budget amendment been in place when      the financial crisis struck in 2008, there's no doubt at all      that we'd be living through another one now.       Backers also argue that because states have to balance      their budgets, the federal government should, too. But the      federal government has responsibilities the states don't,      most notably to protect national security. And when state      revenues collapse, the federal government serves as a      critical lifeline.       Preferable alternatives to a constitutional amendment      include pay-as-you-go requirements and firm spending caps      that require lawmakers to make choices, rather than run up      debt. But why make tough choices now when you can vote for a      gimmick that someday, maybe, would address the problem?                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 4, 2011]                   More Folly in the Debt Limit Talks       Congressional Republicans have opened a new front in the      deficit wars. In addition to demanding trillions of dollars      in spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation's debt      limit, they are now vowing not to act without first holding      votes in each chamber on a balanced budget amendment to the      Constitution.       The ploy is more posturing on an issue that has already      seen too much grandstanding. But it is posturing with a      dangerous purpose: to further distort the     terms of the budget fight, and in the process, to entrench      the Republicans' no-new-taxes-ever stance.       It won't be enough for Democrats to merely defeat the      amendment when it comes up for a vote. If there is to be any      sensible deal to raise the debt limit, they also need to      rebut the amendment's false and dangerous premises--not an      easy task given the idea's populist appeal.       What could be more prudent than balancing the books every      year? In fact, forcibly balancing the federal budget each      year would be like telling families they cannot take out a      mortgage or a car loan, or do any other borrowing, no matter      how sensible the purchase or how creditworthy they may be.       Worse, the balanced budget amendment that Republicans put      on the table is far more extreme than just requiring the      government to spend no more than it takes in each year in      taxes.       The government would be forbidden from borrowing to finance      any spending, unless a supermajority agreed to the borrowing.      In addition to mandating a yearly balance, both the House and      Senate versions would cap the level of federal spending at 18      percent of gross domestic product.       That would amount to a permanent limit on the size of      government--at a level last seen in the 1960s, before      Medicare and Medicaid, before major environmental legislation      like the Clean Water Act, and long before the baby-boom      generation was facing retirement. The spending cuts implied      by such a cap are so draconian that even the budget recently      passed by House Republicans--and condemned by the public for      its gutting of Medicare--would not be tough enough.       Under the proposed amendments, the spending cap would apply      even if the government collected enough in taxes to spend      above the limit, unless two-thirds of lawmakers voted to      raise the cap. More likely, antitax lawmakers would vote to      disburse the money via tax cuts. Once enacted, tax cuts would      be virtually irreversible, since a two-thirds vote in both      houses would be required to raise any new tax revenue. It      isn't easy to change the Constitution. First, two-thirds of      both the Senate and House must approve an amendment, and then      at least 38 states must ratify the change.       But expect to hear a lot about the idea in the days ahead      and in the 2012 political campaign, with Republicans eagerly      attacking Democrats who sensibly voted no.       Democrats, undeniably, have a tougher argument to make. A      fair and sustainable budget deal will require politically      unpopular choices on programs to cut and taxes to raise.      Americans deserve to hear the truth: There is no shortcut, no      matter what the Republicans claim. Nor is their urgency to      impose deep spending cuts now, while the economy is weak, as      Republicans are insisting.       What is needed is enactment of a thoughtful deficit-     reduction package, to be implemented as the economy recovers.      If politicians respect the voters enough to tell them the      truth, the voters may reward them at the polls.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, July 14, 2011]              A Balanced Budget Amendment Isn't the Answer                              (Editorial)       Amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget is a      bad idea that never dies. It's not surprising that the      current avalanche of debt has inspired renewed calls. Given      that the political system appears unable to discipline itself      not to spend more--trillions more--than it takes in, why not      tie lawmakers' hands to prevent them from piling ever more      debt on the national credit card?       The answer: The constitutional cure, while superficially      tempting, would be worse than the underlying disease. A      balanced-budget amendment would deprive policymakers of the      flexibility they need to address national security and      economic emergencies. It would revise the Constitution in a      way that would give dangerous power to a congressional      minority.       The latest push from lawmakers advocating the amendment is      to couple a vote on the proposal with an agreement to raise      the debt ceiling. On the surface, this argument seems benign      enough: Why not give states the chance to decide whether the      Constitution should mandate a balanced budget? But      policymakers have an independent responsibility to assess      whether an amendment is wise. This one, especially in its      latest incarnation, is not. It would require a two-thirds      vote in both houses of Congress to run a deficit in any year.      The same supermajority would be needed to enact any tax      increase. Compare those hurdles to the version of the      amendment that passed the House in 1995, which called for a      slightly lower three-fifths vote in each house to pass an      unbalanced budget or increase the debt ceiling and a mere      majority vote to increase taxes.       Worse yet, the latest version would impose an absolute cap      on spending as a share of the economy. It would prevent      federal expenditures from exceeding 18 percent of the gross      domestic product in any year. Most unfortunately, the      amendment lacks a clause letting the government exceed that      limit to strengthen a struggling economy. No matter how shaky      the state of the union, policymakers would be prevented from      adopting emergency spending, such as the extension of      unemployment insurance and other countercyclical expenses      that have helped cushion the blow of the current economic      downturn. The 18 percent cap on spending is so severe that      House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's economic plan      would violate its strictures. So would any budget passed      under President Ronald Reagan. With health-care costs rising      and the number of retiring baby boomers increasing, it would      be next to impossible to keep spending to that low share of      the economy.       Both houses of Congress are expected to vote on the      amendment next week, but a responsible lawmaker's obligation      does not end at voting against this version. Even a less      draconian rendition--without the spending cap or with lower      thresholds for approving tax increases or running deficits--     would be the wrong approach. If a balanced-budget amendment      had been in place when the economy crashed in 2008, Congress      would have been unable to respond with a stimulus package or      efforts to stabilize banks and auto manufacturers. Even if      you believe that was the wrong policy response, it is      important that Congress retain the flexibility to craft the      correct one.       The fiscal situation is perilous. It's commendable that      members of Congress are trying to right it. The balanced-     budget amendment remains a deeply flawed approach to      achieving a noble goal.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 17, 1990]                   No to a Balanced Budget Amendment       The balanced budget amendment that the House will vote on      today is impractical, unenforceable and wouldn't end Federal      deficits. But it would litter the Constitution with a vacuous      promise, and invite greater cynicism in budget-making.       Deficits are arbitrarily defined and easily manipulated.      Achieving a specific level, like zero, has no special      economic significance. And trying to hit that target could      play havoc with valuable Federal programs and a declining      economy that might need deficit spending.       Yes, Congress should keep deficits from spiraling upward.      But there is no immediate crisis, and the deficit--compared      with the size of the economy--has already been cut in half      under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. More needs to be      done. The prudent way is to amend Gramm-Rudman to make it      work better, not spoil the precious Constitution in a      quixotic search for a quick fix.       The proposed amendment would require a three-fifths vote in      both houses to run a deficit. That, say the sponsors, would      provide the flexibility to run deficits when they are needed      but stymie unnecessary borrowing. But nowhere does the      amendment come to grips with political reality. Evasion would      be simple. Congress could move programs ``off budget,'' like      funds for the savings and loan crisis.       The amendment also would require Congress and the President      to agree on revenue and expenditure estimates. But      politicians have a common interest in fudging such      projections and pretending to pass a balanced budget. The      amendment's only safeguard against self-serving projections      is the proposed three-fifths vote to raise the debt ceiling.      That way legislators eventually would be forced to confront      the issue. Yet garnering enough votes would be easy since to      vote otherwise would bring the Government to a screeching      halt.       As for states that have balanced budget amendments, they      also have separate capital accounts. That allows them to      borrow money for long-term investments in infrastructure.      There is no separate capital account in the Federal budget.      So a requirement to balance the budget would create a      horrific incentive for Congress to avoid costly investments      in railroads, education and research.       Congress has been unable to make the Gramm-Rudman budget      law work fully as intended. But amending it to plug loopholes      would be far easier, and better, than drafting a skimpily      worded constitutional amendment.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 2011]              Why a Balanced-Budget Amendment Is Too Risky                        (By Norman J. Ornstein)       It is no surprise that a constitutional amendment to      balance the budget would reemerge now--there's the symbolism      of standing for fiscal rectitude and wrapping that position      in the cloak of the Constitution. And nearly all states have      constitutional provisions to balance their budgets, so why      should the federal government be different?       But the answer to that question is a key reason a      constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget would      be disastrous.       A sagging economy requires what we call countercyclical      policy, stimulus to counter a downturn and provide a boost.      The need for countercyclical policy became apparent in the      1930s, after the opposite response to economic trouble caused      a dizzying collapse; its application early in Franklin      Roosevelt's presidency succeeded in pulling the United States      out of the Depression (until a premature tightening in 1937-     38 pulled us back down into it).       Countercyclical policy is what every industrialized country      in the world employed when the credit shock hit in late 2008,      to avoid a global disaster far more serious than the one we      faced. Under a balanced-budget amendment, however, no      countercyclical policy could emanate from Washington.      Spending could not grow to combat the slump. And while the      Obama stimulus did not jump-start a robust economic recovery,     any objective analysis would find that absent the $800      billion stimulus, the economy would have spiraled down much      further.       State balanced-budget requirements make the option of a      federal balanced-budget amendment dangerous. When state      revenue declines during economic downturns, state spending on      unemployment and Medicaid increases. To balance their      budgets, states have to raise taxes and/or cut spending, the      opposite of what is needed to emerge from a fiscal funk. This      is the economic equivalent of the medieval practice of      bleeding to cure any ailment, including anemia. In 2009, the      fiscal drag from the states amounted to roughly $800 billion;      in effect, the stimulus from Washington merely replaced the      blood lost by the state-level bleeding.       Even balanced-budget amendments that have a waiver for      recessions are a risk because there is often a lag between a      recession itself and when it is recognized. That lag could      produce more inopportune bleeding.       The amendment under consideration has its own deep flaws.      The Republican proposal would cap spending each year at 18      percent of gross domestic product. Because the formula is      based on a previous year's economy, it would mean, according      to Republican economist Don Marron, a cap of more like 16.7      percent of GDP. This in turn means that the House-passed      budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, which calls for draconian      cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary      domestic programs, would not be nearly draconian enough.      Accounting for population changes, the 16.7 percent limit      would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare well below      the levels contemplated by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles      fiscal commission, and cutting discretionary spending by half      or more. It is hard to make the case that decapitating food      inspection, air traffic control, scientific research, Head      Start, childhood nutrition programs and more, as the      amendment would almost certainly require, would lead to a      healthier economy, itself a necessity to solve the debt      problem.       To be fair, the amendment has a safety valve--a two-thirds      vote of both chambers can authorize a deficit. But imagine      the chances of securing a two-thirds vote in this Congress.      Similarly, its requirement that 60 percent of both houses      vote to increase taxes or the debt limit would result in      political gridlock and opportunities for legislative      blackmail.       That this amendment has been endorsed by all 47 Republicans      in the Senate, and that a dozen Republicans have pledged not      to increase the debt limit without the amendment, are sad      commentaries on our politics. But the effects should this      amendment be adopted would be frightening.

The balanced budget amendment is a flag conservatives love      to run up the pole when they think they can get the American      public to hate free-spending Democrats a little bit more.      It's disingenuous at best. Congress should not require a      special rule that says its members use common sense when      making vast and expensive decisions. When it comes to      international conflicts, domestic terror threats and economic      recessions, the added steps of arguing to get around a      balanced budget amendment is not what is needed.       But when it comes to running the government, members of      Congress need to use forethought and that not-so-common      common sense to avoid unproductive tax cuts, conflicts      without reasonable exit strategies and the ability to find      solutions when deficits grow too large.       The timing of our own Rep. Bob Goodlatte's amendment might      sound quite reasonable to a lot of people right now. But it      isn't reasonable. It's another ploy by those who don't want a      solution to the real problem, but just a way to make gullible      followers believe they've found a solution to our budgetary      woes.       A balanced budget amendment does not equal smaller      government with less spending. Like any household, the only      way to balance a budget is by trimming expenses and adding      revenue. Pressed to balance a budget would force Congress to      raise taxes, especially if we are to hang on to high-cost      government entities like Social Security and Medicare.       It's not a solution. Demanding that a balanced-budget      amendment go along with any agreement toward raising the debt      ceiling simply will drag the whole thorny mess down even      more.
