 President, I oppose this amendment, as does the vice chairman and the administration. This amendment is not germane to FISA. It has not been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which would have jurisdiction over this matter. It seeks to reverse 30 years of Supreme Court precedence of interpreting the fourth amendment. According to the administration talking points received this afternoon: The amendment would severely limit the effectiveness of law enforcement authorities at all levels of government and will effectively repeal the FISA Amendments Act.  I urge a ``no'' vote.
