 President, today I wish to pay tribute to my good friend Joel Pierce Smith, Sr. He was a personal friend who passed away on July 30, 2009, and, along with his family, I mourn his passing.  Joel was born on February 13, 1929, in Samson, AL. After graduating from Florida State University, he went to work at the Birmingham News-Post Herald in 1953. This would mark the start of a newspaper career that would span five decades. Following his work in Birmingham, Joel served as the editor of the the Geneva Reaper for 3 years.  In 1958, Joel moved to Eufaula, AL, and was named editor of the Eufaula Tribune. A year later, he was named publisher. An avid journalist, Joel also edited and published the Cuthbert Times and News Record of Cuthbert, GA. In 1999, Joel handed over the editorial reins of the Eufaula Tribune to his son Jack, though he continued to write his weekly personal column, Candid Comments, until 2006. All told, Joel wrote Candid Comments for 51 years, never missing a week. He truly was an extraordinary newspaperman and, as such, garnered numerous state and national awards. These awards recognized both the quality of his work and his leadership in his community and amongst his peers. Among his honors were the Alabama Press Association's Community Service Award, General Excellence Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award.  Joel was active in both the Alabama Press Association and the National Newspaper Association throughout his career. He served as president for both the Alabama Press Association and the Alabama Journalism Foundation and he held a seat on the board of directors for the Alabama Press Association and the Georgia Press Association. Additionally, Joel served as the Alabama State Chairman of the National Newspaper Association for many years, chairing the latter's 1992 Governmental Affairs Conference in Washington, DC.  Throughout his distinguished career, Joel remained an active voice for progressive change in Eufaula. Among other things, he encouraged the reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce, promoted tourism in the area, and crusaded for the preservation of Eufaula's architectural heritage. He served on the board of trustees at Birmingham-Southern College for more than 25 years, where he became life trustee, and at Andrew College in Cuthbert, GA. Joel served on the Board of Education of the city of Eufaula and as a trustee at the Lakeside School. His good work was not overlooked in the community and he was honored as the Eufaula Kiwanis Club's Citizen of the Year in 2002 and received the Alabama Historical Commission's Distinguished Service Award.  Joel is loved and will be missed by his wife Ann Sutton Smith and his three sons, Joel Pierce Smith, Jr., Abb Jackson Smith II, and William Sutton Smith. Joel was an inspiration to many and will be remembered as an outstanding husband, father, editor, publisher, friend, and community leader.  I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my friend, Joel Pierce Smith.                          ____________________
