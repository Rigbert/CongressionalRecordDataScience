The committee staff is different, the leadership staff is different, and as the Senator pointed out, the executive is different. What is that all about? It should be uniform or not all, and it should be uniform for everybody who had a hand in this debacle.  I even thought about an amendment saying that those who didn't vote for it--I voted against ObamaCare three times: Once in the HELP Committee, once in the Finance Committee, and once it came out of Harry Reid's office. My colleagues said: Did you read the bill? Nobody read the bill because it had been changed, so then we had to wade through it, and then, as different events came about, one problem led to another problem, that problem led to two problems, and those problems led to other problems, so we are still finding out about that.  But back to the point of the Senator from Indiana, we can name Senators who said: Look, let's make this uniform. If it is good enough for Americans, it ought to be good enough for us. And that just has not happened.
