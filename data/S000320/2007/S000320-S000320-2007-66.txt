 President, I rise to honor a distinguished colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, who is celebrating a major milestone--today becoming the longest serving Republican in Senate history.  Appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1968 and elected to finish out the term 2 years later, Stevens has since been reelected to the Senate six times, never receiving less than 67 percent of the vote in any election.  During his 38 years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stevens has been Chairman of four full committees and two select committees, assistant Republican whip, and the President Pro Tempore Emeritus.  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Stevens has been an ardent supporter of our national defense, serving as either chairman or ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee since 1980. A champion of our Armed Forces, he has ensured that our servicemembers have the equipment, training, and pay necessary to be prepared to take on those who threaten our national security.  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Stevens on reaching this historic milestone today. I am honored to call Senator Ted Stevens my colleague but prouder to call him my friend.
