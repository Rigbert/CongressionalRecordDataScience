 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I just wanted to mention to my friend that between 1985 and 1995, the workforce, the American workforce of General Electric went down from 245,000 to 150,000, precisely because it is the policy of General Electric to take American jobs to China and Mexico in order to get cheap labor. Does my friend not agree with me that we should use institutions like the Export-Import Bank to tell General Electric to reinvest in America so that we can create more good jobs like the one the gentleman referred to?
