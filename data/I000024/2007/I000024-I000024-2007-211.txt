There are a lot of people who didn't get everything they wanted. Every time we pass an authorization bill, whether it is transportation or a WRDA bill, if you don't have a lot of people upset, then you didn't do a very good job. We had to shave a lot of places. This sets us up, and this offers us discipline for the appropriation process when it comes along.  I say to my good conservative friends, this is the best way to do it, so we know when appropriation bills come up, certain things have been done. This is a major accomplishment. We were able to pass this before, last year. We are hoping now we are going to conference, and we can come back with something we can all support. I believe we will.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
