 President, I thank Chairman Baucus and his staff for working with us on what I believe are significant improvements to the original amendment Senator Grassley and I offered. This amendment has been cleared by both sides with a modification. This amendment, as modified, would simply require recipients of TARP funding to meet strict hiring standards to ensure nondisplacement of U.S. workers.  I thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this amendment. I yield to him. If not, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
