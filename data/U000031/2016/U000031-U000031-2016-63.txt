The resolution also creates a new system to claim, substantiate and resubstantiate, review, and adjudicate requests for protection of trade secrets.  Finally, it organizes the Federal-State regulatory relationship in a way that makes sense for promoting interstate and global commerce, but also recognizes the efforts taken by a number of States. The amendment makes accommodations for some existing State requirements and tort actions as well.  Today, we have a landmark, bipartisan, bicameral agreement that makes substantial changes to the existing law. This resolution is supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders, ranging from environmental and public health groups to large and small industrial organizations. It is worthy of every Member's support.  Before I close, I want to say a word of thanks to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Frank Pallone and Paul Tonko. I know the last couple of weeks have not exactly been a picnic--a few ants, et cetera--but they know that this is a better bill because of their involvement. But the real impetus behind this whole project has been John Shimkus. What a guy. Without his leadership, we simply never would have reached this point.  Also, I want to thank the dedicated and hardworking staff who tirelessly worked to get us where we are today: Dave McCarthy, Jerry Couri, Tina Richards, and Chris Sarley. I thank them all. At times it may not have been a labor of love, but we have got a finished product that will indeed make a difference.  This bill is good for jobs. It is good for consumers. It is good for the environment. It is the most meaningful and impactful update to issues involving the environment and the economy that we have made in many decades, and soon it will be law. The President will sign it, and he will be grateful for all of our hard work, dedication, and legislative achievement that every one of us can be proud of.
