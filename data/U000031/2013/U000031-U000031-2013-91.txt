This is certainly a very crucial issue for all Americans.  Last year, I would remind us that the House voted 326-81 in favor of the Shimkus amendment to increase the bill's funding for Yucca Mountain license review. This year, the committee has once again reflected the will of the House not just by funding the license review, but also providing the Department of Energy the authority to transfer funds to the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It's my understanding that this provision gives both DOE and the NRC the flexibility to make sure that the Yucca Mountain licensing case gets optimum resources, where needed, to make real progress in meeting our Nation's need for a safe repository to isolate our spent nuclear fuel and high-level defense waste.  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen).
