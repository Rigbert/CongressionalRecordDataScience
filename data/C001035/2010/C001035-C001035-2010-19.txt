President, Today I commend the James F. Doughty School of Bangor, ME, on being named a 2010 National Blue Ribbon School. This recognition of high accomplishment was bestowed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.  The Blue Ribbon Schools award, created in 1982, is considered the highest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for this national honor reflect the goals of our Nation's education reforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program is designed to honor public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement. This award recognizes that the James F. Doughty School has worked with its students to improve their academic standing and educational excellence.  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and students of the James F. Doughty School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens.  I also wish to commend Kennebunkport Consolidated School in Maine on being named a 2010 National Blue Ribbon School.
