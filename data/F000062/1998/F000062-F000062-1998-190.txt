 I understand the importance of this bill. I would very much welcome floor time to consider this bill as well.  However, I did indicate in our Democratic caucus that absent that opportunity, and because women all across this Nation are going through some of the same events that two women who brought this to my attention 3 years ago in California went through, and that is to show up to have a radical mastectomy at 7:30 in the morning, and then to be pushed out on the street at 4:30 that afternoon with drains in them, the effects of anesthetics still upon them, really unable even to walk--is it not true that what we strive to do is make a simple reform and say that no woman without the permission of her physician will be subject to this kind of treatment ever again in the United States of America?  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator from California is absolutely correct.  Let me say that we worked long and hard on this. We have many of our colleagues who, because of their commitment to deal with this--it is tragic when it hits a family it has so much of an impact--said you have to have at least 48 hours. In other words, 72 hours. And we finally have been working with the people in the medical community, and I must say we built a consensus where we recognize that we should not put any time limitation whatsoever.  If I might, Mr. President, we have the Senator from Montana who is waiting to make a statement. Might I propound a unanimous consent request that he be permitted to speak for up to 3 or 4 minutes as if in morning business, and that might we also have an additional 5 minutes then--we started late--so that he could make his statement, and then without my losing the right to continue and to hold the floor and continue our discussion with respect to this?
