 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. As the gentlemen knows, the Rosh Hashanah holiday falls in the middle of that week; and while we wanted to plan the voting schedule for that week around that holiday, and we are still trying to do that, we still believe it may be necessary for the House to be in session at some point in that week.
