Mr. Speaker, just 2 weeks ago, the Republican leadership brought to this floor a so-called scholarship proposal, an experiment that would drain $45 million out of public schools in the District of Columbia and give it to just 3 percent of students to attend private and religious schools. But taking money out of schools in the District of Columbia was not enough for them. Now they are coming after all public schools in every city, town and village in the Nation, draining resources from public schools and giving vouchers for a few to attend private and religious schools.                              {time}  1030  That is the Republican HELP Scholarship scheme. HELP the few, deprive the many, that is the Republican plan.  This voucher scheme will do nothing to rebuild our crumbling public schools, some overcrowded, or train teachers. Our children need our help. This is why Democrats believe in investing in public education. Public education for all, opportunity for all, scholarships for all, not vouchers for a privileged few.                          ____________________
