President, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of 2007, a bill that will strengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal law and provide new tools to help investigators and prosecutors attack public corruption nationwide. This is the time to restore the faith of the American people in their Government. Congress took an important step in that direction today in passing long-awaited ethics and lobbying reforms that will tighten restrictions on those of us who hold public office, and those who seek to lobby us on behalf of private industry. But rooting out the kinds of rampant public corruption we have seen in recent years requires us to go further and to give prosecutors the tools they need to effectively investigate and prosecute criminal public corruption offenses.  The most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our own rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on getting around the rules and banking that they will not get caught. These offenses are very difficult to detect and even harder to prove. Because they attack the core of our democracy, these offenses must be found out and punished. Congress must send a signal that it will not tolerate this corruption by providing better tools for Federal prosecutors to combat it. This b1ll will do exactly that.  The bill Senator Cornyn and I introduce today, like a bill that I introduced in the Senate in January, will provide investigators and prosecutors more time and resources to pursue public corruption cases. But it goes a step further by amending several key statutes to broaden their application in corruption contexts and to prevent corrupt public officials and their accomplices from evading or defeating prosecution based on existing legal ambiguities.  The bill will help improve the prosecution of public corruption offenses in three fundamental ways. First, the bill would give investigators and prosecutors more time and resources to uncover, charge, and prove three of the most serious and corrosive public corruption offenses. Specifically, it would extend the statute of limitations from 5 years to 6 years for prosecutions involving bribery, deprivation of honest services by a public official, and extortion by a public official. Public corruption cases are among the most difficult and time-consuming cases to investigate and prosecute. They often require the use of informants and electronic monitoring, as well as review of extensive financial and electronic records, techniques which take time to develop and implement. Bank fraud, arson and passport fraud, among otheroffenses, all have 10-year statutes of limitations. Public corruption offenses cut to the heart of our democracy, and a more modest increase to the statute of limitations is a reasonable step to help our corruption investigators and prosecutors do their jobs.  The bill would also provide significant additional funding for public corruption enforcement. Since 9/11, FBI resources have been shifted away from the pursuit of public corruption cases to counterterrorism. FBI Director Mueller has recently indicated that public corruption is now a top criminal investigative priority; but a September 2005 report by Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that, from 2000 to 2004, there was an overall reduction in public corruption matters handled by the FBI. This must be reversed; our bill will give Offices of Inspector General, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice additional resources to hire additional public corruption investigators and prosecutors. These offices will finally be able to have the manpower they need to track down and prosecute these difficult but crucially important cases.  Second, the bill contains a series of legislative fixes designed to improve the clarity and enhance the effectiveness of existing Federal corruption statutes, such as the law criminalizing the acceptance of bribes and gratuities, and the law that govern mail and wire fraud. The bribery-gratuities fix resolves ambiguity in the law by making clear that public officials may not accept anything of value, other than what is permitted by existing regulations, that is given to them because of their official position. Similarly, the bill appropriately expands the definition of what it means for a public official to perform an ``official act'' for the purposes of the bribery statute to include any actions that fall within the duties of that official's public office. The bill also adds two corruption-related crimes as predicates for the Federal wiretap and the racketeering statutes, lowers the transactional amount required for Federal prosecution of bribery involving federally-funded state programs, and expands venue for perjury and obstruction of justice prosecutions.  Third, the bill raises the statutory maximum penalties for theft of Government property and Federal bribery to reflect the serious and corrosive nature of these crimes, and to harmonize these statutory maximums with others for which Congress has already raised penalties. Increasing penalties in appropriate cases sends a message to would-be criminals and to the public that there will be severe consequences for breaching the public trust.  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct that we have recently witnessed in high-profile public corruption cases, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give investigators and prosecutors the tools and resources they need to enforce our laws. Passing the ethics and lobbying reform bill is a step in the right direction. But we must finish the job by strengthening the criminal law to enable Federal investigators and prosecutors to bring those who undermine the public trust to justice. I strongly urge Congress to do more to restore the public's faith in their Government.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1946       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
