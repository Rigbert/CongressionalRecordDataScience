Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record a letter from me to Speaker Hastert regarding H.R. 5689, making technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2006.     Hon. Dennis J. Hastert,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: On June 28, 2006 the House passed H.R.      5689, making technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable,      Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for      Users (SAFETEA: LU). Yesterday, I introduced a bill that      revises H.R. 5689 to incorporate changes that the Senate has      asked us to include (H.R. 6233). These changes are necessary      to ensure that all policies, programs and projects embodied      in last year's long-term highway, transit, and highway safety      authorization bill are implemented as intended by the      Congress.       On September 14, 2006 the House passed H. Res. 1000,      instituting a new standing order of the House with regard to      earmarks in authorization, appropriations, and tax measures.      H. Res. 1000 provides that, in order to consider a bill, the      committee of jurisdiction must list all earmarks included in      the bill and committee report along with the names of Members      requesting the earmarks.       The bi-partisan bill that I introduced yesterday has not      been reported by the Committee, so there is no report or list      of earmarks. In reading the standing order, I concluded that      the requirement that a list appear with this bill does not      apply because the point of order described in section 1(c) of      H. Res. 1000 does not lie against a bill considered under      suspension of the rules. I intend to move to suspend the      rules of the House to pass H.R. 6233.       This bill does not increase the amount of funding that is      designated for projects in SAFETEA: LU. There are changes to      the descriptions of projects that are currently in SAFETEA:      LU and there are some projects to replace projects in      SAFETEA: LU that cannot be executed or implemented. In this      correction bill, however, the total amount of funding      designated for projects is identical to the amount that was      designated in SAFETEA: LU.       Where this bill does provide funding (which is offset by a      rescission of contract authority), the legislative sections      providing such funding do not meet the earmarking definition,      because no entity is named as the intended recipient of the      funds. Where this bill does designate specific entities, or      amend underlying project designations in SAFETEA: LU, it does      not provide new funding. In addition this bill provides for      no new outlays. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has      scored the bill as reducing contract authority by $4 million      over five years.       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1961]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       SAFETEA-LU AMENDMENTS ACT                                 ______                                                              HON.
