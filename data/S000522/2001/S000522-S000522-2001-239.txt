Mr. Speaker, my office manager, Mary Christ, noted the followingthat I want to share with my colleagues. And I quote:       Suddenly, we are living in a new world.       This attack on the United States is worse than the Pearl      Harbor of the past.       Then, a known enemy struck at a far-away naval base.       Now, an unclear enemy has struck against the heart of the      nation.       Innocent civilians were turned into weapons, and innocent      civilians were the targets and the victims. It was      unspeakable brutality and terror.       It could not have been worse.       This was the day we will all remember.       This was the day the world changed.       For 10 years, we have been living in the optimism after the      fall of the Evil Empire and a new freedom around the world.      Now, a new Evil has struck.       A new war will be waged across world.       It will never be the same.  Thank you Mary!
