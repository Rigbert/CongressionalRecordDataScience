Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer legislation to help our nation and this body address the important task of disaster recovery.  We are engaged in significant efforts to mitigate future disasters like Hurricane Katrina, and efforts to improve the way in which the aftermath of such disasters are handled. The Committee I Chair, Transportation and Infrastructure, held a hearing today on rebuilding efforts in New Orleans. Other Committees are investigating and exploring other aspects of the situation. But we will never legislate disasters away, and we will never improve recovery to the point where disasters are painless. Or inexpensive.  Now, we can argue for months--and we probably will--about what causes the disasters this country faces regularly. Wild fires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes: They all have some human component that does at least contribute to the scope of the damage, if not the cause. But here now I would like to move beyond that discussion, and instead focus on what we know that we must do in the aftermath: raise and distribute funds to rebuild lives, repair infrastructure, and reforge communities.  We have so far appropriated $62.3 billion for recovery efforts in the Gulf region. There was another $8.5 appropriated for the Disaster Relief Fund for Fiscal Year 2005. Hurricane Katrina was a major disaster, but we have had others--there have been 1,572 major disaster declarations in the last 50 years, an average of 31 a year--and there will be more.  We must find a way to meet the inevitable needs that will arise after future disasters. We cannot continue deficit spending. After numerous discussions with others, and based upon the successful program during WWII, I would today like to introduce legislation to begin a ``Disaster Recovery Bond'' program, similar to Savings Bonds, but with the income from the bonds dedicated to disaster recovery. This money would supplement funds in the Disaster Recovery Fund, providing an additional pool of funds to be used during large scale disasters like Hurricane Katrina.  When a natural disaster--be it a hurricane, earthquake, tornado, or flood--hits a particular region or State, the rest of us can often feel disconnected because it's happening to ``them'' and not ``us.'' Buying bonds that are specifically designated for these types of disasters can help bring together Americans and create a sense of patriotism. This idea of individual Americans pitching in for the good of the Nation was instrumental in the success of the War Bonds during WWII.  As a Nation, we are great at reacting. This was evident in the days and weeks after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita when the American people contributed millions of dollars to countless nonprofit organizations to assist their efforts in the affected Gulf Coast region. However, we need to think of the future and be more proactive. Purchasing Disaster Recovery Bonds will offer Americans an opportunity to contribute towards recovery and reconstruction efforts for natural disasters that have not yet occurred but are inevitable.                          ____________________
