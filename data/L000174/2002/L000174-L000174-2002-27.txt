President, we have before us the nomination of United States District Court Judge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Judge Shedd's nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last Thursday on a voice vote. Nine Democratic Senators, including myself, voted against him. As I noted before, I told Senator Thurmond I intended to bring this matter to a vote by the committee this year. My concern at the penultimate meeting, the meeting before last week, a meeting we held in October, was that we had very little time to debate this controversial nominee and that threatened to prevent a committee vote on 17 other of the President's judicial nominees before the committee.  Incidentally, those 17 district court nominees and 2 circuit court nominees were confirmed by the Senate last week. Those 17 district court nominees were on the Senate Calendar because the Senate Judiciary Committee was able to report those nominees despite unparalleled personal attacks by Republicans on me as chairman. Those attacks have included everything from saying I am not bringing up nominees--although I am and we are at a record rate that far outpaces the Republican rate during their six and one-half years of control--to even attacks in these recent months on my religious beliefs as well as the religion of several of the members of the Democratic majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Notwithstanding these unprecedented attacks on both our religious beliefs and our actions, the confirmations last week bring to 99 the number of President Bush's judicial nominees confirmed by the Democratic-led Senate in the past 16 months.  I mention this because before that, during the 6\1/2\ years when the Republican majority controlled the Senate, they averaged 38 judicial confirmations per year. In fact, in the year 1996, over the whole year, they allowed only 17 district court judges to be confirmed all year and did not confirm a single circuit court nominee--not a single one. We had 17 district court judges in 1 meeting and those 17 nominees of President Bush were confirmed on one day last week by the Democratic-led Senate.  I put this in the record so the people understand the historic demonstration of my bipartisanship toward the President's judicial nominees in perspective with the recent history of judicial confirmations. The fact is that in addition to the 83 district court nominees confirmed, the Senate has also already confirmed 16 of his circuit court nominees. That is in sharp contrast to the fact that the Republicans allowed only 7 circuit court nominees to be confirmed per year, on average, during their control of the Senate. For example, more than half of President Clinton's circuit court nominees in the106th Congress were defeated through such obstruction--more than half.  In fact, the Fourth Circuit--to take one at random--is one of many circuits affected by the other party's obstruction of President Clinton's judicial nominees. In the Fourth Circuit, seven of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit were never given a hearing or a vote in committee or on the floor--seven out of that one circuit alone.  James Beaty, one of the Fourth Circuit nominees of President Clinton, did not get a hearing or a vote in 1995, or 1996, or 1997, or 1998. Another Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Richard Leonard, did not get a hearing or vote in 1995 or 1996.  Another Fourth Circuit nominee, James Wynn, did not get a hearing or a vote in 1999, 2000, or 2001. Other Fourth Circuit nominees--Elizabeth Gibson, Judge Andre Davis, or Judge Roger Gregory--also did not get hearings or votes during the period of Republican control of the Senate.  Indeed, the first hearing the Judiciary Committee held last year on a judicial nominee was for an earlier Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Roger Gregory. He had been nominated initially by President Clinton when the Republicans were in control. They did not act on him. He was brought back by President Bush, and he became the first judge confirmed to the Fourth Circuit in several years. He was also the first African American confirmed to the Fourth Circuit in American history. That is because our committee in the Senate acted in the summer of 2001. Judge Gregory was the first of 20 circuit court nominees on whom we proceeded to hold hearings in our 16 months in the majority.  So the partisan rhetoric about the Judiciary Committee having blockaded President Bush's judicial nominees and having treated nominees unfairly might be a good stump speech on the circuit, but it is belied by the facts. Frankly, I think the staff at the White House who have put those kinds of misstatements in the President's speeches have done the President a disservice, as they have the Senate.  Turning to the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, I cannot fail to note that it is not without controversy. In fact, it is quite controversial. Issues in his judicial record raised cause for concern among many Senators on the Judiciary Committee as well as with many citizens who live in the jurisdiction of the Fourth Circuit and elsewhere in the country who have written to the Senate in opposition to his elevation and confirmation.  While considering the information gathered in the hearing process, I placed Judge Shedd's nomination on the committee agenda in September. That was my effort to show Senator Thurmond courtesy as a former chairman and to signal that I expected this committee to proceed to consider the nomination before the year was out. Several Senators asked to hold the nomination over, and under the rules any Senator can.  On October 7, when I hoped to be able to list his name for consideration again, I was told there would be a debate so lengthy that we would not even be able to consider the 17 other judicial nominations of President Bush that were on the agenda or, for that matter, the legislative matters we were trying to take up before the election. So I told Senator Thurmond, and other Senators before that markup, it was for this reason that I would not list Judge Shedd's nomination on the agenda for the October 8 markup, but I explained to Senator Thurmond and others that I hoped we would be able to consider it at our next opportunity, as we knew at that point we would have a lame duck session. So now, having the lame duck session, I scheduled as soon as we came back and Senators would be here a markup on Judge Shedd and one other judicial nominee.  The committee has received more than 1,200 letters from individuals and organizations, both in and out of South Carolina, expressing concerns about elevating Judge Shedd. In fact, right here, it stands about 2 feet high--the stack of letters we got against it. These letters raise serious issues. What I heard about the nominee from the citizens of South Carolina and from others around the country was and is troubling.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed samples of letters such as those from citizens of South Carolina in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    South Carolina                                     Legislative Black Caucus,                                  Columbia, SC, September 4, 2002.     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The South Carolina Legislative Black      Caucus (SCLBC) was formed in 1975 soon after the Civil Rights      Movement in the 1960's. Presently, the SCLBC has 31 members:      seven senators and 24 representatives, including four women.      The SCLBC is dedicated to the struggle for fairness, equality      and justice for all South Carolinians, and to the civic and      political involvement of African-Americans, women and other      racial and ethnic minorities.       We seek to preserve the civil rights strides that occurred      in South Carolina over the decades, and we fight to prevent      any regressive step that threatens to rollback civil rights      and constitutional rights of American-Americans, women and      other racial and ethnic minorities. The nomination of U.S.      District Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Fourth Circuit represents such a regressive step, and      accordingly, we strongly oppose the nomination.       African-Americans constitute a full one-third of South      Carolina's population, yet there is only one active African-     American federal judge in the state. And, there are only two      South Carolinian female federal judges, one on the federal      District Court and the other on the Fourth Circuit. This is      unfair and unjustified because there are many well-qualified      African-American and women jurists and lawyers who deserve an      opportunity to serve this nation on the federal judiciary.       Because African-Americans are one-third of South Carolina's      population and the Fourth Circuit has a greater number of      African-Americans than any circuit, it is critical that any      nominee, especially one from South Carolina, be an unabashed      champion of civil rights. The appointee should have a record      that demonstrates fairness and justice to all people. Based      on our careful review of Judge Dennis Shedd's performance on      the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina,      we have concluded that his record shows a serious hostility      to civil rights and constitutional protections.       Since his appointment to the federal bench in South      Carolina, Judge Shedd has engaged in right-wing judicial      activism by imposing strict and exacting standards when      reviewing employment discrimination cases brought by African      Americans and women. He has dismissed almost every employment      discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights and      disability case that has come before him. Judge Shedd seems      to believe that discrimination is not an actionable offense      even when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has      found ``reasonable cause'' that discrimination has occurred.      Judge Shedd, however, seems to apply a more lenient standard      in reviewing discrimination cases brought by white men. Judge      Shedd has allowed four out of five ``reverse'' discrimination      cases to proceed beyond the summary judgment phase of      litigation.       This record shows that Judge Shedd does not have an abiding      concern for civil rights and fairness. It further shows that      Shedd lacks the requisite moderate reasoning to bring balance      to the Fourth Circuit. In fact, his membership to the Fourth      Circuit would push it further beyond the mainstream of      American values and would subject South Carolinians and      residents of other states within the Fourth Circuit to an      extreme right-wing interpretation of this nation's civil      rights laws and constitutional protections.       Accordingly, we oppose Judge Shedd's nomination without      reservation. His values represent the Old South, where      African Americans and women were judged by different and      unequal standards.       We appreciate your attention. If you have any questions,      please contact me at the address and telephone number above.           Sincerely,                                                   Joseph H. Neal,     Chairman.                                  ____         South Carolina State Conference, National Association for            the Advancement of Colored People,                                      Columbia, SC, June 24, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to oppose the nomination of      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.       By now, you must be familiar with the importance of the      Fourth Circuit to the African American community. Almost a      quarter of the Fourth Circuit's residents are African      American. The Fourth Circuit, with over 6 million African      Americans in the five states, has the greatest number of      African Americans of any Circuit Court in the country. The      Latino population within the Fourth Circuit now at more than      one million persons, has nearly tripled in the last decade.      Based on     these demographics, more may be at stake here for the future      of civil rights than in any other Circuit Court in the      country.       The Fourth Circuit is already an extremely conservative      Court on civil rights and Constitutional issues. This Circuit      ruled that federal law-enforcement officials need not follow      the Miranda decision, only to be reversed by the Supreme      Court. This Circuit authorized drug testing for pregnant      women without their consent, which was reversed by the      Supreme Court. This Circuit ruled that the Equal Employment      Opportunity Commission was limited to remedies contained in      employee arbitration agreements, and again, was reversed by      the Supreme Court. The Circuit also has been reversed      recently in capital habeas corpus cases and citizen suits      under environmental laws. The Fourth Circuit has issued      numerous other opinions that are hostile to affirmative      action, women's rights, fair employment, and voting rights.       This is also the Court to which moderate African American      nominees were repeatedly denied membership. No fewer than      four African Americans were nominated to this Court by      President Clinton, only to have their nominations languish      for years due to Senatorial obstruction. Thus, if a nominee      is to be confirmed to this Court, the nominee must be a      jurist who will bring moderation and ideological balance to      this Court. It is our strongly held view that this nominee is      not Dennis Shedd.       Judge Shedd's judicial record reveals a deep and abiding      hostility to civil rights cases. A review of Shedd's      unpublished opinions reveals that Judge Shedd has dismissed      all but very few of the civil rights cases coming before him.      In nearly thirty cases involving racial discrimination in      employment, he granted summary judgment for the employer in      whole or in part in all but one case; most of the cases were      dismissed altogether. Many of these cases were strong cases      with compelling evidence and litigated by experienced civil      rights lawyers.       Gender and disability discrimination cases before Judge      Shedd fare no better. He has granted summary judgment on      every sexual harassment claim on which summary judgment was      requested. Collectively, these rulings leave us with the      distinct impression that, in Dennis Shedd's view of the      world, discrimination does not exist, and just as      importantly, a jury should never be asked even to decide that      question.       We are profoundly disturbed by the mounting evidence of      Judge Shedd's zealous efforts to assist the defense in civil      rights cases. There are repeated instances of Judge Shedd's      intervention in civil rights cases--without prompting by the      defendant--in ways that are detrimental to the plaintiff      case. In a number of cases, Judge Shedd, on his own motion,      has questioned whether he should dismiss civil rights claims      outright or grant summary judgment. He has invited defendants      to file for attorneys' fees and costs against civil rights      plaintiffs. These are not the actions of an impartial      decision-maker.       We are extremely concerned about Judge Shedd's rulings      promoting ``States' rights,'' and view these as a fundamental      encroachment on Congress's ability to enact civil rights and      other legislation. Judge Shedd has a very restrictive view of      Congressional power. He struck down the Driver's Privacy      Protection Act of 1994 as legislation beyond Congress's      power, although this legislation was an ``anti-stalking''      measure designed to prohibit public disclosure of drivers'      license information. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice      Rehnquist, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned Judge      Shedd's ruling and refuted his reasoning. This stands as one      of the few occasions in which the Supreme Court rejected      unanimously a holding that Congress exceeded its power in      enacting a statute.       The question of judicial temperament is raised by Judge      Shedd's offensive remarks during a judicial proceeding about      an issue that strikes at the heart of many--the Confederate      flag. Judge Shedd presided over a federal lawsuit seeking the      removal of the Confederate flag from the dome of the South      Carolina Statehouse. According to press accounts of a hearing      held in the case, Judge Shedd made several derogatory      comments about opposition to the flag. First, he attempted to      marginalize opponents to the flag by questioning whether the      flag matters to most South Carolinians. (It does, and thirty      percent of South Carolina's population is African American.)      He also minimized the deep racial symbolism of the flag by      comparing it to the Palmetto tree, which appears in South      Carolina's State flag.       Our membership in South Carolina, deserves to be      represented on the Circuit by a nominee who has a record of      judicial impartiality, is committed to the progress made on      civil rights and individual liberties, and has a deep respect      for the responsibility of the federal judiciary to uphold      that progress. Dennis Shedd is not that nominee. We urge you      and the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against his      nomination.            Sincerely,                                                    James Gallman,                                                        President.
