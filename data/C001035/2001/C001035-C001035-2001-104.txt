President, I am pleased to join my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing legislation to improve access to oral health care by strengthening the dental workforce in our nation's rural and underserved communities.  Oral and general health are inseparable, and good dental care is critical to our overall physical health and well-being. Dental health encompasses far more than cavities and gum disease. The recent U.S. Surgeon General report Oral Health in America states that ``the mouth acts as a mirror of health and disease'' that can help diagnose disorders such as diabetes, leukemia, heart disease, or anemia.  While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last 50 years, these improvements have not occurred evenly across all sectors of our population, particularly among low-income individuals and families. Too many Americans today lack access to dental care. While there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delaythe progression of dental health problems, an estimated 25 million Americans live in areas lacking adequate dental services. As a consequence, these effective treatment and prevention programs are not available in too many of our communities. Astoundingly, as many as eleven percent of our nation's rural population has never been to a dentist.  This situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce is graying and the overall ratio of dentists to population is declining. In Maine, for example, there currently are 393 active dentists, 241 of whom are 45 or older. More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will retire in the next ten years, and the number of dental graduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees.  As a consequence, Maine, like many States, is currently facing a serious shortage of dentists, particularly in rural areas. While there is one general practice dentist for every 2,286 people in the Portland area, the numbers drop off dramatically in western and northern Maine. In Aroostook County, where I am from, there's only one dentist for every 5,507 people. Moreover, at a time when tooth decay is the most prevalent childhood disease in America, Maine has fewer than ten specialists in pediatric dentistry, and most of these are located in the southern part of the state.  This dental workforce shortage is exacerbated by the fact that Maine currently does not have a dental school or even a dental residency program. Dental schools can provide a critical safety net for the oral health needs of a state, and dental education clinics can provide the surrounding communities with care that otherwise would be unavailable to disadvantaged and underinsured populations. Maine is just one of a number of predominantly rural states that lacks this important component of a dental safety net.  Maine, like many States, is exploring a number of innovative ideas for increasing access to dental care in underserved areas. In an effort to supplement and encourage these efforts, we are introducing legislation today to establish a new State grant program designed to improve access to oral health services in rural and underserved areas. The legislation authorizes $50 million over 5 years for grants to States to help them develop innovative dental workforce development programs specific to their individual needs.  States could use these grants to fund a wide variety of programs. For example, they could use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment programs for dentists practicing in underserved areas. They could also use them to provide grants and low- or no-interest loans to help practitioners to establish or expand practices in these underserved areas. States, like Maine, that do not have a dental school could use the funds to establish a dental residency program. Other States might want to use the grant funding to establish or expand community or school-based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental clinics.  To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts, States could also use the funds for placement and support of dental students, residents, and advanced dentistry trainees. Or, they could use the grant funds for continuing dental education, including distance-based education, and practice support through teledentistry.  Other programs that could be funded through the grants include: community-based prevention services such as water fluoridation and dental sealant programs; school programs to encourage children to go into oral health or science professions; the establishment or expansion of a State dental office to coordinate oral health and access issues; and any other activities that are determined to be appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The National Health Service Corps is helping to meet the oral health needs of underserved communities by placing dentists and dental hygienists in some of America's most difficult-to-place inner city, rural, and frontier areas. Unfortunately, however, the number of dentists and dental hygienists with obligations to serve in the National Health Service Corps falls far short of meeting the total identified need. According to the Surgeon General, only about 6 percent of the dental need in America's rural and underserved communities is currently being met by the National Health Service Corps.  In my State, approximately 173,000 Mainers live in designated dental health professional shortage areas. While the National Health Service Corps estimates that it will take 33 dental clinicians to meet this need, it currently has only three serving in my State.  The bill we are introducing today would make some needed improvements in this critically important program so that it can better respond to our nation's oral health needs.  First, it would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and implement a plan for increasing the participation of dentists and dental hygienists in the National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan repayment programs.  It would also allow National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan repayment program recipients to fulfill their commitment on a part-time basis. Some small rural communities may not have sufficient populations to support a full-time dentist or dental hygienist. This would give the National Health Service Corps additional flexibility to meet the needs of these communities. Moreover, some practitioners may find part-time service more attractive to them. This particularly may be the case for a retired dentist who may want to practice only part-time, allowing this feasibility could in turn improve both recruitment and retention in these communities.  Last year, after a 6-year hiatus, the National Health Service Corps began a two-year pilot program to award scholarships to dental students.  This is a step in the right direction, however, these scholarships are only being awarded to students attending certain dental schools, not one of which is located in New England. Moreover, the pilot project requires the participating dental schools to encourage Corps dental scholars to practice in communities near their educational institutions. The problem is obvious. If none of these programs are in New England, and yet there is a requirement that the dentists participating in these programs practice in the surrounding communities, this is of no benefit to a State such as Maine that does not have a dental school and does not have a qualifying program. As a consequence, this program will do nothing at all to help relieve the dental shortage in Maine and other areas of New England.  The legislation we are introducing today would address this problem by expanding the National Health Service Corps Pilot Scholarship Program so that dental students attending any of the 55 American dental schools can apply and require that placements for these scholars be based strictly on community need, not on whether or not they surround the dental school.  It would also improve the process for designating dental health professional shortage areas and ensure that the criteria for making such designations provide a more accurate reflection of oral health needs, particularly in our rural areas where the problem is most acute.  And finally, taxing the scholarships and stipends of students adversely affects their financial incentive to participate in the National Health Service Corps and to provide health care services in underserved communities. Our legislation would, therefore, exclude from Federal income tax the fees and related educational expenses to individuals who are participating in the National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan repayment programs.  The Dental Health Improvement Act will make critically important oral health care services more accessible in our Nation's rural and underserved communities. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supportin this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that letters endorsing my bill from the American Dental Association and the American Dental Education Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  American Dental Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Dental      Association and our 144,000 member dentists, I am delighted      to endorse     the ``Dental Health Improvement Act,'' which you introduced      today. The Association is proud that the oral health of      Americans continues to improve, and that Americans have      access to the best oral health care in the world.       Having said that, we agree that dental care has not reached      every corner of American society to the extent it has reached      the majority of Americans. For those Americans who are unable      to pay for care, and those with special needs, such as      disabled individuals, those with congenital conditions, and      non-ambulatory patients, obtaining dental care can be      difficult.       Your legislation recognizes several of these problems and      goes a long way towards addressing them in a targeted and      meaningful way. The section on grant proposals offers states      the opportunity to be innovative in their approaches to      address specific geographical dental workforce issues. You      recognize the need to provide incentives to increase faculty      recruitment in accredited dental training institutions, and      your support for increasing loan repayment and scholarship      programs will provide the appropriate incentives to increase      the dental workforce in ``safety net'' organizations.       The ADA is very grateful for your leadership on these      issues. Thank you for introducing this legislation. We want      to continue to work with you on dental access issues in      general and on this legislation as it moves through the      Congress.           Sincerely,                                               Robert M. Anderton,     D.D.S., J.D., LL.M., President.                                  ____                                                   American Dental                                        Education Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing on behalf of the dental      education community to commend you for developing and      introducing the Dental Health Improvement Act. This      legislation, when enacted into law, will expand the      availability of oral health care services for the nation's      underserved populations, strengthen the dental workforce, as      well as maintain the ability of dental schools to produce the      necessary manpower to provide oral health care to all      Americans.       The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) represents      the nation's 55 dental schools, as well as hospital-based      dental and advanced dental education programs, allied dental      programs and schools, dental research institutions, and the      faculty and students at these institutions. ADEA's member      schools are dedicated to providing the highest quality      education to their students, conducting research and      providing oral health care services to Americans from      medically unserved and underserved areas, the majority of      whom are uninsured or who are from low-income families.      Recent downward trends in student enrollment and a growing      shortage in dental faculty have caused ADEA serious concern      about our ability to fully and competently address these      responsibilities.       Therefore, I was delighted to see that the Dental Health      Improvement Act directly responds to many of these concerns.      If implemented, the Act would expand access to oral health      care to thousands of Americans for the first time. When      enacted, the provisions of the bill can be instrumental in      helping the more than 31 million Americans living in ares      that lack access to adequate oral health care services. It      can provide much needed help to dental education institutions      as we seek to address faculty shortages.       As you know, dental education institutions face a major      crisis in the graying of its faculty which threatens the      quality of dental education, oral, dental and craniofacial      research, and ultimately will adversely impact the health of      all Americans. Currently, there are approximately 400 faculty      vacancies. Retirements are expected to accelerate in both      private practice as well as teaching faculties in the      nation's 55 dental schools. There is a significant decrease      in the number of men and women choosing careers in dentistry,      teaching and research. Your personal experience in Maine is a      perfect example.       Educational debt has increased, affecting both career      choices and practice location. Your bill will provide funds      to help with recruitment and retention efforts and helps      expand dental residency training programs to the 27 states      that do not currently have dental schools.       Also important are the incentives you have proposed to      expand or establish community-based dental facilities linked      with dental education institutions. The need for this is      obvious. More than two-thirds of patients visiting dental      school clinics are members of families whose annual income is      estimated to be $15,000 or below. About half of these      patients are on Medicare or Medicaid, while more than a third      have no insurance coverage or government assistance program      to help them pay for their dental care.       Dental academic institutions are committed to their patient      care mission, not only by improving the management and      efficiency of patient centered care delivery at the dental      school, but through increasing affiliations with and use of      satellite clinics. All dental schools maintain at least one      dental clinic on-site, and approximately 70% of U.S. dental      schools have school-sponsored satellite clinics. Delivering      patient care in diverse settings demonstrates professional      responsibility to the oral health of the public.       Dental schools and other academic dental institutions      provide oral health to underserved and disadvantaged      populations. Yet more than 11 percent of the nation's rural      population has never been to see a dentist. This bill can      have a positive impact on this population by establishing      access to oral health care at community-based dental      facilities and consolidated health centers that are linked to      dental schools. 100 million Americans presently do not have      access to fluoridated water. The bill provides for community-     based prevention services such as fluoride and sealants that      can cause a dramatic change for nearly a third of the      nation's population.       Thank you again for taking such a leadership role in the      area of oral health. Please be assured that ADEA looks      forward to working closely with you to bring the far-reaching      potential of the Dental Health Improvement Act to fruition.           Sincerely,                                            Richard W. Valachovic,                               D.M.D., M.P.H., Executive Director.
