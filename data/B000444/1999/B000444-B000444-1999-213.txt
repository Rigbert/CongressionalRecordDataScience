 President, let me begin by thanking the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member. This is a bit unusual. I am violating what the Senator from South Carolina would recognize as the Russell Long rule.  When I first came to the Senate, Russell Long, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, was chairman of the Finance Committee. One day I walked up to him because I had an amendment to a finance bill. He said: I will accept it. I said: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Then I got back to my seat in the back row, and a staff person who had worked here longer than I had--I had only been here about 3 months--said: Senator, you really want a rollcall vote on that.  So I went ahead and I did my little spiel. Then I asked for the yeas and nays. The roll was called, and Russell Long voted against the amendment and encouraged others to vote against it. It was defeated. I walked up to him and said: Mr. Chairman, my Lord, you told me just 15 minutes ago you would accept my amendment. He said: Yes, I would accept your amendment. But I did not say anything about a rollcall vote.  We are not going to have, I hope, a rollcall vote on this amendment. I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for accepting the amendment. I apologize to him for speaking on something that is going to be accepted. But I think this is of such consequence that it is important to remind our colleagues of what we are about to redo.  A few weeks ago, the Appropriations Committee zeroed out all funding for the COPS Program, nearly closing the doors of what I believe to be the most successful Federal-State cooperative law enforcement program of our time.  This amendment corrects the committee's elimination of the funding for the COPS office in the fiscal year 2000. It restores funding for the COPS office to perform many of the significant functions in support of law enforcement--particularly in getting more cops out on the street.  In doing so, it supersedes--or, basically, makes void--the language in the committee report on pages 62 and 63 that would have directed the Justice Department to take steps to dismantle the COPS office. Under this amendment, the COPS office will remain alive and well for fiscal year 2000.  I am pleased today we have put aside partisan politics in support of this effective law enforcement program. Let me make it clear, although some of my colleagues on the Republican side worry a little bit about this being a Democratic program, it is not a Democratic program. It is a bipartisan program. It is a program where even this amendment has garnered the cosponsorship of four Republicans and the commitment of another several to vote for it. I predict there will be more Republicans to vote for it as well.  I am glad that we have listened to the police officers on the street, the police chiefs, the prosecutors, the mayors, the citizens of our communities, and our constituents about why they think the COPS Program has worked so well.  As I said, today, joined by 42 of my colleagues, including four Republicans, I offer this amendment to restore the COPS Program for fiscal year 2000. This amendment restores $495 million in funding for the COPS Program for the year 2000.  This is just one-third of the $1.43 billion that was appropriated in 1999. But it preserves this vitally important program that has thus far funded over 100,000 cops in communities across the country.  Here is how it will work: $170 million will come from unobligated balances for this fiscal year for the COPS office; $5 million in unobligated funds from the Bureau of Prisons; $140 million are shifted back to the COPS office for programs that it already has successfully administered in the past.  These include the Cops Connect Program, which provides equipment and upgrades so that officers from different jurisdictions can talk to each other and share vital information; it also includes targeted funding for equipment that protects police officers, such as bulletproof vests; and for training to identify and take down methamphetamine and other drug laboratories.  And $180 million are put back into the COPS Program to fund the hiring of up to an additional 2,400 officers in our public school system.  Most importantly, this amendment restores to the COPS office its primary function: putting more cops on the street. Under this amendment, therewill be funding sufficient to put 1,500 additional local law enforcement officers out on the streets in our communities.  I think we can all agree that this is a small price to pay for lower crime rates, safer communities, safer schools, more advanced law enforcement equipment, and more responsive police departments.
