 President, it seems to be ``deja vu all over again'' to quote Yogi Berra--last year we had to fight an effort on the House side to slash funds for the crime law trust fund, and it looks like we are going to have to do the same this year.  The amendment which I propose today gives the entire Senate the opportunity to express its support for full funding of the violent crime control trust fund enacted in the 1994 crime law. Let me point out that the Senate budget resolution offered by Chairman Domenici does the right thing on the trust fund--Chairman Domenici fully funds the President's $5 billion request for the trust fund for 1997. This recognizes that the $5 billion for the trust fund is already paid for by the reduction of the Federal work force by 272,000 employees.  The problem is that the budget resolution proposed by the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives which passed just last week by a narrow, partisan vote of 226 to 195--221 Republicans voted for it, 4 against; 190 Democrats voted against, 5 voted for it--cut the President's $5 billion request for the trust fund by $300 million.  This is less than the $900 million cut that had been proposed by the Republican leadership of the House--but this is still a significant cut that I must oppose.  If the House proposed cut of $300 million is allowed to stand there can be only one result--fewer Federal dollars will be available to combat crime. As my colleagues know, the general numbers of the budget resolution do not specify which programs will be cut--but it is clear that some programs must be cut.  What specifically might this mean? Let us just review the law enforcement efforts funded by the crime law trust fund:  Federal prosecutors, $55 million;  FBI, $40 million; DEA, $200 million; border enforcement and deporting aliens who break the law, $525 million; violence against women efforts including more police and prosecutors and more shelters for battered women, $254 million; $1 billion for constructing prisons and reimbursing States for imprisoning criminal aliens; and an additional $2.6 billion to aid State and local law enforcement--whether it is through the 100,000 Cops Program I favor or the block grant favored by the other side, I do not believe that any Senator favors a smaller total for State and local law enforcement.  We all know there is no free lunch--so if there is a cut in the total for the trust fund, at least some of the pieces of the trust fund must be cut. For that reason, I call upon the entire Senate to go on record as opposing the House cut to the President's $5 billion request for the crime law trust fund.  But, let me also point out that even if we pass the resolution I am offering today, and even if the House Republican majority ultimately agrees to fully fund the President's request for the trust fund--even if all that happens, a massive shortfall in the President's request for crime fighting resources will still have been made by the budget resolutions adopted by the Republican majority.  To quickly review the facts on the total ``administration of justice'' account--compare what the Senate and House budget resolutions offer for the non-trust fund portion of the ``administration of justice'' account that pays for the entire Justice Department--FBI, DEA, prisons, everything--and the courts:                                                                BillionPresident request.................................................$18.5House budget resolution............................................17,4Senate budget resolution...........................................16.7  These are massive cuts--the House proposes to slash the President's request for crime fighting dollars by $1.1 billion; the Senate proposes a cut $1.8 billion.  What happened to all this ``tough on crime'' rhetoric we have been hearing from all sides? It seems that the President held up his end of the bargain--requesting the largest-ever annual budget for the FBI, DEA, U.S. attorneys, and help for State and local prisons and police. But, the Congress controlled by the other party has been ``AWOL--absent without law enforcement.''  Unless there is a major change to restore these funds when the House and Senate budget conferees meet--we can expect but one result when the appropriators develop their bills later this year. Massive cuts in Federal law enforcement because the appropriators will have no choice--if we shrink the budget pie for law enforcement, there is no way to provide all the slices. It is just that simple.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment I am offering on behalf of myself, and Senators Leahy, Kohl, and Hatch.
