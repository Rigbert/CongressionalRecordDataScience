 I would like to ask the Democratic leader a question, if I might. What objection does he have against my amendment, which is a simple amendment which simply says if the State can provide adequate evidence to the EPA that it can burn or refine gasoline to meet clean air standards that it should not be required to use ethanol? What objection does he have to that?
