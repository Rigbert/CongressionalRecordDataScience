Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, relative to the legislation, I would like to point out that important changes have happened since our House approved this legislation on July 27. Additional funding was added to the original House bill, a total of $1.2 billion. As a result, important water-related infrastructure projects not funded in the Senate's version of the bill were retained in the final conference agreement. I am pleased that we were able to assist so many Members with important water-related projects in their individual congressional district.  On the matter of national policy, I would point out that two legislative provisions in Title I of the bill were modified by the conference committee late last week during intense negotiations. Specifically, legislative language had been included in the conference report creating in statutory language a new administrative appeal system in the Corps of Engineers related to jurisdictional determinations for wetlands.  Again, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, there are a number of other very worthwhile provisions in this legislation, and I would encourage my colleagues to support the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bentsen).  (
