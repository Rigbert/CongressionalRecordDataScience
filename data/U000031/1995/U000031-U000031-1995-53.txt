Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, during the last couple of days I have been spending quite a bit of time talking to folks on the front line, folks in Kalamazoo, MI, and all across southwestern Michigan, in terms of what they think would be the best choice as we fight the tough issue of the crime problem. As I have talked to every one of my folks, prosecutors, judges, police chiefs, and community activists, they have all said, ``FRED, we want flexibility. We want to be able to decide in our community what is best. We don't want all these strings coming from Washington,'' and the way this bill has been crafted is exactly the way they would support it on the front line.  This is the right bill. We should allow the flexibility at the local level so that they can decide what is best for their communities.                              {time}  1350  I would urge that we vote ``no'' on this particular amendment, and vote in favor of it when it comes on final passage later this evening.  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
