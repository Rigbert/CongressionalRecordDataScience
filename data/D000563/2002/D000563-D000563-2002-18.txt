Recent news stories indicate the former national security adviser John Poindexter is working at the Department of Defense to develop a plan to shift private database research in fear that it might be useful for intelligence purposes. That proposal raises some privacy questions, I concede. Another mistaken news story suggests that homeland security will facilitate that kind of investigation into private databases.  My proposal has nothing to do with this DOD plan. My proposal focuses only on making sure the Federal Government computer databases can communicate with one another when necessary to make certain, for example, that the INS and the FBI can share internal information--not information on private databases--to help protect against terrorist risk.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
