President, reserving the right to object, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, if the Senator from Alabama would be kind enough to show us a copy of his amendment, we may be able to enter into this agreement very quickly.  I would like to see the amendment, if he wouldn't mind. I have seen Senator Ford's amendment. I believe the time allocation we have been talking about is a reasonable one. But I wonder if the Senator from Alabama is asking for 30 minutes for his amendment in the second degree. Is that my understanding?
