President, if I may ask the Senator to yield for a question, I wish there were a way to engage the Senator from Oklahoma because it is his amendment, and I would like to hear his response. I hold in my hand a publication from the Department of Justice which you can find on the Web site. I invite my colleagues to go to the Web site. They can read this official publication from the Department of Justice, and this is what they will learn. It is entitled, ``Know Your Rights.''       Do you have trouble with English? Are you unable to speak,      read, write, or understand English well? If so, you are      limited in English proficiency. Federal agencies and      organizations which get money from the Federal Government      have to take reasonable steps to help people who have trouble      with English. Sometimes when a government agency or      organization does not help you because you are limited in      English proficiency, they violate the law. This is called      ``national origin discrimination.''  They go on to say:       There is a Federal law that protects your civil rights. The      law is called ``Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.''  It goes on with examples of possible discrimination. If you come to a hospital and you have limited English proficiency, they are supposed to be able to try to help you understand what your rights are and treat you.  Are we changing that? Will the Inhofe amendment change that? If it doesn't, why are we enacting this? If this is law which we are comfortable with and will live with--and it is currently law in the United States--why are we trying to change it? If we are eliminating this protection which is currently in the law, recognized by the Department of Justice, why are we eliminating it?  That is my question.
