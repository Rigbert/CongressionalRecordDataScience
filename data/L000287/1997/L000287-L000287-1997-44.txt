Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important for this Congress to consider than campaign finance reform. The American people ask for it, the President asks for it, and Members of this Congress support it. Two years ago the President and the Speaker shook hands on it.  Mr. Speaker, this year, many of us sent a letter to the Speaker, a reminder, asking for consideration of campaign finance reform within 100 days.  One hundred days have come and gone, and this leadership refuses to act. Instead, they are closing down all business in the House so they can go to New York for a fundraiser. That is right. Tonight the House will close early, very early, so Republicans can go and raise more money, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars.  Mr. Speaker, this is no way to represent the American people. We deserve better. Bring campaign finance reform to this floor and stop stone-walling.                          ____________________
