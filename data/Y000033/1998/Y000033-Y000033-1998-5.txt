Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1132.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1132 and urge my colleagues to pass this measure.  S. 1132 is a bill introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman and has a companion bill, H.R. 3936 which was introduced by Congressman Bill Redmond, both from the State of New Mexico. Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Redmond have worked hard to develop a bill that will increase the size of Bandelier National Monument and protect its watershed.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1132 modifies the boundary to include lands within the upper watershed of the Bandelier National Monument which potentially can threaten the Monument with flooding, erosion, and water quality. The expansion will include approximately 935 acres of land and can only be acquired with the consent of the landowner. This boundary expansion will help enhance and protect the lands within the Bandelier National Monument.  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1132.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
