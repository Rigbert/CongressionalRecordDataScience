President, today I will be introducing a major piece of legislation with Senator Kassebaum and Senator Burns.  As a frequent user of the air traffic control system, I have a very real stake in addressing the persistent problems which have plagued the FAA for many years. Former Senator Barry Goldwater accurately described way back in 1975 the current FAA shortcomings when he introduced a bill to reestablish the FAA as an independent agency.  Senator Goldwater noted, and this was back in 1975, 20 years ago:       In 1967, when the then new Department of Transportation was      created, the Federal Aviation Agency was terminated and its      powers and functions were transferred to and vested in the      Secretary of DOT. The previously independent Federal Aviation      Agency was in effect converted to a new bureau within the      Department of Transportation, named the Federal Aviation      Administration. The Administrator of this ``bureau'' reports      to and is subject to the control of the Secretary of      Transportation.  Barry Goldwater went on to say, 20 years ago:       There is extensive evidence to show that subsequent to this      transformation, there has been undue interference on the part      of the Department of Transportation in the internal affairs      of the Federal Aviation Administration, so much so that the      FAA's procurement process has been slowed down to an average      time period of 1\1/2\ years or more--  I understand it is more than that today, but I am quoting from 20 years ago.     resulting in the cancellation of many procurement projects or      unnecessary losses in the millions of dollars to companies      involved. It is important to note, too, that aviation users,      who pay much of the money which goes into the Airport and      Airway Trust Fund, have no effective participation in the      development of FAA finance plans so long as it is under the      Department.  These words that were stated on the floor of the Senate by Senator Barry Goldwater 20 years ago are just as true today as they were then. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass the Goldwater bill. The problems Senator Goldwater identified in 1975 are yet to be resolved.  As a pilot, I have found holding town hall meetings in small towns and airports is an effective way of communicating with people. In doing these on the weekends--virtually every weekend, I do 10 or so--I talk to pilots, I talk to controllers. I do not think there is a controller that I do not know by their first name in Oklahoma.  They all agree that something needs to be done about changing the FAA. Even though Barry Goldwater attempted to do this back 20 years ago, what he said then is true today and we need to do it.  A careful analysis of these proposals that have been made in order to corporatize or privatize shows that they really do not work and there is a lack of understanding.  Mr. President, there has been an effort by the administration to privatize or corporatize the FAA. I think that while I do believe in privatizing, it is not appropriate in this case.  People who use the system oppose the privatization of the FAA. After working with users of the system, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to come up with a workable solution. Along with Senators Conrad Burns and Nancy Kassebaum, I am introducing legislation to reform the Federal Aviation Administration.  Our bill is similar to a bill introduced in the House by my good friend from Iowa, Representative Jim Lightfoot, and also Representative John Duncan. This bill provides dramatic yet realistic reform that will resolve the problems that were identified by Senator Goldwater in 1975 and continue today to plague the FAA.  It will restore the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent agency status. This will ensure that the agency is able to manage and regulate the safety of the air traffic control system without the second-guessing or interference by the politically appointed Department of Transportation officials and staff.  Our approach represents a reform from within Government. It offers a more prudent and realistic approach to the FAA reform than the extremely risky alternative of privatizing or corporatizing the air traffic control system.  As a former mayor of a major metropolitan area, I know something about privatizing. I have been a fan of privatizing for a long time. In fact, I privatized everything I could when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa, OK, many years ago.  One of the systems that has been emulated today by cities all over America was the privatization of the trash system. A refuge or trash system is not a sensitive system like air traffic control.  As a believer in the ability of the private sector to generally do a better job of managing than Government, I believe that there are some inherently governmental functions. Oversight of our air traffic control system is one. The safety implications are too great to allow a management team that has to worry about the bottom line to make these decisions.  Those who use the system and those who use it in commercial aircraft--it does not matter whether you are in an American Airline 747 as a pilot or a passenger, or you are with me in a 20-year-old Piper Aztec. The fact is that your lives are in the hands of these individuals on the ground. [[Page S8498]]   In addition, our proposal provides for appointment of an FAA Administrator with a fixed term of 7 years. The average tenure of the FAA Administrator since I have been in Congress has been less than 2 years. By the time they find their way to the cafeteria, they are out of there. There is no continuity in planning for the FAA. Clearly, we need the continuity of leadership if real changes are to take hold.  This proposal establishes a personnel pilot program which would provide FAA greater latitude managing personnel by giving increased flexibility in measuring performance. The pilot program has been designed to improve performance of individuals and departments, rather than merely rewarding longevity.  Our bill establishes a procurement reform pilot program which will permit the FAA to simplify its procurement procedures by shifting from the rigid procurement rules to allow routine off-the-shelf purchases.  We have example after example of instances where complicated procurement practices have delayed the purchasing of technology and of products that are needed to save lives, until they are no longer current, in terms of their technology.  A good example is the microwave landing system. The MLS system is supposed to replace the ILS system. By the time they got around to implementing this program, the GPS, the global position system, had reached a degree of technology that allows for precision approaches.  The other areas are in the area of costs. I mean, the same thing regarding the GPS system. I happen to be the only Member of Congress in history to fly an airplane around the world. I did it a couple of years ago. In doing this I used a GPS system. Never, all the way around the world, did I lose a satellite. This system is a beautiful system. Yet that system that I used only 2 years ago flying around the world is one-fourth the cost today that it was then.  That means if we and the FAA procure this highly technical machinery, the mechanics to run the system, by the time the system goes through following the procurement practices, that which you have purchased is much cheaper and it would be out of date. So, for cost purposes and technology purposes, this has to happen.  Under our bill, a select panel is created to review and report back to Congress on innovative financing mechanisms for long-term funding of our aviation infrastructure and needs. Panel members will review loan guarantees, financial partnerships with for-profit private sector entities, multiyear appropriations, revolving loan funds, mandatory spending authority, authority to borrow, and restructured grant programs.  Each of these proposals has the support of virtually all of the aviation industry. This bill is strongly supported by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, who have, in just the State of Oklahoma, 4,500 general aviation pilots; and throughout America have 340,000 general aviation pilots. They support this.  In addition, the National Aviation Coalition Association, a consortium of 28 major aviation organizations representing all segments of the aviation community, has indicated that this proposal is a valuable contribution to a healthy debate concerning much needed reform of the FAA.  Mr. President, it is clear that everyone, the administration, Congress, and the aviation community, agrees on the need to reform the FAA. I urge my colleagues to join with Senators Burns and Kassebaum, Representative Lightfoot and Representative Duncan from the House, and Senator Goldwater and me in supporting a meaningful reform of the FAA.                                 ______      By
