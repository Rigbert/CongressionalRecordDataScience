President, if I can further ask the majority leader: The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison--who has put a lot of time in this, along with Senator Rockefeller--has objected to two or three provisions in the bill from the Finance Committee related to transportation and financing. I have said I support those provisions. But if the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, wants to offer a motion in the morning to strike those provisions, is the majority leader saying--I ask through the Chair--is the majority leader saying it is her right to offer that motion to strike?
