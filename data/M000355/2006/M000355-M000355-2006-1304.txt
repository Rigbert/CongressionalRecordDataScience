 Let me repeat that we passed this bill about 5 weeks ago. A number of Democrats voted for it on final passage. The reason they voted for it is they know it is the only way to prevent a tax increase on many middle-class people who are counting on the tax relief that was passed several years back and hope that it will continue. My only point is, I say to my good friend from Nevada--and he is my good friend--we have been there and done that on this bill. To simply redo the same measure is arguably a waste of the Senate's time. Nevertheless, that is where we are. At some point this week we will complete, once again, the passage of this Tax Increase Prevention Act which will be to the substantial benefit of the American people.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
