 Speaker, I would like to call your attention to an article printed in the March edition of the Labor Party Press, and ask that it be printed in the Congressional Record for my colleagues' benefit:                  ``Don't Blow Away Social Security''       There is no Social Security crisis. But if Democrats and      Republicans get their way and privatize the system, there      will be.       ``It's weird,'' says economist Dean Baker of the Preamble      Center, who has been studying and writing about Social      Security reform. ``We're all looking at the same numbers, and      what the numbers say--even the pessimistic ones--is that we      could take absolutely no action on Social Security for the      next 34 years, and the program would continue to pay out all      its benefits.'' And yet, politicians of both parties are all      aflutter about the need to radically reform Social Security      right away.       The picture they paint does sound grim. Mostly because      people are living longer, today's workforce is supporting a      greater and greater number of Social Security recipients. And      the trend will probably continue. In 1995, there were nearly      five people under 65 for every one person over retirement      age. But by 2030, the ratio will be more like three workers      for every retiree. And since Social Security is actually a      pay-as-you-go system--current workers pay for current      retirees--that spells trouble. (See ``Social Security      Basics'' on page 4.) For the time being, we can supplement      the shortfall by drawing from the extra pot of money the      Social Security system has amassed (the Social Security Trust      Fund). But then, in 2034, according to some projections, that      fund will be depleted, and Social Security money will have to      come from active workers alone. And, under the current      formula, they would only be able to cover about 75 percent of      the benefits retirees had been promised from Social Security.       President Clinton and members of Congress say ``saving''      Social Security is at the top of their agenda (after      impeachment, of course). Many recipes have been written for      rescuing Social Security. The most extreme plans involve      privatization. Some people want the Social Security payroll      withholding to go into our own ``personal security account''      that we can invest ourselves. Less radical plans would allow      the Social Security Trust Fund to be invested in the stock      market, where it would supposedly get a higher return than      where it is invested now, in U.S. Treasury bonds.       President Clinton favors a combination of both ideas. He      wants to invest part of the Social Security Fund (eventually      up to 15 percent of it) in the stock market. He also proposes      setting up voluntary new private accounts for middle- and      low-income Americans--but outside the Social Security system.       At a time when the stock market is in the stratosphere,      record numbers of Americans are investing, and the airwaves      are full of experts advising the general public on how to get      the best return, the idea of turning Social Security into a      personal Wall Street investment portfolio is appealing to a      lot of people.       But not everybody's sold on the idea. To begin with, many      people question whether there even will be a Social Security      shortfall. They argue that the Social Security hullabaloo is      all based on some very gloomy economic projections made by      Social Security trustees. In their reports, the trustees      assume that over the next 75 years, the U.S. economy will      grow at less than half the rate it has grown for the past 75      years. According to a report by the New York-based Century      Foundation, an increase in annual economic growth of just .15      percentage points over the next 35 years would raise output      by as much as the combined increase in the cost of both      Social Security and Medicare. Meaning: Workers of the future      may have no trouble supporting the growing ranks of the      retired.       And yet, our politicians have managed to convince a      majority of Americans that there really is a crisis at hand.      Polls of younger Americans show that many believe they can      expect little or no money from Social Security when they      retire (unless, perhaps, the system is radically changed).       So who started this rush for a ``solution'' to the Social      Security ``crisis''? Follow the money. Wall Street could      stand to gain $240 billion in fees within the first 12 years      of a privatized system, according to economist Christian      Weller. That, he points out, is enough to give 20,000 fund      managers an annual salary of $1 million each. No wonder the      financial industry has spent millions of dollars of late to      promote the idea of Social Security privatization.       Economist Dean Baker believes there's a deeper motive      behind the privatization push: ``I think much of this is      being driven by people who are just plain anti-government,''      he says. ``And Social Security is the government's flagship      social program.''       It may be, says Baker, that some minor adjustments will      need to be made to allow the Social Security system to      continue in good health. (See the sidebar on ``What We Should      Do.'') But privatizing the system and investing Social      Security money in the stock market is not the way to go. In      fact, he believes, it would take the ``security'' out of      Social Security. Most of us would see our retirement incomes      dramatically reduced.                               ____________________
