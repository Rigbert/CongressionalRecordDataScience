  Let me begin by quoting from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer editorial board from this morning:       Mexican trucks are welcome in this country so long as they      make the same safety criteria required of all the vehicles      that travel here. Senator Patty Murray has taken just the      right approach to this sensitive and contentious issue. The      Bush administration, which unwisely has threatened to veto      the transportation bill over this matter, contends that under      terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican      trucks should be allowed to travel freely beyond the 20-mile      commercial zone at the southern border to which they are now      restricted.       The House of Representatives disagrees. It voted to keep      the trucks limited to where they now are, permitted to travel      when delivering Mexican goods to U.S. markets. Murray, who      heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on      Transportation, wrote the transportation bill that rightly      requires Mexican trucks to have safety inspections and to be      insured by a carrier licensed to do business in the United      States before they can travel in this country. These are      simple, commonsense requirements.  From the Roanoke Times & World News:       Among other things, certainly the inspections indicate an      element of protectionism but of the public safety, not the      spirit of free trade. By a large bipartisan majority, 19      Republicans joined all 50 Democrats and one independent. The      Senate voted Thursday to end a filibuster to kill the tougher      standards. Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott charged that the      initiative was anti-Mexican and anti-Hispanic and suggested      that Mexican trucks should be inspected according to the same      standards as Canadian trucks. Lott commits aggravated      silliness.       A recent study by the Inspector General of the      Transportation Department found that nearly two in five      Mexican trucks failed basic safety inspections compared with      one in four U.S. trucks and one in seven Canadian trucks. In      addition, Mexican truckers are often overworked and their      fatigue could pose a danger to American drivers.       As for violating the free trade spirit of NAFTA, the treaty      already contains provisions allowing legitimate safety      regulations. Given the clear evidence presented by the      Transportation Department, Congress would be remiss by      opening U.S. borders to trucks known to be unsafe.  From the Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, CA:       With Mexican trucks failing border inspections nearly two      in five times, safety is a far more important concern. The      dismal record is an indication that a well-funded border      inspection program is critical. The Senate proposal, which      requires around-the-clock border inspections, is a balanced      measure that will allow trucking while still keeping roads      relatively safe. But with one in four American trucks failing      safety tests, do not take your eyes off the rear view mirror      any time soon.  From the Sarasota Herald Tribune:       Public safety, not politics, money, free trade or      international relations, should be the priority as American      leaders debate whether to allow tractor trailers from Mexico      to deliver goods in the United States.  From the Deseret News:       A Senate bill would apply a simple solution. It would      require the Mexican truckers to obtain U.S. insurance and to      pass safety inspections before crossing the border. Then the      trucks would be free to travel where they would like within      the United States and presumably to Canada. These are      sensible requirements that ultimately could save lives. The      only objection the President can offer is that Congress does      not hold Canadian truckers to the same standards, but      Congress does not need to do so. Canada already holds its      truckers to standards more rigid than those in the United      States.  They go on to say:       The only way to end the problem of illegal immigration is      to help Mexico's economy grow to the point where leaving the      country no longer is necessary for survival and prosperity.      But this cannot be done at the peril of highway safety in the      United States. Despite the threats of a veto, Congress needs      to pass tough standards on all trucks that come from south of      the border.  From the Providence Journal:       Kudos to the Senate for voting 70-30 for strict safety      standards for Mexican trucks on U.S. roads. The government      has the duty to ensure that foreign truckers follow the same      rules that American ones do. Statistics show trucks from      Mexico with more lenient safety standards than the United      States are 50 percent more likely to fail U.S. inspections      than ours. A race to the bottom is intolerable.  From the Seattle Times Editorial Board:       Suggesting inspections will inhibit free trade is more than      a bit disingenuous, given that current law keeps Mexican      trucks within a 20-mile zone along the U.S. border. Earlier      this summer, the House of Representatives passed a harsh      measure to block any Mexican trucks from venturing beyond      that zone. Opening U.S. highways to Mexico's trucking      industry is in the full spirit of NAFTA, as long as the      trucks are safe and insured. This is hardly onerous. Indeed,      Canadian trucks and truckers have a better inspection record      than U.S. trucks. Do not take too much of the Teamsters      Union's backing the safety measure as if to suggest it was a      topic with heavy labor influence. Only a fraction of U.S.      drivers are represented by organized labor. This fight is      fundamentally about highway safety. Creating a haven of      lesser standards south of the border might invite the U.S.      trucking industry to essentially reflag their fleets where      regulations are lax.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all of the editorials to which I have referred, as well as a press release from the AAA of Texas chapter, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Aug. 1, 2001]             Impose U.S. Safety Standards on Mexican Trucks       Mexican trucks are welcome in this country--so long as they      meet the same safety criteria required of all other vehicles      that travel here.       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has taken just the right      approach to this sensitive and contentious issue, which      threatens to derail the transportation bill and some $140      million in much-needed funding earmarked by Murray for this      state.       The Bush administration, which unwisely has threatened to      veto the transportation bill over this matter, contends that      under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement,      Mexican trucks should be allowed to travel freely beyond the      20-mile     commercial zone at the southern border to which they are now      restricted.       The House of Representatives disagrees; it voted to keep      the trucks limited to where they now are permitted to travel      when delivering Mexican goods to U.S. markets.       Murray, who heads the Senate appropriations subcommittee on      transportation, wrote the transportation bill that rightly      requires Mexican trucks to have safety inspections and to be      insured by a carrier licensed to do business in the United      States before they can travel in this country.       These are simply common-sense requirements. However, care      must be taken in implementation to avoid having them become a      bogus trade barrier.       Murray contends Mexican trucks are less safe than U.S.      trucks. She says a recent study by the inspector general of      the Department of Transportation found that nearly two in      five Mexican trucks failed basic safety inspections compared      with one in four American trucks and one in seven Canadian      trucks. Since Canadian trucks appear safer than American      ones, there seems no rationale for imposing additional      requirements on them.       But President Bush, rightly has at the top of his      international agenda improving relations with Mexico, says it      would be too expensive and time-consuming to require the      Mexican trucks to meet U.S. safety and insurance standards.      However, introducing unsafe trucks on U.S. highways is      unlikely to improve relations between our two countries;      quite the opposite.       Mexico, meanwhile, has raised the possibility that it might      restrict the import of American agricultural goods in      retaliation. That's non-productive. A better course is to      assure Mexican trucks meet international safety standards.       Murray, who also chairs the Democratic Senate Campaign      Committee, happens to be on the same page in this dispute as      the all-powerful Teamsters union, which ardently opposes the      entrance of Mexican trucks and their low-paid, often      overworked, non-unionized drivers. The Teamsters clearly have      a self-interest in putting the brakes on the entrance of      Mexican trucks.       Murray's business, however, is the public interest, not      that of the Teamsters. We believe that in insisting that      Mexican trucks comply with U.S. laws, she's property      discharging that larger duty.       As a NAFTA arbitration panel acknowledged last February,      the United States is ``responsible for the safe operation of      trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership is U.S.,      Canadian or Mexican.''                                  ____          [From the Roanoke Times & World News, July 28, 2001]             Require Mexican Trucks To Meet the Safety Test       As frequent drivers of Interstate 81 can attest, sharing      the road with high-balling semi-trailer trucks intensifies      anxiety about highway safety, even with the assumption those      behemoths meet safety-inspection standards.       The same assumption cannot be applied to Mexican trucks,      about 40 percent of which fail U.S. standards, so the U.S.      Senate's hesitation this week to allow free entry of big      commercial Mexican vehicles onto U.S. highways in January is      both understandable and prudent.       President Bush, the Senate's Republican leadership and the      Mexican government have opposed an amendment to the pending      $60 billion Senate transportation spending bill that would      require much stricter safety inspections before allowing the      Mexican trucks to venture freely onto U.S. highways.      Opponents contend that such a restriction violates the North      American Free Trade Agreement.       Certainly, the inspections indicate an element of      protectionism--but of the public safety, not the spirit of      free trade. By a large bipartisan majority--19 Republicans      joined all 50 Democrats and one independent--the Senate voted      Thursday to end a filibuster to kill the tougher standards.

Some alarm has been expressed      by farming states and agriculture lobbyists after Mexican      officials threatened to consider restrictions on U.S.      agricultural imports if the bill becomes law.       Congress should be more concerned about the lives of      Americans driving on U.S. highways.                                  ____          [From the Press Democrat Santa Rosa, July 30, 2001] Mexican Trucks Senate Proposal Allows Free Trade While Ensuring Safer                                  Roads       In February an arbitration panel determined that the      Clinton administration policy limiting Mexican trucks to a      20-mile border zone violated the North American Free Trade      Agreement.       Since that ruling, Congress, President Bush and the      Teamsters union have been fighting over how to regulate 18-     wheelers originating from Mexico.       The Teamsters union opposes opening the border to Mexican      truckers because it fears losing union jobs. In other words,      having lost the free trade battle in 1993, it is now trying      to unravel NAFTA piece-by-piece. It seems the Teamsters' time      would be better spent improving U.S. truckers'      competitiveness.       With Mexican trucks failing border inspections nearly two      in five times, safety is a far more important concern. The      dismal record is an indication that a well-funded, border      inspection program is critical.       The Senate proposal, which requires around the clock border      inspections, is a balanced measure that will allow trucking      while still keeping roads--relatively--safe. But with one in      four American trucks failing safety tests, don't take your      eyes off the rearview mirror anytime soon.                                  ____           [From the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, July 31, 2001]No Substitute for Safety Trade Pact Doesn't Preclude High Standards for                                  Trucks       Public safety--not politics, money, free trade or      international relations--should be the priority as American      leaders debate whether to allow tractor-trailers from Mexico      to deliver goods in the United States.       President Bush wants to enable Mexican trucks to begin      making long-haul deliveries on U.S. highways in January as      part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico      and Canada. Currently, big trucks from Mexico are limited to      a 20-mile zone near the border.       In recent days, a bipartisan group in the Senate has pushed      for a stricter U.S. inspection program for Mexican trucks.      They cite statistics indicating that trucks from Mexico are      almost 50 percent more likely to fail inspections than U.S.      trucks.       But Bush and his allies on this issue, including Sen. John      McCain, R-Ariz., contend that the safety fears are overblown      and that the proposed standards are tougher than those in      place for Canadian trucks. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., takes      the rhetoric further and accuses Democrats of being ``anti-     Mexican'' and ``anti-Hispanic.''       The cries of discrimination make for great TV sound bites,      but if there is evidence that inspections are less rigorous      in Mexico, why shouldn't the United States do more to ensure      that Mexican vehicles are safe before they enter U.S. roads?       Tractor-trailers are already a significant safety concern      in this country. In recent years, federal safety officials      have documented a steady increase in the number of deaths      caused by accidents involving big trucks. Let's not add to      the carnage in the name of free trade, or politics.                                  ____                 [From the Deseret News, July 31, 2001]                       All Trucks Need Standards       As usual in Washington, the debate over whether to apply      tough standards to Mexican trucks that cross the border has      to do with a lot more than the simple issue at hand. For the      Bush administration, it has to do with the Hispanic vote, of      which he obtained only 35 percent last year. For the      Democrats, it has to do with organized labor, which would      love to drive into Mexico but doesn't want to lose any jobs      by allowing the Mexicans to drive here.       Those are the currents running swiftly beneath the surface.      On the top, however, the debate is centering on the only      thing that really ought to matter--safety.       Organized labor lost its fight to keep Mexican businesses      out eight years ago when Congress passed the North American      Free Trade Agreement. Bush's support among Hispanics, and his      relationship with Mexican President Vicente Fox (who has      threatened trade retaliation against the United States) have      to be dealt with in a different arena. This is a question of      keeping unsafe vehicles off the highway.       Current rules allow Mexican trucks to travel no further      than 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) over the border--just far      enough to unload their cargo onto American trucks. Border      inspectors there have found that more than one-third of      Mexican trucks fail to meet the safety standards required of      American trucks.       A Senate bill would apply a simply solution. It would      require the Mexican truckers to obtain U.S. insurance and to      pass safety inspections before crossing the border. Then the      trucks would be free to travel where they would like within      the United States and, presumably, to Canada. These are      sensible requirements that ultimately could save lives. The      only objection the president can offer is that Congress      doesn't hold Canadian truckers to the same standards.       But Congress doesn't need to do so. Canada already holds      its truckers to standards more rigid than those in the United      States.       In many ways, this is an example of the types of conflicts      that will occasionally arise when attempting free trade with      a nation     whose economy is struggling to stand on its own. Mexico has      made great strides in recent years, eliminating much of the      corruption that used to plague its one-party government. The      United States should reward those efforts with increased      trade. The only way to end the problem of illegal immigration      is to help Mexico's economy grow to the point where leaving      the country no longer is necessary for survival and      prosperity.       But this can't be done at the peril of highway safety in      the United States. Despite the threats of a veto, Congress      needs to pass tough standards on all trucks that come from      south of the border.                                  ____              [From the Providence Journal, July 29, 2001]                           Divers Ruminations       Kudos to the Senate for voting, 70 to 30, for strict safety      standards for Mexican trucks on U.S. roads.

(Mexican trucks' emissions problems are bad,      too.) A race to the bottom is intolerable.       Meanwhile, President Bush is commendably backing off from      an idea floated to give a blanket amnesty to illegal Mexican      immigrants but not necessarily for illegal immigrants from      other nations. We are leery of any blanket amnesty because it      would tend to encourage lawbreaking. But basic fairness      requires that a plan to ``regularize'' illegals, not single      out one nationality.       Rumor has it that stars usually bound for the likes of the      Hamptons have discovered the pastoral and coastal beauties of      Westport and South Dartmouth, and are eyeing real estate      there.

Will the glitz,      and soaring prices, that have soured Long Island's south      shore infect Buzzards Bay towns, too? Better for us if celebs      use assumed names if they buy land.       To protect its right to regulate land use, North Kingstown      commendably keeps battling developer/nightclub owner Michael      Kent. Mr. Kent is infamous for chopping down the trees and      painting the stumps blue and red on a parcel that the town      said he couldn't build on. Now he dumps manure and says he      might keep ostriches there, as he puts up signs calling his      spread ``Plum Beach Park.''

Patty Murray led a strong, appropriate      effort to require tougher safety standards for Mexican trucks      entering the United States.       The White House and Republican leadership waged a phony war      against this highway-safety measure with claims it undermined      the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement and relations      with our neighbor.       Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., stooped so low      as to suggest the effort was anti-Mexican. Poppycock. This is      about improving standards for Mexican trucks that are 50      percent more likely to fail U.S. inspections than American      vehicles.       Nineteen Republicans joined Senate Democrats to knock down      parliamentary attempts to tie up the requirements for regular      U.S. inspections of Mexican trucks and drivers, on-site      audits of Mexican trucking firms, and more scales and      inspectors at 27 U.S. border stations.       Suggesting inspections will inhibit free trade is more than      a bit disingenuous given that current law keeps Mexican      trucks within a 20-mile zone along the U.S. border. Earlier      this summer, the House of Representatives passed a harsh      measure to block any Mexican trucks from venturing beyond      that zone.       Opening U.S. highways to Mexico's trucking industry is in      the full spirit of NAFTA, as long as the trucks are safe and      insured. This is hardly onerous. Indeed, Canadian trucks and      truckers have a better inspection record than U.S. trucks.       Don't make too much of the Teamsters Union backing the      safety measure, as if to suggest it was a topic with heavy      labor influence. Only a fraction of U.S. drivers are      represented by organized labor. This fight is fundamentally      about highway safety.       Creating a haven of lesser standards south of the border      might invite the U.S. trucking industry to essentially re-     flag their fleets where regulations are lax.       At the same time, Congress must not create a system of      rules and standards that are thinly veiled trade barriers.      Murray and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., transportation      committee allies on this effort, are not headed in that      direction.       The White House wants to make sure NAFTA is supported and      that Mexico is nurtured as a friend, ally and trading      partner. But the Bush administration's garbled, inconsistent      response on truck safety only confused matters.       Opening America's roads to Mexican trucks and truckers is      in the best spirit of free trade. Expecting those rigs to be      adequately maintained and insured is a modest price to pay      for access to the world's most-prosperous consumer market.                                  ____          [From the Roanoke Times & World News, July 28, 2001]             Require Mexican Trucks To Meet the Safety Test       As frequent drivers of Interstate 81 can attest, sharing      the road with high-balling semi-trailer trucks intensifies      anxiety about highway safety, even with the assumption those      behemoths meet safety-inspection standards.

Currently, trucks based in Mexico are allowed to travel up      to 20 miles inside the U.S. border. Under the      administration's proposal, Mexico-origination trucks would be      allowed unrestricted access for up to 18 months before audits      and safety inspections of the owner's facilities, drivers and      their practices would be conducted. With more than 1,200      miles of border, more than 70 percent of the truck traffic      from Mexico will travel on Texas roads.       ``Texas motorists are concerned about the safety of these      trucks and their drivers,'' said Public and Government      Affairs Manager Anne O'Ryan. ``Until recently, Mexico had few      safety or enforcement standards for the vehicles or the      drivers.'' Department of Public Safety officials estimate      that half of the short-haul trucks from Mexico don't meet      U.S. safety standards. The U.S. Department of Transportation      reports that more than 35 percent of trucks from Mexico were      taken out of service for safety violations in 2000. That      compares to 24 percent for U.S. trucks and 17 percent for      trucks from Canada.       The U.S. Senate is debating a proposal that would require      Mexico-origination trucks to meet the same U.S. safety      standards as trucks from Canada. Many of AAA's suggestions      are being considered in the proposal.       AAA has offered the following safety recommendations:       On-site safety audits at the company facility, prior to      authorizing their trucks to cross the border;       Significant improvements in safety inspections at the      border including enforcement of U.S. weight limits;       Adequate resources for enforcement throughout the U.S.;       Adequate and verifiable insurance on each vehicle;       Shared tracking of the company's truck and driver safety      records between U.S. and Mexican authorities; and       Enforcement of safety laws, including limiting the number      of continuous hours spent driving.       ``The safety of the motoring public should not be risked in      the rush to meet an apparently arbitrary deadline,'' said      O'Ryan. The     Senate proposal is being debated this week for inclusion in      the Department of Transportation Appropriations bill.
