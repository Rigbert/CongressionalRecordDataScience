 We passed my amendment to Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act and voted to advance the bill, both by very wide bipartisan margins. S. 1 represents the broad consensus of this body about our Nation's responsibilities as an ally and a partner. It reaffirms our promise to uphold Israel's security, to help Jordan face complex security challenges, and to hold Bashar al-Assad's murderous henchmen accountable.  I look forward to the Senate voting on final passage soon and sending this bipartisan legislation over to the House.  After we complete that work, the Senate will return to the Natural Resources Management Act, a high-priority bill containing more than 100 proposals concerning economic development, public lands, water resources, and conservation.                          ____________________
