Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the McIntosh amendment and certainly in favor of the Roemer-Royce amendment to the United States Housing Act. The McIntosh amendment is a poison pill meant to kill this commonsense reform that we are working on.  The McIntosh amendment is certainly opposed by HUD. But more importantly, the great majority, the great majority of the industry, the manufactured industry here in the United States, is also in opposition, along with many, many consumer groups. It is an unworkable proposal that flies in the face of this Congress's efforts to return authority to State and local governments.  It is of particular concern to California as the McIntosh language would more than likely prevent local governments from allowing fire sprinklers in manufactured housing, a great concern in my area, and as the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Roemer] mentioned, the problem we have had with wind and sheer in the Florida area, we could have had that resolved if this committee was in effect earlier.  On the other hand, the Roemer-Royce amendment has broad bipartisan support and the backing, as I mentioned earlier, of industry, HUD and consumers. It creates a committee consisting of manufacturers, consumers, public officials and other interest groups. This committee will develop standards for manufactured housing in partnership with the HUD secretary.  Let us not lose an opportunity to enact commonense reform. Reject the poison-pill McIntosh amendment and support the bipartisan Roemer-Royce-Calvert proposal.
