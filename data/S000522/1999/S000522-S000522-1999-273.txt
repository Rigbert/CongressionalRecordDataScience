Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues are aware, for the past year or so, the Jewish community of Russia has been subjected to anti-Semitic threats and violence. And this is not just from marginalized, thuggish elements on the streets; even elected officials in Russia have resorted to anti-Semitic slurs and threats.  Amid the latest explosions in Moscow, it is all the more remarkable that no Jewish institutions were attacked in Russia during the Jewish New Year celebration of Rosh Hashanah. Responding to the concerns of the Russian and American Jewish communities, as well as the U.S. Government and Members of Congress, the Russian authorities provided adequate protection for the synagogues, at least in the capital city, Moscow. The federal government of Russia and Moscow's city government deserve credit for this protection of their citizens. Monday's Yom Kippur celebration also passed without incident, and authorities would also be well advised to ensure that future holiday observances are accompanied by a visible and comprehensive police presence.  In the past several weeks, a Jewish community leader was violently attacked inside the Moscow Choral Synagogue, and explosives or false bomb threats have been uncovered in synagogues as well. In addition to synagogues, schools and other institutions are also at risk. The school year has now begun, and elderly Jews will again turn to social services institutions with the approach of winter. Russian authorities should be encouraged to continue protecting Jewish facilities, as well as seriously investigating and prosecuting those guilty of crimes against Jews. In addition, Russian officials should speak out frequently and publicly against those who would--either through word or deed--tear at the fabric of tolerance in Russia. To his credit, President Yeltsin has denounced ``disgusting acts of anti-Semitism'' in Russia, and in a telegram to the Chief Rabbi of Russia, His Holiness Patriarch Alexei II condemned the attack in the Moscow Choral Synagogue. Hopefully, these statements against violence and for tolerancewill be emulated by responsible Russian leaders throughout Russia.  As much as permitting the free exercise of religion is a duty of any government, so is the protection of those exercising that right. As we Americans have unfortunately witnessed in our own country in recent months, our Nation is not immune to anti-Semitic violence. Law enforcement cannot completely guarantee against infringement of these rights, but we have demonstrated what I believe is an appropriate model of community and official response. For instance, when synagogues in California were bombed earlier this year, the California State Legislature condemned the attacks, and the alleged perpetrators are now in custody.  The police protection of synagogues throughout Moscow, along with President Boris Yeltsin's strong message of support to the Jewish community on the eve of the Jewish High Holy Days, represent a commendable Russian step in that same direction. Effective security measures should continue as long as the Jewish community is under threat, but we hope that ultimately such measures will no longer be necessary in a stable, democratic Russia.                          ____________________
