 President, my request for $8 million for ``Improved HMMWV Research'' under Army RDT, ``Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology'' was incorporated in this year's defense appropriations bill. These funds are intended to initiate a third phase of the design, demonstration and validation of ultra-light, steel-based structures and advanced powertrain architectures on high volume truck platforms.  This research effort, competitively selected by the Army in fiscal year 1999 subsequent to the submittal of the President's Budget is titled ``Improved Materials Powertrain Architectures for 21st Century Trucks,'' IMPACT. The full program will cover light/medium military payloads up to five tons, including applications with an open or closed bed configuration currently serviced by several of the Army's HMMWV variants.  Kentucky is a large commercial producer and Army base user of such vehicles, and now, through the University of Louisville's involvement in this effort, it will also play an important research role in their design and testing. The military should realize significant procurement and O cost savings as a result.
