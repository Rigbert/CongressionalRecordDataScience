Speaker, as Western Europe strains with more than 1 million refugees fleeing war in the Middle East and enduring terrible conditions, I rise tonight to address another growing humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine.  The free world has experienced time and again what happens when it fails to support innocents caught by fate under the brutal grip of war and oppression. Today that reality looms largely over Europe and surely over Ukraine, a nation of freedom-seeking people under siege outnumbered and outgunned due to Russia's invasion on Ukraine's eastern front. So Europe in the western end as well as the eastern faces major displacement and humanitarian needs not seen since World War II.  Ukrainians are fighting to choose their own path, and surely America, with our moral leadership, can find a way to help the beleaguered people of Ukraine survive the siege and the onset of a bitter winter, with climates that can be unforgiving, with temperatures falling as low or more than 25 degrees below zero.  To not attend to Ukraine now risks Ukraine accessing to the free world. If one looks at the size of Ukraine in Europe, imagine if Ukraine could access to be part of greater Europe. That is all held in abeyance now and also risks millions more potential refugees fleeing from Ukraine to Western Europe for sustenance and more.  I call on the Obama administration to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Europe, not just on the western end, but on the eastern end in Ukraine. This is a challenge that can be met. America has done this before. The humanitarian need in Ukraine is immediate and growing.  I include in the Record evidence of this growing crisis by the major religious leaders of Ukraine from all confessions, representing, imagine, nearly 90 percent of the faithful of Ukraine. These denominations include Baptist, Pentecostals, Muslims, Reformed Church, the Lutheran Church, Jewish religious organizations, Evangelicals, the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Bible Society, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Seventh-Day Adventists, the Christian Evangelical Church. It is a very, very long list.  I am going to read this in the Record as well as place it in the Record. This was sent to President Obama. A delegation, over this last month, from Ukraine, of its top religious leaders presented the Obama administration with a request. Let me read it.  ``We, the undersigned of the All Ukrainian Council of Churches and religious organizations and representing Ukraine's diverse religious community, appeal to you on behalf of the people of Ukraine to help address the humanitarian catastrophe, Mr. President, gripping our country. The needs are enormous, ranging from medical supplies to everyday items, such as food, water, and clothing.''  They don't even ask for new clothing. They are willing to take used shoes from the United States of America.  ``While the global news media regularly reports on Russia's war against Ukraine, government reforms and financial challenges, there is rarely any mention of the extraordinary dimensions of the human suffering caused by Moscow's aggression. While Ukraine certainly needs greater military, financial, and political assistance, our focus here, as religious leaders, must be on the humanitarian aspect.  ``As you know, according to the United Nations, over 5 million people''--5 million--``including 1.7 million children, are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.''  I brought a chart to the floor that shows pictures of just a few of these children.  ``8,000 people have died and over 17,000 have been injured and wounded. There are over 1,390,000 displaced people, including 174,000 children.''  Here is one child whose only dwelling has been in a bomb shelter since the time of his birth.  ``The challenges of this human tragedy are overwhelming. Even the most conservative estimates show that over 65 percent of projected needs have yet to be met--even on the level of pledges.  ``As representatives of the interfaith community, we witness on a daily basis the challenges and needs of people suffering because of this war. And with the onset of winter, an already dire situation will only get worse. We pray for their lives and for the future of our country.  ``While we are grateful for the assistance provided by the United States Government to date, we know that the need is so much greater. Thus, we appeal to you,'' President Obama, ``to increase assistance and to activate the full potential of the National Guard State Partnership Program and the Partnership for Peace as instruments for alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe. One of the stated goals of the Partnership for Peace is to `provide a framework for enhanced political and military cooperation for joint multilateral crisis management activities, such as humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping.' Ukraine was the first post-Soviet country to join the Partnership for Peace in 1993.  ``In addition to the assistance provided by the US government, we, during our travels throughout the United States, have come to personally witness the great generosity of the American people expressed through numerous spontaneous initiatives to ship medical and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine.  ``Time is of the essence, Mr. President.''  They are begging.  ``The people of Ukraine need to know that they are not forgotten in their time for need. The instruments anticipated by the National Guard State Partnership and Partnership for Peace programs will allow the American people to more effectively and rapidly access and deliver already available medical and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine--literally within days. We each represent distribution networks''--through their various religious confessions--``that cooperate with each other; we now ask for the resources to meet the growing human needs.  ``We pray that God grant you guidance, wisdom and bless you and the great American nation. God bless the United States and Ukraine. Sincerely.''  And I place all their names in the Record.  The people of the world must meet this moral imperative. The United Nations has reported that 2.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the current conflict in eastern Ukraine--so unnecessary--because of Russia's invasion. A staggering 5 million Ukrainians currently need humanitarian survival assistance.  I met with one religious leader who came to Washington. I said: What are you finding?  He said: Congresswoman, we are in Kharkiv. We need shoes, even used shoes, for the children.  Currently, less than half of those in need receive any assistance at all. If Russian aggression were to trigger a flight of these Ukrainians westward, it would also add to the dangerous, destabilizing stress to Europe's already-stretched refugee services as a result of what is happening with the immigration and refugee resettlement from the Middle East.  The situation in Ukraine is far from contained. According to a recent report by Refugees International, approximately 2 million Ukrainians live close to the cease-fire lines separating Ukrainian and Russian-backed forces.  It is hard to see some of these pictures that are on this chart, but what they basically show are bombed-out buildings, bridges that are completely destroyed, old women living in buildings where there are no roofs or windows in eastern Ukraine, children living in bomb shelters, and people just, unfortunately, killed because of Russian shelling.  A Ukrainian and Russian peace settlement likely will take a while, but another 2 million people are living under control of Russian-backed forces. The basic needs of these civilians go unmet daily. Shockingly, most international aid work has been suspended there, and there are hardly any news stories about this. Aid workers have been ejected from regions that are called Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russian-backed fighters.  Some refugees, torn from their villages and towns, have managed to stay in Ukraine and survive even after being driven from their homes by violence. How they are doing this, I simply don'tknow. But these internally displaced are overwhelming the already limited resources of Ukraine's local governments, which are already stretched thin by Russia's invasion. These 1.5 million internally displaced Ukrainians lack durable housing or jobs to pay for food or support their families.  Don't forget, with Russia's invasion, the value of their currency has just plummeted. Everything is so much more expensive. How people are making it, I simply don't know.  We often talk about refugees in abstract numbers. But inside these numbers are the stories and faces of individuals. I just wish people could see the eyes of these parents looking into the future that is so uncertain and so daunting.  Ukrainian children in these conflict zones are being born under conditions that most Americans couldn't even imagine, never having lived without the imminent threat of death or loss. Many risk becoming stateless, as they have been unable to receive birth certificates, passports, and school certificates. In looking into the eyes of children, I am again reminded of the urgency of this crisis.  As freedom-loving nations grapple with the Ukrainian crisis, let us recall the nations of the European continent remain America's most enduring allies in liberty. To not measure up to meet the current internal challenge for Europe is to walk away from liberty's call at freedom's edge in our time.  Existing efforts to assist Ukraine's eastern regions face a daunting set of challenges. Roads leading to Ukrainians trapped in separatist-held areas are difficult to navigate. There is a photo here. I mean, they are walking across rubble, down very steep embankments.  Making matters worse, many of these routes are now scarred by the ravages of war. Roads and bridges have been completely destroyed. On roads running through conflict areas, Russian-backed fighters require registration by any humanitarian group seeking access to the region. Can you imagine? Can you imagine what life is like there?  The United Nations is the only aid group allowed to even enter the Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine. Even the U.N. was prevented from delivering aid to eastern Ukraine for 3 months as people suffered. And then on November 9, just a couple weeks ago, the U.N. was finally able to deliver a convoy of nine trucks carrying vital aid to the city of Luhansk, including 10,000 blankets, 10,000 towels, 5,000 buckets, and a similar number of jerricans and plastic sheets, cement and timber for shelter repairs, and other winterization need and domestic items. That was to one town, and it did not completely serve their enormous needs.  As the U.N. agency head for Ukraine said: ``This is a small drop in the ocean of needs . . . in these conflict-affected areas.''  Can you imagine, millions of people displaced but only 10,000 blankets? Millions of people, 10,000 blankets.  Delivery of basic medical supplies also faces obstacles. There is a shortage of medications that treat critical and common diseases.  After his organization was forced out of Donetsk by Russian operatives, Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations at Doctors Without Borders, said the following: ``We are almost the only organization providing treatment for tuberculosis in prisons, insulin for diabetic patients, and hemodialysis products to treat kidney failure. Thousands of patients suffering from chronic, potentially fatal diseases will now be left with little or no assistance.''                              {time}  2030  This is the situation Ukraine faces in real time. What will the world do? What will the United States do with so many storehouses of used clothing, used blankets, or anything to help sustain life there?  As temperatures fall across that region, shelter assistance has to be delivered quickly to people living in buildings without windows, without doors, without roofs, and, most often, without heat. Thousands of displaced people need warm blankets, winter clothing, and shoes, as well as coal and heating fuels.  If the free world fails to act, it must prepare for the reality that, come spring, we will discover more elderly who are dead, more who are ill, more children who have fallen into illness and have probably died, simply cut off from assistance, who succumbed to starvation and the cold, needlessly adding to the over 8,000 who have already lost their lives in this Russian-directed invasion.  America, as a nation, has long been one of supporting freedom and economic stability across our world. Let me remind you that in a 1947 speech laying out what would become the Marshall Plan for Europe following World War II's devastation, war-weary America stood the test of liberty.  And one of our greatest Americans, a statesman, a general, and then Secretary of State, General George C. Marshall, observed the dire post-war economic conditions in Europe. And despite America's exhaustion from World War II, he urged American involvement and support of European recovery, noting that:  ``It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace.''  Those words apply to Ukraine today, as they did to Western Europe after World War II.  General Marshall continued, saying, ``Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.''  He added that struggling nations must take the lead in their own rebuilding and that America's role should be a supporting one.  It was really remarkable to go back and look at the films of the brilliant airlift from World War II and see what this country did. This crisis is not commensurate with what happens after World War II, but we have a model. We know what to do; we know how to do it. Why aren't we doing it?  I include in the Record separate statements from three religious leaders who are begging the United States of America and its President to pay particular attention to the humanitarian needs of Ukraine: remarks by Patriarch Filaret, Ukraine Orthodox Church; the Archbishop of Ukraine, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church; and also Rabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich, head of the Jewish faiths that have presence in that country.  Transcript of the Speech by Patriarch Filaret at the National Press                         Club on November 9, 2015                    (Translated live from Ukrainian)       Dear Friends, we just met with the staff of President      Obama. We have handed him a letter signed by leaders of All-     Ukrainian Council of Churches and International Organizations      of Ukraine leaders of different religious denominations of      Ukraine. First of all, I want to emphasize that the All-     Ukrainian Council of Churches represents 85% of Ukraine's      residence. So our statement is on behalf of all those people.       What is that letter about? We are discussing how the      humanitarian aid that has been collected for the Ukrainian      people here in the United States can be delivered to Ukraine.      And we are asking President Obama to implement certain      provisions of the Partnership for Peace program.       Why are we asking that? Because, today, Ukraine is      defending democracy and freedom for the whole world. If      Ukraine had accepted Russia's offer and desired to pull it      into the Eurasian Union, there would be no war, but Ukraine      would have lost its democracy and freedom--it would have      become a totalitarian state.       The United States is the leader of democracy and freedom in      the world. And, today, Ukrainians are giving their lives for      this democracy and freedom. So do Ukrainians deserve such      support from the United States and Europe in standing against      Russian invasion and totalitarianism? I think Ukraine does      deserve that.       This is why we are making this request for help. We are      asking to help deliver the humanitarian aid that the people      of the United States have already collected. And we are also      asking to increase the levels of assistance of multi-sided      assistance.       At this time, the war in Eastern Ukraine has not stopped--     it only went down in intensity. Putin has diverted the      world's attention by going into Syria--this does not mean      that he has given up on Ukraine and military warfare may      erupt in Ukraine with new strength anytime. So we are      asking--please, help. We are giving away our live and you      give us the resources, including the humanitarian assistance.       Thank you.                                       ____Transcript of the Speech by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk at the                 National Press Club on November 9th 2015       Dear Friends, I speak on behalf of Ukrainian Greek Catholic      Church, which is present in Ukraine and worldwide. I would      like to convey to you good news from Ukraine.       First good news is that Ukrainian nation is united as never      before in its history. You see that righteous society of      Ukraine, The Council of Churches and Religious Organizations,      which represent 85% of the citizens of Ukraine, are united.      Different religions, different churches, religious      denominations, but we are the heart of Ukrainian civil      society, and we are together.       The second good news is that we did not have a civil war in      Ukraine. We are facing the foreign aggression against      Ukraine. And again, that aggression is a catalyst of      Ukrainian unity. Seventy percent of the soldiers who are      defending free and independent Ukraine are Russian-speakers.      And I think this very important sign, that even those who are      in the occupied territories, as Rabbi Bleich mentioned, are      not supporting war. Even people in Russia will not support a      war. It is why Putin is trying to be silent about that the      Russian troop and its presence on Ukrainian territory.       The third good news from Ukraine is outstanding solidarity.      Today, we have more than two million refugees in Ukraine. But      international society, until now, could only help four      hundred thousand refugees. But what is happening to the rest?      Their Ukrainian fellows are helping them. But our resources      are short because economic crisis is striking us in Ukraine.      Nevertheless, we are united in our desire to rebuild, to      transform Ukraine.       The next good news from Ukraine, we all together are      fighting against corruption, because corruption it not only      political issue, is a deep moral issue. It is a part of the      post-Soviet mentality. But we all together are trying to      reform and transform the very heart of Ukraine. To transform      the interpersonal relationships, because corruptions strike      those kinds of relationships between person in Ukraine. But,      nevertheless, we are here to be a voice of the millions who      are suffering the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe after      the Second World War.       It is a pity that Ukrainian politicians until now did not      declare the state of the humanitarian emergency in Ukraine.      Until now we've received an answer that this is a political      quest. Nevertheless, Ukraine needs worldwide international      support, especially in order to solve the humanitarian      situation in our country. So it is why we are here--to speak      on behalf of those millions who will suffer terrible winter      in few months.       But we have a hope in Ukraine. You know, politicians will      come and go, presidents will come and go, all political      visions will change, but Ukraine will remain, churches will      remain. And today we are building our future fostering the      reconciliation and cooperation between the nations.       Thank you very much.  Transcript of the Speech by Rabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich at the National                     Press Club on November 9th 2015       Thanks for coming and for showing some interest in what's      going on in Ukraine. It is important for us in Ukraine to      know that it's not only politicians that get together and      talk about Ukraine, but that it interests civil society too.       First of all, the message comes from a coalition called the      Council of Churches and Religious Organizations of Ukraine,      which is a very unique organization anywhere in the world      probably, where the Heads of all religions in the country get      together and work for the benefit of all of the people of the      country.       Our message is from civil society, from people to people.      We spoke today with politicians because they can do things we      can't do. But we can do a lot more than they can. We feel      that civil society has an obligation to try help and do what      they can. We come together with other NGOs in the United      States trying to make things happen, change things. And I      want to point something out: the help that we may get paying      for transportation of containers of aid that was collected      here to send to Ukraine is very very symbolic. The money is      not the most important thing.       What is much more symbolic is that the people in the United      States care about what's happening in Ukraine, they      understand the war.       The need for help in Ukraine is a direct result of a      democratic choice, a choice that the people of Ukraine made.      They want to be a part of the western family of nations. They      want democracy, they want to be free, they want to be a part      of Europe, they want to live like people in the West live.      Because of that they are suffering, and it's important for      people in the United States to know that the front of the war      between democracy, democratic life and brutality, communism,      putinism, that front is taking place now in Eastern Ukraine.      That fight, which is a fight of entire world for democracy,      is taking place right there. It's not only a fight for      Ukraine, not only a fight for Ukraine's freedom, it's a fight      of freedom over putinism. This is our message.       You could see people who are willing to sacrifice      themselves for their freedom. People who are sacrificing      their lives on the front are not sacrificing for their      freedom, they are sacrificing for the freedom of their      country, for freedom of their people, for freedom of all      peoples throughout the world to have that democratic choice,      to choose how they want to live, and to be able to live the      way we take for granted here, in the United States.       Today, actually, President Poroshenko signed a decree for      organizing a committee for the 75th anniversary of Babij Yar.      This is important! We don't have to talk about this now, but      a year and a half ago we were still trying to counteract the      propaganda that was coming out of Russia about the fascism in      Ukraine and the anti-Semitism, which is a bunch of baloney.      Basically, we won that war.       People, most people, understand that Ukrainian Government      and Ukrainian people today are not fascists and anti-Semites,      they are just people who want to live free, democratically,      but part of that is that Ukrainian Government also coming      through and showing time and again, proving as much as      possible, as many times as possible that Ukrainian people are      united no matter what ethnicity, no matter what their      background, what their religion is. They want to be free,      they want to be democratic. Even the Russian-speaking people      want to be free. That was part of the failure of Putin in the      east that he didn't have the support. He doesn't have the      support of the people in Donbas to become a part of Russia.      They are not interested in becoming a part of Russia. They      want to be free as well. Everyone wants to be free.       Thank you.
