As a police chief, city manager, airport director, and two tenures as the Vermont secretary of transportation, Brian is a model of commitment both to his work and to his State.  For the past 4 years Brian and his team at the Vermont Agency of Transportation have overseen vast improvements in the State's infrastructure. In 2008 nearly 20 percent of Vermont's bridges were structurally deficient. By 2013 that number was reduced to just 8 percent. Additionally, in 2008, 36 percent of Vermont's pavement was rated in ``very poor'' condition, but through his work and the support of Governor Shumlin, Brian and his team were able to improve that number to 21 percent. Brian has also remained committed to supporting Vermont's rail infrastructure, spending the time necessary to apply for and win Federal grants. This necessary funding allowed Vermont to realize the final stages of completing the Western Rail Corridor project designed to connect Rutland to Burlington, as well as upgrade track to complete high speed rail service between Saint Albans and Montreal. The success of these projects could not have happened without Brian's leadership.  Brian and I have tackled many projects together, always working to accomplish big goals for Vermont's transportation and infrastructure needs. In August of 2011, Tropical Storm Irene hit the State, wiping out 500 miles of roadway and forcing 33 bridges to close in Vermont's worst natural disaster in recent history. Brian helped to bring our rural devastation to a national stage by testifying before the Senate's Committee on Environment and Public Works and then led his team to successful rebuilding efforts. For this, Vermonters will always be grateful.  About a year ago, Brian approached Governor Shumlin with a resignation letter in his pocket. Looking at the wealth of knowledge and historic improvements in the agency's work during Brian's tenure, the Governor prevailed upon him to remain at the helm until the end of the Governor's second term. Brian accepted the call, finished the year, and is now leaving the Vermont Agency of Transportation as a well-respected arm of Vermont's State government.  Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in thanking Brian for his years of service to the State and wish him and his family the very best as they begin a new chapter of their lives.                          ____________________
