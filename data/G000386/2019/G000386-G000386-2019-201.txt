 President, repealing the noninterference clause means a restricted formulary, which places limits on the drugs that are available to seniors, maybe excluding some drugs that your doctor wants to prescribe for you. I don't believe that Medicare beneficiaries want the government interfering in that process.  Then, as policymakers, we must keep in mind that we are making decisions that affect healthcare choices for the people whom we are elected to represent.  Let's all remember to first do no harm. Repealing the noninterference clause may sound good, but not even a spoonful of sugar will help that bad dose of policy medicine go down.  I come to the floor today to hope that I can put this issue to rest and, as we try to work in a bicameral and bipartisan way to reduce drug costs, that we don't get held up by people who want to do something different by having the government more involved, when it isn't going to save any money and will restrict formularies. It will get the government between you and your doctor.  In other words, I am trying to save Part D. It has been a great success. It is accepted by the people. Let's keep drug costs down without having this issue interfere with our process.  We need to preserve the foundation of private enterprise on which Part D is based--in other words, the marketplace working. We need to get to the real work of reducing prescription drug costs.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Romney). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
