 President, last week, the Department of Labor released its monthly scorecard for the U.S. workforce.  The unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent, which is the lowest rate since December 1969--a new 50-year low. Moreover, an additional 263,000 jobs were created. Job gains have averaged a robust 218,000 over the past 12 months. Additionally, for the ninth straight month, year-over-year nominal wage gains have equaled or exceeded 3 percent.  It is good to see this administration's tax reform and pro-growth policies continuing to improve the daily lives of all Americans.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
