President, I rise to express my support for the VA-HUD Conference Report and to commend the conferees for their work in resolving a number of contentious issues with the House.  First, I would like to commend the conferees for providing adequate funding to renew all expiring section 8 contracts. In my State of Rhode Island, it is expected that section 8 contracts on 4000 units will expire in fiscal year 1998, and I am pleased that this bill will ensure that all of these contracts are renewed.  I would also like to commend the conferees on their successful effort to include the section 8 mark-to-market reforms in the conference report. The Senate Banking Committee passed a mark-to-market bill in June that was initially attached to the balanced budget legislation, but was subsequently dropped in conference.  The significance of inclusion of the mark-to-market reforms in the conference report cannot be overstated because these reforms address an increasingly serious problem, which, if left uncorrected, will threaten the future viability of the section 8 program. The problem I am referring to is the projected increase in section 8 costs as the number of expiring section 8 contracts increases in coming years. In fiscal year 1997, approximately $3.6 was provided to renew expiring contracts. However, absent mark-to-market reforms, the costs of renewing expiring section 8 contracts is expected to increase to $9 billion in fiscal year 1998, and to $18 billion in fiscal year 2002.  The reforms included in this bill address this issue by enabling landlords of section 8 properties to restructure their mortgage contracts, which will reduce the escalating costs of the section 8 program. The reforms will also reduce the subsidy levels that HUD pays to landlords for section 8 assistance. Because of the high costs to build many of these section 8 properties, HUD has been forced in many cases to pay subsidies that are in excess of 120 percent of fair market rent. In fact, a recent study found that 75 percent ofHUD's newer assisted housing projects had rents above fair market rent, and that 50 percent of this housing had rents greater that 120 percent of fair market rent. I am pleased that this bill will address this problem by reducing rents to below fair market rents, or fair market rents for most section 8 housing. These changes will produce $500 million in savings for taxpayers.  Also, the mark-to-market provisions will improve the quality of section 8 housing by requiring landlords to evaluate the rehabilitation needs of their property and undertake necessary repairs. For too long, many of our section 8 properties have been in an embarrassing state of disrepair. In a recent study, it was found that 24 percent of the section 8 properties were distressed. Sadly, some of these section 8 properties have become havens for crime and drug activities. I am pleased that the mark-to-market reforms will begin to attack this problem by requiring landlords to make repairs to their properties and become more responsible owners.  The bill also includes provisions that will enable HUD to screen out rogue owners and managers, as well as provide more effective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of HUD insurance and assisted housing programs.  Most importantly, the reforms in this bill will require landlords who are restructuring their mortgages to maintain their property as section 8 housing throughout the life of the mortgage. This provision is particularly important in ensuring the preservation of the existing stock of section 8 housing.  The mark-to-market reforms included in this bill could affect five Rhode Island housing developments in the near term, and could affect countless other developments in the future, as these provisions are fully implemented by HUD. Overall, I believe these reforms will improve the quality of life for tenants of section 8 housing, half of whom are seniors, and most of whom are very low income.  However, it should be noted that these reforms are not a panacea, and we should be mindful that there is much more to be done. For example, we must take steps to address the ever-worsening affordable housing crisis facing this Nation. Unfortunately, this bill follows HUD appropriations bills in recent years and fails to provide funds for new section 8 vouchers. Indeed, such funds have not been appropriated since 1993.  Also, there is the issue of the term of section 8 contracts. In years past, section 8 contracts have had terms that ranged from 5 to 40 years, with budget authority being allocated in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, because of the adverse budgetary implications of providing long-term contracts, expiring contracts are now being renewed for 1-year terms which require annual appropriations. These 1-year renewals have created a great degree of uncertainty among tenants of section 8 housing who are being notified annually by HUD that they may not have housing if Congress fails to provide section 8 funding. In a meeting with constituents, I was informed that some seniors who are residents of section 8 housing have suffered strokes and other ailments after being notified that their housing was in jeopardy if Congress failed to appropriate funding for section 8 renewals. Mr. President, this is a very serious issue which must be addressed.  While HUD is required to notify tenants about contract renewals, something must be done to ensure that this notification does not unnecessarily alarm seniors and other residents of section 8 housing. I understand that HUD is currently working with a number of tenant groups to craft a notification letter that is less alarming than letters in years past. I intend to work with HUD to see that future notices provide adequate information, without unnecessarily alarming section 8 residents.  Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill increases funding relative to fiscal year 1997 for a number of important programs to Rhode Island. For example, funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program, which provides flexible funding to States and localities for community development initiatives, is increased by $75 million. In fiscal year 1997, Rhode Island cities used over $20 million in CDBG money to fund initiatives ranging from job training to neighborhood revitalization.  In addition, funding for the HOME Program, which is aimed at expanding the supply of affordable housing, is increased by $100 million over fiscal year 1997. Last year, Rhode Island received $3 million in HOME funding which was used to provide 283 units of affordable housing.  Finally, the VA-HUD appropriations bill maintains level funding for a number of important programs such as the section 202 and section 811 programs that provide housing for the Nation's elderly and disabled. A number of Rhode Island groups have successfully used section 202 and section 811 grants to build housing for the elderly and disabled, ameliorating the shortage of affordable housing for these groups in Rhode Island.  In conclusion, I would again like to commend the work of the conferees. Their efforts will help preserve and maintain the section 8 program, in addition to a number of other important housing and community development programs.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will act shortly to approve the conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Act, and I intend to vote for the bill. The bill contains many very worthwhile programs that are vital to our Nation's veterans, to the economic development and viability of our cities, to rural communities, to environmental preservation and remediation, and for other important Government functions. The conferees have done an excellent job of crafting a bill that is balanced and fair, while staying within the budgetary allocations for these programs.  However, once again, I must highlight the myriad of programs that are included in this conference agreement that were not considered in the normal budgetary review process. These programs may very well have a great deal of merit, but unless one is a member of the Appropriations Committee, it is nearly impossible to determine what, if any, criteria were applied to determine the relative worthiness of each of the earmarks and set-asides in the agreement.  For example:       $5 million dollars is earmarked for a study on the cost-     effectiveness of contracting with local hospitals in east      central Florida for the provision of nonemergent inpatient      health care needs of veterans. This earmark was contained in      the House bill, but I find it difficult to determine from the      conference agreement or the House report why such a study is      so urgently needed in east Florida, rather than other areas      of the country that may be considering this type of      contracting.       As I noted when the Senate considered the bill, $10 is      earmarked for demolition and replacement of the Heritage      House in Kansas City, Mo. I still do not understand the      urgency of proceeding with this, rather than other similar      projects.       The bill earmarks $99.6 million for 120 specific Economic      Development Initiative grants, as specified in the report      language. While both bills contained these kinds of earmarks,      my colleagues might be interested to know that the amount      earmarked in the conference agreement is more than twice the      amount earmarked in the Senate bill which was $40 million. I      suspect that a scrupulous comparison of the lists of      earmarked projects in the two bills would conclude that every      project earmarked in either bill is included in this      conference agreement, and then some.       The bill contains an earmark of $15 million for the county      of San Bernardino, Ca, for neighborhood initiatives. I have      not been able to find this earmark in either the House or      Senate bill, neither of which contain any explanatory      language on this initiative.       The bill contains a section which was also included in the      Senate bill, transferring a previous $7.1 million earmark for      a Kansas City industrial park at 18th Street and Indiana      Avenue instead to the rehabilitation and infrastructure      development associated with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum      and jazz museum at 18th and Vine.       The bill authorizes and appropriates $90 million additional      funding for construction of a consolidated EPA research      facility at Research Triangle Park, NC, and raises the total      construction cap on the project, including a child care      center and computer center, to $272.7 million. I recognize      that this provision was included in the House bill, but I      have not been able to find any justification in the bill or      report for earmarking $90 million as part of a nearly $300      million expenditure for this project, versus other worthy      projects.       The bill retains the earmarks in the Senate bill for a $50      million in grants to Texas, requiring State matching of 20      percent, for improving water and wastewater treatment      facilities for the colonias; and a $15 million grant to      Alaska to address drinking water and wastewater      infrastructure needs.       The bill also includes an earmark of $253.1 million for 39      specific wastewater and water treatment facilities and ground      water protection infrastructure, earmarked as stated in the      report. Again, this type of earmark was included in the      Senate and House bills, but the conference earmarked almost      three times the amount in the Senate bill.  The bill also contains three earmarks which I believe were not included in either the Senate or House bill:       $4 million dollars is earmarked for each of three areas--a      native American area in Alaska, a rural area in Iowa, and a      rural area in Missouri--for rural economic development      grants, to test comprehensive approaches to developing a job      base through economic development, developing affordable low-      and moderate-income rental and homeownership housing, and      increasing the investment of both private and nonprofit      capital. While I understand the need to provide funding for      rural communities to improve their living standards, housing      availability, and the like, I question whether the three      areas singled out in this language are the most deserving of      4 million dollars each. And I note that the earmarks for      rural areas in Iowa and Missouri were not contained in either      bill, but were added by the conferees.       The bill includes a section, which I have not found in      either the Senate or House bill, directing FEMA to make a      grant of $1.5 million to resolve issues under the Uniform      Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of      1970 involving the city of Jackson, Ms. Again, the      justification provided for this project is sketchy, to say      the least.       The bill contains a section which cancels the indebtedness      of the village of Robbins, IL, for HUD-guaranteed water and      sewer bonds, including principal, interest, and any fees and      other charges. Again, I could find no mention of this      proposal in either the Senate or House bills.  As I have said many times, these types of earmarks added in conference are an egregious evasion of the normal budget review process, which this body should not condone.  I will not elaborate on the many earmarks and set-aside in the report language of the conference agreement.  I ask unanimous consent that the objectionable provisions be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Objectionable Provisions in H.R. 2158, Conference Agreement on Fiscal           Year 1998 VA/HUD/Independent Agencies Appropriations                             Bill Language       $5 million earmarked for a study on the cost-effectiveness      of contracting with local hospitals in East Central Florida      for the provision of non-emergent inpatient health care needs      of veterans.       Prohibition on relocating the loan guaranty divisions of      the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St.      Petersburg, Florida to the Department of Veterans Affairs      Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia, because the conferees do      not believe the VA has adequately justified the proposed      relocation and has not provided a detailed cost-benefit      analysis including comparison of savings for the cost of      space and personnel.       $10 earmarked for demolition and replacement of the      Heritage House in Kansas City, Missouri.       $4 million earmarked for each of three areas--a Native      American area in Alaska, a rural area in Iowa, and a rural      area in Missouri--for rural economic development grants, to      test comprehensive approaches to developing a job base      through economic development, developing affordable low- and      moderate-income rental and homeownership housing, and      increasing the investment of both private and nonprofit      capital.       $99.6 million earmarked for 120 specific Economic      Development Initiative grants as specified in the report      language.       $15 million earmarked for the County of San Bernardino,      California, for neighborhood initiatives.       $3.5 million earmarked for the non-Federal cost-share of      the levee project at Devils Lake, North Dakota.       Sec. 203--Waives the requirement that the City of Oglesby,      Illinois, hold public hearings concerning an environmental      assessment for a warehouse project.       Sec. 206--$7.1 million transferring an earmark for a Kansas      City industrial park at 18th Street and Indiana Avenue      instead to the rehabilitation and infrastructure development      associated with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and jazz      museum at 18th and Vine.       Sec. 218--Cancels the indebtedness of the Village of      Robbins, Illinois, for HUD-guaranteed water and sewer bonds,      including principal, interest, and any fees and other      charges.       Authorizes and appropriates $90 million additional funding      for construction of a consolidated EPA research facility at      Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and raises the total      construction cap on the project, including a child care      center and computer center, to $272.7 million.       Earmarks $50 million for grants to Texas, requiring state      matching of 20 percent, for improving water and wastewater      treatment facilities for the colonias.       $15 million earmarked for grants to Alaska to address      drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs.       Earmarks $253.1 million for 39 specific wastewater and      water treatment facilities and groundwater protection      infrastructure, earmarked as stated in the report.       Directs FEMA to make a grant of $1.5 million to resolve      issues under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real      Property Acquisition Act of 1970 involving the City of      Jackson, Mississippi.       Sec. 415--``Buy America'' protections.                            REPORT LANGUAGE       [NOTE: Conferees state that they endorse all language in      the House and Senate reports that is not explicitly      contradicted in the conference agreement. Therefore, all      earmarks and set-aside in the underlying reports remain valid      unless reversed in the conference agreement.]       Earmarks $6 million for the Musculoskeletal Disease      Prevention and Treatment Research Center at the Jerry L.      Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center in Loma Linda, California.       Explicit emphasis on report language regarding expanding an      outpatient clinic in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, activation      costs for construction projects at the medical centers in      Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona; and the      demonstration project involving the Clarksburg VA Medical      Center and Ruby Memorial Hospital.       Urges VA to establish a community-based outpatient clinic      in Brookhaven, New York.       Supportive language for the two-year pilot project in New      England and Hawaii, funded through the Department of Defense,      to explore improved and innovative methods of diabetes      detection, prevention, and care.       Encourages VA to examine carefully the work in Detroit      associated with Population and Resources Management      Information Network, and to consider setting aside an      appropriate amount of funds for development and analytical      work associated with that system.       Earmarks $98.4 million for 7 major construction projects of      the VA, including a $4 million add-on for a cemetery in      Arizona.       Earmarks $1.5 million for expansion of the existing      national cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.       Earmarks $1.5 million to increase the number of niches at      the columbarium at the National Memorial Cemetery of the      Pacific.       Earmarks $48.3 million for 23 specific science and      technology projects.       Earmarks $8 million of the funding set aside for research      on EPA particulate matter standards to create ``up to five      university-based research centers focused on PM-related      environment and health effects;'' establishes certain      governing criteria and guidelines for selection of these      centers, although the report states the selection is to be      competitive.       Earmarks $76.5 million from the budget for environmental      programs and management at EPA for 60 specific projects.       Earmarks $2.5 million of the EPA's hazardous substance      Superfund to continue a study on the health effects of      consuming Great Lakes fish, and 2 million for continued work      on the Toms River, New Jersey cancer evaluation and research      project.       Encourages EPA to implement a fixed-price, at-risk      contracting proposal for cleanup of the Carolina Transformer      Site in North Carolina.       Urges immediate construction at the Pepe Field Superfund      site in Boonton, New Jersey.       Recognizes the acute need for additional water treatment      capacity in San Diego County, California, although limited      funds prevented the conferees from earmarking an amount for      this project.       States awareness of San Diego's application for grant      assistance through the U.S.-Mexico border programs for the      South Bay Water Reclamation Facility, and urges that the      matter be reviewed carefully for appropriate support.       Notes support for construction of the Jonathan Rogers plant      in El Paso, Texas, and encourages EPA to provide an      appropriate amount from the border infrastructure fund to      support the project.       Earmarks $500,000 from FEMA's emergency management planning      funds for a comprehensive analysis and plan of evacuation      alternatives for the New Orleans metropolitan area.       States awareness of proposals by the International      Hurricane Center at Florida International University to apply      advanced high-accuracy satellite laser altimeter surveying      techniques to coastal and flood plain modeling and post      natural disaster damage assessments, and urges FEMA to      consider funding such proposals from discretionary funds.       Notes that Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana, faces the      potential threat of multiple disasters, including weather-     related threats, and urges FEMA to provide support for      installation and testing of a prototype communications      system.       Urges NASA to make available underutilized facilities at      the Stennis Space Center for use by industry in launch      vehicle development activities.       Earmarks $19.65 million from NASA's aeronautics and      technology funds for 9 specific projects.       Earmarks $5 million of NASA's mission support funds for      facilities enhancements at Stennis Space Center.       Prohibition on relocating NASA aircraft based east of the      Mississippi River (at the Wallops Island flight facility) to      the Dryden Flight Research Center in California.       Earmarks $1 million of National Science Foundation funds      for the U.S./Mexico Foundation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not an exhaustive list of all the earmarks the conferees endorsed. As with previously submitted conference agreements, the conferees explicitly state in the report that they endorse all the provisions of the Senate and House reports on the bill, unless they are explicitly contradicted or addressed in the conference report. So there are a lot more earmarks that the conferees intend that the agencies will adhere to in allocating appropriated funds.  Again, Mr. President, I hesitate to say that all of these earmarks and set-asides are wasteful, or unnecessary. I want to stress that these projects may very well have merit and may very well be worthy of inclusion in this bill.  But the process the Congress established for itself, which involves both authorization and appropriation of spending items, is routinely ignored in the appropriations bills. These unauthorized and locality specific earmarks and add-ons have bypassed the normal agency review process and have bypassed the authorization process. They have simply been included in the appropriations bill because a small segment of the Senate or House, those who serve on Appropriations Committee, decided to include them.  Mr. President, the American people deserve to know how their money is spent, and why. Millions of dollars will be spent for the projects on the attached list, and I doubt that most Senators know why these projects were chosen for earmarks or set-asides. The American people certainly don't have access to that information.  I intend to send a letter to the President asking that he consider using his line-item veto authority to eliminate these spending items from this bill. That is why we gave him a line-item veto--to eliminate wasteful, unnecessary, and low-priority spending. He has already demonstrated his willingness to use the line-item veto, and I hope he continues to exercise that authority when clearly necessary.  Mr. President, as I said, I support the majority of the provisions of this bill, and I intend to vote for it. I am thankful, however, that a mechanism now exists that could, if utilized, eliminate the earmarks and set-asides in this bill to which I must object.                      particulate matter research
