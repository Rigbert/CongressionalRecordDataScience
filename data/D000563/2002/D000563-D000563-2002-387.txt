President, I am going to address, in a few moments, the pending issue involving the energy bill, particularly when it comes to the renewable portfolio standard for energy. Before I do that, though, I ask the indulgence of the Senate for a few moments to address an unrelated issue which I think is of critical importance to our Nation.  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')
