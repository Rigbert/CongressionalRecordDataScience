 President, ``Did the Bush administration manipulate intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons program to justify an invasion of Iraq?'' This is the central question posed by discredited Ambassador Joe Wilson in his July 6, 2003, op-ed published by the New York Times.  Wilson alleged the answer to the question was ``yes'', and a political firestorm ensued. Indeed, the year-long furor over the infamous 16 words stemmed from Mr. Wilson's disproved claims.  Many of the President's fiercest critics have since argued the Bush administration misled the country into war, a truly incendiary charge.  Lord Butler's comprehensive report includes the real 16-word statement we should focus on. Here is what he had to say:       We conclude that the statement in President Bush's State of      the Union address . . . is well founded.  It is well founded. Yet the New York Times threw its hat into the ring early and ran an editorial on July 12, 2003 amplifying Wilson's irresponsible claim and flaming the fires of this pseudo-scandal. This is what they had to say:       Now the American people need to know how the accusation got      into the speech in the first place, and whether it was put      there with an intent to deceive the nation. The White House      has a lot of explaining to do.  Will the New York Times, which printed 70 stories that repeated Joe Wilson's claims, now retract this editorial? Will it acknowledge on the editorial page the truth about Joe Wilson?  Rather than displaying caution and restraint, too many American politicians raced, like the New York Times, to echo this outrageous allegation.  Early into the fray was the senior Senator from North Carolina. On July 22, 2003, Fox News played a clip from one of Senator Edwards' rallies in which he repeats Wilson's attacks on the President's honesty. Senator Edwards claims:       Nothing is more important than the credibility of the      president of the United States and the words that come out of      his mouth at the State of the Union are, in fact, the      responsibility of the president.  According to the correspondent at the rally:       Edwards blasted the president's 16-word State of the Union      sentence on British intelligence information that Iraq sought      nuclear weapons material from Africa.  Now a candidate for the Vice Presidency, Senator Edwards will have many media opportunities to set the record straight about his view of the President's State of the Union speech. In the name of fairness, I sure hope he will.  Not to be outdone, the Senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, delivered an attack on the Bush administration this January. Senator Kennedy repeated Wilson's distortions, and claimed:       The gross abuse of intelligence was on full display in the      president's State of the Union address last January, when he      spoke the now infamous 16 words. . . . And as we all know      now, that allegation was false. . . . President Bush and his      advisers should have presented their case honestly.  When will Senator Kennedy acknowledge that the President's claim was ``well founded?'' The junior Senator from Massachusetts has also accused the President of misleading the country. An Associated Press report from 2003 includes an exchange between Senator Kerry and a woman on the campaign trail. Here is how it went.       When a woman asked whether U.S. intelligence on Iraq was      doctored, Kerry replies that Americans were ``clearly      misled'' on two specific pieces of intelligence. ``I will not      let him off the hook throughout this campaign with respect to      America's credibility . . .  That is the junior Senator from Massachusetts. Let me quote another AP report about Senator Kerry from last summer:       Kerry said Bush made his case for war based on U.S.      intelligence that now appear to be wrong--that Iraq sought      nuclear material from Africa.  Now that Joe Wilson's claims have been completely discredited, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has a chance to set the record straight. But will he?  I mentioned yesterday the distinguished Minority Leader had repeated Joe Wilson's discredited claims on the Senate Floor. Just last month, Senator Daschle said:       Sunlight, it's been said, is the best disinfectant. But for      too long, the administration has been able to keep Congress      and the American people in the dark . . . serious matters,      such as the manipulation of intelligence about Iraq, have      received only fitful attention.  The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Report reached the following conclusions that directly refute the serious charges made by the President's critics:       Conclusion 83. The Committee did not find any evidence that      Administration officials attempted to coerce, influence, or      pressure analysts to change their judgments related to Iraq's      weapons of mass destruction capabilities.       Conclusion 84. The Committee found no evidence that the      Vice President's visits to the CIA were attempts to pressure      analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure analysts by      those who participated in the briefings on Iraq's WMD      programs, or did pressure analysts to change their      assessments.  Let us not allow honesty to become a casualty of the campaign season.  My colleagues now have an opportunity--and I am sure they will takeit--to set the record straight about their support of Mr. Wilson's outrageous claims. In the name of fairness, will they?                          ____________________
