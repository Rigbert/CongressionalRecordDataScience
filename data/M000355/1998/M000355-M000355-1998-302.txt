 President, before we close for the vote on this India-Pakistan bill, let me re-examine our mandate from the leadership.  Senator Biden and I and the task force have been asked to focus on the following issues: What constitutes a sanction? Is it a sanction when we withhold or condition U.S. foreign assistance? Is it a sanction when we ban investment? Obviously, it is a sanction to ban commercial activity or investment, but there are other issues of aid conditions that are clearly foggy. What sanctions are in place? What flexibility has been offered? And how are these current sanctions being implemented? Implementation, even after we enact a sanction, has been somewhat haphazard.  Mr. President, as the task force moves forward, let me suggest that we are very likely to have a hearing before the August recess to give people out in the country who are affected by whatwe decide an opportunity to have their say. We know the business community, for example, seems to be comfortable with the 301 process, because they know what to expect and when to expect it. We look forward to hearing from them. There are others out in our country who feel the United States is, after all, the beacon of freedom in the world and we should express ourselves about policies in other countries with which we disagree, and we want to hear from them, Mr. President, as well.  It is the intention of Senator Biden and myself to meet the September 1 deadline that the leadership has given us. I want to say that we welcome the thoughts and comments of our colleagues both on and off the task force.  Mr. President, I understand that time has expired.
