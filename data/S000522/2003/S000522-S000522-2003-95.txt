Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2297 as amended, the Veterans Benefit Act of 2003, contains 20 substantive provisions and is a diverse and comprehensive measure with very broad bipartisan support.                              {time}  1215  This bill will affect veterans and survivors alike.  Among the education provisions, the bill provides for an expansion of the Montgomery GI Bill, the college program, by authorizing educational assistance for on-job training in certain 6-month self-employment training programs. It provides an extension of the delimiting date for survivors' and dependents' education benefits when the eligible individual is involuntarily ordered to full-time National Guard duty. It provides for an extension of the VA's Veterans' Advisory Committee on education through December 31 of 2009 and for the repeal of the VA's obsolete education loan program authorization. This program has not made a loan in the past several years because of other better options in the public and private sector.  The bill would also provide that the remarriage of the surviving spouse of a veteran after attaining the age of 55 would not result in the termination of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, or the DIC program. It allows a remarried surviving spouse to attain eligibility for burial in a national cemetery based on his or her marriage to a veteran. It makes permanent the State Cemetery Grants Program. It reinstates a VA pilot program to provide vocational training to newly eligible VA nonservice-connected pension recipients.  It increases, Mr. Speaker, the specially adapted automobile grant from $9,000 to $11,000 and increases the specially adapted housing grant from $48,000 to $50,000 for the most severely disabled veterans and from $9,350 to $10,000 for less severely disabled veterans.  The bill also adds cirrhosis of the liver to the list of presumed service-connected disabilities for former prisoners of war.  It eliminates the requirement that a POW be held for 30 days or more to qualify for presumptions of service-connection for certain disabilities: psychosis and any of the anxiety states, organic residuals of frostbite, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis.  It expands benefits eligibility to those children with spina bifida who were born to Vietnam-era veterans who served in an area of Korea near the demilitarized zone between October 1 of 1967 and May 7 of 1975.  Out of concern about spina bifida, Mr. Speaker, I would note parenthetically that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) and I formed the Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus, which we now co-chair. This caucus is dedicated to improving the health care and overall quality of life for the some 70,000 Americans and their families living with spina bifida, and in a very short time I would again note to my colleagues we have about 20 Members who have joined. And just a little push here in promotion, if they would like to join that spina bifida caucus, we would very much like to have them as part of it.  Let me continue with the bill.  H.R. 2297, as amended, would also make permanent the VA home loan program for members of the Selected Reserve. It reinstates the Department of Veterans Affairs' vendee loan program and provides the full amount of compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation for eligible members of the New Philippine Scouts, who served just after World War II, who are legal residents of the United States. It also provides the full amount of DIC for service in the organized military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, including organized guerrilla units, to individuals who are legal residents of the United States. It extends eligibility for burial in a national cemetery to New Philippine Scouts, as well as eligibility for burial benefits to those who lawfully reside in the United States. It extends the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to maintain a regional office in Manila, Philippines, through December 31 also of 2009.  It mandates that the Department of Labor place staff in veterans' assistance offices at oversees military installations 90 days after the date of enactment, and it expands the list of serious Federal criminal offenses a conviction of which would result in a bar to all VA benefits.  As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, the bill addresses the needs for former prisoners of war. Current law requires former POWs to have been confined for at least 30 days before they qualify for a presumption of service-connection for certain disabilities. Prisoners of war in more recent conflicts, however, have been interred for shorter periods of time. All the POWs from Operation Iraqi Freedom were confined for less than 30 days, for example.  Because physical and psychological trauma can indeed occur within minutes of capture, let alone days or weeks, H.R. 2297, as amended, would provide a presumption of service-connection disability without regard to length of confinement for certain psychiatric disabilities as well as cold-weather-related injuries and traumatic osteoarthritis.  The bill would also, as I said, add a number of other aspects, and I hopefully have outlined those adequately to the committee.  Let me just say, finally, Mr. Speaker, I really want to congratulate the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Brown), the subcommittee chair of our Subcommittee on Benefits, and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud), his ranking member, for their outstanding work on this legislation, for doing the hard work, holding the hearings, working out all the different disparate provisions, and then working to bring it together in a bipartisan way so that we can present to this body a bill that we can all be proud of that will tangibly advance the ball when it comes to our veterans. I want to thank them very much for their good hard work and also the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), my good friend and colleague, on whom we have partnered for years now as chairman and ranking member, working on bills to benefit our veterans both on the health care area and benefits area. I want to thank him as well.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
