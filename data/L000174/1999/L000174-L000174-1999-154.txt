President, I am proud to join Senator Fitzgerald in cosponsoring the Electronic Benefit Interoperability and Portability Act of 1999.  The Food Stamp Program has been critical to diminishing hunger and improving nutrition and health throughout our country. As the country's largest source of food aid, approximately 18 million people--half of which are children--receive food stamp benefits every month. In my home State of Vermont, more than 20,000 households depend on food stamps to help feed their families.  In an effort to strengthen and streamline the Food Stamp Program, three years ago Congress mandated that every State switch to an Electronic Benefits Transfer system for distributing food stamp benefits. Operating like ATM or credit card machines at cash registers, EBT streamlines food stamps by eliminating the cumbersome paper system.  The implementation of the EBT system was left up to the States, and nearly 40 States currently have switched to this new system. EBT has already demonstrated itself to be a more efficient system for distributing food stamp benefits, and it promises to help reduce food stamp fraud.  However, three years into the implementation of EBT, a problem has arisen--some State EBT systems do not match up with neighboring State EBT systems, leaving residents of border communities unable to utilize their food stamp benefits across State lines. This Federal benefit program has always been recognized and redeemable in every State, irrespective of where the actual food stamps were issued.  For some of our more rural States, the inability to access food stamp benefits across State lines could mean the difference between traveling a few miles to a grocery store in the next State to traveling an hour or more to the closest grocery store in one's home State. Clearly, this creates quite a burden.  The bill which we are introducing today would correct this oversight by requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to adopt a national EBT standard, and requiring that all States be EBT interoperable by 2002.  Vermont Commissioner of Social Welfare Jane Kitchel has voiced her support for this bill, as has the New England Convenience Store Association.  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Fitzgerald for all of his work on this issue. I believe that this bill will help make the Food Stamp Program more streamlined and efficient, and I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
