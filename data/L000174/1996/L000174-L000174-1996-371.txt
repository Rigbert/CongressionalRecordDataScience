1541 were included in an amendment to which we jointly agreed. Section 357 establishes flood water retention pilot projects under which farmers may receive incentives to restore land to fully functioning wetlands. The restoration of these wetlands will benefit their neighbors by reducing flooding.  Section 358 was included in the bill to ensure that when a farmer voluntarily restores a wetland on land now exempt from Swampbuster penalties, that land will not subsequently be considered a converted wetland under Swampbuster. Section 364 was then added because of concern that section 358 did not protect against abandonment related regulatory policies. The sections need to be rewritten to work correctly.  Would the Senator from Indiana agree that I have correctly described the history of these amendments?
