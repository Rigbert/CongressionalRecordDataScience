 The enactment of that legislation demonstrates that the retention of Finance Committee jurisdiction over customs revenue functions and commercial operations does not in any way diminish the effective oversight of other functions within the Department of Homeland Security by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, nor does it detract from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee as the principal point of oversight and review for homeland security matters in the U.S. Senate. In fact, by drawing on the focus and expertise of both committees, we improve overall Senate oversight of the homeland security interests and economic security interests of the United States.
