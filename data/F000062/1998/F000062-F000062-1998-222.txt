 President, this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we must rededicate ourselves to making our public education system the best. These reforms, if implemented by states and local school districts in partnership with the federal government, will improve: The achievement of students; the quality of teaching; and the accountability of public school systems.  This sense of the Senate amendment has six elements. It calls on the federal government to work with states, school districts and local leaders to accomplish the following goals by the year 2005:  (1) Establish achievement levels and assessments in every grade for the core academic curriculum; measure each regular student's performance; and prohibit the practice of ``social promotion'' of students (promoting students routinely from one grade to the next without regard to their academic achievement);  (2) Provide remedial programs for students whose achievement levels indicate they should not be promoted to the next grade;  (3) Create smaller schools to enable students to have closer interaction with teachers;  (4) Require at least 180 days of instruction per year in core curriculum subjects;  (5) Recruit teachers who are adequately trained and credentialed in the subject or subjects they teach and encourage excellent, experienced teachers to remain in the classroom by providing adequate salaries; require all teachers to be credentialed and limit emergency or temporary teaching credentials to a limited period of time; hold teachers and principals accountable to high educational standards;  (6) Require all regular students to pass an examination in basic core curriculum subjects in order to receive a high school diploma.                 u.s. schools' performance unimpressive  In 1983--15 years ago--the National Commission on Excellence in Education issued its startling report on the decline of America's schools, titled ``A Nation at Risk.'' Our schools today are still at risk.  A February report this year revealed that American high school seniors are among the world's least prepared in math and science, scoring far below their peers in other countries. Overall, U.S. students outperformed only two countries in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study--Cyprus and South Africa. In twelfth grade advanced math and physics, U.S. students scored last in physics and next to last in math. American eighth graders scored well below the international average in math.  SAT scores today are near their lowest point ever, reports the Brookings Institute. The National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that math, science, writing and reading achievement have been flat for the past quarter century.  The U.S. Department of Education last fall reported that 29 percent of allcollege freshmen require remedial classes in basic skills.  The 1997 annual report on our national education goals found that the high school dropout rate has increased and more teachers reported student disruptions in their classrooms.  The national goals report told us that performance has declined in reading achievement at grade 12 and in the percentage of secondary teachers who hold a degree in their main teaching assignment.  The goals report found no significant improvement in high school completion rate or reading achievement at grades 4 and 8.            issue 1: achievement levels; no social promotion  The first provision of my amendment urges the establishment of achievement levels and assessments in every grade for the core academic curriculum and calls on state and local schools to stop social promotion. Social promotion is the practice of schools' advancing a student from one grade to the next regardless of the student's academic achievement.  Forty-nine states are working to establish achievement standards and assessments, but few have completed the task. AFT found: ``In most districts, there are no agreed-upon explicit standards of performance to which students are held accountable.''  Educators widely agree that tough, clear academic content and performance standards are the only way to determine what students are learning and how quickly or slowly they are learning it. Standards should be the foundation of learning.  Social promotion is contrary to tough standards. Saying that social promotion is ``rampant,'' AFT leaders found that school districts' criteria for passing and retaining students is vague, that only 17 states have standards in the four core disciplines (English, math, social studies and science) that are well grounded in content and that are clear enough to be used.  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our students, their parents and the public.  I agree with the conclusion of the September 1997 study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers:       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school      failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are      deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be      successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count;      for teachers who must face students who know that teachers      wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the      business community and colleges that must spend millions of      dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a      growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to      contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the      nation.                         How Widespread Is It?  None of the districts surveyed by AFT have an explicit policy of social promotion, but almost every district has an implicit practice of social promotion. Almost all districts view holding students back as a policy of last resort and many put explicit limits on retaining students. Districts have loose and vague criteria for moving a student from one grade to the next. This approach, concludes AFT, is implicit approval of social promotion.  AFT found last year that 7 states are seeking to end social promotion by requiring students to meet the state standards before being promoted into certain grades, an increase over the 4 of the previous year.  Mike Wright, a San Diegian, is an example. Cited in the February 16 San Diego Union-Tribune, Mr. Wright say he routinely got promoted from grade to grade and even graduated from high school, even though he failed some subjects. At age 29, he is now enrolled in a community college program to learn to read--at age 29.  Social promotion is a cruel joke. We are fooling students. We are fooling ourselves. Students think a high school diploma means something. But in reality, we are graduating students who cannot count change, who cannot read a newspaper, who cannot fill out an employment application.      The Academic Cost of No Achievement Levels, Social Promotion  Students' need for remedial work is one measure of the harm of the lack of clear achievement levels and the practice of social promotion. Here are some examples:  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college professors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a student has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63% of employers and 76 percent of professors said that the diploma is no guarantee that a graduate can read, write or do basic math.  In California, a December 1997 report from a state education accountability task force estimated that at least half of the state's students--3 million children--perform below levels considered proficient for their grade level.  Nationwide, about one third of college freshmen take remedial courses in college and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, offer remediation, says the AFT study.  A March 27 California State University study found that more than two-thirds of students enter Cal State campuses in Los Angeles lack the math or English they should have mastered in high school. At some high schools, not one graduate going on to one of Cal State's campuses passed a basic skills test. At Cal State Dominguez Hills, for example, 8 out of 10 freshmen enrollees last fall needed remedial English and 87 percent needed remedial math.  Sadly, these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1997, 47 percent of freshmen enrolled at CSU needed remediation, compared to 43 percent in each of the previous three years. In math, 54 percent needed remedial help, compared to 48 percent in 1994.  Similarly, almost 35 percent of entering freshmen at the University of California do poorly on UC's English proficiency test and must receive help in their first year.  Florida spent $53 million in college on remedial education, says the AFT study.  In Boston, school principals estimate that half their ninth graders are not prepared for high school work.  In Ohio, nearly one fourth of all freshmen who attend state public universities must take remedial math or English (Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 7, 1997)  Employers tell me that their new hires are unprepared for work and they have to provide very basic training to make them employable. For example, last year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills training (USA Today, 1996).           Support for Ending Social Promotion is Widespread  Fortunately, many policymakers are beginning to realize that we must stop social promotion. President Clinton called for ending it in his January 27 State of the Union speech. He said, ``We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.''  On February 23, the President sent Secretary Riley a memo asking him to prepare guidelines for educators on ending social promotion and guidelines for using federal funds to adopt sound promotion policies. ``Neither promoting students when they are unprepared or simply retaining them in the same grade is the right response to low student achievement,'' the President wrote. ``Both approaches presume high rates of initial failure are inevitable and acceptable.''  At least three states--Florida, Arkansas and Texas--explicitly outlaw social promotion.  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their new policy was put in place, in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 students failed tests in the third, sixth and eighth and ninth grades and then went to mandatory summer school. Chicago School Superintendent calls social promotion ``education malpractice.'' He says from now on his schools' only product will be student achievement.  Cincinnati's students are now promoted based on specific standards that define what students must know.  In my own state, the San Diego School Board in February adopted requirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate grade-level performance. And they will require all students to earn a C overall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and for high school graduation. For example, San Diego's schools are requiring that eighth graders who donot pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer school.  As long as we tolerate social promotion and the absence of standards, we will never know (1) what our students need to learn and (2) whether they have learned what they should learn. How, I ask, can you measure what you have accomplished if you don't know where you are going?                    issue 2: more remedial programs  Some schools are trying to provide after-school help, tutoring and summer school remedial programs as ways of intervening when students are having learning problems, but a report by the American Federation of Teachers found that only 13 states require local school districts to provide academic intervention for students who fail to meet standards. Similarly, a report of the Council of Chief State School Officers in 1997 on math and science standards, found that states were doing very little to ensure that all students master the standards.  AFT's 1997 report on state standards found that only 13 states require and fund intervention programs to help low-performing students, up from 10 the previous year.  The Chicago Public School, for example, have launched a major revamping of their school system, and have made after-school programs a priority in helping students learn.                        issue 3: smaller schools  The amendment calls on school districts to have smaller schools. In California, some campuses sprawl across acres and acres and schools can have thousands of students. The principal is just a voice over the loudspeaker. School personnel hardly know the names of the students.  I believe that elementary schools should have no more than 500 students; middle schools, 750 students; and high schools, 1,500 students. I believe that in smaller schools children have a stronger sense of community and connectedness, that school personnel become closer to and more effective with their students.  One study of 744 large high schools found that the dropout rate at schools with over 2,000 students was double that of schools with 667 or fewer students. Another study of 357 schools revealed that large schools have higher rates of class cutting, absenteeism, and classroom disorders.  I believe these studies make a compelling case.                      issue 4: longer school year  My amendment also urges states and school districts to have a school year of at least 180 days. The U.S. school year averages around 180 days, an outdated calendar based on our agrarian past over 100 years ago.  Currently, 29 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico require a minimum of 180 teaching days. California now requires only 172 teaching days, but a new state law does provide incentive funds for adding up to eight professional days to the 172-day school year.  Many other countries have longer school years than we do. Students in England, Germany and Japan go to school between 220 and 243 days a year.  A 1993 study entitled ``Timepiece: Extending and Enhancing Learning Time'' observed that American school children spend more days out of school than in school and documented ``summer learning loss,'' finding that teachers spend four to six weeks every fall going over lessons from the previous school year. Similarly, A Nation at Risk recommended lengthening both the school day and the school year.  Along with setting high standards, we must put more time into teaching and learning and thus my amendment recommends 180 days of instructional time, which still would leave us with a school year shorter than many of our international competitors.                       issue 5. trained teachers  Class sizes cannot be reduced without hiring more teachers. And these teachers must be trained and credentialed teachers.  The National Commission on Teaching and Learning in November 1997 brought us some disturbing findings:  More than one-fourth of newly-hired teachers lack qualifications for their jobs.  The U.S. has no real system in place to ensure that teachers get access to the kinds of knowledge they need to help their students succeed.  Twenty-three percent of high school teachers do not even have a minor in their main teaching field.  School systems often waive or lower standards to hire people without qualifications to teach.  California, unfortunately, is a case example. We have 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials. In California, nearly 22,000 of the 240,000 public school teachers in California are not fully credentialed or have not passed a basic skills test. Half of California's math and science teachers did not minor in those subjects in college, yet they are teaching. The October 13, 1997, U.S. News and World Report reported that in Los Angeles, ``new teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former clown, and several chiropractors.''  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future ranked California near the bottom of states in the quality of our public school teaching force because we have some of the highest proportions of uncertified or undertrained teachers, particularly in math and science. The Commission defined ``well-qualified'' as a teacher with full certification and a major in their assigned field. By this measure, only 65 percent of the state's teachers meet the standard. Nationally, that figure is 72 percent. In California, 46 percent of high school math teachers did not minor in math. The national average is 28 percent.  California will need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade because of our escalating enrollment. But a 1996 analysis by Policy Analysis for California Education found that my state could only expect about 9,000 new credentialed teachers per year if current trends continue.  Without good teachers, no school reform, however visionary or revolutionary, can improve student learning. This nation needs a major investment in teacher training, professional development and we need to pay teachers decent, professional salaries to attract and retain them.                  issue 6: final exams for graduation  Without achievement levels or tests, students today can leave high school with a diploma.  According to the Council of Chief State School Officers, for the 1995-1996 school year, only 17 states require passing minimum competency tests for high school graduation. California, for example, does not require high school graduation exams.  The 1997 AFT report on state standards found that only 13 states have high school graduation exams based on 10th grade standards or higher.  Therefore, without standards, with social promotion rampant, a high school diploma means little. It is no measure of achievement. This has to stop.             the public expects performance, accountability  In a recent survey of Californians, 61 percent agreed that our schools need a ``major overhaul,'' up from 54 percent who answered the same question two years ago. A mere six percent believe that schools provide a ``quality education.''  A poll by Policy Analysis for California Education found that only 17 percent of Californians considers the state's schools ``good'' or ``excellent,'' down from about 33 percent three years ago. A 1997 poll in my state found that improving elementary and secondary education has replaced crime and immigration at Californians' top priority.  Nationally, a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll last year found that 58 percent of Americans say fundamental changes are needed in U.S. schools. A Garin-Hart poll last year found only 9% of the public believes our public education system ``works pretty well.'' Only 27 percent gave our schools an above-average rating. A whopping 84% of people favor establishing meaningful national standards.                               conclusion  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment because we must stop shortchanging our students.  School achievement must mean something. It must mean more than filling up a seat at a desk for 12 years. A diploma should not just be a symbol of accumulating time in school. And school systems need to be accountable.  I hope today the Senate will go on record in support of this modest amendment that expresses 6 critical principles for school reform.
