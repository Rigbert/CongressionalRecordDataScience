HATCH. I am prepared, but I think we should use one of the nine open amendments to be fair about it. But if you want to raise a technical objection and not use one, that is fine with me, because it is fair to the distinguished Senator from California, whom I oppose. That is why you kept those amendments. I think it is fairer to use one of them. That way, we do not expand the list. That is what I would do for you. If you won't, then I will accept whatever.
