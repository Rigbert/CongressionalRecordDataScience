 Before the Senator from Georgia got in here, I commented on several of the States. For example, Indiana, where the presiding office is from, he lost, and did so with grace, as much grace as he could, a major installation in Indiana.  Our own chairman, Senator Thurmond, I mean, no one, no one can have more political influence to stop the closing of a base in his home State than the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. And Senator Thurmond was willing to say, all right we have to bite the bullet.  The big issue here is, we need to use the money that is used on excess capacity to be spent on such things as modernization, quality of life, on readiness, on force strength. These are the things that we need to be talking about.  So, yes, the whole thing on privatization in place, it was anticipated someone might bring it up. So the GAO in their report, when they came to the conclusion that if you privatize that excess capacity in place in Sacramento and in San Antonio, it is going to cost the taxpayers, and I say cost the defense system, because that is what it is going to come out of--$468 million a year. Over the 5 years, they said that is $2.34 billion.  In further responding to the Senator's question, I would say, you sat there in those committee meetings when we had the service chiefs in there and said, ``Where are we going to come up with the money if we don't carry out the recommendations of the BRAC system?'' We have to come up with several hundred million dollars. Is it going to kill the force stream and quality of life and come out of modernization. ``Where is it going to come from?'' What did they say? They said, ``We don't have anything for it to come out of.''
