 I say to the Senator from Idaho who stood up here and said he did not believe the survivors of the DC sniper shooting had a right to go to court and therefore he was going to oppose the Senator's amendment, I guess that is clearly his point of view, but he said just the opposite. He said he reads this law to allow the victims and their families of the DC sniper to go court against the dealer.  If that is his opinion, then he ought to accept the amendment from the Senator from Maryland because that is all she is asking for.  If you do not believe the victims of the DC sniper should have a day in court against the dealer to determine whether or not he is guilty of wrongdoing, then just say it. But if you believe that these sniper victims and their families should have a day in court, for goodness' sake, accept the amendment of the Senator from Maryland. If you do not, it really tells the story of your bill.  If your bill is going to stop the families and victims of the DC snipers from holding a gun dealer guilty for irresponsible, reckless misconduct, frankly, that is another good reason for us to defeat the bill. Let us stand behind the innocent victims of the DC snipers.  Talk about people who hate guns. I do not hate guns but I hate snipers who shoot children and innocent people on the street and I hate the people who sell them guns irresponsibly. I think they ought to be held accountable. That is all the Senator from Maryland is asking.
