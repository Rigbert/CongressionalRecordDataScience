Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Ronald Szafarczyk on his retirement from his position of Clerk-Treasurer for the town of Griffith, Indiana. Ron has dedicated his life to public service and the interests of the residents of Griffith. For his lifetime of serving the people of Griffith and Northwest Indiana, Ron will be honored at a celebratory reception on Thursday, January 19, 2012, at Andorra Banquets in Schererville, Indiana.  Ron's interest in local politics began in 1967, when he became a precinct committeeman for the town of Griffith. For the past twenty-four years, Ron has served the town of Griffith in numerous elected capacities. In 1987, Ron ran for a position on the town council and was elected as a councilman, serving from 1988 to 1996. Ron was then elected Clerk-Treasurer, and served in this capacity for sixteen years. Ron's passion, devotion, and continuous support to the town of Griffith are remarkable and he is to be commended.  In addition to his impressive career with the town of Griffith, Ron is a member of the Griffith Rotary, the Griffith Chamber of Commerce, and serves on the committee for Griffith's ``Park Full of Art'' event. He is also a member of the Knights of Columbus and Saint Mary Catholic Church, where he serves as a Eucharistic Minister. Mr. Szafarczyk is the most generous of gentlemen.  Ron's dedication to the town of Griffith is noteworthy; however, it is his commitment to his family that is most impressive. Ron and his wonderful wife, Janice, have six beloved children and fourteen grandchildren.  I am proud that Ron Szafarczyk is my friend and I cannot thank him enough for all that he has done for me over the years. I am even more grateful for what he has done for so many for so long; strangers and friends alike.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Ronald Szafarczyk for his outstanding contributions to the town of Griffith and the community of Northwest Indiana, and to wish him well upon his retirement. Ron has given his time and efforts selflessly to the community and his service is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
