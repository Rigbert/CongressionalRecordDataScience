 President, I want to take a moment to thank members of my staff for their hard work on the last two amendments: Tam Somerville, staff director of the Rules Committee; Hunter Bates, general counsel, who works with him; Andrew Siff, Denise Grant, and Nathan Oman who have been deeply involved in the last two amendments. I appreciate the great assistance from Senator Bennett of Utah.  This is a red letter day for the first amendment. The Hollings amendment had only 33 votes in favor of the amendment. As we all know, it takes 67 votes to approve an amendment to the Constitution. There were 67 votes against this amendment to the Constitution. It is clear that the first amendment is secure for another day, and I thank my colleagues who made that possible.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
