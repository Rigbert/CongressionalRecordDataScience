Speaker, according to the GAO and Secretary Rumsfeld, the Pentagon cannot account for $1 trillion, T-trillion, of expenditure and acquisition costs over the last decade, a bookkeeping shambles that makes Arthur Andersen and Enron look somewhat respectable.  So what is the response in this United States House of Representatives, the people's House, in considering this bill for 1 year, $43 billion increase for a budget that will total more than $400 billion? Hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil.  No amendment to question any Pentagon program, no matter how behind schedule, overbudget or unneeded, will be allowed. It is an expensive debate, $833 million a minute, but not extensive in examining the priorities, waste and abuse at the Pentagon.  I hoped to offer a number of amendments for troubled programs, particularly one on the $12 billion Cold War-era artillery system Crusader that Secretary Rumsfeld says is not needed and he wants to kill, but it will not be allowed nor will an amendment on the F-22, the Comanche.  Stifling debate does not constitute national security readiness for this country. I believe it does a disservice to the people in uniform, those who go without necessities while we put on pedestals gold-plated turkeys.
