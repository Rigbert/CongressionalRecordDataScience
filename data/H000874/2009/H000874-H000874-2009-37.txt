Speaker, our Capital City is mourning the death of one of its leading citizens, a man I was proud to call my friend: Abe Pollin. Our thoughts and sympathy are with his wife, Irene, and his sons, Robert and Jim.  Abe Pollin's business skill, his philanthropy, and his civic spirit changed Washington, D.C., for the better; and, indeed, his legacy extends far beyond this city. It is a legacy that will long outlive Abe Pollin himself, but I rise today to honor the man behind it.  Abe was the sun of a Russian immigrant who came to this country speaking no English, and he rose to become one of this city's most successful developers.  He was a boy whose fondest memories were of paying 25 cents to sit in the bleachers at Washington Senators games. And even when he had brought basketball and hockey teams to Washington, he kept his childhood passion for sports.  The same work ethic that sent him to local railroad yards at 4 in the morning to buy supplies for his father's contracting business helped make him a fortune building housing for thousands. For some that would have been enough, but for Abe it was only the beginning.  Like his father, Morris, whose generosity earned him the nickname ``Charity'' in the Washington Jewish community, Abe Pollin has a proud place in the great American and Jewish traditions of philanthropy. There are thousands and thousands who owe him thanks, whether or not they knew him firsthand. They are sons and daughters of 9/11 victims whose education Abe helped pay for, D.C. families who live in affordable housing that Abe built.  Speaking in 1997 of the arena that was the centerpiece of Washington's downtown rebirth, Abe said this:  ``I walk through that building and I get tears in my eyes. I've got everything I've ever done in my life on the line.''  It was his money that paid to build that arena.  ``My advisers think I'm nuts. But I wanted to do something special for my town.''  Indeed, Abe Pollin's life was something special for this town, for sportsnot only in this town but in America, and for his country.                          ____________________
