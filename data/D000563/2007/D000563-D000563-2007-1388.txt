President, I am looking forward to working with the minority leader on the business ahead. We want to pass this continuing resolution and make sure there is no interruption in the services of our Government. We face an extraordinary challenge because much of the work that we are doing now is work that should have been done previously. But in a positive, constructive, and bipartisan fashion, I am confident we can complete it in time and not risk any possibility of shutting down the Government. So I look forward, on behalf of the majority leader on our side, to working closely with the minority and its leader.                          ____________________
