 I want to congratulate him on an extraordinarily insightful presentation that melded his own personal history in government with his thoughts about this massive bill that we will be considering this week, and his feelings about it, which he expressed to his constituents today. On behalf of all of us, I welcome the Senator to the Senate. I would say he just made a great start, and I know he is going to have an incredibly effective career representing the people of Nebraska and America.  I yield the floor.
