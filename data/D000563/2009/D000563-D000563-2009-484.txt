President, it has been 18 days since the Senate Democrats tried to pass a strong unemployment insurance extension only to see the bill blocked by the other side of the aisle. Since that time, over 125,000 Americans trying to find work have lost their unemployment benefits; 125,000 families across America now have the hardest possible question to answer: How are we going to keep food on the table? How are we going to keep a roof over the heads of myself and my family? Unfortunately, we have been unable to move an extension of unemployment benefits on the floor of the Senate.  This is unusual because in times gone by, this was never even controversial. Extending unemployment benefits was expected. If the economy was in recession and jobs were lost, we stepped up, both parties, and said: We can debate a lot of things, but let's understand there are a lot of Americans in very difficult circumstances who need a helping hand. That is not this time. Unfortunately, at this point in time, it has become a politically controversial issue about whether to extend unemployment benefits to people.  I have heard from a lot of people back in Illinois. A week ago in Chicago, I met with a room full of unemployed people and talked with them about their expenses first hand--people who have been out of work for long periods of time and are desperate to find a job.
