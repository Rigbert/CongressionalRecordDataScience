Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule IX, I hereby give notice of my intention to offer a resolution which raises a question of the privileges of the House.  The form of the resolution is as follows:       Whereas on December 6, 1995, the Committee on Standards of      Official Conduct agreed to appoint an outside counsel to      conduct an independent, nonpartisan investigation of      allegations of ethical misconduct by Speaker Newt Gingrich;       Whereas, after an eight-month investigation, that outside      counsel has submitted an extensive document containing the      results of his inquiry;       Whereas the report of the outside counsel cost the      taxpayers $500,000;       Whereas the public has a right--and Members of Congress      have a responsibility--to examine the work of the outside      counsel and reach an independent judgment concerning the      merits of the charges against the Speaker;       Whereas these charges have been before the Ethics Committee      for more than two years;       Whereas a failure of the Committee to release the outside      counsel's report before the adjournment of the 104th Congress      will seriously undermine the credibility of the Ethics      Committee and the integrity of the House of Representatives:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Committee on Standards of Official      Conduct shall immediately release to the public the outside      counsel's report on Speaker Newt Gingrich, including any      conclusions, recommendations, attachments, exhibits or      accompanying material.
