 President, today I wish to pay tribute to an exceptional veteran of the United States Navy who wore the uniform during World War II, First Class Seaman James Francis of Laurel County, KY.  James was born in Monroe County, KY, in 1924. His family lived on a farm where they raised just about everything they ate. The family moved to Indiana in 1937 when James' father got a job working for the railroad. James was drafted into the Navy in 1941, on his 19th birthday.  Although James never entered combat, he was an intricate part of the war effort in the South Pacific. He was stationed on a Merchant Marine ship that delivered ammunition to the soldiers who were on the front lines. After his time aboard ship, James spent 18 months in Hong Kong cutting hair at a G.I. barber shop. He was discharged in May 1946.  Mr. James Francis is most assuredly deserving of commemoration for the sacrifices he made for each one of us and for our great Nation, as well as his years of service to the betterment of his community and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  There was recently a feature article published in the Sentinel Echo: Silver Edition magazine in November 2011, highlighting the upstanding legacy of Mr. James Francis and his commendable dedication to our Nation's Armed Forces.  Mr. President, it is my wish that my colleagues in the United States Senate join me in honoring the loyalty and bravery shown by Kentucky's own James Francis. And I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:                  [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 2011]                             Navy Supplier                            (By Carol Mills)       First Class Seaman James Francis was a Merchant Marine      during World War II.       In time of war, the Merchant Marine is an auxiliary to the      Navy and delivers troops and supplies for the military.       Francis went to Great Lakes Boot Camp in Illinois, near      North Chicago, and gunnery school in Gulf Port, Miss., and      then went to California and caught a ship.       ``We were shipped out,'' Francis said. ``I went to the      Philippines the first trip, came back to the States, and then      went to Australia and the South Pacific for six months     and then came back again. I served on a Merchant Marine ship.      We didn't do any fighting. We took a load of ammunition to      the Philippines, 150 tons, unloaded it, and the Japanese blew      it up that night. We took supplies to other countries, but I      can't remember. It's been 65 years since I got out. I stayed      in Hong Kong, China, cutting hair for 18 months in a G.I.      barber shop before I came home. I didn't have enough points      to get out (Navy).'' Navy training counts for retirement      points, so Francis decided to learn how to cut hair.       Besides ammunition, Francis also delivered airplane fuel to      the Philippines.       Francis was discharged in May 1946. His experience in the      Navy was all good.       ``There was no bad. I won't take nothing for what I seen      went on, but I wouldn't go do it again.''       Francis, 86, was born in Monroe County in 1924 to Herman      and Maye Francis. His father had a farm between Tomkinsville      and Mud Lick.       ``We raised about everything we ate,'' Francis said.       The family moved to Indiana in 1937, where his father got a      job working for the L&N Railroad.       When Francis was 19, he was drafted into the U.S. Navy on      Dec. 2, 1941, on his birthday. Two or three years after he      was discharged, he married Irene Barton when he was 27 or 28.       ``She was a Kentucky woman. I met her in Indiana,'' Francis      said. ``We moved back down here in 1966. She was born and      raised in Corbin. When she died, I married Lola Boggs. I've      been a widower for about two years now. When she (Lola) died,      I moved to Carnaby Square Apartments. I'm too old to get      married again.''                          ____________________
