Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul Hillegonds, an individual who has served the residents of Michigan through the years with great distinction. Throughout his career in public service, Paul tirelessly worked for the betterment of our great State and continues to impact countless individuals through his professional and community affiliations.  Paul served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1996, and was speaker his final two years in elected office. In 1997, Paul embarked on a new path of service, taking the reins as president of Detroit Renaissance, a non-profit, civic organization comprising Southeast Michigan's business leaders.  Paul has received numerous honors throughout his distinguished career, and I am pleased to call him a friend. Paul and I go back a long way--all the way back, in fact, to when he was Administrative Assistant for U.S. Representative Ruppe and I was a staffer for Representative Dave Stockman.  Our friendship has only strengthened over time. His wife and kids are good family friends and we have enjoyed each other both in and out of public service. Paul has always stood for the right things and he has displayed the utmost integrity. Unfortunately term limits cost us his leadership as speaker of the Michigan House, but his leadership for the folks of Michigan continues.  I look forward to many more years of Paul's friendship. We are all better off for Paul's service to the State of Michigan, and I wish him continued success.                          ____________________
