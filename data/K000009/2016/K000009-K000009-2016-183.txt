Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a true public servant and fellow Ohio politician, Ronald Nabakowski. Ron passed away Friday, June 10th after a long struggle with ALS, and will be dearly missed by his family and friends.  At the time of his passing Ron was retired, fully enjoying his time with family and actively promoting the redevelopment of downtown Lorain. He had been a public servant in government for forty-two years.  Prior to his retirement Ron served as Clerk of Court of Common Pleas in Lorain County for fourteen years, after a long career as State Senator, Lorain County Commissioner, and Director of the Ohio Lottery on Governor Dick Celeste's cabinet.  Throughout his long career Ron remained dedicated to making government work better for the people. A Democrat, Ron did not hesitate to reach across the aisle to create comprehensive legislation that could pass the State legislature, and to ensure the community he represented flourished.  One of his proudest moments in public service came while serving as Director of the Ohio Lottery. During his tenure, 17 cents of each state dollar went towards primary and secondary education in Ohio--a record that would remain unrivaled by subsequent Lottery administrations.  An outspoken politician at times, Ron had many admirers and critics. Regardless of party affiliation, there was no denying that Ron was genuine, and that he would certainly act in a fair manner. He was led by Christian values and his love for the Lorain community. These values served him well, establishing Ron as a public servant of the highest order.  Ron is survived by his wife of 55 years, Dorothea, and six of his children, having been preceded in death by a daughter and his parents.  We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of our dear friend, Ron, who will be remembered with affection and gratitude for his probing intellect, kind heart, and utter dedication to advancing Lorain as a community, its people and its institutions.                          ____________________
