President, I rise today to recognize six students at Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School who captured the Environmental Challenge division title at the Odyssey of the Mind's world competition in Knoxville, Tennessee. These Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School students, under the tutelage of their coach, Jeannine Patterson, beat out 54 teams representing other states and countries to win first place.  While this is the third consecutive year in which a Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School team has advanced a team to the world competition, students Ryan Frohock, Lynsey Hart, Manda Paige, Derek Galyen, Chelsey Spurlock, and James Chandler are the first to win the world competition, which consists of a long-term problem and a spontaneous problem.  Mr. President, we often heap praise upon athletes who demonstrate a special ability to throw a ball, catch a pass, or run extremely fast. Intellectual accomplishments, such as the one achieved by these six Georgetown-Ridge Farm students, however, are rarely acknowledged. But capturing a world title in a competition that involves both creativity and intellect clearly merits the highest commendation we can bestow upon these students. It is important that this achievement receive its due recognition, and I congratulate the six students at Georgetown-Ridge High School who won the Environmental Challenge world title at the Odyssey of the Mind's world competition, as well as their teachers, parents, and friends, all of whom played a role in their victory in Knoxville, Tennessee.                          ____________________
