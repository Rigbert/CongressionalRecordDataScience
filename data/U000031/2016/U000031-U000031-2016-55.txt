Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my friend and partner, Mr. Pallone. We moved a majority of these billsthrough the committee on a bipartisan basis. We had those votes here on the floor, a very strong vote as the process moved.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is about treatment. It is about prevention. It is about recovery, helping law enforcement, particularly with our drug courts, and it adds new resources to help communities suffering from this terrible opioid epidemic.  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act represents the most serious and comprehensive effort ever undertaken by this body to tackle the problem. CARA is a bipartisan blend of the best ideas from the House and the Senate. These bills passed with a combined 494 votes in the House and the Senate and, coupled with the great work led just this week by the House Appropriations Committee to add $581 million to help fund and prioritize these programs, it shows that we are tackling the problem head-on.  Now, this is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. That is why, coupled with the appropriators, I think that we will get the job done. As I have said, at the end of the day, the money will be there.  So those on the front lines fighting the opioid epidemic deserve a strong vote in the people's House. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
