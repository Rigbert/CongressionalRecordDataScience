 I would say to him that--and I think he knows and I know--although I don't think either of us is directly involved in the hour-to-hour negotiations that are going on--but, nevertheless, negotiations still go on, Mr. Speaker--I am hopeful that, on both sides, we can see that which is unacceptable to the other side and put that aside for a later day.  The appropriations process, of course, is about funding government. The appropriations process is about keeping government open. The appropriations process is about how do we best serve the American people.  I am hopeful that that will not get mired down or prevent our success in coming to an agreement on the omnibus because of issues on which, clearly, there are significant policy differences and which can be argued on another day and in another bill, but will not undermine the completion of the appropriations process.  I presume the majority leader hopes that as well. Hopefully, over the next few hours and, really, over the next couple of days, we will work on that because, if we don't, we are going to be here on the 17th, the 18th, the 19th, or the 20th, according to what the majority leader said, in order to get our work done.  Is that accurate, Mr. Leader?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding again.  It is our intention to get an omnibus done in a bipartisan manner. Those are the negotiations that are going on now. I'm hopeful that we can get that done and finished by next week.
