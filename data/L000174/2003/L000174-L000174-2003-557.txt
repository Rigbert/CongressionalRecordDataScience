President, I am concerned that we seem to have these divisive nominees. The Republicans are unwilling to bring forward Judge Edward Prado to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I mention this because I have checked every single Democrat who is willing to have an extremely short time agreement and go to a vote on Judge Prado. Apparently, it is not being brought forward because of a hold on the Republican side. I mention this because we hear often from the White House: Why are Democrats holding up these court of appeals judges?  Well, here is one where every Democrat is willing to vote on the President's nomination to the Fifth Circuit. He is a distinguished Hispanic, Judge Edward Prado. We are ready to vote on him. We have cleared it on this side of the aisle. Apparently, it is being held up on the Republican side. So the next time the White House asks why we cannot move forward with some of these people, let's say: Don't look at us; you may want to ask the other side.  It is even interesting that David Broder wrote a column, April 16, on the nomination of Judge Prado to this seat and pointed out that he had come to the hearings to see what kind of divisiveness there was and found a love-in, and he was probably surprised--I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he is probably surprised that it has not been voted on.  I will note that Judge Prado has significant experience. I do not agree with him on everything, by any means, but he was originally appointed, I believe, by President Reagan to the district court. He is a conservative Republican, a Hispanic. Every Democrat is prepared to go forward. I ask whoever is holding him up on the Republican side to release the hold, let this man go forward and let him be elevated to the U.S. Court of Appeals.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
