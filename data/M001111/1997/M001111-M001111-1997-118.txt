 President, I make a point of order that section 1949(a)(2) of this act violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act.  Mr. President, as an appropriator, I object to the language included in this legislation by the Finance Committee that would make permanent a prohibition against Medicaid managed care funds being used for abortion services except in the cases of rape, incest, or where the woman's life is in danger. This is, for all intents and purposes, a permanent extension of the so-called Hyde amendment that has been included in every Labor-HHS and education appropriations bill since 1987. A reconciliation bill is not the proper vehicle for major abortion policy decisions. This is not how Congress has traditionally dealt with such decisions, and this is not how we should begin to deal with such decisions.  I know that some of my colleagues disagree----
