I also serve currently as Chairman of the Board of Visitors at West Point. We have the opportunity to review the admissions process every year.  Frankly, it is a success. The admissions policy at West Point provides an opportunity to broaden, diversify, and make better the institution with some very talented individuals.  Let me put it in perspective. I graduated in 1971. We had two African-Americans in my class. Today, African-Americans make up 8 percent of the student body. Frankly, the military has a larger representation of minorities than that 8 percent, but it represents an officer corps that is both diverse and, let me emphasize, talented. There is no sacrificing standards. There is no sacrificing ability. There is no sacrificing patriotism or anything else. We get wonderful people.  To me, affirmative action is not about quotas. It is about looking beyond just the people who want to show up in the front ranks because they have gone to good high schools, they have parents helping them along, and all the other things that lead them to even apply to West Point. It is about looking beyond that. It has been very successful.  I also suggest that it has been represented by the success of those young men and women in our military forces who are now general officers. The Commandant of Cadets of West Point today is an African-American officer, a graduate of West Point. That would have been exceptional 30 years ago.
