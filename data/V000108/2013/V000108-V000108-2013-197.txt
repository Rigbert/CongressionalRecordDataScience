Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Saints Peter and Paul Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral as its congregation and church leaders join together in celebration of its 50th Anniversary. The congregation, along with Parish Priest, Very Reverend Tome Stamatov, and the Church Executive Board, including President Thomas Traycoff, Vice President Alex Kutanovski, Vice President Dejan Ristevski, Treasurer Naumce Pejoski, Financial Secretary Stojan Trajkovski, Secretary Dimce Alekovski, and Diocese Delegate Nick Nochevich, will be celebrating with a weekend of events from July 12 to July 14, 2013 at the cathedral in Crown Point, Indiana.   Saints Peter and Paul Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral was consecrated on July 14, 1963 in Gary, Indiana, when a group of immigrants from Macedonia came together with the goal of preserving Macedonian culture and religious tradition. Saints Peter and Paul is known throughout the United States and Canada as the first official Macedonian church built in North America. The founders proclaimed the mission of their new church before the Indiana Secretary of State in Indianapolis, Indiana: ``The purpose of this parish is to preach the word of God and take spiritual care of its members; to spread goodness, justice, brotherly love, and respect among its members.''   The cathedral in Gary flourished for many years, and the congregation continued to grow. Due to an increase in membership, a new cathedral and cultural center were built in Crown Point, Indiana, in 1989, and are still in existence today. The members and leaders of Saints Peter and Paul Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral played a major role in the establishment of additional churches throughout the United States and in Canada. Their determination, focus, and commitment laid the foundation for other Macedonian churches to come to life.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Saints Peter and Paul Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral on its 50th Anniversary. Throughout many hardships and trials, the congregation and leaders of Saints Peter and Paul have dedicated themselves to preserving Macedonian heritage, tradition, and spiritual beliefs. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
