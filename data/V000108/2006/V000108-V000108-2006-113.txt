Speaker, the community of classical vocal music artists and listeners suffered a great loss on April 20, 2006, when a light plane carrying five outstanding graduate students from Indiana University's Bloomington campus School of Music crashed just short of its destination. We join those grieving the loss of these talented musicians--Chris Carducci of Monroe, MI; Garth Eppley of Wabash, IN; Georgina Joshi of South Bend, IN; Zachary Novak of Anderson, IN; and Robert Samels of Medina, OH--for their accomplishments, for the great promise they held, and for the people they were. We will remember them today:  Chris Carducci--born April 18, 1978, in Monroe, MI, a graduate of Monroe High School, he received a bachelor of arts degree in music education in 2002 from Bowling Green State University--BGSU, Bowling Green, OH. He earned a master's degree in music from Indiana University, Bloomington, in 2005. He was a life member of St. John Catholic Church, where he was baptized, confirmed, and educated at its school. He was a former member and past president of the BGSU Men's Chorus. His opera career included an appearance at Carnegie Hall, where he sang selections from Wolf's Italienisches Liederbuch for the Marilyn Horne Foundation's ``The Song Continues . . . 2005.'' A baritone, Mr. Carducci performed with Toledo Opera, Michigan Opera Works, BGSU Opera Theater and IU Opera Theater. In 2005, he created the role of Pontius Pilate in ``Pilatus,'' a new opera by Robert Samels. Last year, he was recognized by the Metropolitan Opera National Council's Indiana District with an Encouragement Award. He also was a two-time winner of the Conrad-Peatee Art Song Competition.

During his years at Indiana University he studied underthe direction of Dr. William Gray, professor of chorale conducting, who was instrumental in Zach's participation in the Lafayette & Carmel Bach Chorale. The Jacobs School of Music at IU continued to foster and enrich his gift of music. Numerous teachers, professors, and ministers had a positive influence on Zach throughout his life. While in Bloomington, Zach was the worship coordinator at First United Methodist Church where he directed the Wesley Choir and Children's Choir. During his time in Anderson, he was the choir director at Bethel United Methodist and choir director and organist at St. Ambrose Catholic Church, where he was a member.
