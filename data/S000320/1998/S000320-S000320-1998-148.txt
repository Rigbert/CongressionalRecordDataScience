 President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the passage of S. 1668, the Disclosure to Congress Act of 1998.  This legislation directs the President to inform employees of the intelligence community that they may disclose information, including classified information, to an appropriate oversight committee of Congress when that information is evidence of misconduct, fraud, or gross mismanagement.  The committee is hopeful that this legislation will also encourage employees within the intelligence community to bring such information to an appropriate committee of Congress rather than unlawfully disclosing such information to the media, as happens from time to time.  It is imperative that individuals with sensitive or classified information about misconduct within the executive branch have a ``safe harbor'' for disclosure where they know the information will be properly safeguarded and thoroughly investigated.  Further, employees within the intelligence community must know that they may seek shelter in that ``safe harbor'' without fear of retribution.  It is not generally known that the Whistle Blower Protection Act does not cover employees of the agencies within the intelligence community.  The whistle blower statute also expressly proscribes the disclosure of information that is specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.  In other words, classified information is not covered by the current whistle blower statute.  Therefore, employees within the intelligence community are not protected from adverse personnel actions if they choose to disclose such information to Congress.  In fact, an employee who discloses classified information to Congress without prior approval is specifically subject to sanctions which may include reprimand, termination of a security clearance, suspension without pay, or removal.  Last year, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 which included section 306, a provision with language similar to the bill before you.  Section 306, however, was much broader than the language in this bill because it directed the President to inform all executive branch employees that it would not be contrary to law, regulation, executive order, or public policy to disclose certain information, including classified information, to an appropriate committee or their own Member of Congress.  The Senate passed that bill by a vote of 98 to 1.  Shortly after the Senate vote, the administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy claiming that section 306 was unconstitutional and that if it remained in the bill, in its present form, senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.  Last year, in conference, members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also expressed concern over the constitutional implications of section 306.  Our House colleagues were also mindful of the administration's veto threat as expressed in the Statement of Administration Policy.  In response to their concerns, the Senate offered an amendment that significantly narrowed the scope of the provision to cover only employees of agencies within the intelligence community, as does this bill.  The amendment offered in conference further narrowed the provision by allowing disclosure only to committees with primary jurisdiction over the agency involved.  In deference to our colleagues' concerns, however, our committee agreed to amend the provision to express a sense of the Congress that the Congress and executive branch have equal standing to receive this type of information.  In conference, members of both committees committed to hold hearings in the second session of the 105th Congress with the intent to fully examine the constitutional implications to such legislation and to pursue appropriate legislative remedy.  Our committee fulfilled our obligation by holding hearings on February 4 and 11.  The committee heard from constitutional scholars and legal experts on both sides of the issue.  An administration representative argued that section 306 and any similar language represents an unconstitutional infringement on the President's authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.  The administration asserted the following:       The President as Commander in Chief, Chief Executive, and      sole organ of the Nation in its external relations has      ultimate and unimpeded authority over the collection,      retention, and dissemination of intelligence and other      national security information.       Therefore, any congressional enactment that may be      interpreted to divest the President of his ultimate control      over national security information is an unconstitutional      usurpation of the exclusive authority of the Executive.       Finally, the Administration argues that the Senate's      language vests lower-ranking personnel in the Executive      Branch with a ``right'' to furnish such information to a      Member of Congress without prior official authorization from      the President or his designee. Section 306 and any similar      provision is, therefore, unconstitutional.  The committee also heard from constitutional scholars that argued that the President's authority in this area is not exclusive.  Hence, Congress also has the authority to regulate the collection, retention, and dissemination of national security information.  Their argument was as follows:       A claim of exclusive authority must be substantiated by an      explicit textual grant of such authority by the Constitution.       There is no express constitutional language regarding the      regulation of national security information as it pertains to      the President.       Therefore, the President's authority to regulate national      security information is an implied authority flowing from his      responsibilities as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.       As the regulation of national security information is      implicit in the command authority of the President, if is      equally implicit in the broad array of national security      authorities vested in the Congress by the Constitution. In      fact, Congress has legislated extensively over a long period      of time to require the President to provide such information      to Congress.       Therefore, Congress may legislate in this area because the      Executive and Legislative Branches share constitutional      authority to regulate national security information.       This legislation is also constitutional because it does not      prevent the President from accomplishing his constitutionally      assigned functions and any intrusion upon his authority is      justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within      the constitutional authority of Congress.  The committee found the latter argument to be persuasive and determined that the Administration's intransigence on this issue compelled the committee to act.  The bill before you is a modified version of section 306, but still directs the President to inform employees and contractors of the covered agencies that it is not prohibited by law, executive order, or regulation to disclose to the appropriate committee, information that the employee reasonably believes to provide direct and specific evidence of, one, a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; two, a false statement to Congress on an issue of material fact; three, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, a flagrant abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  This bill is intended to ensure that members receive information only in their capacity as a member of the committee concerned.  The committee fully appreciates the need to protect national security information, particularly information that might reveal sensitive intelligence sources and methods.  Therefore, it is critical that classified information received by a member of one of the appropriate committees be protected in accordance with that particular committee's rules.  The Intelligence Committee, for example, must follow a very strict procedure before any classified information could be disclosed to the public.  Accordingly, a member is not free to accept classified information as a member of a committee unrestrained by such rules or to withhold knowledge of the information from the committee's leadership.  When individual Members are entrusted with classified information, they may not pick and choose what role they wish to play in an attempt to circumvent their responsibility to safeguard our nation's secrets. We cannot disregard our obligations, under Senate rules, in order to serve our own political interests.  If a Senator is not a member of one of the applicable committees and is approached by an employee from the intelligence community, it is the hope of the Intelligence Committee that the member would direct the employee to the appropriate committee so that the employee would enjoy the full protection of this legislation.  The various national security committees enjoy a long history of trust with the executive branch and this bill is intended to prevent a member or members from inadvertently or intentionally spoiling that record.  This bill further directs the President to inform such employees that members of the appropriate committees have a ``need to know'' and are authorized to receive such information.  This language is consistent with the argument propounded by the administration in a brief that it filed in the Supreme Court in 1989, namely that       . . . the president has uniformly limited access to      classified information to persons who have a need to know the      particular information, such as a congressional committee      having specific jurisdiction over the subject matter.  There is no question that the appropriate committees need this type of information to effectively perform their oversight responsibilities and the administration seems to agree that these committees have a ``need to know.'' Our only disagreement is over the means by which this type of information is brought to the attention of Congress.  In accordance with Executive Order No. 12,958, classified information must remain under the control of the originating agency and it may not be disseminated without proper authorization.  Consequently, an executive branch employee may not disclose classified information to Congress without prior approval. In fact, employees are advised that the agency will provide ``access as is necessary for Congress to perform its legislative functions. . . .''  In other words, an executive agency will decide what Members of Congress may need to know to perform their constitutional oversight functions.  We believe that Members of Congress are best positioned to decide what they need to know.  If an employee must secure prior authorization before they can bring evidence of wrongdoing to an appropriate committee, we may never get the opportunity to make that assessment.  Therefore, this legislation is critical if we are to effectively discharge our constitutional obligations.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as they did last year and send a clear message to the President that the United States Congress will not be subject to the whims of a Chief Executive that may wish to withhold evidence of wrongdoing in the name of national security.  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I send to the desk a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 1668, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1668 A Bill to Encourage the Disclosure to Congress of Certain Classified and Related Information--As Reported by the Senate Select Committee on                    Intelligence on February 23, 1998       The bill would require the President to inform certain      federal employees and contract employees that they may      disclose classified and unclassified information to      Congressional oversight committees if they believe the      information provides direct and specific evidence of      wrongdoing. CBO estimates that the costs of implementing S.      1668 would not be significant because the number of employees      covered by the bill would be small and the cost associated      with each notice would be minimal. Because the legislation      would not affect direct spending or receipts, pay-as-you-go      procedures would not apply.       The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of      1995, and would not affect the budget of state, local, or      tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Dawn Sauter, who      can be reached at 226-2840. This estimate was approved by      Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget      Analysis.
