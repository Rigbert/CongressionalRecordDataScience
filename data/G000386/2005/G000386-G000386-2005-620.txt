 President, I hope I can say the Senate is going to pass S. 1307. I think we will do that. I am going to work the floor to make sure that happens. We have had an awful lot of support expressed for the bill today, and so I look forward to an announcement of a majority vote.  I think history will record this important legislation as a positive step in the development of democracy and prosperity in the CAFTA countries that has developed over the last 20 years, greatly expanding that. I am also confident that our leadership in passing CAFTA will be rewarded through benefits our Nation enjoys under this trade agreement, and more importantly, in the broader picture, advancing our overall trade agenda, particularly with the Doha round of negotiations going on throughout the course of 2005.  I also want to take a moment to compliment Senator Coleman of Minnesota. Senator Coleman has worked hard to create export opportunities for his farmers and manufacturers while looking after the interests of his sugar farmers, who Senator Coleman clearly cares deeply about.  Senator Coleman worked to get his sugar farmers disaster assistance a couple years ago when they were originally ineligible. And now, Senator Coleman has secured a commitment from this administration that the sugar import cap established in the farm bill will not be substantively violated as long as this farm bill is in place.  I want to compliment him on his commitment and dedication to his constituents. I appreciate his efforts tofind a long-term solution to this complex issue.  I am ready to yield back the balance of time and proceed to a vote.
