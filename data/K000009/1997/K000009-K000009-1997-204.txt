Chairman, I say to the Members, if they have not read H.R. 400, I say vote ``no.'' No one will have been able to read it because it has been changed so much, there is no final bill for Members to review.  Support the substitute. Remember, the United States leads the world in intellectual property breakthroughs by 10 times. Why change a system that is working, for a bill which Members have no final copy of to review? Why support a bill that takes away the guaranty of secrecy our patent applicants receive until their patent is granted? Why do that to them?  Why support H.R. 400, when it puts a greater burden of proof on our inventors to defend themselves, forcing them to sue, forcing them to greater re-examination procedures? Why do this to them?  Why support a bill that undermines the objectivity of our patent examiners, and changes our Patent Office?  This is a battle that goes to the heart of the constitutional rights of our citizens to invent opportunity in the 21st century. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 400. Support the substitute.
