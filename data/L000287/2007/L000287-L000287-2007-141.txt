Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood, the man from Georgia, not just a citizen of Georgia, not just a citizen of the American South, but a citizen of the world, a man who fought the good fight, who kept the faith. He was a good and decent man, and we will never ever forget his lasting contribution.  We pray for his family, for the people of his congressional district, and we pray for his soul.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
