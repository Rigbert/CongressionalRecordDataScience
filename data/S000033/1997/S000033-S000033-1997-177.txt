 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, let me offer a suggestion as to what I think underlies this. Mr. Chairman, I think that some of our friends over here on this side know that the American people, many American people are very angry and they are very frustrated. The reason is that, despite what we read in the newspapers every day about our, quote unquote, booming economy, what our Republicans friends know, some of our Democratic friends know, is that the ordinary American is working longer hours for lower wages. What our Republican friends know is that most of the new jobs that are being created are low-wage jobs, they are often part-time jobs, they are temporary jobs.  So the average American today is frustrated and is angry, because his or her standard of living is in decline. They look around and they say, well, why am I in worse shape than I was 10 years ago? Why are my kids in worse shape than was the case in the previous generation? And instead of having the courage to look at the real causes of our problems, trying to understand that our jobs now are going to China and to Mexico, trying to deal with the fact that, while the richest people in America have never had it so good, the standard of living of working people is in decline, trying to understand that the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation for 4 years, trying to really address the frustrations and the angers of the middle class when our Republican friends are saying, we know why they are hurting, and they are hurting because all of their money is going to those poor people.  They are the ones who are taking the tax dollars. They forget to talk about the $125 billion a year that goes in corporate welfare, tax breaks and subsidies for the largest multinational corporations in the country, many of which are taking our jobs to China and Mexico. We do not talk about that. They do not talk about a housing policy through the home interest mortgage reduction program which allows billionaires to get checks from the Government when they deduct the interest on their mortgage from their mansions.  We do not talk about that. But what we say, it is the poor people. And then if we are going to target the poor people, we have to figure out a way to humiliate them.  So what we say is: If you are poor and you live in a housing project, you must work. Now, how do we have a volunteer program when we force somebody to work? I have never heard about that. Now, some people say well, we want to help these poor people. What about creating jobs that actually pay something? Are my colleagues going to work with me for having public works programs and get those people out so they can earn a paycheck? I have not heard that.  What my colleagues are saying is: We want you to work, but we are not going to pay you. We are going to give tremendous power and authority to your supervisor, the administrator at the public housing authority, to tell you what you are going to be volunteering to do.                              {time}  1615  I would suggest that what this entire process is really about is scapegoating; is having the middle class and the working people think that their problems are because of the poor, rather than looking at what the wealthy and the powerful are doing.  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest, somebody here before said about upper-income people, you have upper-income people who are getting checks who do not work. We have not heard any suggestion that maybe those people might want to be forced to volunteer in order to get their checks from the government.  I would suggest that this entire policy is one of an effort to humiliate poor people; to get the middle class in opposition to poor people, rather than to really look at what the causes of our problems are.
