(8) Naturalization rewards legal immigrants who have abided      by all Federal laws and Department of Homeland Security      regulations.       (9) Naturalization bestows all the legal rights,      privileges, and responsibilities of a United States citizen.     SEC. 3. INDEPENDENCE DAY CEREMONIES FOR OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE.
