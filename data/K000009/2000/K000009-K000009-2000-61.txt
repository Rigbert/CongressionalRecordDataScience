KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wish to use this moment with all of our colleagues to extend deepest appreciation to our fine chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), for his leadership and great victory on this bill. It has been a joy to work with him, and I know that under the rules of the House because of rotation, he may not be able to serve in this capacity in the next year, although I hope we can change those rules. But I want to say he has been a true gentleman, a real scholar, someone who understands farming and ranching from the get-go. He truly is an advocate for our farmers and ranchers and a real friend to every single Member of this House. It has been a joy to work with him on this bill in this first year of the new century.
