I have known Nick for many years, and he is one of the most passionate and involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to serving his country and to serving the young men and women of the First Congressional District. Since the mid-1970's, Nick has served the youth of the First Congressional District. Since 1985, he has done so as a member of my Military Academy Board. During this time, Nick has been a constant source of knowledge and insight for students interested in attending the Merchant Marine Academy and all other military academies. Recently, Nick informed me that he will be leaving northwest Indiana and relocating to Texas.  Nick Andryuk was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Following his graduation from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1974, where he studied structural design, Nick chose to attend the United States Merchant Marine Academy, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in marine engineering with a minor in nuclear engineering. Upon his graduation, Nick was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserves, specializing in surface warfare. Always seeking to broaden his horizons, Nick would continue his educational and occupational pursuits over the years to amass an impressive resume, which includes a master's degree in business administration from Indiana University Northwest and a Professional Engineering License from the State of Indiana.  During his time in the Naval Reserves, Nick held various positions, including: administration officer, training officer, executive officer, and eight additional commanding officer positions. In 1985, Nick was named an engineering duty officer, and finally, in 1995, he was promoted to the esteemed rank of captain. While serving in his capacity as a captain, a position he held until his retirement from the Navy Reserves in June 2004, Nick also served as an explosive safety chief inspector.  While he has served his country and community in various capacities throughout his lifetime, Nick came to be known for not only his wisdom and his willingness to serve others, but also for his strong work ethic, a trait he undoubtedly developed during his career at Inland Steel, later Ispat Inland Steel. For over 26 years, Nick served in capacities ranging from assistant engineer to section manager. Following his retirement from Ispat Inland Steel in 2001, he went on to work as a project manager and engineering consultant with Superior Engineering from 2001 to 2007. In September 2007, Nick accepted a position as vice-president of operations with Zimmerman and Jansen, a company located in Humble, Texas. While he will surely be missed in northwest Indiana, his efforts and the impact he has had on the lives of many students in the First Congressional District are to be admired. I am sure Nick will continue to share his vast knowledge with prospective academy students in his new location, and I wish him well on his endeavors.  Madam Speaker, Captain Nick Andryuk is a friend who has selflessly given his time and efforts to the young men and women of the First Congressional District, and he has served his country with the utmost eagerness and dedication as a member of the Armed Forces. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication, and I ask that you join me in wishing him the best of success, health, and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
