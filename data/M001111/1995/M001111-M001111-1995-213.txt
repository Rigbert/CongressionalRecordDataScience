 President, I want to join the President, my House and Senate colleagues, and the American people in expressing my deep relief at the safe return of Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady, who was shot down over Bosnia 6 days ago while on a NATO mission.  It is a tribute to Captain O'Grady and the Air Force that trained him that he was able to survive for so long under such difficult circumstances. And certainly we must all loudly applaud the brave marines who put their own lives on the line and rescued him under the most treacherous circumstances, braving both missile and small-arms fire during their 5-hour rescue mission, to pull one of their own to safety.  Captain O'Grady's family has no doubt had a week of anguish and hope, and I celebrate with them this wonderful news and the remarkable strength and courage of Captain O'Grady and the marines who come to his rescue.  Scott O'Grady, who is from Spokane, WA, is an inspiration to citizens across my State and this nation, and I am proud to join the many many voices today that are celebrating his safe return.                          ____________________
