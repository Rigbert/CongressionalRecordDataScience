President, from the home office in Beebe Plain, VT, I bring you the top 10 giveaways in the Republican budget bill.  10. ``What's white and black all over? A polar bear in an Arctic oil field.'' The bill opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.  9. ``You don't go to jail for this?'' The bill would permit companies to withdraw excess assets from their pension plans.  8. ``One more write-off for the road.'' The bill would allow convenience stores with a gas pump to depreciate their property over 15 years instead of the less generous 39-year period available for other convenience stores.  7. ``And you thought baseball owners were greedy.'' The bill would allow the American College Football Coaches Association to avoid tax penalties and stop an IRS challenge of its pension plan.  6. ``The oil is on the House.'' The bill eliminates the 12.5-percent royalty oil companies used to pay to drill for deep-water oil.  5. ``You can keep the gems--but we're charging you for the dirt.'' In exchange for taking $2 to $3 billion of minerals each year from public lands, mining corporations return a measly $18 million to taxpayers under this bill.  4. ``This should keep' em down on the farm.'' The bill would lift the current $75,000 cap on profits per farmer under Department of Agriculture marketing loan programs so the sky is the limit for wealthy farmers.  3. ``Oh, I thought nurses came with the nursing home.'' The bill repeals national requirements for nursing homes to provide proper health standards--a loophole that will be seized by some to lower the quality of care and life for grandparents and parents.  2. ``Say Aaaah.'' The bill repeals patient protection against excessive doctors' bills, allowing doctors to go after seniors for charges not reimbursed by Medicare.  1. ``Rich guys finish first.'' The bill would give the top one percent of wealthy Americans an average tax break of $5,600 per year while raising taxes on 51 percent of American families --those who earn less than $30,000 a year.                          ____________________
