I sponsored a Senate Resolution that called on the Administration to release its long overdue Mercury Study Report to Congress, a report that was mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1915, the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998'' which, if enacted, would significantly reduce the risks that this powerful neurotoxin poses to the neurological health and development of pregnant women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and children. Senators Snowe, Wellstone and Moynihan have joined me in co-sponsoring the legislation.  The Mercury Study Report to Congress states that 150 tons of mercury are released to the environment every year, year after year. The Study reports that more than one-third of the mercury that is released in the United States each year--52 tons--comes from coal-fired power plants. Mercury is contained in the coal. When coal is burned the mercury is vaporized and is released to the environment.  Once released to the environment, mercury does not behave like many pollutants. It does not biodegrade, it persists. Mercury does not become less toxic--it transforms chemically into even stronger and more toxic forms such as methyl mercury. Methyl mercury accumulates in fish, and it accumulates in the human beings that eat the fish. Once ingested, methyl mercury is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. It easily penetrates the blood-brain and placental barriers, and it stays in the bodyfor very long periods of time. One of the ways that it is finally excreted from the body is through breast milk. A developing fetal brain and nervous system can be exposed to mercury because the placenta and the blood-brain barriers offer no protection, and once born, the exposure can continue through breast milk.  There is ample evidence that mercury levels in the environment are increasing. One of the most telling indicators is the trend in mercury fishing advisories. In 1993, 27 states had issued health advisories warning the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish. In 1997, this had grown to 39 states. We are going in the wrong direction. Before we know it we are going to have filled the whole map with these warnings. It is time to reverse this trend.  While the EPA report does the best job so far in quantifying mercury emissions, many believe that the report understates the actual amount of mercury being released to the environment. Toward the end of obtaining better data on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, EPA has issued notice of its intent to begin collecting information from these facilities on the mercury that they emit. I think that this is an excellent step for EPA to be taking, and I strongly urge the Office of Management and Budget to support this information collection request. It is very much in keeping with the public's ``right to know'' about the types and amounts of toxic pollutants that are being released, and I strongly urge EPA to disseminate the information widely, including making it available via the Internet.  Madam President, I would like to state my serious concern about mercury-related report language in the House of Representatives VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill. Among other things, the report language would require that another mercury report be developed. Each of the mercury-related tasks stipulated in the report language would need to be completed before EPA would be allowed to make any regulatory determinations on mercury.  This report language purely and simply delays efforts to control mercury emissions at the expense of those who are most susceptible to the effects of mercury pollution--pregnant women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and young children.  To put this delay into perspective, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required EPA to study mercury emissions and to report to Congress. EPA completed the report in 1994 and, largely due to highly effective pressure exerted by the coal-fired power industry, the Agency sat on the report for 2 years. It was finally released last December after much effort by this Senator and a number of my colleagues. It is an excellent report, and the years that it spent on the shelf gathering dust did not alter its message. In the meantime, hundreds of tons of toxic mercury emissions continued to rain down unabated on our lands, rivers, and lakes.  The mercury report does not need to be redone. I do not believe that anyone who actually reads it objectively would conclude that we need to study mercury all over again before Congress or the Executive Branch can make any decisions about controlling mercury emissions. But that is precisely what the House report language would require. If the past is any indicator of how long it will take to accomplish what is contemplated by the report language, we will be at least halfway through the first decade of the next century and buried under more than a thousand more tons of mercury before the United States can take even the most minuscule action to control this toxic pollutant. This report language is an inappropriate use of the appropriations process. Such matters of substance and impact on the health and welfare of the citizens of the United States should be debated on the floor of the Senate and House of Representatives.
