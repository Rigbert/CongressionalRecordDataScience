 I want to inform him that the Department of Energy has said it does not have plans to purchase additional heavy water from Iran. So I think this amendment is really irrelevant.  Frankly, I would rather that the United States take whatever Iran has rather than letting them sell it to Russia or somebody else. But the Department of Energy has clearly said they don't have plans to purchase additional heavy water from Iran.  And so the gentleman's amendment is unnecessary, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.  I just urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment. It has been in law before. We have passed it out of this House 2 years in a row. We should do it again.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).  The amendment was agreed to.                              {time}  2030                 Amendment No. 39 Offered by Mr. Norman  The Acting CHAIR.
