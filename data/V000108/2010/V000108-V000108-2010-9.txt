 The Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana is a local branch of the larger Jewish Federations of North America. The Jewish Federations of North America has directed its humanitarian efforts toward improving the social conditions of Jews and non-Jews throughout the world since 1940. Currently, this organization serves 155 communities across North America. The Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana, in conjunction with its national and international partners, puts forth significant support toward rescue, relief, and development programs that serve Jewish communities in need in over 60 countries, including Israel, the former Soviet Union, Latin America, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.  The Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana's long tradition of community service and involvement in the life of Northwest Indiana is to be commended. This organization continues to support many local organizations through its endowment program and is committed to charity work, helping many in need. The charity programs operated by the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana, for which many members have been honored, include the Food Pantry Drive, Shelter Needs, the Holiday Gift Drive, the Adult Friendship Program, the School Backpack Drive, the Senior Retreat, the High School Prom Dress Drive, the JCY Camp, Movie Night, and K'Ton Ton, its pre-school program. The people of Northwest Indiana certainly have been rewarded by the service and uncompromising loyalty displayed by the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana and its members. I congratulate the community service award winners, as they are worthy of the highest praise.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana for its exceptional service and dedication to not only the Northwest Indiana community, but communities worldwide. The members of this truly outstanding organization continue to touch the lives of countless people, and for their unselfish, lifelong commitment, they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
