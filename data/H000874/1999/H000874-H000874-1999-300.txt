Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the attention of the House the following article about the Government Printing Office from the December 1998 issue of In-Plant Graphics which describes the GPO as ``Better Than Ever.'' As a case in point, the article describes GPO's first-rate production and dissemination of the six-volume, 8,327-page Starr Report from last September, a mammoth production job for which the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (Mr. Hyde) has thoughtfully commended the agency.  The article correctly notes that GPO receives little national attention. The fact is, we in Congress could not perform our legislative duties without the timely, professional, non-partisan support of the GPO. Nor could millions of our constituents enjoy an easy, no-cost path to over 140,000 government publications without GPO Access [http://www.access.gpo.gov], an electronic gateway to more than 70 federal databases.  Mr. Speaker, as we conduct the people's business, let's remember that we could not do so without the support of many others, including the dedicated professionals of the Government Printing Office. The article follows:                            Better Than Ever                           (By Bob Neubauer)                       GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Annual sales..............................  $195.9 millionOperating budget..........................  $187.4 millionFull-time production employees............  1,264Total GPO full-time employees.............  3,375Jobs printed per year.....................  163,200Annual impressions........................  4.7 billion------------------------------------------------------------------------       Even though it's the largest in-plant in the country and      produces scores of important government documents, the      Government Printing Office (GPO) doesn't usually get a lot of      national attention.       That all changed in September when the Starr Report was      unleashed on the world. GPO was given the arduous task of      disseminating that report to an eager public. The initial      report arrived on disk, but supplemental materials consisted      of boxes of documents, which had to be shot as camera-ready      copy. The resulting products were put on the Internet, on CD-     ROMs and on paper--all under the watchful eyes of armed      police officers.       ``We took the extra step--just to assure Congress that we      were treating this with the utmost security--of posting      police officers throughout the plant at key production      points,'' explains Andrew M. Sherman, director of the Office      of Congressional, Legislative and Public Affairs. Had there      been no guards, though, Sherman is confident that GPO      employees would have maintained their usual extreme      sensitivity to security issues.       ``We have never had a record of leaks,'' Sherman maintains.      The guards, though, seemed to have their hands full just      keeping the mob of reporters at bay, he adds despite the      distractions, GPO employees kept their minds on their work,      Sherman says--though he admits, ``there was a great deal of      anxiety on everybody's part.''       This situation was far from normal at GPO's Washington      headquarters, where the daily production of the Federal      Register and the Congressional Record are usually the top      jobs. Taking up three buildings and almost 35 acres of floor      space, GPO is larger than most commercial printers. Under the      direction of Public Printer Michael DiMario, a presidential      appointee, GPO generates $800 million a year, $100 million of      which involves document dissemination.       Created in 1860, GPO handles congressional and executive      branch printing and is in charge of distributing federal      documents to the public. As large as GPO's printing operation      is, though, it procures about 75 percent of its work from the      private sector, and produces only the complex, time- and      security-critical work.       Though certain forces in the government still grumble that      GPO should be shut down, some jobs just can't be printed by      the private sector, Sherman insists. A prime example is the      Record. Its average size exceeds 200 pages--about the size of      four to six metropolitan daily papers--but its page count has      fluctuated from a low of 10 to a record of 1,912 pages.      Material arrives in many different forms, including      handwritten notes, and Congress sometimes stays in session      until late at night. Despite all that GPO is still mandated      to get 9,000 copies of the Record printed and delivered to      Congress by 9 a.m. every day.       Another example is the recent Omnibus Appropriations      Spending Bill. A 16-inch tall stack of documents arrived at      GPO and it had to be keyed in, proofread very carefully and      output in the Congressional Record in just two days. The      final congressional report, completed later, was 1,600 pages      long.       In producing independent counsel Starr's report, GPO showed      the same trademark speed and efficiency, despite the      distractions provided by the guards and the reporters. The      Report was up on GPO's Web site (www.access.gpo.gov) within a      half-hour of receiving a CD-ROM containing HTML files from      the House of Representatives. By the evening of that same      day, GPO had produced 500 loose-leaf copies for House members      using DocuTechs at GPO, in the Senate and in the House. By      the next morning, 13,000 additional copies had been printed      on GPO's smaller 32-page 2538" Hantscho webs and bound for      distribution.       ``Everybody was just at their top performance here in      getting it done.'' Sherman praises.       The overwhelming response to the GPO's Web site publication      of the Starr Report was a landmark event in that it was one      of the first times that such a newsworthy document was      available on the Internet before it was printed. Even so,      this was really just another example of how GPO has been      changing to accommodate the latest technologies.       ``There's a great public expectation for quick electronic      access to government information and for it to be free, and      we have accommodated that with our Web site,'' Sherman      remarks. He says 15 million documents are downloaded from      GPO's site each month. The band-width of the site is      currently being expanded, he says.       Fiber-optics and lasers are playing increasingly large      roles for GPO. Up to half of the Senate portion of the Record      is transmitted to GPO from Capitol Hill via fiber-optic      connections, and 80 percent of the Register is transmitted by      laser beam from the Office of the Federal Register.       GPO recently took another bold step forward in technology      when it purchased two new Krause America LX170 computer-to-     plate systems. They will make plates for GPO's three 64-page,      two-color, 3550'' Hantscho web presses, which are used to      print the Record, the Register, the U.S. Budget and other      documents.       Though the Starr Report may have made life difficult at      GPO, it also brought GPO a lot of praise and recognition.      Papers like the Wall Street Journal, the Hartford Courant and      the Baltimore Sun published articles lauding GPO. House      Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde even sent a letter of      praise.       ``People were very impressed with our ability to get this      done,'' says Sherman.                          ____________________
