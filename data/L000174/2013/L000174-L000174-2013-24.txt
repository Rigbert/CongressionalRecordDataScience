President, it is a great pleasure to tell the Senate about Mr. Robert Rossi, a Vermonter who captures the distilled essence of Vermont, and who will be celebrating his 100th birthday this Friday, November 22, 2013. Mr. Rossi represents an inextricable link between where my State, and our country, was, and what it has become, over this most remarkable century. Mr. Rossi was born and has always lived in Barre, VT, the same city where my father was born. Even while defending America in Normandy, or honeymooning with his wife in New York City, his home and his heart were always in Barre.  Mr. Rossi grew up in Barre and his father, like my maternal grandparent, immigrated to the United States and Vermont from Italy. He was a product of the Barre school system, and had a football scholarship to Green Mountain Junior College. Shortly after that he was called for service by the United States Army.  He arrived at Camp Edwards on Cape Cod the same day Pearl Harbor was attacked, and he then was stationed in Northern Ireland just before his departure to Normandy on that fateful day in the summer of 1944. When he returned stateside, he did not dwell on his experiences abroad, but rather returned to his beloved home, where he was instrumental in one of Vermont's leading industries for nearly four decades of his life: the Barre granite and stone carving industry. It has been estimated that one-third of all public and private monuments in the United States were crafted from or by Barre's quarries and its international association of sculptors and artisans. Mr. Rossi is a man of true character, and it is my pleasure to call the Senate's attention to this notable citizen of the Green Mountain State.  I join all Vermonters in offering my sincerest congratulations to Robert Rossi for his genuine lifetime of achievement. I would also like to share a recent article from the Rutland Herald and Times Argus that told his remarkable story and captured many accolades about his illustrious life.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 18, 2013]          Robert Rossi, at 100, Has Always Known Where Home Is                           (By David Delcore)       Robert Rossi remembers Barre.       Sure the Granite City native, who is now days away from his      100th birthday, will tell you he spent two years at Green      Mountain Junior College in Poultney, 20 winters in Tucson, a      honeymoon in New York City, and a memorable World War II tour      that was highlighted by his mercifully belated arrival at      Omaha Beach during the Normandy Invasion. But, if you ask      Rossi where he has ``lived'' for the last 99 years, 360-plus      days, you'd better be ready for a one-word reply.       ``Barre,'' he said Sunday as if surprised by the question.      ``I've never lived anywhere else.''       Born on High Holburn Street, Rossi is the son of an      immigrant stonecutter who he'll proudly tell you was `` the      first alderman of Italian descent ever elected in Barre.''      He'll also tell you that his dad, Antonio Rossi, was      influential in acquiring Barre's first fire engine.       Why?       Because while his dad died during the influenza outbreak in      1918, Rossi, who was five at the time, remembers the city's      old fire wagons.       ``They were pulled by horses,'' he said. ``I remember the      horses.''       Rossi also remembers the old city stables that were once      located on Burnham Meadow--not far from where Capital Candy      now does business. He remembers the city Cow Pasture, but not      just as the place where the city's workhorses spent some of      their spare time, or where folks now like walking dogs.       ``There used to be a nine-hole golf course there,'' he      said, crediting the Meadow Brook Golf Club for creating and      maintaining it.       Rossi, who has moved only twice in his life--from High      Holburn Street where he was born to the Cleary Street home      where he has lived, with occasional interruption, since he      was 12--is a product of Barre schools, though none of the      ones he attended are schools anymore.       Rossi started out at Ward 5, a now-vacant neighborhood      school that the High Holburn Street gang, which included a      boatload of the Rossi clan, fondly referred to as ``Woodchuck      Knoll School.'' Following the death of his dad, his mother's      remarriage and the move to Cleary Street, Rossi attended the      old Brook Street School, which is now home to the Learning      Together Center, for both fifth- and sixth-grades. He spent      seventh grade at the old North Barre School, which has since      been converted to apartments, and eighth grade in the ground-     floor of what used to be Spaulding High School, but is now      the Vermont History Center.       Rossi graduated from the original Spaulding High School in      1931, and while he would eventually head off to Green      Mountain Junior College thanks to a football scholarship that      limited his tuition payment to $100 a semester, the Great      Depression delayed the start of his post-secondary education      for a few years.       Rossi remembers the Depression, which hadn't yet ended when      he started taking classes in Poultney.       ``I remember getting letters from my mother with 25 cents      taped to them,'' he recalled.       A quarter went a long way back then, according to Rossi,      who remembers when cigarettes cost 10 cents a pack, you could      get a good ice cream bar for a nickel, and $20 was more than      enough to pay for a weekend in Montreal--food, lodging and      transportation included.       Rossi also remembers getting drafted, though he prefers the      old-school term ``conscripted.'' He was `` 27 and single'' at      the time, it was 1940 and he was a whole lot closer to going      to war than he realized at the time.       Rossi remembers the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, and not      just because it was the very same day he arrived at Camp      Edwards on Cape Cod fresh from Fort Devens.       ``That's when we knew we were going to war,'' he said.       Rossi was right, though his overseas tour didn't start      until after a trip through officer training school and a      brief stint at Camp McCoy in Wisconsin.       From there it was off to Northern Ireland, where in the      run-up to D-day and the invasion of Normandy in the summer of      1944, Rossi, a second lieutenant in the Army, remembers      getting a pass to go to London. That's where he spotted a      street sign that reminded him of home and tracking down his      brother, an Air Force pilot, to borrow a little spending      money.       ``The sign said: High Holburn Street,''' said Rossi, who      recalls finding his brother, Antonio, between air raids.       According to Rossi, his brother's commander was Jimmy      Stewart.       ``The actor,'' he said.       Asked about Omaha Beach, Rossi said he didn't need to check      a history book to know it didn't go according to script.       The date was delayed, his platoon was divided, and while      one of the landing crafts made it to shore, the propeller on      the one he was on was fouled by rope floating in the debris      just off the coast of France.       Frogmen were summoned to ``un-jam'' the propeller of a      craft that sat ``becalmed'' for four hours.       Rossi remembers eventually making it to shore, though it      wasn't until the next day that his platoon was reunited and      he learned that all of the officers in that first wave were      either killed or injured.       ``I guess I was lucky,'' he said.       Rather than dwell on the experience Rossi turned his      attention back to Barre, where he     spent 39 years working in the granite industry as a shipper,      a boxer and an expediter.       Rossi prefers to remember Barre.       It's where he once played quarterback for the Spaulding      football team, sipped Seal's soda, ordered western sandwiches      at the New Moon Diner, and played pool in Merlo's pool room.       It's also where he met his wife, Beverly Silver, a South      Barre schoolteacher with whom he happily spent more than      half-a-century before she died in 2004.       ``We had a good life,'' said Rossi, who is still living      his.       Technically Rossi will turn 100 on Friday, but, he said, he      recently celebrated the milestone at a lunch with family at      the Cornerstone Pub & Kitchen.       It was the latest in a long line of Barre memories for a      man who wouldn't think of living anywhere else.       ``Barre is home,'' he said.                          ____________________
