 President, I rise as the main Democratic sponsor of this amendment. I have given this a lot of thought for a long time. I believe what we have before us is language that is essentially content neutral. It is on conduct--not speech. I will make that argument later on in my remarks, but I begin my remarks with how I came to believe that the American flag is something very special.  For those of us who are westerners, the Pacific battles of World War II had very special significance.  Reporters were not embedded, there was no television coverage, and the war in the Pacific was terrible--island battle after island battle--the death march at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, and onward.  On the morning of February 24, 1945, I was a 12-year-old. I picked up a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle.
