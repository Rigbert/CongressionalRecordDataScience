 You just went through and will continue to go through all the things they left out. I find it very curious the things they say are in their bill, which, in fact, are not in their bill.  One, they say that a woman can pick as a primary care physician an ob/gyn. Second, they advertise that this means you have access to the emergency room. Third, they talk about continuity of doctors so they say you can choose your doctor. And fourth, they say no gag rule. This is the party of gag rule, and now they say no gag rule. I kind of respected them when they were just flat out saying they were just against any of this.  Does the Senator have an explanation as to why they would pick the four most often stated complaints of the American public and suggest that their bill covers those things? It just seems strange to me that the party of the gag rule says they want an antigag rule, and yet there still is no antigag rule; that the party that said when they were going after Clinton's health plan, you should be able to choose your own doctor, will not allow you to choose a specialist or choose the doctor you need; that the party that suggested the costs of the Clinton plan were too high and everyone could just go to the emergency room are not, in fact, providing access to emergency room care the way in which the American public is looking at it. Why did they pick these four things to say they were for and not any of the rest? Is there some strategy here I am missing?
