 President, I wish to engage the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Subcommittee on AirLand Forces, in a brief colloquy regarding the Army's Crusader program. Senator Warner, I note that the committee has fully supported the Army's priority development of the Advanced Field Artillery System, Crusader program and I commend the committee for its action. However, I am concerned by the actions of the House National Security Committee relative to the liquid propellant [LP] gun aspect of the Crusader program. I have been led to believe that the Army recognized the performance advantages of the LP gun and that the Army in recognition of those performance enhancements accepted the risks associated with LP development. Am I correct in that understanding?
