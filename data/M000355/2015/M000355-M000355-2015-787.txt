  I have long said the Senate should assess this deal by employing a simple standard: Will it further or will it harm the national security interests of the United States and her allies? By that measure, I believe Senators must vote to disapprove of the deal.  I truly wish that wasn't the case, but it is a predictable outcome when one considers the mindset with which the administration appeared to approach these negotiations.
