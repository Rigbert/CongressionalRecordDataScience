Senator Reed has been a persistent advocate for the Liberian nationals who have fled the strife in their nation for the United States. He has recognized that the U.S. has a special relationship with Liberia's citizens and has sought to respect and enhance that relationship. But his efforts have been resisted by the majority, which has consistently denied his requests to take up his bipartisan bill, which would allow Liberians who fled here and meet certain criteria to become legal permanent residents of the United States. I hope that we will change course and address this issue before we adjourn. I commend the Administration for its commitment to insist on action.  Meanwhile, I am pleased that we were able to pass H.R. 2883, a bill that will confer automatic citizenship upon foreign-born children who are adopted by the American parents. Given the severe curtailment of noncitizens' rights under the immigration laws we passed in 1996, it is all the more important toextend this right to American parents and their adopted children. Everyone in the Senate supports adoption, and we should make sure the law expresses that support.  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle worked hard to see this bill become law, and I would like in particular to commend Senator Landrieu for her efforts. She and her staff were dedicated to this bill and were instrumental in its passage.  I hope that we are able today to move forward on a number of pieces of legislation. First, I hope we can pass the bill that extends the program under which religious workers can obtain visas to enter the U.S. Senator Kennedy has championed this legislation, it has significant bipartisan support, and there is no reason not to act quickly to pass it. We should also pass the bill benefiting Syrian Jews that Senator Schumer has advocated, as well as legislation benefiting the Hmong people, which the late Congressman Bruce Vento did so much to promote. Although many of the larger immigration issues that should have been addressed in this Congress--from reforming expedited removal to restoring due process rights for legal permanent residents--may regrettably remain unresolved, we can at least take these more limited steps and demonstrate some commitment to immigrants and a sound immigration policy.                          ____________________
