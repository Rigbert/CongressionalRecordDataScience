Speaker, I would like to place in the Record remarks that I made in 1999 regarding a measure called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill that passed in this Congress on a vote of 362-57. At the time we said it would cause the mess we're facing today on Wall Street and indeed it has.  I will place also in the Record the votes of those who were present voting ``yes'' and voting ``no.''  This is an extraordinarily important vote that essentially unharnessed Wall Street to do whatever it wanted, mixing banking, commerce, real estate, insurance in a way America had not done for over half a century.  Some of what I said at that time was, ``I would say to the people listening tonight, are you tired of calling banks and getting lost in the automated phone system, never locating a breathing human being? This bill will make it worse.  ``Are you fed up with rising ATM fees and service fees that now average over $200 a year per account holder? This bill will make it worse.  ``Are you tired of mega-financial conglomerates and mergers that have made your community a branch economy of financial centers located far away whose officers you never know who never come to your community? This bill will make it worse.''  I would urge my colleagues to take a look at the remarks that were made over a decade ago and think about what we are facing today. I commend all of my colleagues who voted ``no'' in those days. They deserve a badge of honor.
