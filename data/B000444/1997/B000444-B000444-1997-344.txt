 President, today I intend to address one of the most important matters that should come before the Senate in the next several weeks: the Chemical Weapons Convention. This convention--negotiated under Presidents Reagan and Bush--would outlaw poison gas weapons.  The Chemical Weapons Convention represents a significant step forward in our efforts to contend with the greatest immediate threat to our national security--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The Chemical Weapons Convention will make it illegal under international and domestic laws for a country to use, develop, produce, transfer, or stockpile chemical weapons.  The CWC will help protect our citizens from the use of poison gas weapons by terrorist groups. It will benefit our military by requiring other nations to follow our lead and destroy their chemical weapons. It will improve the ability of our intelligence agencies to monitor chemical weapons threats to our Armed Forces and our Nation. The convention has the strong support of the American chemical industry, which was centrally involved in the negotiation of the CWC. It also takes into account all of the protections afforded Americans under our Constitution.  This is a bipartisan treaty, initiated and negotiated under President Reagan, further negotiated, finalized, and signed under President Bush, and strongly endorsed and submitted for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification by President Clinton.  The costs of the CWC are small, but its benefits are potentially enormous.  At present, international law permits the Libyas and the North Koreas of the world to produce limitless quantities of chemical weapons. That will change when the CWC enters into force.  The CWC will make pariahs out of states that refuse to abide by its provisions. Through the sanctions required by the convention, it will make it more difficult for those pariah states to obtain the precursor chemicals they need to manufacture poison gas. It will create international pressure on these states to sign and ratify the CWC and to abide by its provisions. The CWC will create a standard for good international citizens to meet. It will brand as outlaws those countries that choose to remain outside this regime.  The entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention will mark a major milestone in our efforts to enlist greater international support for the important American objective of containing and penalizing rogue states that seek to acquire or transfer weapons of mass destruction.  Ironically, should the Senate fail to give its advice and consent, this milestone will pass with the U.S. On the same side as the rogue states.                        Consequences of inaction  Mr. President, with just over 2 months remaining until entry-into-force, we have reached the eleventh hour.  The convention has been signed by 161 countries and ratified by 68. It will enter into force on April 29 of this year, with or without the participation of the United States. While the United States led the effort to achieve the CWC, the Senate, which received the convention from President Clinton in 1993, has not yet given its advice and consent to ratification.  Our failure to ratify this convention before April 29 will have direct and serious consequences for the security of this country.  First, the CWC mandates trade restrictions that could have a deleterious impact upon the American chemical industry. If the United States has not ratified, American companies will have to supply end-user certificates to purchase certain classes of chemicals from CWC members. After 3 years we will be subject to trade sanctions that will harm American exports and jobs.  Second, an overall governing body known as the Conference of States Parties will meet soon after April 29 to draw up rules governing the implementation of the convention. If we are not a party to the CWC, we will not be a member of that conference. This body with no American input could make rules that have a serious negative impact on the United States.  Third, there will be a standing executive council of 41 members, on which we are assured of a permanent seat from the start because of the size of our chemical industry--that is, if we have ratified the convention by April 29. If we ratify after the council is already constituted, then a decision on whether to order a requested surprise inspection of an American facility may be taken without an American representative evaluating the validity of the request and looking out for the facility's interests.  Fourth, there will be a technical secretariat with about 150 inspectors, many of whom would be American because of the size and sophistication of our chemical industry. If we fail to ratify this convention in the next 2 months, there will be no American inspectors.  Finally, and most importantly in the long term, by failing to ratify we would align ourselves with those rogue actors who have chosen to defy the CWC. This would do irreparable harm to our global leadership on critical arms control and non-proliferation concerns.  Mr. President, I would now like to address some of the benefits we will derive by joining the CWC.                               Terrorism  One clear benefit of the CWC is that it will help protect us against the threat of terrorist groups acquiring poison gas and using it against our citizens at home or our troops abroad. Imagine for a moment if those responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing or last year's attack on our troops in Saudi Arabia had used poison gas instead of conventional devices. How many more Americans would have been killed?  The CWC will make it more difficult for terrorists to get their hands on chemicals that would allow them to blackmail us with the threat of killing thousands of Americans with a single device. This convention will require countries to destroy their stockpiles of chemical weapons, eliminating the risk that these weapons could fall into the wrong hands. It also will control the transfer of those chemicals that can be used to make chemical weapons, thus restricting and improving the monitoring of chemicals that terrorists need to manufacture weapons.  Most importantly, parties to the convention will be required to pass implementing legislation to place the same prohibitions on persons under their jurisdiction that states themselves accept under the convention. This will mean that states will control strictly all toxic chemicals and their precursors. Any prohibited activity under the convention will be criminalized.  That was not the case with the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway in which lethal sarin gas caused thousands of casualties. At that time, there was no Japanese law against the manufacture and possession of chemical weapons. Following that horrible incident, Japan moved swiftly to enact legislation to criminalize chemical weapons activities of the sort banned by the convention. Under the CWC, all parties must do the same.  In conjunction with the legislation we will introduce in our Congress to implement the CWC, the convention will provide American law enforcement officers the tools they need to investigate terrorist groups that are trying to acquire chemical weapons and improve the prospects for early detection and prosecution.  In short, while it cannot entirely eliminate the threat of chemical terrorism--and I would submit that no treaty can--the CWC will make it much harder for terrorists to obtain poison gas and to use it against Americans.                                Military  The CWC also has benefits for our Armed Forces.  Let me make two facts absolutely clear. First, the U.S. has foresworn the use of chemical weapons once the CWC enters into force. Second, the Defense Department is required by law to destroy nearly all U.S. chemical weapons by 2004. Failure to ratify the CWC will not change these two facts.  However, the CWC will require other nations to follow our lead and destroy their chemical weapons.  As the gulf war demonstrated, we do not need chemical weapons to deter potential adversaries like Iraq and Libya from using chemical weapons against our troops. The threat of overwhelming and devastating nonchemical retaliation will serve as a sufficient deterrent. Thus, the Chemical Weapons Convention will enhance, not damage, the capabilities of the U.S. military to carry out its mission.  Several current and former distinguished military officers have spoken to the benefits of this convention.  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf in his recent testimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee stated:       We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future      warfares. And frankly, by not rarifying that treaty we align      ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea and I'd      just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this      particular matter.  Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated before the Foreign Relations Committee : ``From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons Convention is clearly in our interest.''  Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, former Chief of Naval Operations, wrote last month in the Washington Post:       This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's      weapons--weapons that may some day be used against Americans.      For the American military, U.S. ratification is high gain and      low or no pain. In that light, I find it astonishing that any      American opposes ratification.  In addition, several prominent veterans and military groups, including the V.F.W. and the R.O.A., have endorsed the CWC. I will ask that Admiral Zumwalt's op-ed and statements by these groups be printed in the Record.  The CWC does not diminish our ability and duty to provide our troops with defenses against those that would contemplate the use of chemical weapons against us. Indeed, the administration plans to maintain a robust program of upgrading defenses against chemical weapons. Should chemical weapons be used against us after the CWC is in force, we will be ready.  Furthermore, the CWC will place the weight of world opinion behind us to take whatever action is necessary to respond to or prevent an adversary using chemical weapons.  I emphasize again that the most important aspect of the CWC from a military perspective is that it will place most of the world in the same situation we are in--not relying upon chemical weapons as a part of military doctrine. This can only be considered a positive development for our military.                              Verification  Another great benefit of the Chemical Weapons Convention is that it increases our ability to detect production of poison gas.  Regardless of whether we ratify this convention, regardless of whether another country has ratified this convention, our intelligence agencies will be monitoring the capabilities of other countries to produce and deploy chemical weapons. The CWC will not change that responsibility.  What this convention does, however, is give our intelligence agencies some additional tools to carry out this task. In short, it will make their job easier.  In addition to on-site inspections, the CWC provides a mechanism to track the movement of sensitive chemicals around the world, increasing the likelihood of detection. This mechanism consists of data declarations that require chemical companies to report production of those precursor chemicals needed to produce chemical weapons. This information will make it easier for the intelligence community to monitor these chemicals and to learn when a country has chemical weapons capability.  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994, R. James Woolsey, then Director of Central Intelligence, stated: ``In sum, what the Chemical Weapons Convention provides the intelligence community is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit.''  Recently, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, re-emphasized this point before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. Tenet stated: ``There are tools in this treaty that as intelligence professionals we believe we need to monitor the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world. . . . I think as intelligence professionals we can only gain.''  No one has ever asserted that this convention is 100 percent verifiable. It simply is not possible with this or any other treaty to detect every case of cheating. But I would respectfully submit that this is not the standard by which we should judge the convention. Instead, we should recognize that the CWC will enhance our ability to detect clandestine chemical weapons programs. The intelligence community has said that we are better off with the CWC than without it--that is the standard by which to judge the CWC.  Mr. President, having discussed some of the clear benefits of joining the CWC, I now would like to address some of the costs associated with not joining, as well as some of the objections that have been raised to the convention.                                Industry  Perhaps no single aspect of this debate has seen more misinformation than that having to do with the affect the CWC would have on the U.S. chemical industry.  Mr. President, the chemical industry plays a larger role in the economy of the State of Delaware than it does in any other State. Over half of Delaware's industrial output comes from our 47 chemical plants. Their sales represent more than 10 percent of our State's economic output. The chemical industry employs tens of thousands of Delawareans.  The people who own, manage, and work at chemical plants know they have no greater friend than this Senator. If I for one moment thought that the convention would harm the American chemical industry, as some have alleged, I would raise this issue. But the fact of the matter is that the only thing about the Chemical Weapons Convention that would hurt the American chemical industry would be the Senate's failure to give its advice and consent.  In 1995, the American chemical industry exported $60 billion around the world, accounting for fully 10 percent of all American exports and making it the single largest exporting industry. More than 1 million Americans are employed by the U.S. chemical industry.  Should we fail to ratify the CWC, we will put a portion of these exports and these good-paying jobs at risk by leaving our chemical manufacturers open to sanctions, the very sanctions that American negotiators insisted should be a part of this convention as a way to pressure rogue states. In fact, the Chemical Manufacturers Association estimates that failure to ratify the CWC could jeopardize $600 million of our chemical exports.  The charge that the CWC will harm American business appears all the more preposterous when one considers the fact that the convention was negotiated with the unprecedented input of the U.S. chemical industry.  Thanks to their help, the convention contains thresholds and exemptions that protect businesses, small and large alike, from bearing an undue burden. The American chemical industry helped develop the ground rules under which inspections will occur, including provisions for protecting confidential business information. Chemical company representatives also helped design the brief, three-page form that represents the only reporting obligation for 90 percent of the approximately 2,000 companies that will have obligations under the CWC.  I will ask that a statement by Mr. Fred Webber, the president of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, be printed in the Record.  To quote from another statement of Mr. Webber's:       The U.S. Chemical Industry worked hard to help Government      negotiators craft a CWC that provides strong protections      against future uses of chemical weapons, at a minimum burden      and intrusion on commercial chemical facilities. The      protection our industry achieved in the CWC can only be      realized if the Senate acts quickly to ratify the convention.  U.S. chemical companies recognize that while they produce goods intended for peaceful uses, their products and inputs could be misused for nefarious purposes. That is why they so actively have supported this convention. Their involvement in the CWC has been a model of good corporate citizenship.  Unfortunately, we will reward this responsible behavior with a slap in the face if we fail to ratify the CWC and subject the U.S. chemical industry to international sanctions.                           Constitutionality  One of the issues that should not be contentious, and I hope will not continue to be a focus of attention, is whether the convention, and particularly its inspection regime, is constitutional.  Every scholar that has published on the subject, and virtually every scholar that has considered the issue, has concluded that nothing in the convention conflicts in any way with the fourth amendment or any other provision of the U.S. Constitution.  Indeed, to accommodate our special constitutional concerns, the United States insisted that when parties to the convention provide access to international inspection teams, the Government may ``[take] into account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures.''  In plain English, this means that inspectors enforcing the chemical weapons Convention must comply with our constitution when conducting inspections on U.S. soil.  It also means that the United States will not be in violation of its treaty obligations if it refuses to provide inspectors access to a particular site for legitimate constitutional reasons.  In light of this specific text, inserted at the insistence of U.S. negotiators, I am hard pressed to understand how anyone can seriously contend that the convention conflicts with the constitution.  There is nothing in the convention that would require the United States to permit a warrantless search or to issue a warrant without probable cause. Nor does the convention give any international body the power to compel the U.S. to permit an inspection or issue a warrant.  This is the overwhelming consensus among international law scholars that have studied the convention, two of whom have written to me expressing their opinion that the convention is constitutional. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of Harvard Law Professor Abram Chayes and Columbia Law Professor Louis Henkin be included in the Record following my statement.  So let me make this point absolutely clear, despite what opponents of the convention have said, there will be no involuntary warrantless searches of U.S. facilities by foreign inspectors under this convention.  In light of this, I hope that the constitutionality of this convention will not become an issue in this debate.                          American leadership  Mr. President, let me stress that the CWC will go into effect with or without us on April 29. The only way we can ensure fully effective American leadership is to ratify this convention before that date. We will needlessly pay a price if we ratify after that date.  Let us remember that this is not a partisan issue before us. After more than 8 years of negotiation under two Republican administrations, President Bush signed the final version of the CWC in January 1993.  To demonstrate the bipartisan support for the CWC, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record a statement made earlier this month by former President Bush in which he re-stated his strong support for ratification of the CWC.  I also ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a recent op-ed by former Secretary of State James Baker.  Many of the strongest supporters of this convention are Republicans. The distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, has led the effort to ratify the CWC. All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, need to recognize that this convention is a matter of our national interest.  Mr. President, I fear that our status as the world's non-proliferation leader would be irreversibly compromised by our unwillingness to ratify the CWC.  Already, all of our G-7 partners have ratified the CWC.  What will be their reaction when we try to enlist their support for proliferation initiatives targeting rogue states if we cannot even take the simple step of joining a regime that we led the way in creating?  Make no mistake. If we fail to ratify the CWC, we will forfeit the high ground on global proliferation matters. And that is not something to be taken lightly, for the result will be a far more dangerous world.                               Conclusion  Mr. President, in conclusion, the burdens of the chemical weapons convention are small, but its benefits are great.  The American chemical industry strongly supports this convention.  Our military is already committed to destroying our poison gas stockpile, and the convention will require the same of every other CWC member state.  The CWC will improve our ability to monitor the chemical weapons capabilities of other states.  In short, Mr. President, the CWC will improve the security of Americans.  The CWC may not be perfect--and no treaty is--but it is considerably better than the alternative of doing nothing. Ultimately, the question we will have to ask is--are we better off with the CWC or without it? I hope that I have demonstrated today why we would be far better off joining a treaty regime that we created, rather than turning our backs in favor of the status quo or worse.  We need to disregard arguments that are superfluous to the core reality of what this convention will accomplish: It bans poison gas, period.  This convention is the best means available to ensure that there will be no more victims of poison gas like the soldiers in the trenches of World War I or the innocent victims of a murderous Iraqi regime.  I understand that a task force of Republican Senators has been working with the White House to address concerns raised by some of our colleagues. I hope that this process soon will yield a resolution of ratification that merits strong bipartisan support.  But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this convention to our national security. We have a very real deadline hanging over our heads.  I would urge my colleagues to learn more about this convention in the next few weeks so that they can make an informed decision about its necessity for our national security. Please contact me or my staff if you have questions about the cwc and what it will and will not do.  If we bring this convention to the floor and engage in a full, frank, and open debate on its merits, I am confident that two-thirds of the Senate will be convinced that the Chemical Weapons Convention is good for American business, good for the American military, and good for the American people. Mr. President, we owe it to them to have this debate at the earliest possible time.  I ask that the material to which I referred be printed in the Record.  The material follows:                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 6, 1997]                    A Needless Risk for U.S. Troops                         (By E.R. Zumwalt, Jr.)       It has been more than 80 years since poison gas was first      used in modern warfare--in April 1915 during the first year      of World War I. It is long past time to do something about      such weapons.       I am not a dove. As a young naval officer in 1945, I      supported the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. As chief      of naval operations two decades ago, I pressed for      substantially higher military spending than the nation's      political leadership was willing to grant. After retiring      from the Navy, I helped lead the opposition to the SALT II      treaty because I was convinced it would give the Soviet Union      a strategic advantage.       Now the Senate is considering whether to approve the      Chemical Weapons Convention. This is a worldwide treaty,      negotiated by the Reagan administration and signed by the      Bush administration. It bans the development, production,      possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Senate      opposition to ratification is led by some with whom I often      agree. But in this case, I believe they do a grave disservice      to America's men and women in uniform.       To a Third World leader indifferent to the health of his      own troops and seeking to cause large-scale pain and death      for its own sake, chemical weapons have a certain attraction.      They don't require the advanced     technology needed to build nuclear weapons. Nor do they      require the educated populace needed to create a modern      conventional military. But they cannot give an inferior force      a war-winning capability. In the Persian Gulf war, the threat      of our uncompromising retaliation with conventional weapons      deterred Saddam Hussein from using his chemical arsenal      against us.       Next time, our adversary may be more berserk than Saddam,      and deterrence may fail. If that happens, our retaliation      will be decisive, devastating--and no help to the young      American men and women coming home dead or bearing grievous      chemical injuries. What will help is a treaty removing huge      quantities of chemical weapons that could otherwise be used      against us.       ``Militarily, this treaty will make us stronger. During the      Bush administration, our nation's military and political      leadership decided to retire our chemical weapons. This wise      move was not made because of treaties. Rather, it was based      on the fact that chemical weapons are not useful for us.       Politically and diplomatically, the barriers against their      use by a First World country are massive. Militarily, they      are risky and unpredictable to use, difficult and dangerous      to store. They serve no purpose that can't be met by our      overwhelming conventional forces.       So the United States has no deployed chemical weapons today      and will have none in the future. But the same is not true of      our potential adversaries. More than a score of nations now      seeks or possesses chemical weapons. Some are rogue states      with which we may some day clash.       This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's      weapons--weapons that may some day be used against Americans.      For the American military, U.S. ratification of the Chemical      Weapons Convention is high gain and low or no pain. In that      light, I find it astonishing that any American opposes      ratification.       Opponents argue that the treaty isn't perfect: Verification      isn't absolute, forms must be filled out, not every nation      will join at first and so forth. This is unpersuasive.      Nothing in the real world is perfect. If the U.S. Navy had      refused to buy any weapon unless it worked perfectly every      time, we would have bought nothing and now would be disarmed.      The question is not how this treaty compares with perfection.      The question is how U.S. ratification compares with its      absence.       If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our      refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons.      Worldwide availability of chemical weapons will be higher,      and we will know less about other countries' chemical      activities. The diplomatic credibility of our threat of      retaliation against anyone who uses chemical weapons on our      troops will be undermined by our lack of ``clean hands.'' At      the bottom line, our failure to ratify will substantially      increase the risk of a chemical attack against American      service personnel.       If such an attack occurs, the news reports of its victims      in our military hospitals will of course produce rapid      ratification of the treaty and rapid replacement of senators      who enabled the horror by opposing ratification. But for the      victims, it will be too late.       Every man and woman who puts on a U.S. military uniform      faces possible injury or death in the national interest. They      don't complain; risk is part of their job description. But it      is also part of the job description of every U.S. senator to      see that this risk not be increased unnecessarily.                                  ____        [Chemical Weapons Convention News Alert, Feb. 20, 1997]                 Veterans, Military Groups Endorse CWC       Veterans organizations and military associations      representing millions of Americans who have served in this      nation's armed forces have endorsed the Chemical Weapons      Convention.       The Veterans of Foreign Wars Commander in Chief James E.      Nier said:       ``The treaty will reduce world stockpiles of such weapons      and will hopefully prevent our troops from being exposed to      poison gases. . . . As combat veterans we support this treaty      . . .''

The Reserved Officers Association of the United States in a      Resolution declared:       ``. . . failure to ratify the CWC will place us among the      great outlaw states of the world, including Libya, Iran, and      North Korea . . .       ``. . . United States ratification of the CWC will enable      us to play a major role in the development and implementation      of CWC policy, as well as providing strong moral leverage to      help convince Russia of the desirability of ratifying. . .       ``. . . the Reserve Officers Association of the United      States, chartered by Congress, urge the Senate to quickly      ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.''       American Ex-Prisoners of War National Commander William E.      ``Sonny'' Mottern said:       ``. . . I wish to express my support for the ratification      of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This is an important step      in reducing the price that Americans who serve their country      on the field of battle must pay in defense of our freedom.       ``. . .

We are honor bound to protect our Nation and our      troops by minimizing the chances from all obvious or hidden      means of chemical attack in the future.''                                  ____          [Chemical Manufacturers Association, Jan. 13, 1997]                 Ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention                  (By Fred Webber, President and CEO)       Today marks the fourth anniversary of the Chemical Weapons      Convention, an international treaty outlawing poison gas. The      treaty is the brainchild of the United States. Since the      treaty was opened for signature in Paris, 67 nations have      ratified the treaty (China is poised to become the 68th      member of the club). The United States is not among the 67.      Now, with the Convention poised to become international law      on April 29, our nation's continuing absence from a treaty of      its making is fast becoming a source of international      embarrassment. The Senate should act quickly to rectify this      situation by ratifying the treaty at the earliest      opportunity.       Opposition to the Convention, led by conservative think      tanks, is rooted in long-standing suspicions of arms control      agreements. But the critics have taken to embellishing this      argument by also claiming the Convention will have a      devastating impact on American businesses, large and small.       The critics are simply wrong. The members of our      association, large and small, produce over 90 percent of the      nation's industrial chemicals and they strongly support the      Convention. Ratifying it is the right thing to do.       No American business makes chemical weapons. Chemical      companies do, however, make products which can, in the wrong      hands, be processed into weapons agents. Some poison gases      for example, can be made in part from chemicals designed to      treat cancer patients and prevent fires.       Chemical manufacturers have a responsibility to make sure      that their products are safely produced and properly used.      That's why we support the Chemical Weapons Convention. It's      the best way to reduce the threat of future poison gas      attacks.       Some advocacy groups, and their allies on Capitol Hill, are      trying to scare the business community into opposing the      Convention. It's time to answer the critics and set the      record straight.       Here's how the chemical industry answers three commonly-     heard criticisms of the treaty:       The treaty will impose a ``massive new regulatory burden''      on more than 25,000 American businesses, most of which are      not chemical companies. The terms of the treaty place most of      the private-sector reporting requirements squarely on the      shoulders of chemical manufacturers. No more than 2,000      facilities here in the U.S. face treaty obligations. Nearly      all are chemical makers, not their customers. And most      regulated businesses will be required to do more than fill      out a two-page form, once a year.       The treaty threatens vital industry trade secrets by      allowing international inspectors free access to      manufacturing sites. The chemical industry worked with treaty      negotiators for more than a decade to help devise inspection      procedures. We tested these procedures during trial      inspections held at our commercial facilities. Our top      priority was to protect legitimate commercial secrets. The      treaty does just that--it does not permit unlimited inspector      access to any facility.       The treaty tramples on the U.S. Constitution by voiding      Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches      and seizures. This argument does not pass the red-face test.      A simple reading of the Convention reveals that the treaty      respects all constitutional protections.       The chemical industry spent years examining this treaty. We      have opened our plants to trial inspections. We have put the      treaty to the test--over and over again. Honest businesses      have nothing to fear from this treaty. Its benefits far      outweigh the costs.       What the critics fail to mention is the price to pay for      failing to ratify the Convention. The treaty imposes trade      sanctions on countries which don't participate. The price of      U.S. non-participation will be paid by the chemical industry      and by American workers, for it is our products, and our      businesses, that will be hurt. Treaty opponents purport to      represent American business interests in the Convention, but      they aren't telling business the true story.       The Senate's vote on the treaty will send a powerful signal      to the rest of the world. A vote against the treaty will      surely be perceived as a vote for chemical weapons.       Those who oppose this treaty have yet to offer a credible      alternative. Chemical weapons are a serious threat to world      security. The Chemical Weapons Convention is a serious      response to that threat. The treaty's merits have been      debated for years. It's time     to stop talking and take action. It's time for the U.S. to      ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention before it goes into      effect in April 1997.                                  ____                                           Harvard Law School,                                  Cambridge MA, September 9, 1996.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington DC.       Dear Senator Biden: You have asked me to comment on the      suggestion that the Chemical Weapons Convention (the      Convention), now before the Senate for its advice and      consent, conflicts with the provisions of the Fourth      Amendment of the Constitution prohibiting unreasonable      searches and seizures. In my view, the suggestion is      completely without merit.       The Convention expressly provides that:       ``In meeting the requirement to provide access . . . the      inspected State Party shall be under the obligation to allow      the greatest degree of access taking into account any      constitutional obligations it may have with regard to       proprietary rights or searches and seizures.'' (Verification      Annex, Part X, par. 41) (emphasis supplied).\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ The Verification Annex is, of course, an integral part of      the convention.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       As you know, this provision of the Convention was inserted      at the insistence of the United States after earlier drafts,      which provided insufficient protection in regard to      unreasonable searches and seizures, had been criticized by a      number of U.S. scholars. The plain meaning of these words,      which seems too clear for argument, is that the United States      would have no obligation under the Convention to permit      access to facilities subject to its jurisdiction in violation      of the provisions of the Fourth Amendment. It was the clear      understanding of the negotiators that the purpose of the      provision was to obviate any possibility of conflict between      the obligations of the United States under the Convention and      the mandate of the Fourth Amendment. The Convention in its      final form is thus fully consistent with U.S. constitutional      requirements.       Inspections required by the Convention will be conducted      pursuant to implementing legislation to be adopted by      Congress that will define the terms, conditions and scope of      the inspections to be conducted in the United States by      the Technical Staff of the Organization for the      Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) established by the      Convention. I understand that draft implementing      legislation entitled the Chemical Weapons Convention      Implementation Act, now before the Congress, specifies the      procedures that will be followed in the case of both      routine and challenge inspections carried out pursuant to      the Convention. The Act requires, at a minimum, an      administrative search warrant before an inspection can be      conducted, and has elaborate provisions for notice and      other protections to the owner of the premises to be      searched. These provisions of the Act are modeled on      similar administrative inspection regimes already      authorized by Acts of Congress such as the Toxic      Substances Control Act and upheld by the courts. However,      if Congress is concerned that these provisions are      constitutionally insufficient, it is free under the      Convention to revise the Act to include more stringent      requirements that conform to constitutional limitations.      Finally, a person subject to inspection may challenge the      inspection in a U.S. court, which in turn will be bound to      invalidate any inspection that fails to comply with      constitutional requirements. In view of the provisions of      the Verification Annex quoted above, the United States      would not be in violation of any international obligation      in such an eventually.       For these reasons I conclude that there is no      constitutional objection to the Convention, and that the      rights of individuals under the Fourth Amendment will be      fully protected under the Convention and implementing      legislation of the character presently contemplated.       In addition, I have been involved in the field of arms      control as a scholar and practitioner for many years, going      back to the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in connection      with which I appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee as Legal Adviser of the State Department. I have      also closely followed the negotiations for the Chemical      Weapons Convention. The United States has been a prime mover      in the development of the Convention under both Republican      and Democratic administrations. I am convinced that the      prompt ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is      overwhelmingly in the security interest of the United States      and should not be derailed by constitutional objections that      are so plainly without substance.           Sincerely,     Abram Chayes.                                  ____                                              Columbia University,                                                School of Law,                                 New York, NY, September 11, 1996.       Dear Senator Biden: As requested, I have considered      whether, if the United States adhered to the Convention on      Chemical Weapons, the inspection provisions of the Convention      would raise serious issues under the United States      Constitution. I have concluded that those provisions would      not present important obstacles to U.S. adherence to the      Convention.       Like domestic laws, treaties of the United States are      subject to constitutional restraints. The Fourth Amendment to      the United States constitution provides: ``The right of the      people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and      effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall      not be violated . . .'' Constitutional jurisprudence has      established that the right to be secure applies also to      industrial and commercial facilities and to business records,      papers and effects.       The Constitution, however, protects the rights of private      persons; it does not protect governmental bodies, public      officials, public facilities or public papers. As to private      persons, the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches      and seizures that are ``unreasonable.'' Inspection      arrangements, negotiated and approved by the President and      consented to by the Senate, designed to give effect to a      treaty of major importance to the United States, carry a      strong presumption that they are not unreasonable.       The Chemical Convention itself anticipated the      constitutional needs of the United States. Part X of the      Convention, ``Challenge Inspection pursuant to Article IX,''      provides:       ``41. In meeting the requirement to provide access as      specified in paragraph 38, the inspected State party shall be      under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of access      taking into account any constitutional obligation it may have      with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures.''       As applied to the United States, that provision is properly      interpreted to mean that the United States must provide      access required by the Convention, but if the Constitution      precludes some access in some circumstances, the United      States must provide access to the extent the Constitution      permits. And if, because of constitutional limitations, the      United States cannot provide full access required by the      Convention, the United States is required ``to make every      reasonable effort to provide alternative means to clarify the      possible noncompliance concern that generated the challenge      inspection.'' (Art. 42.)       The United States would be required also to adopt measures      to overcome any constitutional obstacles to any inspection or      interrogation required by the Convention. If it were      determined to be necessary, the United States could satisfy      the requirements of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by      arranging for administrative search warrants, by enacting      statutes granting immunity from prosecution for crimes      revealed by compelled testimony, by providing just      compensation for any ``taking'' involved.           Sincerely,                                                     Louis Henkin,     University Professor Emeritus.                                  ____               Statement of Former President George Bush       President Bush. Welcome. Let me just say that we've had a      most enjoyable breakfast. Barbara and I are very flattered      that the Secretary of State, in what is obviously a busy      schedule, took time to come and have breakfast with us.       I told Secretary Albright that she would have my      enthusiastic support in her quest for bipartisanship and      foreign policy. I think Jim Baker, my esteemed friend and      former colleague, told her the same thing, so it's for real      from us and I know she feels strongly about that.       I told her I would strongly support her efforts to get this      Chemical Weapons Treaty approved. This should be beyond      partisanship. I have a certain fatherhood feeling about that.      But leaving that out, I think it is vitally important for the      United States to be out front, not to be dragged, kicking and      screaming to the finish line on that question. We don't need      chemical weapons, and we ought to get out front and make      clear that we are opposed to others having them. So that's      important.       The funding for the State Department: When I heard      Madeleine telling me some of the problems that she might      face--hopefully, she won't, but she might face--it was deja      vu because I remember Jim Baker coming to me, as President,      and saying ``We must keep adequate funding levels for      State.'' I couldn't agree more. There is a stupid feeling in      some quarters that we don't have any more concerns on foreign      policy, that we don't have any more threat in the world. The      Secretary knows so well that we do.       So I hope that Congress will do what's right on a      bipartisan basis in terms of proper levels of funding. She      can determine what those levels should be. But all I know is,      these arguments that we ought to cut back on spending for      foreign affairs--I think it's very shortsighted. We do that      at our own risk for generations to come, too.       We talked about several others. But, Madeleine, welcome,      and I'm so pleased you came to Houston.                                  ____                            Our Best Defense                         (By James A. Baker 3d)       Houston.--The Chemical Weapons Convention -- an      international treaty that commits member nations to destroy      their chemical weapons and to forswear future production,      acquisition or use of them--is before the Senate for      approval. Despite the fact that the treaty was negotiated      under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, a number of      Republicans have expressed reservations about it. I respect      their motives, but their concerns are misplaced.       For instance, some have argued that we shouldn't commit to      the treaty because rogue states like Libya, Iraq and North     Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to      continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is      obviously true. But the convention, which has been endorsed      by 68 countries and will go into effect in April whether or      not we have ratified it, will make it more difficult for      these states to do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to      nonmembers that can be used to make chemical weapons.       In an ideal world, rogue states and terrorist groups would      simply give up the use of chemical weapons. But ours is not      an ideal world. The Chemical Weapons Convention recognizes      that, and so should its opponents. It makes no sense to argue      that because a few pariah states refuse to join the      convention the United States should line up with them rather      than with the rest of the world.       Others have argued that if we ratify the treaty, we will      not be able to verify that all members will abide by it. No      international agreement, of course, is perfectly verifiable--     just as no domestic law is perfectly enforceable. But the      treaty sets up a verification system, including international      inspections on short notice, that will be far more effective      than what we possess today. Moreover, the treaty would      strengthen information-sharing among member states. It would      increase, not diminish, our understanding of chemical weapons      threats.       Some opponents of the treaty claim that it would create yet      another costly international bureaucracy and place an onerous      regulatory burden on American business. Both assertions are      overstated. Our share for administering the treaty would be      about $25 million a year, a truly modest amount in a Federal      budget of about $1.7 trillion. Only about 140 companies would      have significant reporting requirements, while some 2,000      others would be asked to fill out a short form.       Moreover, failure to ratify the treaty would actually cost      the American chemical industry hundreds of millions of      dollars in sales by making United States exporters subject to      trade restrictions by convention members. Our joining the      convention could help American business--which is why the      chemical industry supports ratification.       Other critics assert that the treaty would somehow infringe      on our national sovereignty--in particular, the Fourth      Amendment ban on unreasonable search and seizure. In fact, it      explicitly permits members to abide by their constitutional      requirements when providing access to international      inspectors. Under the treaty, involuntary inspection of      American manufacturing and storage sites would still require      legally acquired search warrants. The idea that ratifying the      treaty would repeal part of our Bill of Rights is simply      wrong.       But by far the most important argument against the treaty      is that ratification would somehow undermine our national      security.       Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me be blunt:      The idea that Ronald Reagan and George Bush would negotiate a      treaty detrimental to this nation's security is grotesque.       The United States does not need chemical weapons as a      deterrent. Any nation or group contemplating a chemical      attack against us must reckon with our overwhelming      conventional force and vast nuclear arsenal. Each is more      than sufficient to deter a chemical attack.       Chemical weapons are relatively easy to develop and cheap      to manufacture, so it is no coincidence that the rogue      nations now seeking to build chemical arsenals are      economically impoverished and technologically backward.      Unlike Iraq or Libya, we don't need such weapons to project      our influence. In fact, we are already committed--under a law      signed in 1985 by President Reagan--to destroy our existing      chemical weapons stockpile by 2004. We will do this whether      or not we ratify the treaty.       What we need is a way to limit the risk that American      troops or civilians may someday face a chemical weapons      attack. The convention can help do precisely this by      controlling the flow of illicit trade materials and by making      it easier to marshal international support for the political,      diplomatic and economic isolation of countries that refuse to      ratify it.       If we fail to ratify the convention, we will not only forgo      any influence in the continuing effort against chemical      weapons, we will also risk postponing indefinitely any      progress on an international ban on the equally dire threat      of biological weapons. More generally, we will imperil our      leadership in the entire area of nonproliferation perhaps the      most vital security issue of the post-cold-war era.       Today we face a monumental choice requiring a bipartisan      consensus, just as we did in ratifying the North American      Free Trade Act in 1993. Failure to ratify the Chemical      Weapons Convention would send a message of American retreat      from engagement in the world. For this reason--and because      our national interest is better served by joining the      convention than by lining up with pariah states outside it--I      support the treaty and urge my fellow Republicans to do the      same.                          ____________________
