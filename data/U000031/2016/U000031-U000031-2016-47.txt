Section 601, the State demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse response, is designed to allow States the flexibility to do what is right and aid in establishing a comprehensive response. Under this grant, we emphasize prevention and treatment, but those are not the only two ways to address the opioid epidemic. Recovery, like the good work that Chairman Goodlatte cited in his district, as it is in mine, is equally as important.  We need a comprehensive response to the crisis that should leave no stone unturned in our quest for helping those in need. I want to thank the chairman for his help in that effort, and I absolutely agree with his reading of the bill.
