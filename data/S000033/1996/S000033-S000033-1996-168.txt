 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Bethany Carpenter, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT. She was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       My name is Bethany Carpenter, and first of all I just want      to say thanks for letting us come today.       ``The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow.'' How      many times has that phrase been stated in one form or      another, it seems to carry no meaning anymore. But what a      true statement it is. Sadly, this statement soon will not be      truthful. Many of the leaders of tomorrow are losing the      opportunity to become leaders due to the lack of support for      a post-secondary education.       Over the past year, I have gone through the process of      looking at colleges; choosing a select number to apply to;      applying; waiting for responses; and most importantly,      sending for financial aid. My top choice school is a small      university in upstate New York specializing in theater arts      and elementary education. Unfortunately, this school costs      $24,000/year. Therefore, I am forced to choose between my top      choice school, which will better prepare me for my future      career, or a somewhat large college in Central Vermont, which      will cost less but will not provide me with the specialized      education that my top choice would. To me, this is the most      disappointing part of my application procedures.       The total post-secondary enrollment in this country has      been rising rapidly in the past years, while the federal      support for post-secondary students has been decreasing. High      school students have been feeling more pressure to continue      their education beyond their twelve years due to the lack of      availability of high-paying jobs for high school graduates.      In today's high-paced world, those who have completed more      years of schooling typically experience less unemployment      than other workers.       In addition, workers' earnings are generally increased as      their level of learning increases. In the latter half of the      1970's, the average male college graduate earned about 50%      more than the average high school graduate. By 1994, the      premium paid to males with college degrees had risen to 81%.      Similarly, the average wage advantage of female college      graduates over female high school graduates grew from about      41% to 77%. In 1994, the average earnings of male workers 18      years or older with a bachelor's degree was $46,278, compared      to that of high school graduates was only $25,038. In the      same year, the average earnings of female workers with a      bachelor's degree was $26,482, while that of a high school      graduate was only $14,995.       The increase in salaries for college graduates over the      past 15-20 years shows the need for a post-secondary      education in today's society. Federal support in the form of      student aid reached a high in 1980, with 83% of aid awarded      in federal funds. That support has dropped to 75% in 1993.      The enrollment of post-secondary students increased from 8.6      million in 1970 to 12.1 million in 1980, and rose to      approximately 15 million in 1993.       I have formatted a plan for tuition which will allow more      students to attend college. The plan starts with the fact      that the United States, in 1995, spent an estimated $269.6      billion for our national defense, while only spending an      estimated $54.7 billion for education and training. This is      less than one-fifth of the amount that is spent on the      military, and this is a disgrace! In many countries, higher      education is a right, not a privilege. For instance, a      fundamental principle in Swedish higher education is that all      students who need help to finance their studies should      receive assistance from the central government. Can the      United States say the same? If the United States government      were to take $69.6 billion of the national defense budget and      put the money towards the education and training of America's      future, this would open up worlds of possibilities for      students, who would otherwise have to forfeit their dream for      college.       If the government would make more money available to pay      for the tuitions of students in need, more students would be      able to afford the other expenses of college. My plan      includes setting a basic fee for all students attending      college, no matter what year they are in college or the      college that they are attending. By doing this, the amount of      money paid by any student or family would be lowered, their      application process for colleges would also need to be      reviewed, and many colleges would need to reevaluate their      expenses and costs. The individual state governments would      then need to institute loan and grant programs for the      students who would still need assistance paying the basic fee      or living expenses while in college.       This plan would involve a major change in thinking and      planning on the part of many people involved, but it is my      hope that it will lead to a better, more fair educational      system for future students. Therefore, it is with a mixture      of hope and trepidation and a wish that you consider very      carefully my original statement, that ``the children of today      are the leaders of tomorrow,'' but only if given the chances      to achieve their goals. (Applause)       Congressman Sanders: Thank you. Bethany, that was an      excellent and important statement. Let me ask you a question.      You mentioned Sweden, and it's true, throughout Europe, and      even in Canada, that the cost of higher education is much      less because the government plays a much more active role.      Why do you think that's so, that other countries in Europe      and Scandinavia, do that--make college more affordable for      young people--and we don't do that in the U.S.?       Answer. Many of the other countries that I researched don't      spend as much on their military, and these programs and other      things like that, and they focus more on the fact that their      youth (and even adults who want to continue their education)      need to do that, and that that's more important than trying      to set up a good army. So they institute a lot more loan,      grant and financial aid programs.       Congressman Sanders: So they have a very different set of      priorities than we do, is what you're saying.       Answer. A much different set of priorities.                          ____________________
