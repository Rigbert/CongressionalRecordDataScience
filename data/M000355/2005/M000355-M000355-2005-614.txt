 President, I welcome everyone back for the remaining time of this work period. This will be the last week before the August recess, we expect.  It will be a busy week. Today we begin with a resolution regarding the anniversary of the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which Senator Harkin was just discussing. We will be voting on the adoption of that resolution at 5:30 p.m. today.  Also, we resume debate on the Defense authorization bill. As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed on the Defense bill, and under the consent agreement all first-degree amendments should be filed at the desk no later than 2 p.m. today.  Tomorrow we will have a very busy morning. Under the agreement reached last week, we have a series of votes lined up for Tuesday morning.
