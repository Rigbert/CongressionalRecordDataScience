 President, I am pleased to reintroduce the ``Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act.'' This legislation would help implement a consensus-driven regional land management plan by directing the Bureau of Land Management to exchange land with the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District in San Bernardino, California.  Before I continue, I would like to thank Senators Lisa Murkowski and Maria Cantwell, as well as their staffs, for their hard work to move this bill forward last Congress. With their assistance, this legislation passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in August 2018 and was included in a bipartisan public lands package.  I thank Senator Murkowski for introducing a bipartisan lands package bill this Congress and including this legislation in it. I look forward to working once again with Senator Murkowski, as well as the newly designated Ranking Member, Senator Manchin, to maintain our momentum and pass this bill as quickly as possible.  I also would like to express my gratitude to Representative Paul Cook and his staff for their continuing work and collaboration on this legislation. Lastly, I welcome working with Representative Cook and Representative Aguilar who are cosponsoring companion legislation in the House of Representatives. Lastly, I thank Senator Harris for cosponsoring this legislation.  This bill is an excellent example of how smart, sustainable, land planning can be accomplished through interagency cooperation. Federal and State agencies, private industry, and municipalities representing mining, flood control, water supply, wildlife conservation, and other interests all came to the table to develop a land management plan that accounts for the array of land uses in this area.  The land exchange facilitated by this bill is broadly supported, including by: County of San Bernardino, City of Redlands, City of Highland, San Bernardino Water Conservation District, San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, East Valley Water District, Endangered Habitats League, CEMEX Construction Materials Pacific, Robertson's Ready Mix, Inland Action.  This diverse group of entities formed the ``Wash Committee'' in 1993 to address mining and land management in the upper Santa Ana River wash area.  I applaud the Committee, along with federal, state and local stakeholders, for working together to develop a strategy for comprehensive land management planning for the area. This group has shown that through cooperation, it is possible to both protect the environment and support local business and community interests.  The land exchange between the San Bernardino Water Conservation District and the Bureau of Land Management will consolidate open space for conservation purposes and optimize the efficiency of mining operations and water conservation efforts.  The exchange will also set aside new land for conservation purposes near land already managed by BLM.  This bill will lead to increased habitat protection, groundwater recharge, and public access while allowing for the continued use of land and mineral resources.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act'' as soon as possible.  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
