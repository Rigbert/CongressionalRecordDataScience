President, today I am submitting a resolution calling for the creation of ``National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month'' to call attention to the need for information about health care coverage options. I am joined in this effort by Senator Collins of Maine.  A person's physical and mental well-being are fundamental to his or her ability to learn, to work, and to contribute to our society. For healthy communities, the health of our citizens is vital. It is a fact that people who have health insurance have better health; forty-four million Americans, however, do not enjoy the protection of health care coverage. This resolution calls for the promotion of a multifaceted educational effort about the importance of health care coverage; to increase awareness of the many health care coverage options already available; and to inform those who are eligible for public insurance programs on ways to access those programs.  This resolution alone will not provide insurance to the millions of Americans who need it. However, it will draw much-needed attention to an issue that touches every citizen in every state.
