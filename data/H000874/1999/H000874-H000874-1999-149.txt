Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  The gentleman from Michigan had an amendment to set a specific amount of damages for the two parties that were most directly affected here. I indicated to him that I would not be able to support that at this time, simply because I do not know what the amount of damages are. Quite obviously, on the floor it is difficult to assess the amount of damages of a claim, and there are thousands of claims, of course, against the government; and if we did that on a regular basis, it would be chaotic. That does not, however, diminish in any way the absolute justice in the amendment.  I am going to be working very, very hard to try to get to the bottom of this. And I say to my friends from Michigan and Georgia that their prosecution of this matter is obviously very vigorous, very focused, but very appropriate; and I look forward to working very closely with them so we can come to the bottom of this. And whatever we assess as the damages, we will work with them towards making sure that their constituents and people with whom they are involved are made whole to the extent they can be.
