., with the Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the final half. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to consideration of H.R. 4, 1099 repeal, with 1 hour of debate. Senators should expect two rollcall votes around noon on the Menendez amendment and passage of H.R. 4, as amended, if amended. We will recess following the votes until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly caucus meetings. We are working to reach an agreement on the small business bill and will notify Senators when additional votes are scheduled.  I am standing in for Majority Leader Reid, who has been called to the White House for the meeting with the President and the leadership, the Speaker and the leadership of the House of Representatives. The object of this is obviously to avert a government shutdown.  I listened carefully to the prayer from the Chaplain this morning. I don't know if we will need divine inspiration or divine interjection into this matter, but whatever it will take, I hope people of good will can come to an agreement. We are close. I don't think it is good for us as a government or as a Nation to see a shutdown of basic services that may cause inconvenience and hardship across America.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
