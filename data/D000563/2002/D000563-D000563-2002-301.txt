 When it comes to the issue of education, it is clear that this President has not done his homework.  Will the Senator from Massachusetts recount for this Senator, for the record, what happened in the debate and deliberation over No Child Left Behind? Is it not true that both parties came together in a bipartisan fashion, behind the President, to authorize and create the very programs the Senator is describing today? Is it not true that the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been on this Senate floor as a leader in education, worked hand in hand with the President to put in place this reform of public education across America with the promise it would be more than a press conference, that it would be a commitment to funding education to make certain these programs work? Is that not a fact?
