 President, today I am introducing a bill to clarify that children receiving health insurance under the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are eligible for free vaccines under the 1993 federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.  I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman Jane Harman who is introducing an identical bill in the House today.  We are introducing these bills because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has apparently interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as 580,000 children in California will lose their current eligibility to receive free vaccines, under California's new Healthy Families program.  The federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in 1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In 1997, as many 775,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or on Medicaid, received these vaccines. California received $60 million from the federal government to provide them.  Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than immunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--diseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows that vaccines are fundamental to children's good health.  Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the program, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can take to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold them from children who (1) have been getting them when they were uninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become insured.  According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of California's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the fact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Our uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 22 percent, the third highest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. As for children, 1.7 million or 18 percent of our children are without health insurance, compared to 13 percent nationally, according to UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need.  In creating the new children's health insurance program in California, the state chose to set up a program under which the state contracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible children care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, HHS appears to be interpreting this method of providing these children health insurance as making them ``insured,'' asdefined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for the federal vaccines. I disagree.  It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress made eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, children who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe that in defining the term ``insured'' Congress clearly meant private health insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's new Healthy Families program are participating in a federal-state, subsidized insurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families apply to the state for participation. They are not insured by a private, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the Vaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B). On February 23, the California Medical Association wrote to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, ``As they are participants in a federal and state-subsidized health program, these individuals are not ``insured'' for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).''  The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is administering the new program with the Department of Health Services, wrote to HHS on February 5, ``It is imperative that states like California, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same support and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at no cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.'' The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, ``More than half a million California children should not be deprived of vaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality. . . ,'' calling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.''  Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper childhood immunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help me keep our children healthy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2013       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMIT CHILDREN COVERED UNDER PRIVATE HEALTH                    INSURANCE UNDER A STATE CHILD HEALTH PLAN TO                    CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS UNDER THE                    VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.       (a) In General.--Section 1928(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396s(b)(2)(A)(ii)) is amended by      inserting ``, except that for purposes of this paragraph a      child who is only insured under title XXI shall be considered      as being not insured'' after ``not insured''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)      shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the      Balanced Budget Act of 1997.                                 ______                                       By
