President, In his two terms in the Senate, Bob Corker established a strong reputation as a visionary leader who offered innovative, commonsense solutions and developed an extraordinary expertise in foreign policy. He has served the people of Tennessee and of America with distinction and will always be a good friend.  He certainly was well-prepared when he came to the Senate in 2007. His early work on a charitable mission to Haiti inspired him to serve his home community of Chattanooga as an advocate for the disadvantaged. He built a successful business, providing jobs and opportunity to others. As mayor of Chattanooga, he led initiatives to improve education, reduce crime, grow the economy, and increase accountability in government. Those experiences and accomplishments guided his work in the Senate.  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker has been a powerful voice for U.S. global leadership and diplomacy, a complement to his visits to more than 70 nations since he took office in 2007. Although he has many accomplishments worth mentioning, I believe his leadership this year in enacting the BUILD Act, which modernizes American development finance to drive long-term economic growth in the developing world, may be among his most lasting contributions to American diplomacy and global security.  Senator Corker does not seek partisan advantage, but common ground. He has been an extraordinary Senator who always did what he believed was right. He has contributed greatly to our country and served his State well. I commend my colleague, Senator Bob Corker, for his outstanding service, and I thank him for his commitment, integrity, and friendship.                          ____________________
