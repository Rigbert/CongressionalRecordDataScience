 If you put everything else aside, you take all the detail away, you will find at its root--I am not suggesting that everybody who opposes this treaty doesn't believe everything they are saying; they do. But at its root, it comes down to a belief that has been the case in almost all the debates on treaties--and I am not suggesting that everybody has opposed every treaty. But they have argued one final piece, and that is simply that they lack faith in the political will of this country to do whatever is required. That has been the closing and legitimate argument raised. It was raised in START I, START II, SALT I, and SALT II.  The issue was whether or not we would so change the political climate that we lull ourselves to sleep. My friend from New Mexico remembers the argument that we would not have the political will to reengage. It is a legitimate argument. I do not give it short shrift. I think it is the single most serious argument against this treaty.  I will close by saying, as the kids say, I will put my experts up against your experts. I have more of them, numerically.  Mr. President, I think it is our turn. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bingaman.
