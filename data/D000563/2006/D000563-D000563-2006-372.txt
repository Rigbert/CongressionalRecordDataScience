President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                S. 3775       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``African Health Capacity      Investment Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act, the term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given      such term in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of      1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2(g)).     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The World Health Report, 2003, Shaping the Future,      states, ``The most critical issue facing health care systems      is the shortage of people who make them work.''.       (2) The World Health Report, 2006, Working Together for      Health, states, ``The unmistakable imperative is to      strengthen the workforce so that health systems can tackle      crippling diseases and achieve national and global health      goals. A strong human infrastructure is fundamental to      closing today's gap between health promise and health reality      and anticipating the health challenges of the 21st      century.''.       (3) The shortage of health personnel, including doctors,      nurses, pharmacists, counselors, paraprofessionals, and      trained lay workers is one of the leading obstacles to      fighting HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.       (4) The HIV/AIDS pandemic aggravates the shortage of health      workers through loss of life and illness among medical staff,      unsafe working conditions for medical personnel, and      increased workloads for diminished staff, while the shortage      of health personnel undermines efforts to prevent and provide      care and treatment for those with HIV/AIDS.       (5) Workforce constraints and inefficient management are      limiting factors in the treatment of tuberculosis, which      infects over \1/3\ of the global population.       (6) Over 1,200,000 people die of malaria each year. More      than 75 percent of these deaths occur among African children      under the age of 5 years old and the vast majority of these      deaths are preventable. The Malaria Initiative of President      George W. Bush seeks to reduce dramatically the disease      burden of malaria through both prevention and treatment.      Paraprofessionals can be instrumental in reducing mortality      and economic losses associated with malaria and other health      problems.       (7) For a woman in sub-Saharan Africa, the lifetime risk of      maternal death is 1 out of 16. In highly developed countries,      that risk is 1 out of 2,800. Increasing access to skilled      birth attendants is essential to reducing maternal and      newborn mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.       (8) The Second Annual Report to Congress on the progress of      the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief identifies the      strengthening of essential health care systems through health      care networks and infrastructure development as critical to      the sustainability of funded assistance by the United States      Government and states that ``outside resources for HIV/AIDS      and other development efforts must be focused on      transformational initiatives that are owned by host      nations''. This report further states, ``Alongside efforts to      support community capacity-building, enhancing the capacity      of health care and other systems is also crucial for      sustainability. Among the obstacles to these efforts in many      nations are inadequate human resources and capacity, limited      institutional capacity, and systemic weaknesses in areas such      as: quality assurance; financial management and accounting;      health networks and infrastructure; and commodity      distribution and control.''.       (9) Vertical disease control programs represent vital      components of United States foreign assistance policy, but      human resources for health planning and management often      demands a more systematic approach.       (10) Implementation of capacity-building initiatives to      promote more effective human resources management and      development may require an extended horizon to produce      measurable results, but such efforts are critical to      fulfillment of many internationally recognized objectives in      global health.       (11) The November 2005 report of the Working Group on      Global Health Partnerships for the High Level Forum on the      Health Millennium Development Goals entitled ``Best Practice      Principles for Global Health Partnership Activities at      Country Level'', raises the concern that the collective      impact of various global health programs now risks      ``undermining the sustainability of national development      plans, distorting national priorities, diverting scarce human      resources and/or establishing uncoordinated service delivery      structures'' in developing countries. This risk underscores      the need to coordinate international donor efforts for these      vital programs with one another and with recipient countries.       (12) The emigration of significant numbers of trained      health care professionals from sub-Saharan African countries      to the United States and other wealthier countries      exacerbates often severe shortages of health care workers,      undermines economic development efforts, and undercuts      national and international efforts to improve access to      essential health services in the region.       (13) Addressing this problem, commonly referred to as      ``brain drain'', will require increased investments in the      health sector by sub-Saharan African governments and by      international partners seeking to promote economic      development and improve health care and mortality outcomes in      the region.       (14) Virtually every country in the world, including the      United States, is experiencing a shortage of health workers.      The Joint Learning Initiative on Human Resources for Health      and Development estimates that the global shortage exceeds      4,000,000 workers. Shortages in sub-Saharan Africa, however,      are far more acute than in any other region of the world. The      World Health Report, 2006, states that ``[t]he exodus of      skilled professionals in the midst of so much unmet health      need places Africa at the epicentre of the global health      workforce crisis.''.       (15) Ambassador Randall Tobias, now the Director of United      States Foreign Assistance and Administrator of the United      States Agency for International Development, has stated that      there are more Ethiopian trained doctors practicing in      Chicago than in Ethiopia.       (16) According to the United Nations Development Programme,      Human Development Report 2003, approximately 3 out of 4      countries in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer than 20 physicians      per 100,000 people, the minimum ratio recommended by the      World Health Organization, and 13 countries have 5 or fewer      physicians per 100,000 people.       (17) Nurses play particularly important roles in sub-     Saharan African health care systems, but approximately \1/4\      of sub-Saharan African countries have fewer than 50 nurses      per 100,000 people or less than \1/2\ the staffing levels      recommended by the World Health Organization.       (18) Paraprofessionals can be trained more quickly than      nurses or doctors and are critically needed in sub-Saharan      Africa to meet immediate health care needs.       (19) Imbalances in the distribution of countries' health      workforces represents a global problem, but the impact is      particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa.       (20) In Malawi, for example, more than 95 percent of      clinical officers are in urban health facilities, and about      25 percent of nurses and 50 percent of physicians are in the      4 central hospitals of Malawi. Yet the population of Malawi      is estimated to be 87 percent rural.       (21) In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya,      thousands of qualified health professionals are employed      outside the health care field or are unemployed despite job      openings in the health sector in rural areas because poor      working and living conditions, including poor educational      opportunities for children, transportation, and salaries,      make such openings unattractive to candidates.       (22) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United      States stated, ``The scale of the public health crisis in      poor countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by      epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and      tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until      these scourges can be contained. Resources from the developed      world are necessary but will be effective only with honest      governance, which supports prevention programs and provides      effective local infrastructure.''.       (23) Public health deficiencies in sub-Saharan Africa and      other parts of the developing world reduce global capacities      to detect and respond to potential crises, such as an avian      flu pandemic.       (24) On September 28, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza      Rice declared that ``HIV/AIDS is not only a human tragedy of      enormous magnitude; it is also a threat to the stability of      entire countries and to the entire regions of the world.''.       (25) Foreign assistance by the United States that expands      local capacities, provides commodities or training, or builds      on and enhances community-based and national programs and      leadership can increase the impact, efficiency, and      sustainability of funded efforts by the United States.       (26) African health care professionals immigrate to the      United States for the same     set of reasons that have led millions of people to come to      this country, including the desire for freedom, for economic      opportunity, and for a better life for themselves and their      children, and the rights and motivations of these individuals      must be respected.       (27) Helping countries in sub-Saharan Africa increase      salaries and benefits of health care professionals, improve      working conditions, including the adoption of universal      precautions against workplace infection, improve management      of health care systems and institutions, increase the      capacity of health training institutions, and expand      education opportunities will alleviate some of the pressures      driving the migration of health care personnel from sub-     Saharan Africa.       (28) While the scope of the problem of dire shortfalls of      personnel and inadequacies of infrastructure in the sub-     Saharan African health systems is immense, effective and      targeted interventions to improve working conditions,      management, and productivity would yield significant      dividends in improved health care.       (29) Failure to address the shortage of health care      professionals and paraprofessionals, and the factors pushing      individuals to leave sub-Saharan Africa will undermine the      objectives of United States development policy and will      subvert opportunities to achieve internationally recognized      goals for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and other      diseases, in the reduction of child and maternal mortality,      and for economic growth and development in sub-Saharan      Africa.     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should help sub-Saharan African      countries that have not already done so to develop national      human resource plans within the context of comprehensive      country health plans involving a wide range of stakeholders;       (2) comprehensive, rather than piecemeal approaches to      advance multiple sustainable interventions will better enable      countries to plan for the number of health care workers they      need, determine whether they need to reorganize their health      workforce, integrate workforce planning into an overall      strategy to improve health system performance and impact,      better budget for health care spending, and improve the      delivery of health services in rural and other underserved      areas;       (3) in order to promote systemic, sustainable change, the      United States should seek, where possible, to strengthen      existing national systems in sub-Saharan African countries to      improve national capacities in areas including fiscal      management, training, recruiting and retention of health      workers, distribution of resources, attention to rural areas,      and education;       (4) because foreign-funded efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and      other diseases may also draw health personnel away from the      public sector in sub-Saharan African countries, the policies      and programs of the United States should, where practicable,      seek to work with national and community-based health      structures and seek to promote the general welfare and      enhance infrastructures beyond the scope of a single disease      or condition;       (5) paraprofessionals and community-level health workers      can play a key role in prevention, care, and treatment      services, and in the more equitable and effective      distribution of health resources, and should be integrated      into national health systems;       (6) given the current personnel shortages in sub-Saharan      Africa, paraprofessionals represent a critical potential      workforce in efforts to reduce the burdens of malaria,      tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other deadly and debilitating      diseases;       (7) it is critically important that the governments of sub-     Saharan African countries increase their own investments in      education and health care;       (8) international financial institutions have an important      role to play in the achievement of internationally agreed      upon health goals, and in helping countries strike the      appropriate balance in encouraging effective public      investments in the health and education sectors, particularly      as foreign assistance in these areas scales up, and promoting      macroeconomic stability;       (9) public-private partnerships are needed to promote      creative contracts, investments in sub-Saharan African      educational systems, codes of conduct related to recruiting,      and other mechanisms to alleviate the adverse impacts on sub-     Saharan African countries caused by the migration of health      professionals;       (10) colleges and universities of the United States, as      well as other members of the private sector, can play a      significant role in promoting training in medicine and public      health in sub-Saharan Africa by establishing or supporting      in-country programs in sub-Saharan Africa through twinning      programs with educational institutions in sub-Saharan Africa      or through other in-country mechanisms;       (11) given the substantial numbers of African immigrants to      the United States working in the health sector, the United      States should enact and implement measures to permit      qualified aliens and their family members that are legally      present in the United States to work temporarily as health      care professionals in developing countries or in other      emergency situations, as in S. 2611, of the 109th Congress,      as passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006;       (12) the President, acting through the United States      Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should      exercise the voice and vote of the United States--       (A) to ameliorate the adverse impact on less developed      countries of the migration of health personnel;       (B) to promote voluntary codes of conduct for recruiters of      health personnel; and       (C) to promote respect for voluntary agreements in which      individuals, in exchange for individual educational      assistance, have agreed either to work in the health field in      their home countries for a given period of time or to repay      such assistance;       (13) the United States, like countries in other parts of      the world, is experiencing a shortage of medical personnel in      many occupational specialties, and the shortage is      particularly acute in rural and other underserved areas of      the country; and       (14) the United States should expand training opportunities      for health personnel, expand incentive programs such as      student loan forgiveness for Americans willing to work in      underserved areas, and take other steps to increase the      number of health personnel in the United States.     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO INCREASE HUMAN CAPACITY IN THE HEALTH                    SECTOR IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961      (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following new section:     ``SEC. 135.
