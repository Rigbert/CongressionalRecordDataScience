Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the food industry is our Nation's largest private sector employer, providing jobs to some 12 million Americans. Today, that industry is threatened by an array of legal claims alleging that it should be liable to pay damages for the overconsumption of its legal products by others. H.R. 339, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, is designed to foreclose frivolous obesity-related lawsuits against the food industry.  From June 20 to the 22nd of last year, personal injury lawyers from across the country gathered at a conference designed to ``encourage and support litigation against the food industry.'' Attendees were required to sign an affidavit in which they agreed to keep the information they learned confidential and to refrain from consulting with or working for the food industry before December 31, 2006, apparently setting a deadline for bringing that vital industry to its knees in a nationally coordinated legal attack.  The hatred of some lawyers for the food industry is stark. Ralph Nader, for example, has compared food companies to terrorists, saying that the double cheeseburger is ``a weapon of mass destruction.''  H.R. 339 prohibits obesity or weight-gain-related claims against the food industry, with reasonable exceptions, including those in which a State or Federal law was broken and as a result the person gained weight, and those in which a company violates an expressed contract or warranty. Also, because this bill only applies to claims based on ``weight gain'' or ``obesity,'' lawsuits could go forward under the bill, if, for example, someone gets sick from a tainted hamburger.  The bill also contains essential provisions governing the conduct of legal proceedings. H.R. 339 includes the very same discovery provisions designed to prevent fishing expeditions that are already a part of our Federal securities laws. It also contains provisions that appropriately require that a complaint set out the fact as to why the case should be allowed to proceed.  Some trial lawyers are mounting an attack on personal responsibilityagainst the advice of the Nation's leading weight-loss experts. Listen to the insightful words of Dr. Gerard Musante, a clinical psychologist with training at Duke University Medical Center, who has worked for more than 30 years with thousands of obese patients. He is the founder of Structure House, a residential weight-loss facility in Durham, North Carolina. Dr. Musante said the following at a Senate hearing on this legislation:  ``Through working with obese patients, I have learned that the worst thing one can do is to blame an outside force to get themselves `off the hook,' to say it's not their fault and that they are a victim. Congress has rightly recognized the danger of allowing Americans to continue blaming others for the obesity epidemic. It is imperative that we prevent lawsuits from being filed against any industry for answering consumer demands. The fact that we are addressing the issue here today is a step in the right direction.''  The chairman of the American Council for Fitness and Nutrition, Susan Finn, has also written that ``if you are obese, you don't need a lawyer; you need to see your doctor, a nutritionist and a physical trainer. Playing the courtroom blame game won't make anyone thinner or healthier.''  Even the Los Angeles Times, which rarely agrees with people on this side of the aisle, has editorialized against such lawsuits, stating, ``People shouldn't get stuffed, but this line of litigation should.''  On the other hand, the lobbying organization for personal injury attorneys, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which opposes this legislation, has published a litigation instruction manual that openly belittles jurors who believe in ``personal responsibility.'' According to that instruction manual, ``Often a juror with a high need for personal responsibility fixates on the responsibility of the plaintiff. According to these jurors, a plaintiff must be accountable for his or her own conduct. The personal responsibility jurors tend to espouse traditional family values. Often these jurors have strong religious beliefs. The only solution is to identify these jurors and exclude them from the jury.''  Besides threatening to erode values of personal responsibility, the legal campaign against the food industry threatens the separation of powers.                              {time}  1230  Nationally coordinated lawsuits seek to accomplish through litigation that which has not been achieved by legislation and the democratic process. As one mastermind behind lawsuits against the food industry has stated, ``If the legislatures won't legislate, then the trial lawyers will litigate.'' In order to preserve the separation of powers and support the principle of personal responsibility and to protect the largest private sector employer of the United States, let us pass H.R. 339.  Mr. Chairman, at this time, I will insert in the Record jurisdictional letters the gentleman from Texas (Chairman Barton) and I have exchanged regarding this legislation.                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: On January 28, 2004, the      Committee on the Judiciary ordered reported H.R. 339, the      Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act. As ordered      reported by your Committee, this legislation contains a      number of provisions that could fall within the jurisdiction      of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.       Specifically, I believe that H.R. 339 would impose a new      scienter requirement with respect to certain enforcement      actions taken by agencies and statutes within our      jurisdiction. This requirement could fundamentally alters how      agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Food      and Drug Administration, enforce violations of laws they      administer.       Recognizing your interest in bringing this legislation      before the House expeditiously, the Committee on Energy and      Commerce agrees not to seek a sequential referral of the      bill. In exchange, you have agreed to eliminate our      jurisdictional concerns with a floor amendment that expressly      eliminates lawsuits brought under the Federal Trade      Commission Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      from the definition of ``qualified civil liability action''      under the legislation.       By agreeing not to seek a sequential referral, the      Committee on Energy and Commerce does not waive its      jurisdiction over the bill as your committee ordered it      reported. In addition, the Committee on Energy and Commerce      reserves its right to seek conferees on any provisions within      its jurisdiction which are considered in any House-Senate      conference.       I request that you include this letter and your response as      part of the Congressional Record during consideration of this      bill by the House.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2004.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC 20515       Dear Chairman Barton: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 339, the ``Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption      Act.'' I appreciate your willingness not to seek a sequential      referral of the bill.       I strongly disagree with your assertion of jurisdiction      over the bill. I do not believe that H.R. 339, as reported,      contains provisions that affect lawsuits by the Federal Trade      Commission or the Food and Drug Administration, and the      drafters did not intend such suits. Nor do I agree with the      description of the bill in the second paragraph of your      letter. However, I will include language (a copy of which is      attached) in a manager's amendment on the floor to make it      clear that such suites are not precluded or otherwise      affected by the bill. I will also include language our staffs      have discussed in the Committee's report (a copy of which is      attached) to further clarify this point.       By agreeing to this resolution of this matter, the      Committee on the Judiciary does not acknowledge that the      Committee on Energy and Commerce had jurisdiction over      provisions of the bill. In addition, the Committee on the      Judiciary does not waive any of its jurisdictional claims in      these matters.       I will include your letter and this response in the      Committee's report on H.R. 339 and in the Congressional      Record during the consideration of this bill in the House. I      appreciate your cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                       F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.     Chairman.                                  ____                           AMENDMENT LANGUAGE       Strike the current Sec. 4(5)(C) (the language that excludes      suits relating to adulterated foods) and insert:       ``(C) Such term shall not be construed to include an action      brought under the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41      et seq.) or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.      301 et seq.).''                            REPORT LANGUAGE       After the Committee on the Judiciary's markup of H.R. 339,      the Committee on Energy and Commerce expressed concerns that      the definition of ``qualified civil liability action'' might      be construed to include actions under the Federal Trade      Commission Act or actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and      Cosmetic Act. The Committee on the Judiciary did not intend      to include such actions in the definition and did not believe      that the actions were included within its clear terms.      Notwithstanding that, both Committees agree on the policy      that such actions should not be precluded by H.R. 339. To      make this policy agreement abundantly clear, a manager's      amendment to be offered during floor consideration of H.R.      339 will strike the current language in Sec. 4(5)(C)      excluding adulteration suits and replace it with language      stating explicitly that the definition shall not be construed      to include actions under the Federal Trade Commission Act or      the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Committee on      the Judiciary believes that this language will resolve the      practical concerns of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
