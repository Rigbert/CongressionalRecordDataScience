 President, for the information of all Senators, we are now going to move to a Coburn amendment. We will have 2 minutes equally divided and a vote. We are very close to finishing this bill. There are some amendments in a managers' package on which we are moving rapidly forward. We have a couple of Senators who may require a vote on an amendment and final passage. In the next vote, we are going to try to work out a final agreement on whether to have those votes tonight or the first thing in the morning. But if we can get a final list of amendments, we will let all Senators know, by the end of the next vote, what the path forward is, following this vote.  I believe the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak on this amendment.
