Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  House Republicans promised the American people that, if granted the majority, we would vote to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare. Let's face it. ObamaCare is nothing like what was promised. Former Speaker Pelosi said we would have to pass the bill to find out what was in it. Rest assured, we found out.  Rather than reform health care, this law epitomizes Washington at its very worst--intrusive mandates, higher costs, red tape, unaffordable spending, taxes on employers and families, and the control of personal health care decisions by boards, bureaus, and agencies in Washington. Let's just consider the many broken promises.  President Obama promised that his reforms would lower family premiums by $2,500 by the end of his first term, yet the cost of an employee-sponsored family plan increased to $15,000 in 2011. The CBO projects, if we allow the rest of ObamaCare's mandates to kick in, premiums will rise further.  The President told us over and over that if you liked your health care plan you could keep it, yet the law pushes employers to drop coverage. The CBO estimates that up to 20 million American workers will lose their plans under ObamaCare.  The President said his law would cost a mere $900 billion as if spending nearly $1 trillion on a new program were thrifty.                              {time}  1500  Yet, when it is fully implemented, ObamaCare is estimated to cost taxpayers $2.6 trillion over a decade. The President promised to make Medicare stronger. Instead, ObamaCare raided $575 billion from Medicare to pay for new programs and entitlement expansions.  The President pledged that he would not raise taxes for households with incomes under $250,000. Yet ObamaCare includes 21 new tax increases that will cost taxpayers roughly $800 billion over the next decade. The IRS will impose new taxes on medical devices, prescription drugs, health coverage, high-premium health plans. The agency will place new restrictions on health saving accounts and flexible spending accounts. Employers will face a tax for failing to provide health plans approved by HHS and a new surtax on investment.  The President promised American taxpayers that they would not been forced to fund abortions and our conscience rights would be protected. Yet HHS is moving forward with a mandate that requires religious institutions to violate their principles or pay a steep fine. Or is the fine on faith going to be considered a tax as well, just like the individual mandate? The Supreme Court made clear that the mandate is a massive new tax, one that will primarily be levied on middle class households.  Repeal is also the only way to honor and restore the promises the President wisely made but foolishly broke. The Supreme Court rendered its diagnosis, but the American people will be offering a second opinion. We promised the American people that we would work to repeal this terrible law, and that is a promise we are keeping.  I reserve the balance of my time.
