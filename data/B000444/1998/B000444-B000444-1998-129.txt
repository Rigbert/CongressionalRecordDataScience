 President, I must object. I object because what the majority leader proposes is to add a very significant piece of substantive drug legislation relating to the crack-powder cocaine sentencing issues.  I note that the Judiciary Committee has not reported this legislation. This legislation is subject to significant debate. For example, the costs of the most recent proposal offered by Senators Abraham and Allard are very significant.  According to the Justice Department--the 5-year cost estimate to our federal prison budget is more than $790 million. The 10-year estimate--more than $1.9 billion.  This is just one example of the significant policy implications of this proposal. Frankly, the Judiciary Committee must be given the opportunity to report this legislation before we debate this on the floor.  In contrast, we have fully debated the drug director legislation introduced last summer. The Judiciary Committee has debated it, the committee held hearings, the committee developed a bipartisan re-authorization bill, the committee reported the bill last November, since then we have worked with Senator McCain and the Armed Services Committee to work out their issues with this bill.  The bottom lines--we have a bipartisan, fully debated, bill; and we need to get the drug director's office re-authorized.  There are many particular, specific drug policy issues to debate. Crack-cocaine is just one of them. Youth drug abuse, youth violence, drug interdiction, and many more all need to be debated.  But, let's keep our eye on the ball, and let's re-authorize General McCaffrey's office. The General needs our support.
