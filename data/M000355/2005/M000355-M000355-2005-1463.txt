 President, we as senators have an enormous amount of work to do for the American people. For example, while our economy is strong, unfortunately gas prices are way too high. People are feeling those costs every time they fill up at the pump. This Senate needs to seriously address a long-term energy policy for this country, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  We have serious work to do to reform America's tax code, so it is fairer for all Americans, and leads to a more robust economy.  We have undertaken a debate on how to reform Social Security so it is stronger and more secure for future generations, as it has served millions so well already over the last 70 years.  Our road system needs improving. Millions of Americans take to the roads everyday to get to work and keep this country moving. It's critical the Senate pass a highway bill. In short, we have a formidable agenda before us. We welcome that challenge. I think that our constituents sent us here to get things done, not just to sit in these fancy chairs. But the Nation's business may soon come to an abrupt halt.  In the face of so much important work to be done, sadly, my Democratic friends on the other side of the aisle are promising to pull the plug on this chamber, and thus shut down the Government. Just because a majority of Senators want to restore the 200-year-old norms and traditions of the Senate, by granting a President's judicial nominees who have majority support the simple courtesy of an up-or-down vote, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are threatening to stop this Senate dead in its tracks.  An energy bill to begin to address the high cost of gasoline and reduce our dependence on foreign oil? They would say: Forget it.  A highway bill, to begin desperately needed repairs on bridges and roads across the country? They would say: Not a chance.  These and other priorities will not happen if the Democrats shut down the Government. Because they cannot have what no Senate minority has ever had in 200 years--the requirement of a supermajority for confirmation--they threaten to shut the Government down.  The American people by now must rightly be asking, ``How did we get in such a mess?''  It was not by accident. The Democrats did not stumble into this position. It was carefully conceived.  Four years ago, in May of 2001, the New York Times reported that 42 of the Senate's then-50 Democrats attended a private weekend retreat in Farmington, PA, to discuss a plan of attack against the President's judicial nominees.  According to this article, the unprecedented obstruction by the other side is not based on checks and balances, or the rights of the minority. It is about ideology. The Democrats invited speakers to their retreat who warned them that President Bush was planning to, ``pack the courts with staunch conservatives.''  Now, here's the clincher. According to the New York Times, one participant said:       It was important for the Senate to change the ground rules,      and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because      they are scholarly or erudite.  Let me make sure that last part came through loud and clear. The Democrats are accusing the Republicans, who merely want to restore the 200-year-tradition of giving judicial nominees with majority support an up-or-down vote, of some kind of power grab. Yet here is a 4-year-old admission that it is the Democrats who are clearly out to ``change the ground rules.'' They knew what they were doing. This was thoroughly premeditated.  That quote says it all. If a minority of the Senate does not get its way in obstructing judges from serving on our Nation's Federal courts, they will ``change the ground rules.'' They will shut down the Government. I say to my friends, I wouldn't take the extreme step of shutting the government down.  I ask unanimous consent to have this New York Times article of May 1, 2001 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2001]                 Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight                           (By Neil A. Lewis)       President Bush has yet to make his first nominee to a      federal court and no one knows whether anyone will retire      from the Supreme Court this summer, an event that would lead      to a high-stakes confirmation battle.       Nonetheless, the Senate's Democrats and Republicans are      already engaged in close-quarters combat over how to deal      with the eventual nominees from the Bush White House.      Democrats in particular are trying to show some muscle as      they insist that they will not simply stand aside and confirm      any nominees they deem right-wing ideologues.       ``What we're trying to do is set the stage and make sure      that both the White House and the Senate Republicans know      that we     expect to have significant input in the process,'' Senator      Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior Democrat, said in an      interview. ``We're simply not going to roll over.''       Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private      retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal      topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the      White House on judicial nominees.       The senators listened to a panel composed of Prof. Laurence      H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Prof. Cass M. Sunstein of the      University of Chicago Law School and Marcia R. Greenberger,      the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the      need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.      The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that      the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they      said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr. Bush was      planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.       ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the      ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone      just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who      attended said.       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,      then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday      morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any      Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who      spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because      some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two      Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the      nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney      general.       Senators Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph R.      Biden Jr. of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft      selection, impeding the early campaign against the      nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted      against the nomination.       The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom      that Republicans are considering changing, which governs      whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home      State. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee      have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy''      that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip      with the committee.       On Friday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking      Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. Schumer sent a      letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats      insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially      given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the      Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick      Cheney is able to break any tie.       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,      told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration      will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they      should expect to name judges from their State.''       Mr. Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the      process but, in the end, would not block any significant      number of nominees.       Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of      the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13      circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some      of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench      is shaped in the next 4 or 8 years, scholars say, could have      a profound effect on issues like affirmative action, abortion      rights and the lengths to which the government may go in      aiding parochial schools.       Mr. Bush is expected to announce his first batch of      judicial nominees in the next several days, and it is likely      to include several staunch conservatives as well as some      women and members of minorities, administration officials      have said. Among those Mr. Bush may put forward to important      Federal appeals court positions are such conservatives as      Jeffrey S. Sutton, Peter D. Keisler, Representative      Christopher Cox of California and Miguel Estrada.       The first group of nominees, which may number more than two      dozen, is part of an effort to fill the 94 vacancies on the      Federal bench while the Republicans still control the Senate.       But it remains unclear if there will be a Supreme Court      vacancy at the end of the court's term in July. Speculation      on possible retirements has focused on Chief Justice William      H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul      Stevens. But in recent days, associates of Justice O'Connor      have signaled that she wants it known that she will not      retire after this term.  Mr. McCONNELL. the record about who is out to change what is not merely confined to the statements from this article. No, we have 4 years of behavior to corroborate these statements.  Soon after that Democrat retreat, and continuing to this day, we have seen our Democratic friends make major changes in the Senate's ground rules for confirming qualified judicial nominees.  For example, almost immediately the Democrats began to litmus-test judges in order to strain out the ones they considered too conservative. When they controlled the Judiciary Committee in the 107th Congress, they even held hearings on using ideology in the confirmation process in an effort to legitimize their practice of litmus-testing judges.  The Democrats have widely-applied their litmus tests. They have filibustered almost 1 circuit court nominee for every 3 they have confirmed. As a result, in his first term, President George W. Bush had only 69 percent of his circuit-court nominees confirmed. That is the lowest confirmation percentage of any President since World War II.  In addition, the Democrats began to demand that they in effect get to co-nominate judges along with the President. The Constitution clearly provides in Article II, Section 2, that the President, and the President alone, nominates judges. The Senate is empowered to give ``advice'' and ``consent.'' The Democrats, however, have sought to redefine ``advice and consent'' to mean ``co-nominate.''  President Bush, rightly so, has not acceded to this attempt to upset our Constitution's separation of powers. Unfortunately, the administration of justice is suffering. In the case of the Sixth Circuit, for example, Democratic Senators are willing to let one-fourth of the circuit seats sit empty in order to enforce their demands. As a result, the Sixth Circuit--which includes Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan--is far and away the slowest circuit in the Nation. My constituents and the other residents of the Sixth Circuit are the victims. Thanks to the other side's obstruction, Kentuckians know too well that justice delayed means justice denied.  The Democrats have changed other ground rules in the confirmation process. But all these changes were just precursors to what happened in the last Congress. In 2003, Democrats instituted the ultimate change in the Senate's ground rules: they began to obstruct, via the filibuster, on a systematic and partisan basis, well-qualified nominees who commanded majority support. That is unprecedented in over 200 years of Senate history.  Republicans did not filibuster judicial nominees, even though it would have been easy for us to do so. Let me give you the names of some very controversial Democratic judicial nominees whom we could have easily filibustered, during the Clinton and Carter years: Richard Paez, William Fletcher, Susan Oki Molloway, Abner Mikva. None of these nominees had 60 votes for confirmation.  Other controversial Democratic nominees, like Marsha Berzon, barely had 60 votes for confirmation, but we did not whip our caucus to try to filibuster them either. Indeed, just the opposite occurred: Senators Lott and Hatch, to their great credit, argued that we ought not to set such a precedent, no matter ow strongly we oppose the nominee. I remember voting for cloture myself, voting to shut off debate on Paez and Berzon both, and then voting against them when they got their up-or-down vote, which they were entitled to get.  Our friends, the Democrats, are driving a double standard: The nominees of a Democratic President only had to garner majority support, as had every other judicial nominee in history until Democrats sought to change the ground rules. But nominees of a Republican President have to get a much higher level of support. That is the ultimate in hypocrisy.  Because the majority may seek to restore the norms and traditions of the Senate--norms and traditions that my Democratic friends have upset--the Democrats are now threatening to shut down the Government. That is not right.  We need to recommit ourselves to the 200 year principle that in a democracy an up-or-down vote should be given to a President's judicial nominees. It is simple. It is fair. It has been that way for over 2 centuries. And it's served us well.  I yield the floor.
