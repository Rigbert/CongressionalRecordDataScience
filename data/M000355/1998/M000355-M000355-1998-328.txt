       The states' tobacco lawyers demand, with more brass than      plausibility, that their fees be treated as an island immune      from Congress' general jurisdiction over the settlement.  Now, the Faircloth amendment agrees with Mr. Will's analysis and simply says that no trial lawyer's sweetheart deal is an island. I firmly believe that we cannot settle theseState deals and create a sweeping Federal regulatory scheme for tobacco without also regulating the fees.  Let me repeat something that others have forcefully said. No bill should leave the Senate of the United States that does not deal with the unjust enrichment of lawyers contained in this bill.  Let me read another piece that makes similar points. The article appeared in a home State newspaper, the Lexington Herald-Leader:       Question: If on election day you were asked to chose      between a political candidate who promised to work for a      reasonable salary, and another candidate who wanted to be      paid 25 percent of the government's proceeds, an amount which      could reach billions of dollars, which candidate would you      vote for?       Many voters thought they were voting for the former, but      are getting the latter. That's because several dozen states      have chosen to farm out legal work to lawyers who will be      paid not for the number of hours they work but a percentage      of the proceeds from lawsuits.       Advocates for trial lawyers give several reasons why      lawyers should be paid large contingency fees instead of for      work performed, like other state employees.       First, they say contingency fees are the only way states      can afford to hire top-notch lawyers. Nonsense. Tobacco      litigation pits 40 states with extensive revenues (the Texas      state government alone collected $ 40.4 billion in 1996,      which is about $ 4 billion more than the domestic and      international tobacco revenues of the largest tobacco      company, Philip Morris, for the same year) against tobacco      companies who pay their lawyers by salary or by the hour. If      tobacco companies can do it, so can the states. Some have:      Maine has capped the fees for its lawyers at $ 150 per hour,      and Vermont's lawyers, in the case of a national deal, will      be paid no more than $ 200,000.                           *   *   *   *   *       Private lawyers will likely reap tens of billions from      tobacco settlements. After they do, won't they try to keep      this cash cow going? If lawyers can make billions saying that      states are due dollars for the adverse health effects of      tobacco, won't they want to say the same about junk food? Or      liquor? Or fast cars?       The answer is: Yes. And that's why private profit-making      has no place in government decision-making. Government      policies should be based on their merits, not on      opportunities to give private lawyers billion-dollar profits.  Mr. President, I am proud to say that every state did not go out and cut a sweetheart deal with their trial lawyer contributors. Some states took the high road in this deal and refused to allow the conflict-of-interest contingency fee arrangement to taint the deal.  Let me read to you a piece from the Seattle Times that explains the rationale of these states that took the road less traveled:       Using the state's own attorneys has permitted California      Attorney General Dan Lungren to claim high ground and dismiss      suggestions that the lawsuits were motivated by the      plaintiff's bar.       The fact that we are not using outside counsel lends a lot      more credibility to the legitimacy of these claims,'' said      Tracy Buck Walsh, special assistant attorney general, who      is managing California's case.       Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton, who also had the      political backing of the governor, had another motive: She      said she is philosophically opposed to her state using      contingency-fee attorneys because these outside counsel are      motivated by more than the pursuit of justice.       ``We tend to be more objective than private counsel who are      employed on a contingency basis and who maintain their own      personal financial interest in the outcome of the      litigation,'' said Norton, a Republican. ``It gives them      different motives.''       The state of West Virginia's one-page contingency-fee      contract agreeing to pay one-third of the recovery, by far      the largest contemplated by any state, was thrown out of      court as unconstitutional.       In arguing against the contract, tobacco-industry attorneys      suggested that it was unethical because it compromised the      independence and impartiality of the quasi-judicial role      vested in state prosecutors.       ``The litigation team is wielding the coercive, regulatory      and punitive powers of the state,'' tobacco attorney Robert      King argued. Such a contract ``permits the power of the state      to be exercised by attorneys with a direct financial stake in      the exercise of that power.''  The bottom line here is that the National Lawyer Enrichment Deal smells like an under-the-table arrangement cut in smoke-filled rooms.  The states have made deals with their lawyer friends to engage in what has been aptly referred to as ``prosecution for profit''--and we can not simply bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we have no duty to regulate these deals.  In the words of the Weekly Standard:       Bribing judges was long ago made a crime. Bounty hunters      were banished and state prosecutors put on salary for a      reason--to remove any financial stake in their prosecution.      Contingency-fee lawyers have a stake in litigation that      reaches grotesque proportions. And now these lawyers are      being deputized by attorneys general to prosecute under the      cloak of state authority.       When these lawyers are making large political contributions      to the attorneys general who hire them to sue, in lawsuits      that have contingency fees running literally hundreds of      millions of dollars, prosecution for profit takes on a whole      new dimension. Such conflicts of interest once were      considered a threat to justice. Indeed they were. Indeed they      are.  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Faircloth's reasonable and fairminded amendment. Frankly, I had hoped the previous amendment offered by Senator Faircloth at $250 an hour would be approved. But certainly, $1,000 an hour, when the average American entering the work force at minimum wage is making $5.15 an hour and when the average lawyer in America is making $48 an hour, is not unreasonable.  The amendment says it is perfectly OK to make a great living in America--as a trial lawyer or in any other legal occupation--but it is not OK to cut sweetheart deals, ``prosecute for profit,'' and use the massive, coercive, and punitive power of the State to transfer private and public dollars to make a few friends into instant billionaires.  I yield the floor.
