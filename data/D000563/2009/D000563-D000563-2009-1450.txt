We have to increase demand for American products to resuscitate our economy. And we have to reduce the financial burden that our children will assume. We need to let consumers keep more of their own money without reducing the revenues that the government needs to pay for essential services.  In addition, we need to stop the reckless lending that brought us this economic disaster.  Today, I introduce the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act to try to get at each of these goals. My bill sets a ceiling of 36 percent annualized interest rates on consumer credit.  Consumers spend approximately $27 billion every year on predatory payday loans, high-cost overdraft loans, and hugely expensive refund anticipation loans. Imagine if a portion of that $270 billion 10-year cost of credit could be redirected towards buying American goods and services. The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that a strong federal usury cap would save low-income borrowers $5 billion each year.  And, in an era that has called for trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out banks and jumpstart economic demand, this proposal costs the taxpayers nothing.  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would establish a new Federal annualized fee and interest rate calculation--the FAIR--and institute a 36-percent cap for all types of consumer credit.  In 2006, Congress enacted a Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for certain credit products marketed to military servicemembers and their families, which curbed payday, car title, and tax refund lending around military bases. My bill would expand on that premise to include all types of credit for all borrowers.  If a lender can't make money on 36 percent interest, then maybe the loan shouldn't be made.  Although I hope to gain widespread support for this bill from responsible lenders, I understand that some of the financial service firms in this country will be uneasy with a broad bill establishing a high interest rate cap. I hope this bill can open an honest conversation about consumer credit rates.  My opening question in that conversation is this: what services do you provide for which you can justify charging your customers more than 36 percent in annual interest?  Fifteen States and the District of Columbia have already enacted broadly applicable usury laws that protect borrowers from high-cost payday loans and many other forms of credit, while 34 States and the District of Columbia have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or less for one or more types of consumer credit.  But there is a problem with this State-by-State approach. Those limits can sometimes be evaded by out-of-State lenders that are based in States that have weaker usury laws.  Various Federal and State loopholes allow unscrupulous lenders to charge cash-strapped consumers pay 400 percent annual interest for payday loans on average, 300 percent annual interest for car title loans, up to 3500 percent annual interest for bank overdraft loans, between 50 and 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual interest for credit cards that charge junk fees.  Consider 66-year-old Rosa Mobley, who lives on Social Security and a small pension.  The Chicago Tribune reports that Ms. Mobley took out a car title loan--a type of payday loan in which the borrowers put up their cars as collateral--for $1,000. Ms. Mobley was charged 300 percent interest.  She wound up paying more than $4,000 over 28 months and at the time of the report was struggling just to get by.  This bill would require that all fees and finance changes be included in the new usury rate calculation and would require all lending to conform to the limit, thereby eliminating the many loopholes that have allowed these predatory practices to flourish.  It would not preempt stronger State laws, it would allow State attorneys general to help enforce this new rate cap, and it would provide for strongcivil penalties to deter lender violations.  I included in this bill the flexibility for responsible lenders to replace payday loans that some borrowers once relied on with reasonably priced, small-dollar loan alternatives. The bill allows lenders to exceed the 36 percent usury cap for one-time application fees that cover the costs of setting up a new customer account and for processing costs such as late charges and insufficient funds fees.  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would eliminate predatory lenders, but it also would help borrowers make smarter choices.  Congress established the Truth in Lending Act over 40 years ago to help consumers compare the costs of borrowing when buying a home, a car, or other items by establishing a standard Annual Percentage Rate that all lenders should advertise.  My first mentor in politics, the late Senator Paul Douglas from my home State of Illinois, said all the way back in 1963 that too often lenders:     compound the camouflaging of credit by loading on all sorts      of extraneous fees, such as exorbitant fees for credit life      insurance, excessive fees for credit investigation, and all      sorts of loan processing fees which rightfully should be      included in the percentage rate statement so that any      percentage rate quoted is meaningless and deceptive.  That was before anyone had ever heard of ``subprime lending.''  Unfortunately, as the use of credit has exploded and as the complexity of the credit products offered by lenders has become mind-boggling, Congress and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions since the passage of Truth in Lending to weaken the APR as a tool for comparison shopping. Today, many fees can be excluded from the rate that is given to borrowers. The APR no longer gives consumers the convenient and accurate information it once did. One payday lender in Pennsylvania used the various exclusions to disclose what was really a 400 percent APR as 6 percent.  This bill would give consumers a way to accurate compare credit options, by requiring that the new FAIR calculation be disclosed both for open-end credit plans such as credit cards and for closed-end credit such as mortgages and payday loans.  The bill is supported by 100 groups at the national and local levels, including the Consumer Federation of American, the National Consumer Law Center, the Center for Responsible Lending, USPIRG, and Consumers Union, and I include a copy of their letter of support for the Congressional Record.  As Congress considers some very complicated economic challenges, I urge my colleagues to also consider simple solutions. We can help give more money to American consumers today without borrowing money that must be repaid tomorrow. Let's start by eliminating some of the worst abuses in lending by establishing a reasonable fee and interest rate cap.  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 500       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from      Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest      rates in America since colonial times;       (2) at the State level, 15 states and the District of      Columbia have enacted broadly applicable usury laws that      protect borrowers from high-cost payday loans and many other      forms of credit, while 34 states and the District of Columbia      have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or less for      1 or more types of consumer credit;       (3) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a      Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members      and their families for covered credit products, as defined by      the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title,      and tax refund lending around military bases;       (4) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory      lending, high cost lending persists in all 50 States due to      loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms      of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates      permitted by preemption;       (5) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap,      consumers annually pay approximately $17,500,000,000 for      high-cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,600,000,000 for      storefront and online payday loans, and nearly $900,000,000      for tax refund anticipation loans;       (6) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent      annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest      for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft      loans, 50 to 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by      expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual      percentage interest for credit cards that charge junk fees;       (7) a national maximum interest rate that includes all      forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to      eliminate such predatory lending; and       (8) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small      dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment      schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be      encouraged.     SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.       The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is      amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 141.

      ``(B) all fees which constitute a finance charge, as      defined by rules of the Board in accordance with this title;       ``(C) credit insurance premiums, whether optional or      required; and       ``(D) all charges and costs for ancillary products sold in      connection with or incidental to the credit transaction.       ``(2) Tolerances.--       ``(A) In general.--With respect to a credit obligation that      is payable in at least 3 fully amortizing installments over      at least 90 days, the term `fee and interest rate' does not      include--       ``(i) application or participation fees that in total do      not exceed the greater of $30 or, if there is a limit to the      credit line, 5 percent of the credit limit, up to $120, if--       ``(I) such fees are excludable from the finance charge      pursuant to section 106 and regulations issued thereunder;

and       ``(B) if the credit account has been open less than 1 year,      the fee and interest rate shall be calculated based upon the      total of all fees and finance charges described in subsection      (b)(1) charged by the creditor since the plan was opened,      divided by the average daily balance, and multiplied by the      quotient of 12 divided by the number of full months that the      credit plan has been in existence.       ``(2) Other credit plans.--For purposes of this section, in      calculating the fee and interest rate, the Board shall      require the method of calculation of annual percentage rate      specified in section 107(a)(1), except that the amount      referred to in that section 107(a)(1) as the `finance charge'      shall include all fees, charges, and payments described in      subsection (b)(1).       ``(3) Adjustments authorized.--The Board may make      adjustments to the calculations in paragraphs (1) and (2),      but the primary goals of such adjustment shall be to protect      consumers and to ensure that the 36 percent     fee and interest rate limitation is not circumvented.       ``(d) Definition of Creditor.--As used in this section, the      term `creditor' has the same meaning as in section 702(e) of      the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691a(e)).       ``(e) No Exemptions Permitted.--The exemption authority of      the Board under section 105 shall not apply to the rates      established under this section or the disclosure requirements      under section 127(b)(6).       ``(f) Disclosure of Fee and Interest Rate for Credit Other      Than Open End Credit Plans.--In addition to the disclosure      requirements under section 127(b)(6), the Board may prescribe      regulations requiring disclosure of the fee and interest rate      established under this section in addition to or instead of      annual percentage rate disclosures otherwise required under      this title.       ``(g) Relation to State Law.--Nothing in this section may      be construed to preempt any provision of State law that      provides greater protection to consumers than is provided in      this section.       ``(h) Civil Liability and Enforcement.--In addition to      remedies available to the consumer under section 130(a), any      payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor, to      the extent that such payment is a transaction made in      violation of this section, shall be null and void, and not      enforceable by any party in any court or alternative dispute      resolution forum, and the creditor or any subsequent holder      of the obligation shall promptly return to the consumer any      principal, interest, charges, and fees, and any security      interest associated with such transaction.

Diverse National and State Groups Support Durbin/Speier FAIR Bill                                                February 25, 2009.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     Hart Senate Bldg.,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jackie Speier,     Cannon House Office Bldg.,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Speier: We applaud      Senator Durbin and Representative Speier for proposing a      measure that would stop a wide range of lending abuses by      capping interest rates for consumer credit at 36 percent      annually. Cleaning up the finance industry is essential to a      sustainable economic recovery.       The ``Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates      Act'' would implement a key promise made by President Obama      to extend to all Americans Congressional protection against      predatory lending for Service members and their families. By      limiting the total cost of consumer credit to 36 percent,      Congress will keep billions of dollars in the hands of low      and moderate-income consumers, helping to stimulate the      economy without costing taxpayers a penny.       This measure is designed to keep affordable financial      products available, as lenders who offer sustainable loans do      so at rates well below 36 percent annually. But it would      eliminate abuses that rely on high fees, interest and other      devices to charge extremely high annual rates--some 400      percent and higher--to trap consumers in debt they cannot      afford to pay off.       Protections that once curbed abusive lending in America      have been shredded, and consumers are paying astronomical      rates for credit, especially those who have the fewest      resources. Payday loans cost 400 percent APR or higher; car      title loans cost 300 percent APR and put car ownership at      risk; loans secured by expected tax refunds cost 50 to 500      percent APR; and credit card fees and interest can combine to      produce triple-digit rates. Bank overdraft loans can cost      quadruple digit interest rates. These extremely expensive      credit products drain billions from families who struggle to      make ends meet, diminishing their ability to purchase      products and services that would boost the economy.       The ability of states to enact meaningful reforms on credit      card and bank overdraft practices has been severely      restricted as a result of federal preemption. Banks are now      permitted to locate in a state without consumer protections      and then engage in unregulated lending in the other forty-     nine states, which are powerless to protect their citizens      against high cost credit cards and tax refund anticipation      loans. State usury caps have been riddled with loopholes and      exceptions, leaving consumers in thirty-five states exposed      to outrageously expensive payday loans.       The FAIR (Fees and Interest Rate) cap on consumer credit is      set high enough not to hamper mainstream responsible lending.      A 36 percent rate cap is twice the limit for federally-     chartered credit unions and enables credit to be responsibly      extended to consumers with less than perfect credit ratings.      This is the rate cap enacted by Congress through the Military      Lending Act and is the limit typically used in state small      loan laws. The FAIR cap will be the maximum amount lenders      can charge, but states will be able to set lower rate caps to      protect their citizens, such as New York's 25 percent      criminal cap and Arkansas's constitutional cap.       We urge quick action to implement the FAIR cap to stop      usurious credit rates, to protect struggling consumers, and      to put all lenders under the same set of protections.
