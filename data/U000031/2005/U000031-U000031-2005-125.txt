Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.  I would just remind my friend in the well that the FCC specifically dismissed complaints against ``Saving Private Ryan,'' and with regards to the ad that was trying to be run by United Church of Christ, that was a first amendment right that the station made themselves. I do not think anyone thought that the FCC would fine them for the airing of that commercial.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
