 I believe the Senator mentioned a judgeship from Alabama that was qualified last week. I am sorry the Senator from Alabama was unable to be there. I do appreciate him being there for the markup earlier. I thank our colleague, Senator Shelby, for his fine words about the nominee. We are trying to move that nominee from Alabama very quickly. We are doing that to try to help the other Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions. We will keep on the pace, and someday we can go past, if we ever get our offices back.
