Speaker, this morning we learned that the Clinton administration and Republican leadership here in Congress have abandoned their plan to seek congressional approval of $40 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico. Workers and taxpayers of America prevailed in our first round of debate over the proposed Mexican bailout. But President Clinton is scheduled to reveal an alternative plan when he addresses the Nation's Governors this afternoon.  We should watch carefully to ensure that he defends the American people against Wall Street speculators. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is meeting right now and is likely to raise your interest rates. That is the seventh time over the past year. What this means to you is that if you bought a $60,000 home a year ago on a 30-year mortgage, your payments today will be about $100 higher than they were a year ago.  Now, why are interest rates rising when inflation has not gone up and your wages have not gone up? The reason is because the markets have discounted the cost of the $40 billion bailout, and more, that is related to NAFTA and Mexico.  Too much hot money from Wall Street was bet on a gamble in Mexico that we are all having to pay for now.                          ____________________
