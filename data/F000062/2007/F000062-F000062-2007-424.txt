 President, I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Robert Kuan Liang and his wife, Chun-Mei ``Alice'' Hsu-Liang, foreign nationals who live in San Bruno, CA.  I have decided to offer private relief immigration bills on their behalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and their three United States citizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much longer.  The Liangs are foreign nationals facing deportation on account of their overstay of visitors visas and the failure of their previous attorney to timely file a suspension of deportation application before the immigration laws changed in 1996.  Mr. Liang is a foreign national and refugee from Laos. His wife is a citizen of Taiwan. They entered the United States 24 years ago as tourists and established residency in the San Bruno, CA. Because they overstayed the terms of their temporary visas, they now face deportation from the United States.  After living here for so many years, removal from the United States would not come easily or perhaps without tearing this family apart. The Liangs have three children born in this country: Wesley, 15 years old, Bruce, 12 years old, and Eva, 9 years old. Young Wesley suffers from asthma and has a history of social and emotional anxiety.  The immigration judge who presided over the Liang's case in 1997 concluded that there was no question that the Liang children would be adversely impacted if they were required to leave their relatives and friends behind in California to follow their parents to Taiwan, a country whose language and culture is unfamiliar to them.  I can only imagine how much more they would be adversely impacted now given the passage of 9 more years.  The Liangs have filed annual income tax returns; established a successful business, Fong Yong Restaurant, in the United States; are homeowners, and are financially successful. Since they arrived in the United States, they have pursued and, to a degree, achieved the American Dream.  Mr. and Mrs. Liang's quest to legalize their immigration status began in 1993 when they filed for relief from deportation before an immigration judge.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, however, did not act on their application until nearly 5 years later, in 1997, after which time the immigration laws had significantly changed.  According to the immigration judge, had the INS acted on their application for relief from deportation in a timely manner, they would have qualified for suspension of deportation, given that they were long-term residents of this country with U.S. citizen children and other positive factors. By the time INS processed their application, however, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which changed the requirements for relief from removal to the Liangs' disadvantage.  I supported the changes of the 1996 law, but I believe sometimes there are exceptions which merit special consideration. The Liangs are such a couple and family. Perhaps what distinguishes this family from many others is that through hard work and perseverance, Mr. Liang has achieved a significant degree of success in the United States while battling a severe form of post traumatic stress disorder.  According to his psychologist, this disorder stems from the persecution he, his family and community experienced in his native country of Laos during the Vietnam war.  Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mr. Liang was exposed to numerous traumatic experiences, including the murder of his mother by the North Vietnamese and frequent episodes of wartime violence. He also routinely witnessed the brutal persecution and deaths of others in his village. In 1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.  The emotional impact of Mr. Liang's experiences in his war-torn native country has been profound and continues to haunt him. His psychologist has also indicated that he suffers from severe clinical depression, which has been exacerbated by the prospect of being deported to Taiwan, where on account of his nationality, he believes he and his family would be treated as second-class citizens.  Moreover, Mr. Liang believes that the pursuit of further mental health treatment in Taiwan would only exacerbate the stigma of being an outsider in a country whose language he does not speak. Given those prospects, he also fears the impact such a stigma would have on the well-being and future of his children.  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of the Liangs.  I also ask unanimous consent that two letters of community support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  January 2, 2007.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to ask you to once      again introduce a private bill to aid my friends Alice and      Robert Liang, who are seeking permanent lawful resident      status in the United States.       Without your assistance, the Liangs face deportation for      overstaying their temporary visas by 24 years. Being forced      to leave the United States would devastate their family.      Their three minor children, Eva, Bruce and Wesley, are U.S.      citizens and know no other home. Robert, a refugee from Laos,      suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder that would be      exacerbated if he were forced to relocate to Taiwan after      building a life here.       The Liangs own and run a successful vegetarian Chinese      restaurant, Garden Fresh, in Mountain View. They work hard,      pay taxes and own their own home in San Bruno. Though they      are by no means wealthy, they are generous donors to a      variety of charities and are quick to provide food or      assistance to anyone who needs help. They are also loving      parents and wonderful people who have nearly magically turned      hundreds of their customers into a community of friends      vitally concerned about their welfare. The fact that so many      of their customers are committed to ensuring their future in      the U.S. is a testament to the Liangs high character.       Two years ago, you told Congress that the extraordinary and      unique facts surrounding the Liangs situation merited the      introduction of a private bill on their behalf. I hope that      you will be similarly supportive once again, and I urge you      to continue your efforts to aid this very worthy family.       Thank you.           Sincerely,     June D. Bell.                                  ____                                                December 27, 2006.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are honored to write to you in      support of the Liang family of San Bruno, California. We have      known Robert and Alice for twelve years, and are repeatedly      awed by their support of their children and their      communities. They are the kind of people that we all wish      could surround us: honest, hard-working and extraordinarily      generous.       Anyone who has enjoyed their restaurants has unknowingly      become a part of Alice's family, as a first-timer noted. But      it is their service to the community, schools, and anyone in      need, that is so extraordinary. For example, on two recent      occasions, after the Katrina and Rita hurricanes, and again      after the Asian tsunami, Robert and Alice gave every penny      received on a full day to the relief efforts. Then on several      occasions, they have taken food and solace to hospitalized      customers (including me), giving up their free day. And for      years, Robert and Alice have provided food for a local public      school, at cost.       This kindness comes from a man who still suffers the      effects of his childhood during the war years in southeast      Asia, and a woman who grew up on a small farm in rural      Taiwan. They are therefore driven to provide a better life      for their American-born children.       We ask that you submit and guide to passage a Private Bill      that would permit this wonderful family to stay together in      our country, thereby enhancing not just the five of them, but      all of us who are touched by them. All five members of the      Liang family should be allowed to stay together in this      country and call themselves American.           Sincerely,     W. Cameron Caswell, Jr.,     Barbara Anne Maas.                                 ______                                       By
