President, I yield the floor. I know there are others waiting to speak. I reserve the remainder of my time.                               Exhibit 1                             Republican Governors Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.     Hon. Don Nickles,     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Nickles: As Congress begins debate on managed      care reform legislation, we would like to emphasize our      confidence in states' achievements in managed care and ask      that any legislation you consider preserve state authority      and innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's      efforts to complement the states' reforms by expanding      managed care protections to self-insured plans without      preempting state authority.       Historically, regulating private insurance has been the      responsibility of the states.     Many, if not all of the ideas under consideration now in      Congress, have been considered by states. Because the      saturation of managed care is different throughout the      nation, each state has its own unique issues relative to its      market place. We have concerns about the unintended      consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all standards on      states which could result in increasing the number of      uninsured and increasing health care costs.       As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in      managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of      importance to our citizens. As you know, some analysts      estimate that private health insurance premiums could grow      from the current 6 percent to double-digit increases later      this year. This does not include the costs of any new federal      mandates. Health resources are limited.       We hope the Congress' well-intended efforts take into      account the states' successful and historical role in      regulating health insurance.           Sincerely,                                                Frank Keating,                                             Governor of Oklahoma,                                                         Chairman.                                                   Ed Schafer,                                         Governor of North Dakota,                                                    Vice Chairman.                                                Don Sundquist,                                            Governor of Tennessee,                              Chairman RGA Health Care Issue Team.
