There is no question that the value of our Nation's currency on international markets is a measure of our Nation's economic strength and economic health. And over the past few days and weeks, our dollar has hit historic lows against currencies of all the nations that we trade with. In fact, it is at the lowest level, our dollar's value, since World War II. That is a longer time than many people in this Chamber have been alive. so it has not been at this point for decades.  The dollar's exchange value stands at a scant 92.8 yen to the dollar. I can remember when it was 240 yen to the dollar and 1.4 German marks against the dollar. In other words, the dollar is not looking so good to the rest of the world. It is losing its value. It is looking cheap.  Little that our Treasury Department or Federal Reserve have been able to do over the last few days to give the dollar a boost has worked. In fact, they put over $2 billion into buying currencies around the world over the weekend and it did not do any good. Did not do any good, had no impact on stopping the dollar's further decline.                              {time}  2000  Now, what does this really mean to families in our Nation? It means that our money, our people's money, cannot buy as much, not just here at home, but abroad. It means that interest rates in our country rose seven times over the last 12 months, even though most people were going, well, why are interest rates going up? There is really [[Page H2788]] no inflation. What is happening here? Banks are raking in good money off of our people, and though there is no inflation on the horizon, we see that our Nation is raising interest rates to attract money from other places because our money is not worth as much.  In fact, we are now, the United States of America, the largest debtor nation in the world, and through NAFTA, we linked ourselves to Mexico and Canada, and North America is now the largest debtor continent on the face of the planet.  And the markets know it. For 15 years our country has been importing vast amounts of merchandise, more than we exported. In fact, last year, 1994, we had the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of our country; as Congressman DeFazio referenced, over $166 billion more of goods coming in here than we sent out.  In effect, what we have, we have a decapitalization of the United States of America; production that used to be done here is being done somewhere else. We are importing all this stuff and then we have to pay for it with borrowed money. Doesn't sound like a very smart policy to me.  Last year, our deficit with Japan went up even more, to over $65 billion. Our deficit with China went up to nearly $30 billion, and the former surplus that we had had before NAFTA with Mexico dried up and went into the negative numbers in October and November of last year, and with the incredible devaluation of the peso, it is estimated that this year of 1995, the United States will yield nearly $15 billion more of trade deficit in the red with Mexico.  In other words, Mexico will be sending more goods to this country than we will be sending down there. That is not how NAFTA was supposed to work. It is clear that since the middle of February, and like Mr. DeFazio, I have a chart that shows the value of the U.S. dollar going down. Since the mid-1980's until the most recent period here after the Mexican peso was devalued, to which we have not linked ourselves inseparably, the value of our dollar has dropped at the fastest rate in the history of our country, and like Mr. DeFazio, I am shocked there are no emergency hearings in the Congress. There is no word from the White House. At least the newspapers are reporting, and it has been in top headlines in USA Today, in the New York Times, in the Wall Street Journal. You think Washington fell comatose on this one.  There is a major economic crisis brewing, and money is flowing out of our Treasury to try to prop up the Mexican peso, a few billion dollars. Actually there is more money that has flowed out of the Treasury to prop up the Mexican peso than money has flowed out of the Treasury to prop up the United States' dollar in international markets, we learned this morning. What happened today? Peso went down again in terms of its own value.  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.
