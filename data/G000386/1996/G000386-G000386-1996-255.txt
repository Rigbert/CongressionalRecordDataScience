 President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment with my friend from California, Senator Boxer.  Over the years, she has helped me watchdog the Pentagon.  That is not an easy thing to do.  Whether Republicans or Democrats are running the place, it's always tough to tangle with the Pentagon.  It is an unpopular thing to do.  She has always been a reliable defense reform ally.  In today's political environment, dependable defense reform allies are hard to come by.  They may be an endangered species.  So I am happy to team up with her on this measure.  It is another effort to chip away at the Pentagon culture.  This is a culture that is literally blind to waste.  It tolerates waste and sometimes even encourages waste.  What we want to do is change that culture.  In trying to change that culture, we hope to strengthen our military capabilities.  When we add $12 billion for defense--like in this bill, we want to make sure we buy more capability.  We want to make sure that we are not buying more waste and more cost.  Our amendment would place a permanent cap on individual executive compensation allowable under Government contracts.  It would set the cap at $200,000 per year.  The cap would apply to salaries, bonuses, and other incentives.  It would be a permanent cap.  There is a temporary, short-term cap in effect today.  The temporary, short-term cap was imposed by the DOD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996.  It applies only to fiscal year 1996 contracts.  I will discuss the existing cap in greater detail later in the debate.   Mr. President, I would like to make one point crystal clear right off the bat.  This is not an attempt to tell private companies how much they should pay their top executives.  Instead, it would restrict what Government bureaucrats are allowed to pay top executives in industry.   Mr. President, executive salaries in private industry should be determined in the marketplace.  And not by a bunch of bureaucrats in the Pentagon.  But that is what is going on.  Right now, bureaucrats decide what is fair and reasonable and pay it.  Our amendment would put a lid on Government payments only.  I underscore Government payments only.  That is the driving force behind this measure.  The Grassley-Boxer amendment would not limit the amount of money a defense contractor could pay its executives.  If, for example, a defense company wants to pay one of its top executives working on military contracts $6,332,000.00 a year--as one did, then so be it.  Under Grassley-Boxer, the company could continue to do it--no questions asked.   Mr. President, Loral Corporation's top executive, Mr. Bernard L. Schwartz, received a pay and bonus package in 1995 that totaled $6,332,000.00  But that's not the whole enchilada.  Mr. Schwartz will also receive a $36 million bonus for agreeing to sell his company's defense business. The buyer is the Lockheed Martin Corp.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place a recent newspaper article about Mr. Schwartz's pay in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 16, 1996]    Loral Chairman to Give $18 Million of Merger Fee to 40 Employees                            (By John Mintz)       Loral Corp. Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz will receive a $36      million bonus for agreeing to sell his company's defense      business to Lockheed Martin Corp., but will give $18 million      of it to a group of Loral employees, according to documents      filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The money Schwartz is giving up will reward 40 people in      Loral's Manhattan headquarters who may lose their jobs or be      demoted in the merger, according to the documents. The      employees, including some secretaries and mid-level      executives, could receive money equivalent to as much as      twice their annual salary and bonus.       Loral's New York headquarters likely will close and be      folded into Lockheed Martin's Bethesda offices, industry      officials said.       ``Their lives could be affected by the merger, and I      decided it would be appropriate to recognize their efforts,''      Schwartz said yesterday. ``There are some smiling faces here      today. . . . If I'd had enough resources, I would have spread      it among all 38,000 Loral employees.''       Giving such a gift to employees is extremely rare in      mergers, investment bankers said. Schwartz, the only liberal      Democrat among chief executives of large defense firms, has      often expounded on his views of corporate empowerment, and      for years has offered generous stock options to Loral      employees to make them what he calls ``stakeholders'' in his      company.       The $18 million bonus Schwartz will collect from Loral is      in addition to approximately $27 million he has made on paper      in the value of his Loral stock due to the proposed merger.      He owns about 3.6 million shares, and each has increased in      value by approximately $7.50 following the announcement last      week.       Schwartz's regular annual compensation and bonus from the      company in 1995 totaled $6,332,000.       The proposed merger with Lockheed Martin was announced last      week. If Loral pulls out of the transaction, it must pay      Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $175 million, according      to the SEC filings.       Meanwhile, the Pentagon has largely sided with Lockheed      Martin and against a group of critics in a bitter controversy      involving a previous merger that created Lockheed Martin from      Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. in March last year.       In a report, a Defense Department accounting office called      the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) did not support      allegations by Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-VT.), some      congressional colleagues and the newspaper Newsday that      Lockheed Martin was improperly seeking a Pentagon payment of      $31 million in connection with the merger. The critics called      it a taxpayer rip-off.       The DCAA recommendations, which still must be reviewed by      the Pentagon, were first reported in the industry publication      Defense Week.       The company has asserted for months that its foes are      confusing two sums of money. One is a $61 million payment to      460 former Martin Marietta executives because of the merger.      The military won't reimburse firms for such payments, and      Locheed Martin is not asking for that.       But the firm is asking the military to reimburse it $31      million that it has already paid those 460 executives. These      sums had nothing to do with the merger, the company has said.       The military pays contracts on a ``cost-plus'' basis,      meaning the companies tell the Pentagon about their expenses,      including overhead, cost of labor and materials, and      executive compensation. The military decides which requests      are ``reasonable,'' computes the profit and pays the      appropriate amounts.       The company has said the $31 million was part of its long-     standing executive compensation package and not, as Sanders      asserted, a cozy Pentagon pay-off to high-ranking executives      for arranging the merger.       Now the Pentagon's DCAA has concluded that $16 million of      the firm's $31 million in reimbursement requests was proper,      has deferred consideration on $9 million and raised questions      about $6 million of the requested amount. The questions,      however, focused on complex government accounting issues and      did not directly track with Sanders' objections.       Congressional offices were closed for the holiday. Calls to      Sanders' office seeking comment were not answered.
