 President, and Members of the Senate, where we are we have one more amendment upon which we will be voting, a motion to table very shortly, the Helms amendment. And in all likelihood the only additional vote will be final passage. There is one other amendment we are still working on. So there could possibly be two rollcall votes plus final passage; but in all likelihood one rollcall on an amendment, a tabling motion, and then final passage. So we are very, very close to finishing the bill.
