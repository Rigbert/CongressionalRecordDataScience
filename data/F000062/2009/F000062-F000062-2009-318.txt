 President, I believe it is fair to say that there is a farm emergency in this country. Some of it is caused by drought, including out West where California has had, for 3 years, a very serious drought. But most of it is caused by the absence of farm labor--labor to help plant, prune, and harvest.  Many of us have listened to farm bureaus throughout the country, spoken with farmers who are losing land, fallowing land, and leasing land abroad. I think the time has come to do something about it.  Today, with 16 cosponsors, I am introducing an agricultural worker bill known as AgJOBS. This bill is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Schumer, Kennedy, Kohl, Boxer, Dodd, Lieberman, Bingaman, Feingold, Murray, Kerry, Bill Nelson, Kaufman, Casey, Cantwell, and Levin. It would provide farmers with the stable, legal workforce they deserve by reforming the broken H-2A seasonal worker program and offering a pathway to citizenship for hard-working, law-abiding immigrants already employed or who have been employed on American farms.  This bill is supported by more than 200 agricultural coalition and immigration reform groups throughout the Nation.  Since I last came to the floor to talk about a solution to this crisis, it has only grown. The bill is necessary, and I believe Congress must act now to save America's agriculture industry.  Today across the United States, there are not enough agricultural workers to do the pruning, picking, packing, and harvesting of our country's crops. With an inadequate supply of workers, farmers from Maine to California, from Washington State to Georgia, have watched their produce rot in fields, and have been forced to fallow close to half a million acres of land, and billions of dollars are being drained out of our economy as a result.  Farmers are downsizing their operations. Many are buying or leasing land in Mexico. Others are going out of business. Quite clearly, the labor situation facing the American farmer is an emergency.  So some ask: Why don't American farmers hire Americans to do their work? The unemployment rate is high. People are looking for jobs. So why don't they hire Americans?  The fact is, they have tried and tried and tried. But there are very few Americans who are willing to take the job in a hot field, doing backbreaking labor, in temperatures that often exceed 100 degrees. That is a fact.  The other fact is that immigrant workers are the backbone of America's agricultural industry--a huge industry and a proud industry, which is now dying due to the lack of steady labor supply.  Farmers are departing the country in order to stay in business, leaving devastated farm communities behind. In California, in the Great Central Valley, farmers who once tended ``America's breadbasket'' are now standing in bread lines, with unemployment rates in their communities that are as high as 45 percent. Topsoil from fallowed land turning into dust now blows up in sandstorms and has caused periodic shutdowns of Interstate 5, the State's main north-south freeway.  As a result of Congress's inaction, between 2007 and 2008--1 year--1.56 million acres of farmland, once rich with crops, are now dormant. That is 1.5 million acres dormant in a year. In California alone, in the past 5 years, that amount--1.5 million acres--of production has been lost.  American farmers have moved at least 84,155 acres of production to Mexico. This is what we know of: Over 84,000 acres of farm production now in Mexico. This has resulted in the growth of farm labor jobs in Mexico; namely, 22,285 jobs to cultivate crops that vary in diversity from avocados to green onions to watermelons.  This shortage of workers is devastating American agriculture, and we need to wake up and understand what is happening. In the next 1 to 2 years, the United States stands to lose $5 billion to $9 billion in agricultural sales to foreign competition if Congress does not act to provide a workforce for the American farming community.  California has already lost almost $1 billion from 2005 to 2006. It is estimated we will lose between $1.7 and $3.1 billion in the next year. The California farm industry--the largest in America--was almost a $40 billion-a-year industry. It is deteriorating every year.  We are witnessing nothing less than the slow vanishing of American agriculture.  Ayron Moiola, the executive director of the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, predicts that California's asparagus crops will disappear completely in the Imperial Valley if their demand for specialized asparagus planters and harvesters is not met.  Colorado farmers have estimated their State's fruit and vegetable industry will disappear completely in the next 5 to 10 years without some program to provide a sustainable workforce.  As of February 2008, 35 to 45 New Hampshire farm operations have been at risk of going out of business or being forced to severely cut back operations due to labor shortages.  This reduction in farm production would result in an estimated loss of 22,000 acres of farmland and $58 million of agricultural production for New Hampshire alone. In addition, over 600 full-time farm jobs and 4,300 jobs in agriculture-related businesses could be in jeopardy.  I say to the Presiding Officer, I hear this from your apple growers in New York, and I hear it from the dairy industry throughout America.  The situation is dire from coast to coast, and urgent action is required to halt these trends. I do not think we can afford to lose our entire agricultural industry because this has always been a central and sustainable part of our national economy. Our food is clean; there are strong pesticide controls in this country. I think most of us believe we would much prefer to buy American produce than foreign produce. Yet we may not have that opportunity.  When farmers suffer, there is a ripple effect felt throughout the economy: in farm equipment manufacturing, packaging, processing, transportation, marketing, lending, and insurance. Jobs are being lost, and our economy is going to decline further as a result. Low-producing farms mean a loweredlocal tax base--as farms no longer generate income and create jobs.  As can be seen from this graphic I have in the Chamber, for every job lost on a farm and ranch, the country loses approximately three jobs in related sectors that are supported by having the agricultural community in this country.  I have received a letter from the Port of Oakland, which depends heavily on agribusiness for its survival. According to the port, last year more than 750 metric tons of agricultural products, worth approximately $2.6 billion, were shipped through the port, representing 40 percent of the port's exports.  As these farms disappear, port jobs, basic jobs for people, also disappear. The central issue is not immigration; it is the bottom line of the American economy. I think Congress should be doing everything we can to prevent U.S. farms from closing down.  There is a solution, and it is this bill. This bill is well known, and this bill has been well supported in the past with a majority of votes. It is bipartisan. We can take it up and pass it today, and that would immediately help American farmers bolster the U.S. economy at a critical time.  The AgJOBS bill has two parts. The first meets the immediate needs of our farmers by creating a program that would provide an opportunity for experienced agricultural workers to earn the right to apply for legal status in this country.  The second part meets the long-term needs of farmers by reforming the H-2A program--that is the temporary worker program for the farm industry--so that if new workers are needed, farmers and growers have a legal path to bring workers in to harvest their crops.  The first step of the program requires that undocumented agricultural workers apply for a blue card if they can demonstrate they have worked in American agriculture in the United States for at least 150 workdays within the previous 2 years before December 31, 2008.  The second step requires that a blue cardholder work in the U.S. agricultural industry for an additional 150 workdays per year for at least 3 years, or 100 workdays per year for 5 years.  At the end of this time, a worker can obtain a green card and can continue to work in agriculture.  Workers participating in the program will be required to pay a fine of $500, show that they are current on their taxes, and that they have not been convicted of any crime that involves bodily injury, the threat of bodily injury or harm to property.  Employment is verified through employer-issued itemized statements, pay stubs, W-2 forms, employer letters, contracts or agreements, employer-sponsored health care, timecards or payment of taxes.  At the end of 5 years, those workers will be able to gain citizenship in this country.  The blue card visa program will be capped at 1.35 million blue cards over 5 years and sunsets after 5 years.  All blue cards will have encrypted, biometric identifiers, and contain other anticounterfeiting protections. This provides, in effect, a biometric identifier for 1.35 million people who are undocumented but in the country today.  AgJOBS would also streamline the current guest worker program, known as the H-2A program, which is currently unwieldy and ineffective.  Among other things, the bill will shorten the labor certification process, which now often takes 60 days, reducing the approval process to between 48 to 72 hours.  Advertising and positive recruitment for U.S. workers in the local labor market is required by filing a job notification with the local office of the State employment security agency.  Petitions for admission of H-2A workers must be processed and the consulate or port of entry notified within 7 days of receipt.  The adverse effect wage rate would be frozen for 3 years, to be gradually replaced with a prevailing wage standard.  H-2A visas will be secure and counterfeit resistant.  The reforms to the H-2A agricultural worker program are especially important to meet the needs of year-round agricultural industries, such as dairy, which are not covered by the seasonal program.  Many say that dairy should use the seasonal H-2A program--but it does not work for that industry. They need workers 24/7, 365 days a year.  The National Milk Producers recently shared with me an economic study done by researchers at Texas A&M that will be released next week on the economic impacts of immigration on U.S. dairy farms. Over 5,000 dairy farms, surveyed nationally, with responses from 47 States, are in this study. Of these, 50 percent use immigrant labor. Immigrant labor now accounts for 62 percent of milk production in 47 States.  As can be seen from this chart I have in the Chamber, eliminating immigrant labor would reduce the U.S. dairy herd by 1.34 million, milk production by 29.5 billion pounds, and the number of farms by 4,532. Retail milk prices would increase by an estimated 61 percent.  This will be the result if we do not recognize what is a basic reality that farm and dairy communities depend on undocumented workers, who are the only workers who will do this kind of work.  This is hard for people to believe. However, a while back, we posted notices in the welfare departments of all 58 california counties that said: Agricultural worker jobs available. Please sign up here.  However, do you know how many workers came from this? Not a single one.  When I drive down the highway, down to Monterey, along the coast, and I go through the great Salinas Valley, I watch the row crops either being planted or sprayed or harvested. You see the workers in the field stooped over, hour after hour, in the sun, when it is 100 degrees or more in temperature, and you can see the specific nature of this type of work.  People think of this work as unskilled labor, but it is not. It is a learned skill. These workers have to move fast and be trained to use the farm equipment. They know how to work skillfully with their hands and move row after row, after row, down the field.  Last summer, a young pregnant woman working in the field collapsed from heat exhaustion and was taken to the hospital, where she died. Working in the field is back breaking, difficult work, and there are very few Americans who are willing to do this work.  The backbone of the agriculture industry in my State is the undocumented workforce and it is time to recognize that reality. I can't have--and Mr. President, you can't have--farmers standing in bread lines because they can't get the labor to plant or harvest their crops. The fields across America are increasingly being fallowed and this does not make sense.  Congress must stand tall and acknowledge that the basic workforce in the American agricultural community is undocumented farm labor. Undocumented workers take these jobs because they are professional and proud of the work that they do. I believe that is desirable.  This bill has previously passed with more than a majority in comprehensive immigration reform. It recognizes that the American farm industry is in crisis; that the industry is deteriorating; and that America is losing its produce. This bill stands up for American farmers and provides them with the workforce they deserve--American farmers like Toni Scully, a pear farmer from Lake County, CA.  Toni Scully experienced a devastating harvest that left much of her pear crop rotting on the ground because she could not find workers in time for the harvest.  Early last year, I heard from Dewey Zabka, an onion and potato farmer in northern Colorado who, for the first time in his company's 50-year history, had to downsize 25 percent of his production.  In the State of New York, 800 farms and $700 million in sales may be forced to go out of business or scale back their farm operations if labor shortages continue. For the first time since 1991, Jim Bittner, the owner of Singer Farms in Appleton, NY, razed 10 percent of his sweet cherry and peach orchards last year because he could not get farm labor.  For the 2009 season, California growers who anticipate a shortage of reliable labor are deciding to move awayfrom planting permanent tree crops, including peach, plumb, nectarine, almond, pomegranate, and olive trees. Many of these farmers are supplementing these crops with pistachios, which can be harvested mechanically.  In June 2008, The Oregonian reported that Oregon's pear and onion industries are at risk of not being able to sustain production without consistent labor.  In Yuma County, AZ, where agricultural workers earn between $10 and $19 per hour, U.S. lettuce producers were unable to find enough laborers to harvest the spring crop of lettuce for 2008.  The truth is Americans will not do the work that sustains agriculture. It is hard, stooped labor requiring long and unpredictable hours. As a result, the labor shortage will be persistent. It is not going to get better next year, unless we have the courage and the guts to stand up for a major industry in America which deserves a steady labor base, particularly during these difficult economic times. And there are examples all over the nation that Americans simply won't fill these jobs.  H. Lee Showalter, a member of the Pennsylvania Apple Marketing Board, points to the example of the largest Macintosh apple producer in New York, who is required to advertise for local labor before joining a migrant labor program. Of the 300 workers he needed to fill, only 1 American worker applied.  Willoway Nurseries, Inc. has been in business in northern Ohio since 1954. Willoway Nurseries has attempted to recruit local workers, though to no avail. General nursery workers on this farm earn a starting wage of $9.93 per hour. Yet it has been impossible for the nursery to recruit American help.  The Washington Farm Bureau reported that nearly 500 tons of apples were not picked in Washington State's apple harvests last year due to picker shortages. As Valoria H. Loveland, director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture, stated in a letter to me:       The reality of our local labor market [is that] local      people who want to work are already employed, or are not      interested in doing the seasonal and physically demanding      work that characterizes our specialty crop production.  Experts estimate that nearly 80 percent of Florida's approximately 150,000 agricultural workers are undocumented immigrants. This is a $1.6 billion a year business that produces up to 90 percent of the fresh domestic tomatoes that Americans eat between the months of December and May.  Many farmers have been in business for generations. Many farm the land that their parents and their grandparents farmed before them. California farms produce approximately 350 different crops: pears, walnuts, raisins, lettuce, onions, strawberries, and apricots, just to name a few. Without reform, we will continue to see the deterioration of American farms nationwide. This includes the possibility that certain vegetables and fruits will no longer grow in our Nation, where we have stricter rules and regulations for safety.  Once the trees are gone, they are replaced by crops that do not require manual labor. As a result, our pears, our apples, our oranges will be increasingly coming from foreign sources. This is not what America wants, but it is what Congress's inaction compels.  The trend is quite clear. If there is not a means to grow and harvest our produce in this country, we will import produce from China, from Mexico, and from other countries that have sufficient labor. If our farmers want to stay in business, they will continue to go to Mexico and lease land and grow crops there. We are not doing our duty if we let this continue.  Steve Scaroni has been in the California lettuce and broccoli industry for over three decades. In recent years he has moved 2,000 acres and 500 jobs from his $50 million operation in Heber, CA, to Guanajuato, Mexico. Steve wants his business to survive, and he can't hire or plant. If he can't plant, he can't pick. If he can't pick, he can't pack, and he won't be able to deliver a harvest. As a result, today Steve exports to the United States about 2 million pounds of lettuce a week. He has spent thousands of dollars to start up the new farms and to train workers to ensure that his crops meet U.S. food safety standards.  In Wilcox, AZ, Eurofresh Farms has transferred tomato crops and 150 workers to Sonora, Mexico, where tomatoes are grown and shipped to the U.S. on a daily basis.  Reforming the system means that we not only protect the agricultural industry, but also the health of this Nation. This past July, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that a variety of jalapeno and serrano peppers grown in Mexico caused an outbreak of salmonella in the United States. This outbreak was first thought to have originated in tomatoes.  The repercussions of the outbreak were felt on farms from coast to coast. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that the tomato scare cost local farmers about $14 million in total production value. Nationwide, the tomato industry lost at least $100 million due to lower prices and reduced demand. At the same time, over the last 15 years, imports of tomatoes have increased 179 percent. Right now, almost 40 percent of the tomatoes that we eat are grown in a foreign country. Yet tomato farmers are being forced to close shop.  The agriculture industry has been seeking a resolution for the labor crisis for the past 10 years. Mr. President, I have received over 50 letters of support for AgJOBS.  I am committed to working with the Obama administration, and Senators Leahy, Schumer, and Kennedy, as well as the House champions, Representatives Berman and Putnam, and others, to support U.S. farmers and the workers who provide the skilled labor needed to plant, tend and harvest our crops.  The time is now, and the solution is before us. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of AgJOBS and help restore America's farms before it is too late.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, letters of support, and list of supporters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1038       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Grounds for Removal.--Any alien granted blue card      status who does not apply for adjustment of status under this      section before the expiration of the application period      described in subsection (a)(4) or who fails to meet the other      requirements of subsection (a) by the end of the application      period, is deportable and may be removed under section 240 of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a).

Dear Senator Feinstein: The seven affiliated unions and six      million members of Change to Win write to thank you for your      continued leadership in reintroducing the ``AgJOBS'' bill      (the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security      Act of 2009), and to pledge our full support for its      enactment.       The effects of our broken immigration system on the labor      market must be addressed. Farm workers and their families      live in fear of deportation, and agricultural growers across      the country face worker shortages. AgJOBS would enable farm      workers to bargain for better working and living conditions      and provide growers a legal stable labor supply by offering      undocumented farm workers the chance to come out of the      shadows and earn legal status by meeting stringent      agricultural-work requirements. It is important that AgJOBS      would also revise the H-2A agricultural guestworker program      in a balanced manner.       This bipartisan bill is the product of congressional      negotiations and an historic compromise between the United      Farm Workers and major agribusiness employers. It also has      the full support of hundreds of farmer, worker, and immigrant      organizations. Its passage would be a substantial down      payment on the kind of comprehensive immigration reform our      country needs.           Sincerely,         Anna Burger, Chair, Change to Win, International            Secretary-Treasurer, Service Employees International            Union (SEIU); Edgar Romney, Secretary-Treasurer, Change            to Win, Executive Vice President, UNITE HERE; Joseph            Hansen, International President, United Food and            Commerical Workers, International Union, UFCW); James            Hoffa, General President, International Brotherhood of            Teamsters (IBT); Geralyn Lutty, United Food and            Commerical Workers International Union (UFCW).

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Leadership      Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest,      largest, and most diverse civil and human rights coalition,      we thank you for introducing the Agricultural Job      Opportunities, Benefits and Security Act (``AgJOBS'') of      2009. We have strongly supported virtually identical versions      of the AgJOBS bill in previous Congresses, and we look      forward to working with your office and our other allies in      the effort to move it forward in the 111th Congress.       AgJOBS would provide a legal, stable agricultural labor      supply and, at the same time, give undocumented farmworkers      the chance to come out of the shadows and earn legal      immigration status a) by meeting a past-work requirement in      American agriculture and b) through stringent future      agricultural-work requirements. Giving farmworkers the      ability to legalize their status is critical to enabling them      to bargain for better working and living conditions. AgJOBS      represents a balanced approach and is a tremendous      improvement over the current H-2A agricultural guestworker      program, thanks to the concessions made by all sides in this      debate.       The treatment of farmworkers is a matter of great      importance to the civil rights community. Whether it was      Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, the 4.5 million      braceros brought into the United States during the World War      II era, or H-2A workers under the current program,      guestworkers have long been the most vulnerable and poorly      treated workers among us. Even today, they are subject to      below poverty-level wages and a lack of coverage by basic      labor standards that other American workers take for      granted--and they lack the political and economic power to      improve these conditions on their own. It is because of this      that we speak up today for their rights, and strongly urge      the enactment of AgJOBS.           Sincerely,     Wade Henderson,       President & CEO.     Nancy Zirkin,       Executive Vice President.                                  ____                                     Dairy Farmers of America,                                                     May 12, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Last Congress, you showed      extraordinary leadership in authoring the Agricultural Jobs,      Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act (AgJobs), a bill which      restructures and reforms the current H-2A temporary      agricultural worker program to ensure a reliable and legal      workforce for the agricultural community. On behalf of the      nearly 18,000 members of Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. (DFA)      we applaud your decision to reintroduce this important      measure in the 111th Congress.       Dairy Farmers of America is a dairy marketing cooperative      that serves and is owned by dairy farmers in 48 states. Our      cooperative's success is built on the success of its      producer-members, who raise their dairy herds and their      families on family farms across the nation.       Immigrant labor plays a crucial role in contributing to the      success of our members and the dairy industry as a whole. A      large percentage of the hired workers on dairy farms of all      sizes are immigrants. Unfortunately, unlike most other      immigrant-dependent agricultural sectors, the dairy industry      is currently blocked by the Department of Labor (DOL) from      using the H-2A program because of the program's requirement      that the worker and job both be temporary or seasonal. This      seasonality aspect of the H-2A program has prevented dairy      farmers from using the program to attract and maintain needed      workers. In order to survive, our industry needs reform in      the system now.       Once again, on behalf of DFA members across the country, we      appreciate your leadership on this matter and stand ready to      fight for its passage.           Sincerely,                                                  John Wilson,                                            Senior Vice President,     Marketing and Industry Affairs.                                  ____                                       U.S. Apple Association,                                         Vienna, VA, May 11, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein, thank you for standing up for the      U.S. apple industry and other labor intensive agriculture by      reintroducing the AgJOBS bill in the Senate.       Apple production and harvesting is highly labor-intensive.      The cost and availability of a predictable, consistent and      legal supply of labor is critically important to the U.S.      apple industry.       The past few years have brought great uncertainty to our      industry. Labor shortages coupled with increased enforcement      and a cumbersome, unworkable H-2A guest worker program have      meant that, even in good crop years, growers' livelihoods are      in jeopardy when they cannot get all of their apples off the      tree. This has lead many in the industry to delay or cancel      plans to expand and in some cases to get out of the fruit      business altogether.       We need AgJOBS! Without this critical legislation, the U.S.      could lose much of our domestic apple industry and with it      over $2 billion in farm gate value. Our apples would have to      be imported, most likely from China, the world's largest      producer of apples. We've seen what dependence on foreign oil      has been like. Can you imagine dependence on foreign food?      This is not what American consumers want.       USApple and our industry leaders stand ready to work with      you and your staff to pass AgJOBS. We have supported the      legislation since the first year it was introduced and it is      our top legislative priority.       Thank you again for your leadership on this critical issue.           Sincerely,                                                  Nancy E. Foster,                                                  President & CEO.                                       ____                                 Society of American Florists,                                                     May 12, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the members of the      Society of American Florists (SAF), I understand that you      plan to reintroduce the Agricultural Job Opportunities,      Benefits and Security Act (AgJOBS) this week. We applaud you      for your courageous leadership and tenacity in working to      advance agricultural labor reform. AgJOBS reflects years of      negotiations on complex and contentious issues and will      achieve historic and critical reforms to our nation's labor      and immigration laws.       The bipartisan AgJOBS legislation recognizes the unique and      urgent need of labor intensive agricultural industries--     ranging from floral and nursery to fruits and vegetables,      meat and dairy farms--to have access to a legal workforce.      Thank you for recognizing these needs and taking the lead to      change the untenable status quo. Your efforts on behalf of      agriculture will go far to preserve one of our country's      strategic commodities--a stable and reliable labor supply      that produces our food and helps to sustain our economy.       An estimated two-thirds of farm workers lack proper work      authorization. No other segment of the economy is so      dependent upon a foreign-born workforce. Our industry is also      vulnerable to the increased workplace immigration enforcement      focused on employers. In addition, several pending regulatory      enforcement mechanisms like the ``no-match'' rule and ``E-     Verify'' mandate an immediate legislative solution to the      labor problems of agriculture.       Agricultural economists estimate that three non-farm jobs      in the upstream and downstream economy are sustained by every      farm worker job. Absent the reforms of AgJOBS, many of these      jobs will be lost because agricultural producers will have no      choice but to cut back or send some of their production      offshore.       In addition, AgJOBS will contribute to increasing national      security by enhancing the rule of law. In the short term,      those eligible to earn legal status must come forward, submit      to a background check and make substantial commitment to      agricultural work prospectively. This ability to retain our      trained workforce will lead to a long-term solution so that      capacity can be built to allow greater participation in a      reformed H-2A program.       Finally, the bipartisan AgJOBS continues to have the      endorsement and support of organized labor, agriculture,      immigrant rights and religious community groups, and general      business, through three Congresses.       Thank you for your leadership and vision on this vital      issue. We look forward to working with you in the months      ahead to enact AgJOBS.       The Society of American Florists is the national trade      association representing the entire floriculture industry, a      $21 billion component of the U.S. economy at retail.      Membership includes about 10,000 small businesses, including      growers, wholesalers, retailers, importers and related      organizations, located in communities nationwide and abroad.      The industry produces and sells cut flowers and foliage,      foliage plants, potted flowering plants, and bedding plants.       Sincerely,                                                     Kevin Priest,     Chairman, Government Relations Committee.                                  ____                                                American Nursery &                                        Landscape Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Nursery & Landscape      Association commends you for your steadfast leadership toward      resolving the labor crisis that threatens every labor-     intensive sector of agriculture in America. ANLA represents      2000 active member firms and an additional 20,000 grassroots      network participants who grow, sell, and install landscape      plants. ANLA members also produce the orchard and vineyard      planting stock that sustains farms in California and across      the nation. At farmgate, our industry was valued by the U.S.      Department of Agriculture at over $16 billion in 2007.      California is of course the nation's leading nursery stock      producer, but nurseries are an important agricultural      component from coast to coast. Nursery and greenhouse      production ranks among the top five sectors of agriculture in      28 states, and in the top 10 in all 50 states!       Nursery farming is inherently labor intensive and requires      specialized skills. As with the rest of agriculture, much of      the nursery workforce is comprised of foreign workers; their      labor here contributes immensely to the American economy and      secures the continued employment of hundreds of thousands of      nursery farm managers, office, marketing, sales, and other      staff--good American jobs that will move to Canada or Mexico      or China if we do not have a stable and legal workforce      performing the nursery work that cannot be readily      mechanized.       ANLA has long supported AgJOBS because its bipartisan,      common-sense reforms reflect how our country and our Congress      must confront and solve myriad tough challenges. AgJOBS      recognizes the unique experience and talent of the farm labor      force that is here, now, feeding America, and encourages      these workers to continue contributing to the well-being of      our nation as they earn their way to a brighter future.      AgJOBS also provides a lasting solution through a sweeping      overhaul of the H-2A program. Indeed, we could not support a      bill that fails to provide a lasting solution. Many ANLA      members now use H-2A and many more will be able to when the      reforms of AgJOBS are enacted.       Senator, we have shared a difficult journey, and the      journey is far from complete. We look forward to the      enactment of the urgently-needed reforms of AgJOBS, whether      as part of a much broader effort to reform America's failing      immigration system, or as part of a strategic first step.      Again, thank you for your leadership.           Sincerely,                                          Robert J. Dolibois, CAE,                                         Executive Vice President.                                             Craig J. Regelbrugge,     Vice President for Government Relations.                                  ____                                            Americas Majority,                                  Overland Park, KS, May 11, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to commend you on the      AgJobs Act of 2009, a piece of legislation crucial to      maintaining America's position in an increasingly      internationalized market in vegetables, fruits, and grains.      The bill is a paradigm of what immigration reform should be--     friendly alike to families and businesses, but mindful of the      needs of public safety.       It is well known to those who represent agricultural      constituents that foreign migrant workers are crucial to      American farmers, ranchers, and foresters. What is less      understood is the vast network of white collar jobs that      depend on maintaining access to guest workers in America.      Roughly one half of the agricultural labor force consists of      those who work with crops in field, nurseries, and      greenhouses. The rest, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics      NAICS codes reveal, represent a cross section of American      skills: Managers in production, finance, transportation, and      sales; computer programmers and systems analysts; accountants      and auditors; life scientists and agricultural engineers;      pilots and truck drivers, riggers and diesel mechanics;      salesmen, secretaries and receptionists--an entire world of      white collar jobs on American soil, much of it dependent on      the competitive nature of our operations in the fields,      nurseries, and greenhouses.       It has become fashionable in some circles to pretend that      the exclusion of foreign workers from America's farms will      relieve American farmers of their competition. This is not      so. It is possible, had one the heart for it, to remove      Mexican nationals from American fields--but we cannot remove      Argentinians from Argentina, Brazilians from Brazil, or      Malaysians from Malaysia. A healthy agricultural industry      requires access to all types of labor, including field labor,      on a competitive basis, here in America.       We hope you will succeed in moving AgJobs 2009 to keep      American agriculture competitive.           Best,                                                   Richard Nadler,     President.                                  ____                                                     May 11, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing out of deep concern      for the future of the agricultural industry in California,      and the U.S. generally. For reasons set forth more fully      below, it is imperative that Congress pass legislation this      year, such as AgJOBS, that will provide agriculture with a      stable, reliable and legal workforce.       As you know, California agriculture relies upon a large      immigrant workforce. The current economic crisis and rampant      unemployment has only confirmed what you and our industry      have been saying for years: American workers will not do      these jobs. Despite staggering job losses, there has been no      perceptible shift in the demographic makeup of our workforce.      Today, as always, our industry relies on a community of      talented immigrant farmworkers. They are the best farmworkers      in the world, and our industry would cease to exist without      them.       Honest employers who do not intend to hire illegal      immigrants, but unknowingly do when employees provide them      with false but genuine-appearing employment verification      documents, stand beneath the proverbial Sword of Damocles,      never knowing if their workforce--or they themselves--will be      hauled off by federal agents. Where should agricultural      employers look to find labor when Americans won't do the job      and the ones that will are largely falsely documented? The      answer is not the current H-2A program, which is notoriously      cumbersome, uneconomical and prone to litigation.       I submit that the best opportunity to solve the farm labor      issues in California and the U.S. is AgJOBS. AgJOBS would      provide workable and fair legal channels for farmworkers to      enter the country, work, and return home after completing the      season. At the same time, there is a clear and compelling      need for experienced farmworkers who lack legal status to be      given a chance to earn legal status over time, subject to      reasonable conditions.       California's $32 billion dollar agricultural industry      produces one-half of the nation's fruits, vegetables and tree      nuts. Without the passage and implementation of AgJOBS,      California and the nation will continue to export farms along      with the field jobs and three to four upstream and downstream      jobs that are created in the agricultural industry.      Furthering U.S. dependency on imported crops from countries      such as China is not only dangerous for our health, it is      devastating to our economy.       It is imperative that AgJOBS pass this year. On behalf of      Western Growers, I urge you to introduce AgJOBS in the Senate      as soon as possible, as this legislation must not be delayed      any longer.           Sincerely,                                             Thomas A. Nassif,                                                President and CEO,     Western Growers.                                  ____                                          United Farm Workers,                                          Keene, CA, May 14, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your leadership on      the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security      Act (``AgJOBS'').       As you are well-aware, the status quo for farmworkers and      agricultural employers is untenable and must be reformed. The      majority of farmworkers lack immigration status. Because they      live and work in the shadows, undocumented farmworkers are      too fearful to complain about violations of their wages and      working conditions and are vulnerable to exploitation by      labor contractors and growers. The wages of all farmworkers      are depressed by the presence of so many employees who lack      any meaningful bargaining power. The ability to legalize the      immigration status of farmworkers under AgJOBS is key to      enabling farmworkers to bargain for better working and living      conditions.       With this letter are just a few stories of farmworkers and      their families who will be helped by the passage of AgJOBS.      The United Farm Workers collected these stories from      farmworkers and farmworker groups and unions throughout the      country. There are thousands more like them.       Thank you for your continued leadership and commitment to      AgJOBS. We look forward to working with you to achieve this      desperately needed reform.           Sincerely,                                              Arturo S. Rodriguez,     President                                  ____                                       The National Association of                             State Departments of Agriculture,                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2009.

NASDA supports the Agricultural Job Opportunity,      Benefits and Security Act of 2009 (AgJOBS).       As leaders in agriculture, we recognize that a critical      workforce need exists today in agriculture. Millions of      American jobs depend on agricultural production and will be      enhanced with legislation that can secure a legal work force      for agriculture as well as regularize the status of current      agricultural workers through an adjustment program problem.      Farmers in most regions of the United States have faced      critical shortages of entry level workers for many years.      AgJOBS is a solution for workers and agriculture producers.       NASDA has carefully considered the farm labor issue and has      concluded that Congress needs to enact immigration reform      legislation that provides workable and fair legal channels      for farmworkers to enter the country, work, and return home      when the season is over. The best opportunity to achieve both      of these goals is the bipartisan and time-tested AgJOBS.       NASDA's current policy on agricultural labor is consistent      with the objectives of the AgJOBS legislation. NASDA policy      addresses four areas of concern to all agricultural      industries: concern for the basic rights of all agricultural      workers, recognition that the current H2A program does not      serve as a viable means for addressing gaps in the local      workforce, the need for a trustworthy identification system      for non-citizen workers, and the need to regularize the      status of the existing workforce during a transition to a      more transparent and enforceable means of meeting basic      workforce needs.       We greatly appreciate your support and reintroduction of      this important legislation.                                                   Ron Sparks,                                    NASDA President, Commissioner,     Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries.                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.       To The Members of the United States Senate: The U.S.      Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation      representing more than three million businesses and      organizations of every size, sector, and region, supports the      ``Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of      2009'' (AgJOBS), which is expected to be introduced today.       The Chamber supports a comprehensive solution to fixing      America's broken immigration system and believes that AgJOBS      is a step towards that goal and one that can be taken now.      One of the bill's most important attributes is that it      provides a reasonable mechanism for the most experienced, but      unauthorized agricultural workers to earn legal status      subject to strict conditions.       Agriculture is a sector that is highly sensitive to foreign      competition. Forcing much of U.S. agricultural production      offshore through an enforcement-only approach to immigration      policy is resulting in significant loss of American jobs and      leaving the United States less secure. The U.S. agriculture      sector is the most reliant on the foreign-born labor supply.      However, each farmworker sustains jobs in the upstream and      downstream economy--equipment, supplies and services,      packaging and distribution, lending and insurance.       The bipartisan AgJOBS is the fruit of years of hard work by      business and labor, conservatives and liberals, Republicans      and Democrats alike. The Chamber urges your support for      enactment of AgJOBS, this year.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten,     Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.                                  ____  Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform--Members and Supporters       AgriMark Inc; Agri-Placement Services; Allied Federated Co-     Ops, Inc; Allied Grape Growers; Almond Hullers and      Processors; American Agri-Women; American Frozen Foods      Institute; American Horse Council; American Mushroom      Institute; American Nursery & Landscape Association; American      Sheep Industry Association; CoBank; Council of Northeast      Farmer Cooperatives; Dairy Farmers of America; Dairylea      Cooperative, Incorporated; Farwest Equipment Dealers      Association; Federation of Employers and Workers of America;      Gulf Citrus Growers Association; Irrigation Association; Land      O' Lakes.
