The result of more than four decades of advocacy from such giants of the women's equality movement as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the amendment was merely a first step in advancing women's rights.  Since the ratification of the 19th Amendment, there has been considerable progress in the march for gender equality. The President's Commission on the Status of Women, established by President Kennedy and directed by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, in part led to formation of the National Organization for Women. NOW's core issues include two on which this Congress has been rightly focused: ending violence against women, and promoting economic justice.  The country last week celebrated the 20th anniversary of the enactment ofthe Violence Against Women Act. This landmark law shined a light on the scourge of domestic violence and improved the criminal justice system's response to these cases. Last year, Congress again came together to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA to address the evolving needs of domestic and sexual violence victims, and to ensure that those protections are available to all victims, regardless of sexual orientation, ethnicity, race or gender. The VAWA reauthorization law, which I was proud to author, was just one example of how we must continue to build on the historic work of past years in advancing equal rights and opportunities for American women.  And earlier this week, the Senate yet again tried to move forward with legislation to address pay equality. Building on more than 50 years of progress, starting with the Civil Rights Act, which barred employment discrimination based on race and gender, and on the heels of the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act would take a significant step toward ensuring a balanced and equal environment for women in the workplace. Unfortunately, for the fourth time, partisan objections have prevented the Senate from advancing this legislation to hold employers accountable and to protect employees from retaliation for discussing their salaries with colleagues. Vermont has adopted its own Equal Pay Act, making it illegal for employers to offer anything less than equal pay for equal work. Still, in Vermont, where 22,000 households are headed by women, the yearly gender pay gap is nearly $6,000. More needs to be done, and we can do better.  This year, Vermont will mark two important anniversaries. Thirty years ago, Vermont voters sent the first woman in our history to the State House to serve as Governor. Madeleine Kunin, a trailblazer in Vermont, served for 6 years as Governor, before becoming a Deputy Secretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. As a child, she fled the threat of the Holocaust, leaving Switzerland with her family for the hope and promise of America. She returned to the country that she had been forced to flee when President Clinton appointed her to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland. She continues to lead and inspire as an author, educator, mentor to women in politics, and tireless advocate for women's rights.  Later this year, the Vermont Women's Fund will celebrate 20 years of supporting women, both in the workplace and at home. The Fund helps women overcome economic hardships to live secure and successful lives. The Fund guides young women to opportunities in nontraditional career paths and propels future leaders to reach their goals. As we well know, when women are given an equal opportunity, their achievements are elevated. When women are given equal opportunities, they thrive and often rise to the top. When women are given a fair shot, their contributions at home, in the workplace and in our communities make us all better. The Vermont Women's Fund, with its diverse and representative council, works to establish and preserve that progress for Vermonters.  In the nearly 95 years since the Nation came together to belatedly extend the right to vote to women, we have made considerable strides in advancing gender equality. More than two dozen women lead Fortune 500 companies, an achievement once viewed as unattainable to young women entering the workforce. Women have risen to some of the highest ranks in our government. Women now comprise a majority of students enrolled in college. In Vermont, we are proud of our history in advancing women's rights. Leaders like Madeleine Kunin, and programs like the Vermont Women's Fund, are shining examples of why Vermont is a leader in this social progress for women and our entire society. And we are proud to be a national leader in the advancement of women. Congress, and the country, can learn and benefit from Vermont's trailblazing example.                          ____________________
