Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore [Mr. Bonilla] having assumed the chair, Mr. Hastings of Washington, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 478) to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to improve the ability of individuals and local, State, and Federal agencies to comply with that Act in building, operating, maintaining, or repairing flood control projects, facilities, or structures, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
