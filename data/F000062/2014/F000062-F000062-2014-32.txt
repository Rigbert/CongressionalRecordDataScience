S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  There is no question that David Barron has the background and qualifications for this position.  Consider his credentials: over a decade as a Harvard law professor; 3 years at the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, in the Clinton administration, and another 2 years at OLC under President Obama as the Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of that office--during which time he was awarded the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service and the National Intelligence Exceptional Achievement Medal from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; he clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens and Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt; he earned his bachelor's and law degrees from Harvard; and a substantial majority of the ABA Committee found him to be ``well qualified,'' their highest rating.  In sum, David Barron's record shows that he will be a jurist of the highest caliber.  He also has a strong record of standing up for what is right on many issues, whether it is campaign finance or gay rights.  Many distinguished individuals in both parties have written to the Judiciary Committee to support Professor Barron. Among them are: Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor and former head of OLC under President George W. Bush, Michael McConnell, conservative law professor and former Tenth Circuit judge, who described Barron as ``one of President Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate courts;'' Charles Fried, law professor and former Solicitor General under President Reagan; 15 former career attorneys at OLC who served in administrations of both parties; and Ron George, former chief justice of California and someone I deeply respect.  Chief Justice George wrote:       As a person who served for 38 years in a state court      system, the last 14 years as chief justice of California, I      have been particularly impressed by Mr. Barron's      understanding and respect for the critical role played by the      states and their courts in our federal system.  I respected the strong desire of some of my colleagues to have access to the two OLC memos related to the targeted killing of an American named Anwar al-Awlaki. Those memos were authored while Barron was Acting Assistant Attorney General at OLC.  However, I regret that even though the administration made those two opinions available to all Senators and even though the administration has recently decided to make the OLC analysis public, some still insist on delaying a vote on Professor Barron's nomination.  Let's contrast David Barron's nomination with that of another former head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Jay Bybee, who led the office from 2001 to 2003.  He was in charge of OLC when it produced an opinion saying waterboarding and nine other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques were not torture. On August 1, 2002, Mr. Bybee signed an opinion that set an unconscionably high bar for torture by saying that ``physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'' That opinion was withdrawn during the Bush administration by Bybee's successor, Harvard Law Professor Jack Goldsmith.  Under Bybee, OLC also produced opinions about President Bush's Terrorist Surveillance Program that contain very troubling legal analysis. Because those opinions remain classified, I will not describe them here other than to note that they authorized a secret surveillance program that involved the collection of the content of communications without a court order and was in clear violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Those OLC opinions also were withdrawn by Bybee's successor, Professor Goldsmith.  Despite the fact that those opinions were produced when he was head of OLC, Jay Bybee was nominated by the Bush administration to a Nevada seat on the Ninth Circuit. He was confirmed 74 to 19 in March 2003. I was one of 19 voting no.  Why would we confirm the man who approved the so-called ``torture memos'' and led OLC when it approved President Bush's surveillance program but delay David Barron, who produced superior legal work as head of OLC? The only reason I have heard is that Senators may believe that the two OLC opinions on Anwar al-Awlaki should be made public. Let me address that.  First, this week the Department of Justice took steps to ensure that the OLC analysis will be made public. The Justice Department has decided not to appeal a court order from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals requiring the OLC analysis to be made public. So this will happen in the near future.  Second, Professor Barron left OLC in 2010--well before the strike killed Awlaki in Yemen in September 2011. Since 2010, Professor Barron has been in academia.  It wasn't Barron's decision to withhold the OLC memos from Congress or from the public.  Let me quote from Professors Laurence Tribe and Charles Fried, both legal experts often on opposite sides of issues. They wrote an op-ed together about Barron in the Boston Globe. It reads, in part:       [Barron] has not advocated, much less ordered, the      withholding of any documents. His job as acting head of the      Office of Legal Counsel was to provide thorough, accurate,      and unvarnished legal opinions to the president and other      executive officials, based on the traditional legal      authorities of text, history, and precedent. We have every      reason to believe that is precisely what he did, and there is      absolutely no evidence to the contrary.  In fact, Professor Barron implemented policies that have made OLC more rigorous, professional, and transparent.  First, when he was acting head of OLC, Barron ordered the withdrawal of several opinions related to coercive interrogation that had been issued during the Bush administration.  Second, on July 16, 2010, Professor Barron wrote a memo entitled ``Re: Best Practices for OLC Legal Advice and Written Opinions'' that updated previous OLC guidance. It said that OLC ``operates from the presumption that it should make its significantopinions fully and promptly available to the public. This presumption furthers the interests of Executive Branch transparency, thereby contributing to accountability and effective government, and promoting public confidence in the legality of government action.'' This presumption did not exist in the Bush administration; David Barron was responsible for establishing it as OLC policy. Given Barron's impressive record and his shift of OLC toward more transparency, it simply is wrong to oppose his nomination because a classified OLC opinion on drone strikes has not been made public yet, a decision that was not even his to make.  Since the OLC opinions on Anwar al-Awlaki that Professor Barron wrote seem to have become the issue holding up this nomination, let me close with a reminder of the specific plotting Awlaki was involved in before he was killed in 2011.  True, Awlaki was a dual U.S.-Yemeni citizen, but he served as chief of external operations for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP. In that position, he planned and directed attacks against the United States, making him an imminent and continuing threat.  Awlaki played a significant operational role in AQAP. In 2010, the United States designated Awlaki a ``Specially Designated Global Terrorist'' for ``supporting acts of terrorism and for acting for or on behalf of AQAP.''  Awlaki publicly urged attacks against U.S. persons and interests worldwide. He worked with another American named Samir Khan to publish AQAP's Inspire Magazine to encourage terrorist attacks against innocent men, women, and children in the United States and elsewhere. As a reminder, Inspire Magazine provided the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston with the instructions for making the bomb they used at the Boston Marathon last year.  Let me offer just a few examples of Awlaki's direct involvement in terrorist operations:  Christmas Day Attack--In December 2009, Awlaki directed operative Umar Faruk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate an explosive device aboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit on Christmas Day. Awlaki instructed Abdulmutallab to detonate the device while over U.S. airspace to maximize casualties.  Fort Hood Attack--Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan attended al-Awlaki's sermons in Virginia and corresponded at least 18 times with him through email. After the attack, Awlaki posted on his blog praising Hasan's actions and calling him his ``student and brother.''  Times Square Bombing Attempt--Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators in early 2010 that he was ``inspired by'' Awlaki and communicated with him.  Package Bomb Plot--in October 2010, Awlaki had a direct role in supervising and directing AQAP's failed attempt to bring down two U.S. cargo aircraft by detonating explosives concealed inside two packages mailed to Chicago-area synagogues.  In sum, there is no doubt that Awlaki was chief of external operations for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, and a continuing and imminent threat to the United States.  David Barron's legal analysis of whether the United States can target Awlaki is cogent, careful legal analysis and reflects the kind of consideration of due process that we should applaud, not punish.  Barron certainly should not be disqualified because he was the head of OLC when that targeting decision--a targeting decision Barron did not advocate for--was being contemplated and analyzed by the Obama administration.  Let me conclude by saying this: David Barron is an impressive lawyer and scholar with a strong record. Nobody doubts that. Distinguished lawyers on both sides of the aisle have endorsed him wholeheartedly.  The reason for this is simple: His qualifications are first rate, and he has under his belt many years of commendable scholarship and service to this nation.  Simply put, he will be an outstanding jurist for the people of the First Circuit, and I very much hope my colleagues will support him.                          ____________________
