 President, I yield myself 5 minutes and I ask to be informed at the end of those 5 minutes. I am not going to take the time to speak to why this is a killer amendment and why this is so important, because I could not improve upon what the Senator from Indiana said. I mean that sincerely.  It is real basic. This gets down to real basic considerations. Anybody who has the capacity to transfer technology can do that right now.
