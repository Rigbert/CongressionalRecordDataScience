President, I will not object, but I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes after the Senator from South Dakota, and I believe the Senator from North Dakota will be seeking recognition for 20 minutes. I don't know when Senator Lieberman is arriving. Would it be appropriate now to lock in these three requests--10 minutes for the Senator from South Dakota, 10 minutes for myself, and 20 minutes for the Senator from North Dakota?
