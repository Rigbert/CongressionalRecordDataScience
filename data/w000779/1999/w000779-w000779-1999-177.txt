I gather the Senator from North Carolina, who is getting us into this area, was largely talking about the tort section. That, of course, is the difference of opinion here. I believe it would be a mistake to try to ``tortify'' these contractual rights at this time when we are staring, early in the next century, at all of these liabilities.  I have three good friends with whom I agree on probably the vast majority of issues that come up in this body who see it otherwise. I recognize that. But I want to, again, in the name of trying to work things out, make it clear if there is anything in the contract section--in the contract section--that would suggest a plaintiff cannot get the economic losses they are entitled to under State contract law, I am very certain Senator McCain and Senator Dodd and I will be happy to look at that. We do have a difference of opinion on this matter involving torts.
