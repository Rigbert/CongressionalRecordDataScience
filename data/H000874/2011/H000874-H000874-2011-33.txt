 If I can clarify, and I understand that we are coming up to the end of the year. There is a lot of business which needs to be done in the time remaining, and so I understand his urging to be flexible.  My Members have asked me, I'm sure Your members have as well, Friday the 9th is scheduled on the calendar to be a nonwork day, as a matter of fact, the 8th was the target date. Either side very rarely meets its target. But in your flexibility--clearly we've told our Members the following week, the week of the 12th, that undoubtedly we're going to be here. But can you give them some sort of confidence level with respect to the 9th, or is that not possible?  I yield to my friend.
