Chairman, I rise in opposition to the King amendment.  What is interesting to me is that the net effect of the King amendment would be to drive wages down, another Republican amendment to not really show any respect for the workers of this country. Are they all going to work for poverty wages?  Millions of our citizens still remain out of work, the middle class is shrinking, and here we have a Member that stands up and he wants to have lower wages. The public wants Congress to create middle class jobs and to pay people what they are worth.  The interesting thing about this amendment is that, when you look back at all the studies that have been done, for instance, when President Bush suspended Davis-Bacon wages during the Hurricane Katrina rebuilding efforts, construction costs went updue to the dramatic increase in the employment of unqualified workers.  I would like to say to the gentleman--and I know you are a handyman because you have told me you are--that the people who work on these projects are ironworkers. I defy anybody in this place to do that. I think Stephen Lynch did that work. Congressman Lynch is about the only one that survived that. Boilermakers, carpenters, operating engineers, electricians, laborers, sheet metal workers, cement masons, roofers, painters, these people go up on those high bridges and they risk their lives. They need training. And do you know what? They deserve the wage they get under contract--under contract--not by happenstance, not by accident.  I find it interesting that the gentleman offers this amendment, because in your district, since 1995, you have received $9 billion in Federal subsidy that goes to your farmers. I don't see the gentleman railing against the subsidies that come to your district. You get insurance. Your farmers get insurance if they lose their crop. What does an ironworker get if he falls off high scaffolding in New York City or Toledo, Ohio, or Cleveland or wherever? What does that worker get?  It is interesting--I think the gentleman is kind of disingenuous--your State ranks second in the Nation for agriculture subsidies. The Federal Government holds you up. Davis-Bacon simply says that, when you go to work, the price of what you are paid, your labor, is by contract; it is not by happenstance; it is not by accident; it is not by exploitation. In fact, we know when better buildings are built, when safe bridges are built, there are no washouts under tunnels and bridges. That is a good thing. That is a good thing for America.  So I hold respect for the workers who want to work, who receive the training to work, who know how difficult the work is.  I will tell you a story from my own district. We built one of the biggest bridges in Ohio several years back. We lost ironworkers and an operating engineer in that process, though we had signed every kind of safety agreement we could possibly sign. And do you know what happened? The construction company decided, because there were at least two lanes, they would pit sets of workers against one another to see who could finish the job fast enough. What happened was some of the cranes were not secured at the base as they hung above the river. The construction company, which was supposed to be abiding by the law and all the safety standards, found a trick in order to save a couple of pennies, and it cost the lives of some of the finest workers in the country.                              {time}  1345  I devoted months and months and months to making sure that there were good safety standards in place. And they always find a way around it.  This is dangerous work. This is work that most people in this Chamber most likely never thought about, never did; don't understand what these workers go through in cold winter months, hanging above oil rigs across this country; handling public projects underground, above ground, above water.  It is unbelievable what these people do. They go to other countries. Look at the dangerous scaffolding that exists in places like Ukraine, and you respect the trades of this country, who have managed to build apprenticeship and training programs so we don't lose lives needlessly.  Davis-Bacon assures we have a middle class standard; that we have labor valued by contract, not by accident, not by happenstance, not by subsidy, like the gentleman's district gets, but by plain hard work.  I couldn't be more in opposition to any amendment offered this afternoon, and I think the gentleman must be misguided in what he is trying to do here. But I think it is important to have definable standards.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would ask Members to address their remarks to the Chair and not to other Members in the second person.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
