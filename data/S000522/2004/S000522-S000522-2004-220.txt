Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 409), recognizing with humble gratitude the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the United States Armed Forces during World War II and the Americans who supported the war effort on the home front and celebrating the completion of the National World War II Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 409       Whereas the National World War II Memorial on the National      Mall in the District of Columbia will be the first national      memorial to both recognize the courage, bravery, and      unselfish dedication of the members of the United States      Armed Forces who served in World War II and those who served      on the home front and acknowledge the commitment and      achievement of the entire American people in that conflict;        Whereas World War II veteran Roger Durbin of Berkey, Ohio,      first proposed the construction of a National World War II      memorial, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur of     Ohio introduced legislation to establish the memorial in the      District of Columbia to honor members of the Armed Forces who      served in World War II and to commemorate the participation      of the United States in that war;       Whereas, in Public Law 103-32 (107 Stat. 90; 40 U.S.C. 8903      note), approved May 25, 1993, Congress authorized the      American Battle Monuments Commission, an independent Federal      agency, to design and construct the memorial;       Whereas the location selected as the site for the memorial,      the Rainbow Pool site on the National Mall at the east end of      the Reflecting Pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the      Washington Monument, was dedicated on November 11, 1995;       Whereas, in an open competition, the American Battle      Monuments Commission selected Friedrich St. Florian as the      design architect for the memorial, and his final      architectural design was approved by the Commission of Fine      Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the      Secretary of Interior;       Whereas the late Representative Bob Stump of Arizona, who      served as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and      the Committee on Armed Services of the House of      Representatives, sponsored several measures to expedite the      funding and construction of the memorial, which were enacted      as sections 601, 602, and 603 of Public Law 106-117 and      Public Law 107-11;       Whereas after eight years of planning, six years of public      deliberation, and four years of fund raising, construction      began on the memorial in September 2001;       Whereas the memorial would not have been possible without      the efforts and dedication of National Chairman Senator      Robert J. Dole and National Co-Chairman Frederick W. Smith,      who were instrumental in raising over $194,000,000 for the      construction of the memorial;       Whereas these generous contributions came from hundreds of      thousands of individual Americans, as well as corporations,      foundations, veterans groups, fraternal and professional      organizations, States, communities, and schools;       Whereas actor Tom Hanks, the Advertising Council, and the      History Channel played a key role in increasing public      awareness of the heroic achievements of American World War II      veterans and the war effort and in raising support for the      memorial;       Whereas President George W. Bush will formally dedicate the      memorial on May 29, 2004;       Whereas the memorial will be a monument to the selfless      sacrifice and undaunted courage of the members of the United      States Armed Forces who served in World War II and a place of      remembrance to honor the more than 400,000 American      servicemen and servicewomen who died in that conflict      defending the United States; and       Whereas the memorial will be a source of inspiration for      current and future generations of Americans, giving visitors      to the memorial a new appreciation for the accomplishments of      America's World War II generation, which united in the quest      to free the world from tyranny: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress recognizes with humble gratitude      the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the United      States Armed Forces during World War II and the Americans who      supported the war effort on the home front and celebrates the      completion of the National World War II Memorial on the      National Mall in the District of Columbia.
