 President, I want to speak on behalf of the pending measure, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, which the Senate will pass shortly.  This bipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive lucrative stock options from their employers--once considered the exclusive perk of corporate executives.  Senator Dodd and I have worked closely with Senators Jeffords and Enzi, Abraham, Bennett, and Lieberman, the Department of Labor, and others to develop this critical bill.  We have the support of groups representing business and workers, as well as Secretary Alexis Herman. In short, everybody wins with this proposal.  All over the country today, forward-thinking employers are offering new financial opportunities--such as stock options--to hourly employees.  Unfortunately, it appears that our 1930's vintage labor laws might not allow the normal workers of the 21st century to reap these benefits.  When we realized this, we decided to fix this problem. It would be a travesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the average employee to share in his or her company's economic growth.  The Workers Economic Opportunity Act is really very simple. It says that it makes no difference if you work in the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor--everyone should be able to share in the success of the company.  In sum, the bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure that employer-provided stock option programs are allowed, just like employee bonuses already are.  Also, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that specifies that employers have no liability because of any stock options or similar programs that they have given to employees in the past.  I hope that this bill will be the first of many commonsense efforts to drag old labor and employment laws into the new millennium.  Mr. President, we need to pass this law. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently estimated that 17 percent of firms have introduced stock option programs.  They went on to say that over the last two years, 37 percent of these employers have broadened eligibility for their stock option programs--allowing even more American workers to share in their employers' prosperity.  The Employment Policy Foundation estimates between 9.4 million and 25.8 million workers receive benefits through some type of equity participation program.  This trend is growing, and given the current state of the economy, it is likely to continue to grow.  However, we have one last thing we have to do to make sure that American workers can have this incredible opportunity--we have to pass this bill.  Without it, our ``New Deal'' labor laws will strangle the benefits our ``New Economy'' offers to American workers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the United States Chamber of Commerce be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2000.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to express the support      of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest      business federation representing more than three million      businesses and organizations of every size, sector and      region, for S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act.       Last year the U.S. Department of Labor issued an advisory      letter stating that companies providing stock options to      their employees must include the value of those options in      the base rate of pay for hourly workers. Employers must then      recalculate overtime pay over the period of time between the      granting and exercise of the options. This costly and      administratively complex process will cause many employers to      refrain from offering stock options and similar employee      equity programs to their nonexempt workers.       Clearly, the Fair Labor Standards Act needs to be      modernized to reflect the fact that many of today's hourly      workers receive stock options. For this reason, the Chamber      strongly supports S. 2323, which would exempt stock options,      stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase plan      programs from the regular rate of pay for nonexempt workers.      This carefully crafted legislation will provide certainty to      employers who want to increase employee ownership and equity      building by offering stock options and similar programs to      their hourly workers. We commend you for negotiating a bill      that is broadly supported and look forward to working with      you to ensure its passage as soon as possible in this      legislative session.       Again, thank you for your leadership in introducing S.      2323, legislation that is important to millions of American      workers and employers.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the sponsors' statement of legislative intent be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Joint Statement of Legislative Intent by the Sponsors of S. 2323, the                     Worker Economic Opportunity Act                      I. Introduction and Purpose       The purpose of S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity      Act, is to allow employees who are eligible for overtime pay      to continue to share in workplace benefits that involve their      employer's stock or similar equity-based benefits. More      working Americans are receiving stock options or      opportunities to purchase stock than ever before. The Worker      Economic Opportunity Act updates the Fair Labor Standards Act      to ensure that rank-and-file employees and management can      share in their employer's economic well being in the same      manner.       Employers have provided stock and equity-based benefits to      upper level management for decades. However, it is only      recently that employers have begun to offer these programs in      a broad-based manner to non-exempt employees. Historically,      most employees had little contact with employer-provided      equity devices outside of a 401(k) plan. But today, many      employers, from a broad cross-section of industry, have begun      offering their employees opportunities to purchase employer      stock at a modest discount, or have provided stock options to      rank and file employees; and they have even provided outright      grants of stock under certain circumstances.       The Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently estimated      that 17 percent of large firms have introduced a stock      options program and 37 percent have broadened eligibility for      their stock option programs in the last two years.\1\ The      Employment Policy Foundation estimates between 9.4 million      and 25.8 million workers receive benefits through some type      of equity participation program.\2\ The trend is growing, and      given the current state of the economy, it is likely to      continue.---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The tremendous success of our economy over the last several      years has been largely attributed to the high technology      sector. One of the things that our technology companies have      succeeded at is creating an atmosphere in which all employees      share the same goal: the success of the company. By vesting      all employees in the success of the business, stock options      and other equity devices have become an important tool to      create businesses with unparalleled productivity. The Worker      Economic Opportunity Act will encourage more employers to      provide opportunities for equity participation to their      employees, further expanding the benefits that inure from      equity participation.                II. Background and Need for Legislation     A. Background on stock options and related devices       Employers use a variety of equity devices to share the      benefits of equity ownership with their employees. As the      employer's stock appreciates, these devices provide a tool to      attract and retain employees, an increasingly difficult task      during a time of record economic growth and low unemployment      in the United States. These programs also foster a broader      sense of commitment to a common goal--the maintenance and      improvement of the company's performance--among all employees      nationally and even internationally, and thus provide an      alignment between the interests of employees with the      interests of the company and its shareholders. They can also      reinforce the evolving employer-employee relationship, with      employees viewed as stakeholders.       Employer stock option and stock programs come in all      different types and formats. The Worker Economic Opportunity      Act focuses on the most common types: stock option, stock      appreciation right, and employee stock purchase programs.       Stock Option Programs.--Stock options provide the right to      purchase the employer's securities for a fixed period of      time. Stock option programs vary greatly by employer.      However, two main types exist: nonqualified and qualified      option programs.\3\ Most programs are nonqualified stock      option programs, meaning that the structure of the program      does not protect the employee from being taxed at the time of      exercise. However, the mechanics of stock option programs are      very similar regardless of whether they are nonqualified or      qualified. Some of these characteristics are described below.       Grants. An employer grants to employees a certain number of      options to purchase shares of the employer's stock. The      exercise price may be around the fair market value of the      stock at the time of the grant, or it may be discounted below      fair market value to provide the employee an incentive to      participate in the option program.       Vesting. Most stock option programs have some sort of      requirement to wait some period after the grant to benefit      from the options, often called a vesting period. After the      period, employees typically may exercise their options by      exchanging the options for stock at the exercise price at any      time before the option expires, which is typically up to ten      years. In some cases, options may vest on a schedule, for      example, with a third of the options vesting each year over a      three-year period. In addition to vesting on a date certain,      some options may vest if the company hits a certain goal,      such as reaching a certain stock price for a certain number      of days. Some programs also provide for accelerated or      automatic vesting in certain circumstances such as when an      employee retires or dies before the vesting period has run,      where there is change in corporate control or when an      employee's employment is terminated.       Exercise. Under both qualified and nonqualified stock      option programs, an employee can exchange the options, along      with sufficient cash to pay the exercise price of the      options, for shares of stock. Because many rank-and-file      employees cannot afford to pay the cost of buying the stock      at the option price in cash, many employers have given their      employees the opportunity for ``cashless'' exercise, either      for cash or for stock, under nonqualified option plans. In a      cashless exercise for cash, an employee gives options to a      broker or program administrator, this party momentarily      ``lends'' the employee the money to purchase the requisite      number of shares at the grant price, and then immediately      sells the shares. The employee receives the difference      between the market price and the exercise price of the stock      (the profit), less transaction fees. In a cashless exercise      for stock, enough shares are sold to cover the cost of buying      the     shares the employee will retain. In either case, the employee      is spared from having to provide the initial cash to purchase      the stock at the option price.       An employee's options usually expire at the end of the      option period. An employee may forfeit the right to exercise      the options, in whole or in part, under certain      circumstances, including upon separation from the employer.      However, some programs allow the employee to exercise the      options (sometimes for a limited period of time) after they      leave employment with the employer.       Stock Appreciation Rights.--Stock appreciation rights      (SARs) operate similarly to stock options. They are the      rights to receive the cash value of the appreciation on an      underlying stock or equity based security. The stock may be      publicly traded, privately held, or may be based on valued,      but unregistered, stock or stock equivalent. The rights are      issued at a fixed price for a fixed period of time and can be      issued at a discount, carry a vesting period, and are      exercisable over a period of time. SARs are often used when      an employer cannot issue stock because the stock is listed on      a foreign exchange, or regulatory or financial barriers make      stock grants impracticable.       Employee Stock Purchase Plans.--Employee stock purchase      plans (ESPPs) give employees the opportunity to purchase      employer stock, usually at up to a 15 percent discount, by      either regularly or periodically paying the employer directly      or by having after-tax money withdrawn as a payroll      deduction. Like option programs, ESPPs can be qualified or      nonqualified.       Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code \4\ sets forth the      factors for a qualified ESPP. The ability to participate must      be offered to all employees, and employees must voluntarily      choose whether to participate in the program. The employer      can offer its stock to employees at up to a 15 percent      discount off of the fair market value of the stock,      determined at the time the option to purchase stock is      granted or at the time the stock is actually purchased. The      employee is required to hold the stock for one or two years      after the option is granted to receive capital gains      treatment. If the employee sells the stock before the      requisite period, any gain made on the sale is treated as      ordinary income.       Nonqualified ESPPs are usually similar to qualified ESPPs,      but they lack one or more qualifying features. For example,      the plan may apply only to one segment of employees, or may      provide for a greater discount.     B. The Fair Labor Standards Act and stock options       The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \5\ (FLSA) establishes      workplace protections including a minimum hourly wage and      overtime compensation for covered employees, record keeping      requirements and protections against child labor, among other      provisions. A cornerstone of the FLSA is the requirement that      an employer pay its nonexempt employees overtime for all      hours worked over 40 in a week at one and one-half times the      employee's regular rate of pay.\6\ The term ``regular rate''      is broadly defined in the statute to mean ``all remuneration      for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee.'' \7\       Section 207(e) of the statute excludes certain payments      from an employee's regular rate of pay to encourage employers      to provide them, without undermining employees' fundamental      right to overtime pay. Excluded payments include holiday      bonuses or gifts,\8\ discretionary bonuses,\9\ bona fide      profit sharing plans,\10\ bona fide thrift or savings      plans,\11\ and bona fide old-age, retirement, life, accident      or health or similar benefits plans.\12\ By excluding these      payments from the definition of ``regular rate,'' \13\      Congress recognized that certain kinds of benefits provided      to employees are not within the generally accepted meaning of      compensation for work performed.       Thus, by excluding these payments from the regular rate in      section 207(e) of the FLSA, Congress encouraged employers to      provide these payments and benefits to employees. The      encouragement has worked well--employees now expect to      receive from their employer at least some of these benefits      (i.e., healthcare), which today, on average, comprise almost      30 percent of employees' gross compensation./14/ For similar      reasons, Congress decided that the value and income from      stock option, SAR and ESPP programs should also be      excluded from the regular rate, because they allow      employees to share in the future success of their      companies.     C. The Department of Labor's opinion letter on stock options       The impetus behind the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is      the broad dissemination of a February 1999 advisory opinion      letter \15\ regarding stock options issued by the Department      of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, the agency charged with      the administration of the FLSA. The letter involved an      employer's stock option program wherein its employees would      be notified of the program three months before the options      were granted, and some rank-and-file employees employed by      the company on the grant date would receive options. The      options would have a two-year vesting period, with      accelerated vesting if certain events occurred. The employer      would also automatically exercise any unexercised options on      behalf of the employees the day before the program ended.\16\       The opinion letter indicated that the stock option program      did not meet any of the existing exemptions to the regular      rate under the FLSA, although it did not explain the reasons      in any detail. Later, the Administration's testimony before      the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee explained that      the stock option program did not meet the gift, discretionary      bonus, or profit sharing exceptions to the regular rate      because, among other reasons, it required employees to do      something as a condition of receiving the options--to remain      employed with the company for a period of time.\17\ Such a      condition is not allowed under the current regular rate      exclusions. The testimony also noted that the program was not      excludable under the thrift or savings plan exception because      the employees were only allowed to exercise their options      using a cashless method of exercise, and thus the employees      could not keep the stock as savings or an investment.\18\       The opinion letter stated that the employer would be      required to include any profits made from the exercise of the      options in the regular rate of pay of its nonexempt      employees. In particular, the profits would have to be      included in the employee's regular rate for the shorter of      the time between the grant date and the exercise date, or the      two years prior to exercise.19       Section 207(e)'s exclusions to the regular rate did not      clearly exempt the profits of stock options or similar equity      devices from the regular rate, and thus from the overtime      calculation. Thus, the Department of Labor's opinion letter      provided a permissible reading of the statute. A practical      effect of the Department of Labor's interpretation was stated      by J. Randall MacDonald, Executive Vice President of Human      Resources and Administration at GTE during a March 2 House      Workforce Protections Subcommittee hearing on the issue:      ``[i]f the Fair Labor Standards Act is not corrected to      reverse this policy, we will no longer be able to offer stock      options to our nonexempt employees.'' 20       As the contents of the letter became generally known in the      business community and on Capitol Hill, it became clear that      the letter raised an issue under the FLSA that previously had      not been contemplated. It further became clear that an      amendment to the FLSA would be needed to change the law      specifically to address stock options.       A legislative solution was not only supported by employers      at the House hearing, it was also supported by employees and      unions. Patricia Nazemetz, Vice President of Human Resources      for Xerox Corporation, read a letter from the Union of      Needlework, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), the      union that represents many Xerox manufacturing and      distribution employees, in which the International Vice      President stated:       ``Xerox's UNITE chapter would strongly urge Congress to      pass legislation exempting stock options and other forms of      stock grants from the definition of the regular rate for the      purposes of calculating overtime. . . . It is only recently      that Xerox has made bargaining unit employees eligible to      receive both stock options and stock grants. Without a      clarification to the FLSA, we are afraid Xerox may not offer      stock options or other forms of stock grants to bargaining      unit employees in the future.'' 21       At the House hearing, the Administration also acknowledged      that the problem needed to be fixed legislatively in a      flexible manner, ``Based on the information we have been able      to obtain, there appears to be wide variations in the scope,      nature and design of stock option programs. There is no one      common model for a program, suggesting the need for a      flexible approach. Given the wide variety and complexity      of programs, we believe that the best solution would be to      address this matter legislatively.'' 22       The general agreement on the need to fix the problem among      these diverse interests led to the development of the Worker      Economic Opportunity Act.            III. Explanation of the Bill and Sponsors' Views       Congress worked closely with the Department of Labor to      develop this important legislation. The sections below      reflect the discussions between the sponsors and the      Department of Labor during the development of the      legislation, and the sponsors' intent and their understanding      of the legislation.     A. Definition of bona fide ESPP       For the purposes of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, a      bona fide employee stock purchase plan includes an ESPP that      is (1) a qualified ESPP under section 423 of the Internal      Revenue Code;23 or (2) a plan that meets the      criteria identified below.       1. Qualified employee stock purchase plans       Qualified ESPPs, known as section 423 plans, comprise the      overwhelming majority of stock purchase plans. Thus, the      intent of the legislation is to deem ``bona fide'' all plans      that meet the criteria of section 423.       2. Nonqualified employee stock purchase plans       As described above, section 423 plans are considered bona      fide ESPPs. Further, those ESPPs that do not meet the      criteria of section 423, but that meet the following criteria      also qualify as bona fide ESPPs:       (a) the plan allows employees, on a regular or periodic      basis, to voluntarily provide funds, or to elect to authorize      periodic payroll deductions, for the purchase at a future      time of shares of the employer's stock;       (b) the plan sets the purchase price of the stock as at      least 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time      the option is granted or at the time the stock is purchased;      and       (c) the plan does not permit a nonexempt employee to accrue      options to purchase stock at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of      fair market value of such stock (determined either at the      time the option is granted or the time the option is      exercised) for each calendar year.       The sponsors note that many new types of ESPPs are being      developed, particularly by     companies outside the United States, and that many of these      companies may also intend to apply them to their U.S.-based      employees. These purchase plans have several attributes which      make them appear to be more like savings plans than      traditional U.S. stock purchase plans, such as a period of      payroll deductions of between three and five years, or an      employer provided ``match'' in the form of stock or options      to the employee.       Further many companies are developing plans that are      similar to section 423 plans. The sponsors believe that it is      in the best interests of employees for the Secretary of Labor      to review these and other new types of plans carefully in the      light of the purpose of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act--     to encourage employers to provide opportunities for equity      participation to employees--and to allow section 7(e), as      amended, to accommodate a wide variety of programs, where it      does not undermine employees' fundamental right to overtime      pay. It is the sponsors' vision that this entire law be      flexible and forward-looking and that the Department of Labor      apply and interpret it consistently with this vision.     B. ``Value or Income'' is defined broadly       The hallmark of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is that      section 7(e)(8) provides that any value or income derived      from stock option, SAR or bona fide ESPP programs is excluded      from the regular rate of pay. For this reason, the phrase      ``value or income'' is construed broadly to mean any value,      profit, gain, or other payment obtained, recognized or      realized as a result of, or in connection with, the      provision, award, grant, issuance, exercise or payment of      stock options, SARs, or stock issued or purchased pursuant to      a bona fide ESPP program established by the employer.       This broad definition means, for example, that any nominal      value that a stock option or stock appreciation right may      carry before it is exercised is excluded from the regular      rate. Similarly, the value of the stock or the income in the      form of cash is excluded after options are exercised, as is      the income earned from the stock in the form of dividends or      ultimately the gains earned, if any, on the sale of the      stock. The discount on a stock option, SAR or stock purchase      under a ESPP program is likewise excludable.     C. The act preserves programs which are otherwise excludable          under existing regular rate exemptions       The Worker Economic Opportunity Act recognizes two ways      that employer equity programs may be excluded from the      regular rate. Such equity programs may be excluded if they      meet the existing exemptions to the regular rate pursuant to      Section 7(e)(1)-(7), which apply to contributions and sums      paid by employers regardless of whether such payments are      made in cash or in grants of stock or other equity based      vehicles, and provided such payment or grant is consistent      with the existing regulations promulgated under Section 7(e).      Employer equity plans also may be excluded under new section      7(e)(8) added by the Worker Economic Opportunity Act.       This is reaffirmed in new section 207(e)(8), which makes      clear that the enactment of section 7(e)(8) carries no      negative implication about the scope of the preceding      paragraphs of section (e). Rather, the sponsors understand      that some grants and rights that do not meet all the      requirements of section 7(e)(8) may continue to qualify for      exemption under an earlier exclusion. For example, programs      that grant options or SARs that do not have a vesting period      may be otherwise excludable from the regular rate if they      meet another section (7)(e) exclusion. This would be true      even if the option was granted at less than 85% of fair      market value. This language was not intended to prevent      grants or rights that meet some but not all of the      requirements of an earlier exemption in 7(e) from being      exempt under the newly created exemption.     D. Basic communication to employees required because it helps          ensure a successful program       For grants made under a stock option, SAR or bona fide ESPP      program to qualify for the exemption under new section      7(e)(8), their basic terms and conditions must be      communicated to participating employees either at the      beginning of the employee's participation in the program or      at the time of grant. This requirement was put into the      legislation to recognize that when employees understand the      mechanics and the implications of the equity devices they are      given, they can more fully participate in exercising      meaningful choices with respect to those devices. As      discussed below, this is a simple concept, it is not intended      to be a complicated or burdensome requirement.       1. Terms and conditions to be communicated to employees       Employers must communicate the material terms and      conditions of the stock option, stock appreciation right or      employee stock purchase program to employees to ensure that      they have sufficient information to decide whether to      participate in the program. With respect to options, these      terms include basic information on the number of options      granted, the number of shares granted per option, the grant      price, the grant date or dates, the length of any applicable      vesting period(s) and the dates when the employees will first      be able to exercise options or rights, under what conditions      the options must be forfeited or surrendered, the exercise      methods an employee may use (such as cash for stock, cashless      for cash or stock, etc.), any restrictions on stock purchased      through options, and the duration of the option, and what      happens to unexercised options at the end of the exercise      period. Pending issuance of any regulations, an employer who      communicated the information in the prior sentence is to be      deemed to have communicated the terms and conditions of the      grant. Similar information should be provided regarding SARs      or ESPPs.       2. The mode of communications       The legislation does not specify any particular mode of      communication of relevant information, and no particular      method of communication is required, as long as the method      chosen reasonably communicates the information to employees      in an understandable fashion. For example, employers may      notify their employees of an option grant by letter, and      later provide a formal employee handbook, or other method      such as a link to a location on the company Intranet. Any      combination of communications is acceptable. The intent of      the legislation is to ensure that employees are provided the      basic information in a timely manner, not to mandate the      particular form of communication.       3. The timing of communications       The legislation specifies that the employer is to      communicate the terms and conditions of the stock option, SAR      and ESPP programs to employees at or before the beginning of      the employee's participation in the program or at the time      the employee receives a grant. It is acceptable, and perhaps      even likely, that the relevant information on a program will      be disseminated in a combination of communications over time.      This approach allows flexibility and acknowledges that types      of participation vary greatly between stock option and SAR      programs, on the one hand, and ESPPs on the other.       For example, under an ESPP, an employee may choose to begin      payroll deductions in January, but not actually have the      option to purchase stock until June. By contrast, with an      option or SAR program, employees are given the options or      rights at the outset, but those rights may not vest until      some year in the future.       The timing of the communication is flexible, because often      it is difficult to have materials ready for employees at the      beginning of a stock option or stock appreciation right      program, immediately following approval by the Board of      Directors, because of confidentiality requirements. Thus,      within a reasonable time following approval of a stock option      grant by the Board of Directors, the employer is required to      communicate basic information about the grant employees have      received. For example, an initial letter may notify the      employees that they have received a certain number of stock      options and provide the basic information about the program.      More detailed information about the program may precede or      follow the grant in formats such as an employee handbook,      options pamphlet, or an Intranet site that provides options      information.     E. Exercisability criteria applicable only to stock options          and SARs       As discussed above, a common feature in grants of stock      options and SARs is a vesting or holding period, which under      current practice may be as short as a few months or as long      as a number of years. For a stock option or SAR to be      excluded from the regular rate pursuant to the Worker      Economic Opportunity Act, new section 7(e)(8) requires that      the grant or right generally cannot be exercisable for at      least six months after the date of grant.       For stock option grants that include a vesting requirement,      typically an option will become exercisable after the vesting      period ends. Some option grants vest gradually in accordance      with a schedule. For example, a portion of the employee's      options may vest after six months, with the remaining portion      vesting three months thereafter. Options may also vest in      connection with an event, such as the stock reaching a      certain price or the company attaining a performance target.       In addition, the sponsors recognize that a grant that is      vested may not be currently exercisable by the employee      because of an employer's requirement that the employee hold      the option for a minimum period prior to exercise. In other      words, there may be an additional period of time after the      vesting period during which the option remains      unexerciseable. An option or SAR may meet the exercisability      requirements of the bill without regard to the reason why the      right to exercise is delayed.       Further, if a single grant of options or SARs includes some      options exercisable after six months while others are      exercisable earlier, then those exercisable after the six      month period will meet the exercisability requirement even if      the others do not. The determination is made option by      option, SAR by SAR. In addition, if exercisability is tied to      an event, the determination of whether the six-month      requirement is met is based on when the event actually      occurs. Thus, for example, if an option is exercisable only      after an initial public offering (IPO) and the IPO occurs      seven months after grant, the option shall be deemed to have      met the provision's exercisability requirement.       However, section 7(e)(8)(B) specifically recognizes that      there are a number of special circumstances when it is      permissible for an employer to allow for earlier exercise to      occur (in less than 6 months) without loss of the exemption.      For example, an employer or plan may provide that a grant may      vest or     otherwise become exercisable earlier than six months because      of an employee's disability, death, or retirement. The      sponsors encourage the Secretary to consider and evaluate      other changes in employees' status or circumstances.       Earlier exercise is also permitted in connection with a      change in corporate ownership. The term change in ownership      is intended to include events commonly considered changes in      ownership under general practice for options and SARs. For      example, the term would include the acquisition by a party of      a percentage of the stock of the corporation granting the      option or SAR, a significant change in the corporation's      board of directors within 24 months, the approval by the      shareholders of a plan of merger, and the disposition of      substantially all of the corporation's assets.       The sponsors believe it important to allow employers the      flexibility to construct plans that allow for these earlier      exercise situations. However, this section is not intended to      in any way require employers to include these or any other      early exercise circumstances in their plans.     F. Stock option and SAR programs may be awarded at fair          market value or discounted up to and including 15%       Stock options and SARs generally are granted to employees      at around fair market value or at a discount. New section      7(e)(8)(B) recognizes that grants may be at a discount, but      that the discount cannot be more than a 15% discount off of      the fair market value of the stock (or in the case of stock      appreciation rights, the underlying stock, security or other      similar interest).       A reasonable valuation method must be used to determine      fair market value at the time of grant. For example, in the      case of a publicly traded stock, it would be reasonable to      determine fair market value based on averaging the high and      low trading price of the stock on the date of the grant.      Similarly, it would be reasonable to determine fair market      value as being equal to the average closing price over a      period of days ending with or shortly before the grant date      (or the average of the highs and lows on each day). In the      case of a non-publicly traded stock, any reasonable valuation      that is made in good faith and based on reasonable valuation      principles must be used.       The sponsors understand that the exercise price of stock      options and SARs is sometimes adjusted in connection with      recapitalizations and other corporate events. Accounting and      other tax guidelines have been developed for making these      adjustments in a way that does not modify a participant's      profit opportunity. Any adjustment conforming with these      guidelines does not create an issue under the 15% limit on      discounts.     G. Employee participation in equity programs must be          voluntary       New section (8)(C) of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act      states that the exercise of any grant or right must be      voluntary. Voluntary means that the employee may or may not      choose not to exercise his or her grants or rights at any      point during the stock option, stock appreciation right, or      employee stock purchase program, as long as that is in      accordance with the terms of the program. This is a simple      concept and it is not to be interpreted as placing any other      restrictions on such programs.       It is the intent of the sponsors that this provision does      not restrict the ability of an employer to automatically      exercise stock options or SARs for the employee at the      expiration of the grant or right. However, an employer may      not automatically exercise stock options or SARs for an      employee who has notified the employer that he or she does      not want the employer to exercise the options or rights on      his or her behalf.       Stock option, SARs and ESPP programs may qualify under new      section 7(e)(8) even though the employer chooses to require      employees to forfeit options, grants or rights in certain      employee separation situations.     H. Performance based programs       The purpose of new section 7(e)(8)(D) is to set out the      guidelines employers must follow in order to exclude from the      ``regular rate'' grants of stock options, SARs, or shares of      stock pursuant to an ESPP program based on performance. If      neither the decision of whether to grant nor the decision as      to the size of the grant is based on performance, the      provisions of in new section 7(e)(8)(D) do not apply. For      example, grants made to employees at the time of their hire,      and any value or income derived from these grants, may be      excluded provided they meet the requirements in new sections      7(e)(8)(A)-(C).       New section 8(D) is divided into two clauses. The first,      clause (i), deals with awards of options awarded based on      pre-established goals for future performance, and the second,      clause (ii), deals with grants that are awarded based on past      performance.       1. Goals for future performance       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) provides that employers may tie      grants to future performance so long as the determinations as      to whether to grant and the amount of grant are based on the      performance of either (i) any business unit consisting of at      least ten employees or (ii) a facility.       A business unit refers to all employees in a group      established for an identifiable business purpose. The      sponsors intend that employers should have considerable      flexibility in defining their business units. However, the      unit may not merely be a pretext for measuring the      performance of a single employee or small group of fewer than      ten employees. By way of example, a unit may include any of      the following: (i) a department, such as the accounting or      tax departments of a company, (ii) a function, such as the      accounts receivable function within a company's accounting      department, (iii) a position classification, such as those      call-center personnel who handle initial contacts, (iv) a      geographical segment of a company's operations, such as      delivery personnel in a specified geographical area, (v) a      subsidiary or operating division of a company, (vi) a project      team, such as the group assigned to test software on various      computer configurations or to support a contract or a new      business venture.       With respect to the requirement to have ten or more      employees in a unit, this determination is based on all of      the employees in the unit, not just those employees who are,      for example, non-exempt employees.       A facility includes any separate location where the      employer conducts its business. Two or more locations that      would each qualify as a facility may be treated as a single      facility. Performance measurement based on a particular      facility is permitted without regard to the number of      employees who are working at the facility. For example, a      facility would include any of the following: a separate      office location, each separate retail store operated by a      company, each separate restaurant operated by a company, a      plant, a warehouse, or a distribution center.       The definitions of both a business unit and a facility are      intended to be flexible enough to adapt to future changes in      business operations. Therefore, the examples of business      units set forth above should be viewed with this in mind.       Options may be excluded from the regular rate in accordance      with new section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) under the following      circumstances:       Example 1--Employer announces that certain employees at the      Wichita, Kansas plant will receive 50 stock options if the      plant's production reaches a certain level by the end of the      year (note that in order to fit within this subsection, the      grant does not have to be made on a facility wide basis);       Example 2--Employer announces that it will grant employees      working on the AnyCo. account 50 stock options each if the      account brings in a certain amount of revenue by the end of      the year, provided that there are at least 10 employees on      the AnyCo. account.       Employer 3--Employer announces that certain employees will      receive stock options if the company reaches specified goal.       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) also makes clear that otherwise      qualifying grants remain excludable from the regular rate if      they are based on an employees' length of service or minimum      schedule of hours or days of work. For example, an employer      may make grants only to employees: (i) who have a minimum      number of years of service, (ii) who have been employed for      at least a specified number of hours of service during the      previous twelve month period (or other period), (iii) who are      employed on the grant date (or a period ending on the grant      date), (iv) who are regular full-time employees (i.e., not      part-time or seasonal), (v) who are permanent employees, or      (vi) who continue in service for a stated period after the      grant date (including any minimum required hours during this      period). Any or all of these conditions, and similar      conditions, are permissible.       2. Past performance       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii) clarifies that employers may      make determinations as to existence and amount of grants or      rights based on past performance, so long as the      determination is in the sole discretion of the employer and      not pursuant to any prior contract. Thus, employers have      broad discretion to make grants as rewards for the past      performance of a group of employees, even if it is not a      facility or business unit, or even for an individual      employee. The determination may be based on any performance      criteria, including hours of work, efficiency or      productivity.       Under new section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii), employers may develop a      framework under which they will provide options in the      future, provided that to the extent the ultimate      determination as to the fact of and the amount of grants or      rights each employee will receive is based on past      performance, the employer does not contractually obligate      itself to provide the grant or rights to an employee. Thus,      new section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii) would allow an employer to      determine in advance that it will provide 100 stock options      to all employees who receive ``favorable'' ratings on their      performance evaluations at the end of the year, and it would      allow the employer to advise employees, in employee handbooks      or otherwise, of the possibility that favorable evaluations      may be rewarded by option grants, so long as the employer      does not contractually obligate itself to provide the grants      or in any other way relinquish its discretion as to the      existence or amount of grants.       Similarly, the fact that an employer makes grants for      several years in a row based on favorable performance      evaluation ratings, even to the point where employees come to      expect them, does not mean in itself that the employer may be      deemed to have ``contractually obligated'' itself to provide      the rights.       Some examples of performance based grants that fit within      new section7(e)(8)(D)(ii) are as follows:       Example A--Company A awards stock options to encourage      employees to identify with the company and to be creative and      innovative in performing their jobs. Company A's employee      handbook includes the following: ``Company A's stock      option program is a long-term incentive used to recognize      the potential for, and provide an incentive for,      anticipated future performance and contribution. Stock      option grants may be awarded to employees at hire, on an      annual basis, or both. All full-time employees who have      been employed for the appropriate service time are      eligible to be considered for annual stock option      grants.''       Company A provides stock options to most nonexempt      employees following their performance review. Each employee's      manager rates the employee during a review process, resulting      in a rating of from 1 to 5. The rating is based upon the      manager's objective and subjective analysis of the employee's      performance. The rating is then put into a formula to      determine the number of options an employee is eligible to      receive, based on the employee's level within the company,      the product line that the employee works on, and the value of      the product to the company's business. Employees are aware a      formula is used. The Company then informs the employee of the      number of options awarded to him or her.       Managers make it clear to employees that the options are      granted in recognition of prior performance with the      expectation of the employee's future performance, but no      contractual obligation is made to employees. This process is      repeated annually, with employees eligible for stock options      each year based on their annual performance review. Most      employees receive options annually based upon their      performance review rating and their level in the company.       Example B--Company B manages its program similarly to      company A, with some notable exceptions. Company B has a very      detailed performance management system, under which all      employees successfully meeting the expectations of their job      receive options. The employee's job expectations are more      clearly spelled out on an annual basis than under Company A's      plan. Once a year, the employee undergoes a formal, written,      performance review with his or her manager. If work is      satisfactory, the employee receives a predetermined but      unannounced number of options. Unlike Company A, which      provides different amounts of options to employees based upon      a numeric performance rating, Company B provides the same      number of options to all employees who receive satisfactory      employment evaluations. Over 90 percent of Company B's      employees receive options annually, and in many years, this      percentage exceeds 95 percent.       In both Example A and Example B, the employers set up in      advance the formula under which option decisions are made;      however, the decisions as to whether an individual employee      would receive options and how many options he or she would      receive was made based on past performance at the end of the      performance period, but not pursuant to a prior contractual      obligation made to the employees. The fact that the employer      determines a formula or program in advance does not      disqualify these examples from new section 7(e)(8).     I. Extra compensation       The Worker Economic Opportunity Act also amends section      7(h) of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(h)) to ensure that the      income or value that results from a stock option, SAR or ESPP      program, and that is excluded from the regular rate by new      section 7(e)(8), cannot be credited by an employer toward      meeting its minimum wage obligations under section 6 of the      Act or overtime obligations under section 7 of the Act. The      language divides section 7(h) into two parts, 7(h)(1) and      7(h)(2). Section 7(h)(1) states that an employer may not      credit an amount, sum, or payment excluded from the regular      rate under existing sections 7(e)(1-7) or new section 7(e)(8)      towards an employer's minimum wage obligation under section 6      of the Act. When section 7(h)(1) is read together with      section 7(h)(2), it states that an employer may not credit an      amount excluded under existing sections 7(e)(1-4) or new      section 7(e)(8) toward overtime payments. However, consistent      with existing 7(h), extra compensation paid by an employer      under sections 7(e)(5-7) may be creditable towards an      employer's overtime obligations. This change shall take      effect on the effective date but will not affect any payments      that are not excluded by section 7(e) and thus are included      in the regular rate.     J. The legislation includes a broad pre-effective date safe          harbor and transition time       In drafting the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, the      sponsors hoped to create an exemption that would be broad      enough to capture the diverse range of broad-based stock      ownership programs that are currently being offered to non-     exempt employees across this nation. However, in order to      reach a consensus, the new exemption had to be tailored to      comport with the existing framework of the FLSA. The result      is a series of requirements that stock option, SAR and ESPP      programs must meet in order for the proceeds of those plans      to fit within the newly created exemption.       Because of the circumstances that give rise to this      legislation, the pre-effective date safe harbor is      intentionally broader than the new exemption. The sponsors      did not want to penalize those employers who have been      offering broad-based stock option, SAR and ESPP programs      simply because these programs would not meet all the new      requirements in section 7(e)(8). Thus, the safe harbor in      section 2(d) of the Act comprehensively protects employers      from any liability or other obligations under the FLSA for      failing to include any value or income derived from stock      option, SAR and ESPP programs in a non-exempt employee's      regular rate of pay. The safe harbor applies to all grants or      rights that were obtained under such programs prior to the      effective date, whether or not such programs fit within the      new requirements of section 7(e)(8). If a grant or right was      initially obtained prior to the effective date, it is covered      by the safe harbor even though it vested later or was      contingent on performance that would occur later. In      addition, normal adjustments to a pre-effective date grant or      right, such as those that are triggered by a      recapitalization, change of control or other corporate event,      will not take the grant or right outside the safe harbor.       On a prospective basis, the sponsors realized that many      employers would need time to evaluate their programs in light      of the new law and to make the changes necessary to ensure      that the programs will fit within the new section 7(e)(8)      exemption. Consequently, the sponsors adopted a broad      transition provision to apply to stock option, SAR and      ESPP programs without regard to whether or not they meet      the requirements for these plans set forth in the      legislation. Specifically, section 2(c) of the legislation      contains a 90-day post enactment delayed effective date.      The sponsors believe that the vast majority of employers      who offer stock option, SAR and ESPP programs to non-     exempt employees will be able to use the transition period      in section 2(d)(1) to modify their programs to conform      with the requirements of the legislation.       In addition, the sponsors felt that there were two      circumstances where a further extension of this broad      transition relief was appropriate. First, the legislation      recognizes that some employers would need the consent of      their shareholders to change their plans. Section 2(d)(2)      provides an additional year of transition relief to any      employer with a program in place on the date this legislation      goes into effect that will require shareholder approval to      make the changes necessary to comply with the new      requirements of section 7(e)(8). Second, the legislation      extends the transition relief to cover situations wherein an      employer's obligations under a collective bargaining      agreement conflict with the requirements of this Act. Section      2(d)(3) eliminates any potential conflict by allowing      employers to fulfill their pre-existing contractual      obligations without fear of liability.                     V. Regulatory impact statement       The sponsors have determined that the bill would result in      some additional paperwork, time and costs to the Department      of Labor, which would be entrusted with implementation of the      Act. It is difficult to estimate the volume of additional      paperwork necessitated by the Act, but the sponsors do not      believe that it will be significant.                    VI. Section-by-Section Analysis       Sec. 2. (a) Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act--The      legislation amends Section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards      Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(e)) by creating a new      subsection, 7(e)(8), which will exclude from the definition      of the regular rate of pay any income or value nonexempt      employees derive from an employer stock option, stock      appreciation right, or bona fide employee stock purchase      program under certain circumstances. Specifically, the      legislation adds the following provisions to the end of      Section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act:       (8) The new exclusion provides that when an employer gives      its employees an opportunity to participate in a stock      option, stock appreciation right or a bona fide employee      stock purchase program (as explained in the Explanation of      the Bill and Sponsor's Views), any value or income received      by the employee as a result of the grants or rights provided      pursuant to the program that is not already excludable from      the regular rate of pay under sections 7(e)(1-7) of the Act      (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(e)), will be excluded from the regular      rate of pay, provided the program meets the following      criteria--       (8)(A) The employer must provide employees who are      participating in the stock option, stock appreciation right      or bona fide employee stock purchase program with information      that explains the terms and conditions of the program. The      information must be provided at the time when the employee      begins participating in the program or at the time when the      employer grants the employees stock options or stock      appreciation rights.       (8)(B) As a general rule, the stock option or stock      appreciation right program must include at least a 6 month      vesting (holding) period. That means that employees will have      to wait at least 6 months after they receive stock options or      a stock appreciation rights before they are able to exercise      the right for stock or cash. However, in the event that the      employee dies, becomes disabled, or retires, or if there is a      change in corporate ownership that impacts the employer's      stock or in other circumstances set forth at a later date by      the Secretary in regulations, the employer has the ability to      allow its employees to exercise their stock options or stock      appreciation rights sooner. The employer may offer stock      options or stock appreciation rights to employees at no more      than a 15 percent discount off the fair market value of the     stock or the stock equivalent determined at the time of the      grant.       (8)(C) An employee's exercise of any grant or right must be      voluntary. This means that the employees must be able to      exercise their stock options, stock appreciation rights or      options to purchase stock under a bona fide employee stock      purchase program at any time permitted by the program or to      decline to exercise their rights. This requirement does not      preclude an employer from automatically exercising      outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights at the      expiration date of the program.       (8)(D) If an employer's grants or rights under a stock      option or stock appreciation right program are based on      performance, the following criteria apply.       (1) If the grants or rights are given based on the      achievement of previously established criteria, the criteria      must be limited to the performance of any business unit      consisting of 10 or more employees or of any sized facility      and may be based upon that unit's or facility's hours of      work, efficiency or productivity. An employer may impose      certain eligibility criteria on all employees before they may      participate in a grant or right based on these performance      criteria, including length of service or minimum schedules of      hours or days of work.       (2) The employer may give grants to individual employees      based on the employee's past performance, so long as the      determination remains in the sole discretion of the employer      and not according to any prior contract requiring the      employer to do so.       (b) Extra Compensation--The bill amends section 7(h) of the      Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 207(h) to make clear that      the amounts excluded under section 7(e) of the bill are not      counted toward an employer's minimum wage requirement under      section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act and that the      amounts excluded under sections 7(e)(1)-(4) and new section      7(e)(8) are not counted toward overtime pay under section 7      of the Act.       (c) Effective Date--The amendments made by the bill take      effect 90 days after the date of enactment.       (d) Liability of Employers--       (1) No employer shall be liable under the FLSA for failing      to include any value or income derived from any stock option,      stock appreciation right and employee stock purchase program      in an non-exempt employee's regular rate of pay, so long as      the employee received the grant or right at any time prior to      the date this amendment takes effect.       (2) Where an employer's pre-existing stock option, stock      appreciation right, or employee stock purchase program will      require shareholder approval to make to the changes necessary      to comply with this amendment, the employer shall have an      additional year from the date this amendment takes effect to      change its plan without fear of liability.       (3) Where an employer is providing stock options, stock      appreciation rights, or an employee stock purchase program      pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that is in      effect on the effective date of this amendment, the employer      may continue to fulfill its obligations under that collective      bargaining agreement without fear of liability.       (e) Regulations--the bill gives the Secretary of Labor      authority to promulgate necessary regulations.       Submitted April 12, 2000 by the Sponsors of S. 2323.     Mitch McConnell.
