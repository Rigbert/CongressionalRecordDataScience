Mr. Speaker, Patricia Smith, a constituent of mine from Jackson, New Jersey and the President of Lyme Disease Association, Inc., LDA, recently testified before the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee regarding the need to establish an advisory committee on Tick-Borne Diseases. I would like to submit her compelling testimony from the hearing, entitled ``Examining Public Health Legislation to Help Local Communities,'' for the Record:       Chairman Pitts and Committee Members, Thank you for      allowing me to testify on the need to establish an advisory      committee on Lyme disease to ensure that government resources      are being appropriately used to move forward the field of      science and treatment in an area that is fraught with      political, scientific, and medical obstacles, yet is      dominating discussion on the worldwide stage. In 2009, the      Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) indicated that      Lyme surpassed HIV in incidence followed by a 2013      announcement confirming a 10-fold under-reporting of Lyme      cases, estimating 300,000 Lyme cases annually. A 2001      National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored study found      that the impact of Lyme disease on physical health status was      at least equal to the disability of patients with congestive      heart failure or osteoarthritis, was greater than those      observed in type II diabetes or in recent myocardial      infarction, and chronic pain contributing to impairment was      similar to that reported by patients with osteoarthritis.      Couple those facts with Lyme spreading worldwide to 80      countries and the discovery of many newly emerging tick-borne      pathogens being carried by many different ticks, then the      passage of HR 610 is long overdue.       The LDA just revised its comprehensive education and      prevention brochure, LymeR Primer, which went from featuring      7 tick-borne diseases (TBD) in 2009 to 15 diseases. Besides      Lyme disease, there are at least 15 other TBD of concern in      the US: anaplasmosis; babesiosis, bartonellosis;      ehrlichiosis; Rocky Mountain Spotted fever; Colorado tick      fever; Q fever; tick paralysis; tularemia; Powassan      encephalitis; STARI, a Lyme-like disease often with the same      rash, transmitted by a lone star tick bite, pathogen cause      unknown, but may be a bacteria similar to the Lyme bacteria;      Rickettsia parkeri Ricketsiosis found increasingly along the      Gulf Coast and in the South; Borrelia miyamotoi, a tick-borne      bacteria which had been producing disease outside the US, now      found in the US; newly found Ricketsia species 364D in the      Pacific Region; and a newly discovered tick-borne virus in      Missouri, Heartland, carried by the lone star tick. One tick-     bite can give someone more than one disease.       My education on Lyme began almost 30 years ago as a NJ      Board of Education member whose district had a large number      of students and staff out with Lyme disease. Then, only a few      US ticks were recognized as major health threats to humans.      Now, many ticks in the US are causing more human diseases,      ticks including Ixodes scapularis (deer, black legged),      Amblyomma americanum (lone star), Dermacentor variabilis      (American dog), Dermacentor andersoni (Rocky Mt. wood),      Ixodes pacificus (western black legged), Amblyomma maculatum      (Gulf Coast), and Dermacentor occidentalis (Pacific Coast).       My Lyme work, including 17+ as president of the national      volunteer-run non-profit Lyme Disease Association (LDA), has      kept me in close contact with patients nationwide. The      complicated nature of Lyme disease, the difficulty in      diagnosis, and lack of recognition by some in the medical      community have exacerbated the plight of patients and their      families, many of which contain more than one Lyme victim.      Medical bills rise; jobs are lost; education is interrupted.      Divorce is not an uncommon result in these families, further      complicating the picture. Often, the families are forced to      seek government help, government which is already burdened      with more debt than it is able to handle.       Children have always been at the highest risk of acquiring      Lyme disease. Based on CDC's Lyme reported cases numbers from      2001-2010 by age, LDA estimated that 37% of reported cases      were children. Using 1990-2011 CDC reported numbers adjusted      for 10-fold underreporting, LDA found that 1,590,449 children      have developed Lyme disease over that period. Many more      children were probably clinically diagnosed but not included      in the CDC surveillance figure, which uses a strict reporting      definition not meant for clinical diagnosis. These are      children who often go on to develop chronic Lyme disease--who      often miss months/years of school and have their childhood      destroyed. Showering, walking, talking, thinking can be a      problem, and serious pain is a daily challenge. A 1998      Columbia University study documents improvement in IQ of 22      points in a 16 year-old after IV treatment for Lyme disease.       A 1992 CDC/NJ Department of Health study in NJ of 64 school      children with Lyme showed that the median duration of Lyme at      time of interview was 363 days; the median number of days the      illness was said to have significantly affected normal      activities was 293; the mean number of total school days lost      was 140; the mean duration of home instruction, 153 days.      Only 26% of children under study were said to have fully      recovered.       The direct medical costs per case incurred by 54 case-     patients totaled $5.2 million, $8.7 million in CPI adjusted      2013 dollars. The mean estimate was $96,569 ($274,412-2013);      and costs of $100,000 ($166,891-2013) or greater were      incurred by more then 1/5 of children. Some indirect costs      were assessed totaling about $15,000 ($ 25,034-2013) due to      lost time caring for patient and parents' lost time      transporting children to medical treatment.       A 2001 Columbia study showed children with Lyme disease had      significantly more cognitive and psychiatric disturbances.      Cognitive deficits were still found after controlling for      anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Lyme disease in children      may be accompanied by long-term neuropsychiatric      disturbances, resulting in psychosocial and academic      impairments. Regarding depression, parents indicated that 41%      of children with LD had suicidal thoughts, 11% had made a      suicide gesture.       Early intervention and appropriate treatment are the      answers for patients with Lyme to prevent the development of      chronic Lyme disease, aka, Post Treatment Lyme Disease, late      disseminated Lyme, persistent Lyme, Post Lyme Disease      Syndrome, etc. While discussions continue on the      justifications for the various terms used for chronic Lyme      disease, we cannot allow the semantics to eclipse the need      for research on chronic Lyme, the area producing the most      human suffering and receiving the least research funding.      According to a new Columbia University Lyme study, based upon      10-fold underreporting and on 10% of newly infected and      treated patients developing symptoms that persist for more      than 6 months, ``the actual incidence of new chronic cases      (PTLS) is . . . 30,000.''       Currently, many major health threats including chronic      fatigue have an advisory committee. Lyme disease does not,      placing its patients and advocates at a great disadvantage.      We have lobbied for a research agenda which includes more      effective treatments for Lyme and other TBD and better      diagnostics, including detection of active infection. B.      burgdorferi was recognized in 1981 to cause Lyme, almost 33      years ago, yet the two-tier testing system endorsed by CDC is      very specific for Lyme disease (99%), so it gives few false      positives, but according to some sources, the tests have a      uniformly low sensitivity (56%)--missing 88 of every 200      patients with Lyme disease. Yet HIV was identified as the      cause of AIDS in 1984, and tests were developed within a few      years after and are 99% sensitive and specific. Moreover,      Lyme has not attracted industry funding for treatment      approaches, which has allowed patients to develop severe      mental and physical disabilities from the disease without      help from science. There is also a need for educating doctors      and the public about the state of the science regarding these      diseases.       The above agenda requires the establishment of a venue      where government agencies working on diverse aspects of tick-     borne diseases (e.g., CDC surveillance, testing; NIH research      funding-clinical trials, as well as basic and translational      research; FDA drug, vaccine and device approvals; USDA      research into natural tick prevention strategies; EPA tick      prevention strategies) can present their activities, submit      their proposed TBD agenda, and receive input from committee      members who represent a wide variety of stakeholders with      diverse scientific viewpoints on development of new      diagnostics, treatment methods, and prevention strategies.      Utilizing this format, government would ensure its agencies      were providing the most judicious use of human and      financial resources for Lyme and TBD. Using an already      established federal advisory committee format ensures that      the committee is only advisory in nature--committee      members would not control nor dictate agency agendas, a      concern that has been expressed by an outside group in the      past. However, those agencies should not be insulated from      the public input and diverse scientific viewpoints this      committee would provide in shaping an agenda and ensuring      the wise use of tight federal dollars, which are provided      by taxpayers. Another concern might be whether an advisory      committee is worth the costs, including time, to support      the operation of the committee. In the case of Lyme      disease, the history of the past decades should lead to an      easy yes.       One does not have to be a scientist to realize that it is      premature and unwise to preclude further clinical trials      studying a broader range of treatment regimens when there are      numerous major and significant aspects of the bacteria's      known pathophysiology which have not been accounted for in      studies conducted to date, when there are still many unknowns      in that pathophysiology, and when we are learning more every      day. While our knowledge of the pathophysiology of the      bacteria continues to evolve, we must be open to additional      clinical trials to document and establish better treatment      regimens. There is preliminary evidence for more effective      regimens, and a specific forum for open dialogue can help      ensure we move forward and don't get waylaid.       An open dialogue also could only improve the process of      utilizing the pool of competent researchers--not in any      manner that would interfere with established fair and open      processes for grant-making, but only to increase awareness.      It's a fact that a small number--a handful--of Lyme      researchers have individually received many millions of      federal research dollars, many of whom shared the same set of      biases and perspectives. Common biases and perspectives are      not objectionable if they are based upon the best scientific      evidence; open dialogue, information sharing, and      transparency can help safeguard the process and the      taxpayers' money.       Patients want research which will restore their health.      Their voice and the voice of the clinicians must be given the      necessary weight to legitimize the research agenda and the      research process. Truth in science can be achieved through      open discussion with diverse viewpoints in an independent      process free from bias and conflicts of interest. The      scientific process fails when one side of a debate controls      the arena and sets the rules to ensure that its viewpoint      prevails.               Patricia V. Smith Lyme Disease Association                          MAJOR POINTS SUMMARY       1. Lyme disease is increasing in numbers and range      worldwide, with CDC announcing U.S. cases are 300,000      annually. It is found in about 80 countries worldwide.       2. A government study has indicated the impact of Lyme      disease on patients is as severe as disability of patients      with congestive heart failure or osteoarthritis, is greater      than those observed in type II diabetes or in recent      myocardial infarction, and chronic pain contributing to      impairment is similar to that reported by patients with      osteoarthritis.       3. Other tick-borne diseases are being discovered with      greater frequency and people are becoming co-infected with a      number of diseases.       4. More ticks are spreading different diseases to humans.       5. My work with the Lyme Disease Association has put me in      close contact with patients who are sick and have other      family members with the disease, which is costly to them      financially and also impacts education and family structure.       6. Children are at the highest risk of acquiring Lyme      disease. They often miss long periods of school and      experience cognitive difficulties, severe pain, and may      attempt suicide related to their Lyme disease.       7. There is a need for HR 610 creating an advisory      committee which will permit all stakeholder input, including      treating physicians, patients, and advocates, to be presented      to government agencies. Currently patients have no voice.       8. The Committee would ensure that all sides of the science      would be factored into the decision making process.       9. Government agencies need to interact with other      government agencies, each bringing different perspectives and      priorities to the table.       10. Having diverse stakeholders at the table ensures all      perspectives are heard to develop a comprehensive coordinated      approach to tick-borne diseases, helping ensure that      government funding is used widely.       11. Truth in science can be achieved through open      discussion with diverse viewpoints in an independent process      free from bias and conflicts of interest.                          ____________________
