President, on Memorial Day, my wife Marcelle and I were honored to attend the dedication of the gleaming new World War II Memorial. This memorial is not only a testament to the sacrifice of the 16 million courageous men and women who served in that grand struggle, but, in some ways, it speaks to the tireless energy of our friend and former Senate majority leader, Bob Dole.  Senator Dole received a Purple Heart in Italy, yet never let the lingering effects of his very serious wounds stand in the way of his overall effectiveness and ability to lead the Senate. After he left office, he turned his special brand of energy and intelligence towards ensuring the completion of the new memorial. He helped raise awareness of the project across the country and was critical to helping gain congressional approval of the measure.  During the dedication, Senator Dole gave a moving tribute to his comrades-in-arms. These remarks helped give further context and meaning to the pillars, plaques, and fountains that make up this grand memorial.  I will ask to have these remarks included in the Record, and I implore all of my colleagues to take a few minutes to read this speech.  Today is a particularly fitting day to read Senator Dole's remarks, as today is his birthday. I want to wish my friend a very happy birthday.  I ask unanimous consent the speech be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Remarks of Senator Bob Dole--National WWII Memorial Dedication, May 29,                                   2004       In the first week of January 1945, a hungry and lonesome      second lieutenant from small town Kansas dispatched a message      to his folks back home: ``You can send me something to eat      whenever you are ready,'' he wrote. ``Send candy, gum,      cookies, cheese, grape jelly, popcorn, nuts, peanut clusters,      Vicks Vapo Rub, wool socks, wool scarf, fudge, cookies, ice      cream, liver and onions, fried chicken, banana cake, milk,      fruit cocktail, Swiss steaks, crackers, more candy,      Lifesavers, peanuts, the piano, the radio, the living room      suite, the record player and Frank Sinatra. I guess you might      as well send the whole house if you can get it into a five-     pound box. P.S., keep your fingers crossed.''       In authoring that only slightly exaggerated wish list I      merely echoed the longings of 16 million Americans whose      greatest wish was for an end to the fighting. Sixty years on      our ranks have dwindled for the thousands assembled here on      the Mall and the millions more watching all across America in      living rooms and hospitals and wherever it may be--our men      and women overseas and our friends in Great Britain and our      allies all around the world. Our final reunion cannot long be      delayed.       Yet if we gather in the twilight it is brightened by the      knowledge that we have kept faith with our comrades.      Sustained by over 600,000 individual contributions, we have      raised this memorial to commemorate the service and sacrifice      of an entire generation. What we dedicate today is not a      memorial to war, rather it's a tribute to the physical and      moral courage that makes heroes out of farm and city boys and      that inspires Americans in every generation to lay down their      lives for people they will never meet, for ideals that make      life itself worth living.       This is also a memorial to the American people who in the      crucible of war forged a unity that became our ultimate      weapon. Just as we pulled together in the course of a common      threat 60 years ago, so today's Americans united to build      this memorial. Small children held their grandfather's hand      while dropping pennies in a collection box. Entire families      contributed in memory of loved ones who could win every      battle except the battle against time. I think of my brother,      Kenny, and my brothers-in-law Larry Nelson and Allen Steel,      just three among the millions of ghosts in navy blue and      olive drab we honor with this memorial.       Of course, not every warrior wore a uniform. As it happens,      today is the 101st birthday of Bob Hope, the GI's favorite      entertainer who did more to boost our morale than anyone next      to Betty Grable. And I can already hear Bob . . . ``but I was      next to Betty Grable.'' And it's hard to believe, but today      is also the 87th birthday of John F. Kennedy, a hero of the      south Pacific, who, a generation after the surrender      documents were signed aboard the USS Missouri, spoke of a new      generation of Americans tempered by war that was nevertheless      willing ``to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any      hardship, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and      success of liberty.'' And we shall always honor the memory      of our great leader and our American hero, General      Eisenhower, who led us to victory all across the world.       As we meet here today, young Americans are risking their      lives in liberty's defense. They are the latest link in a      chain of sacrifice older than America itself. After all, if      we met the test of our times, it was because we drew      inspiration from those who had gone before, including the      giants of history who are enshrined on this Mall, from      Washington, who fathered America with his sword and ennobled      it with his character . . . from Jefferson, whose pen gave      eloquent voice to our noblest aspirations . . . from Lincoln,      who preserved the Union and struck the chains from our      countrymen . . . and from Franklin Roosevelt, who presided      over a global coalition to rescue humanity from those who had      put the soul itself in bondage. Each of these presidents was      a soldier of freedom. And in the defining event of the 20th      century, their cause became our cause. On distant fields and      fathomless oceans, the skies over half the planet and in      10,000 communities on the home front, we did far more than      avenge Pearl Harbor. The citizen soldiers who answered      liberty's call fought not for territory, but for justice, not      for plunder, but to liberate enslaved peoples around the      world.       In contending for democracy abroad, we learned painful      lessons about our own democracy. For us, the Second World War      was in effect a second American revolution. The war invited      women into the workforce. It exposed the injustice on African      Americans, Hispanics and Japanese Americans and others who      demonstrated yet again that war is an equal opportunity      employer. What we learned in foreign fields of battle we      applied in post-war America. As a result, our democracy,      though imperfect, is more nearly perfect than in the days of      Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. That's what      makes America forever a work in progress--a land that has      never become, but is always in the act of becoming. And      that's why the armies of democracy have earned a permanent      place on this sacred ground.       It is only fitting when this memorial was opened to the      public about a month ago the very first visitors were school      children. For them, our war is ancient history and those who      fought it are slightly ancient themselves. Yet, in the end,      they are the ones for whom we built this shrine and to whom      we now hand the baton in the unending relay of human      possibility.       Certainly the heroes represented by the 4,000 gold stars on      the freedom wall need no monument to commemorate their      sacrifice. They are known to God and to their fellow      soldiers, who will mourn their passing until the day of our      own. In their names, we dedicate this place of meditation,      and it is in their memory that I ask you to stand, if      possible, and join me in a moment of silent tribute to remind      us all that at sometime in our life, we have or may be called      upon to make a sacrifice for our country to preserve liberty      and freedom . . .       . . . God bless America.                          ____________________
