Speaker, I rise today to recognize University of Oregon Professor GZ (Charlie) Brown, Philip H. Knight Professor of Architecture. For 38 years, Professor Brown has taught and inspired generations of University of Oregon students and practitioners.  Prof. Brown is a leader in sustainable design and founded the UO Energy Studies in Buildings Laboratory, (ESBL) located in Portland and Eugene. As director of the ESBL, he developed and oversaw research projects focused on understanding how building and transportation design determines energy consumption. The lab collaborates with designers, builders, developers, and governmental agencies to develop strategies and design tools that maximize energy efficiency in new materials, components, assemblies, buildings, and communities. The ESBL has acted as a design consultant on more than 100 projects.  Prof. Brown is a pioneer. In 1988, he collaborated on a study investigating the impactsof climate change on the energy performance of buildings. In 1991, he served as an advisor on the Global Warming project for the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress. He is the author of a pioneering book on the practice of sustainable design, Sun, Wind and Light: Architectural Design Strategies, and co-author of Natural Ventilation in Northwest Buildings and Inside Out: Design Procedures for Passive Environmental Technologies. His list of publications includes more than 100 papers and reports on computing, energy, climate, and housing. He has also co-authored software programs to facilitate design, including Energy Scheming, SIP Scheming, Energy Module, and Auto Architect.  Prof. Brown's research topics include visualization of building information, manually activated pneumatic shade controls, natural ventilation, daylighting (including the impact of structural design), heat exchangers, modular construction (with a focus on structural insulated panels), classroom design, building massing, passive design, insulation, energy auditing, and straw bale construction.  He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and the American Solar Energy Society, and has received awards for leadership in research from the U.S. Green Building Council and the Architectural Research Centers Consortium. In 1984, Prof. Brown received the National Award for Energy Innovation from the U.S. Department of Energy and the Governor's Award for Energy Innovation from the State of Oregon.  Prof. Brown will be honored this month by the University of Oregon for his contributions, and it is my honor to recognize and congratulate him for his years of exemplary service.                          ____________________
