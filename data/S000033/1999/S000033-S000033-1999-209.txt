 Speaker, today I will introduce legislation to increase the burial benefits for certain veterans from the current allowance of $300 to $600. This will represent the first increase in the burial benefit in 20 years.  Current law allows a funeral benefit of $300 for veterans who were receiving disability pay or pensions, or those who were eligible for pensions but who weren't receiving them. This was intended to help defray the costs of funerals for the surviving families. However, Congress has not seen fit to increase this allowance since 1978, and it is past time to do so.  Just before the end of World War I, Congress created a funeral allowance of up to $100 for some war veterans. After World War II, the maximum allowance was increased to $150, and, in 1978, it was increased to $300--where it is today.  When the House was deliberating an increase in 1958, several members rose to point out that it had been 12 years since the last increase in this modest benefit, and that the benefit level was no longer realistic. They said increasing the benefit for the families of those veterans who were eligible for it was ``long overdue,'' and showed that Congress was aware of the economic realities faced by those families. I think, if those Members where here today, they would be saying the same things.  Everyone understands that because of inflation a proper memorial, either a funeral or a cremation, if far expensive in 1998 that it was in 1958, or 1978. A funeral, today, can run thousands of dollars, creating a burden on a bereaved family at a difficult time. I don't think it is asking too much to increase this small benefit for these veterans, which is why I will introduce legislation to double it, to $600.  When members of Congress created this allowance after World War I, they did so because they believed that every veteran receiving disability pay or a pension had a right to be buried with dignity, and without undue financial hardships for the family. That principle was true then, and it remains true today.                          ____________________
