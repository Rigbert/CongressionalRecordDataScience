Speaker, it is with great respect and enthusiasm that I congratulate Ivy Tech Community College Northwest and its regional partners, who recently celebrated their 10th Annual Northwest Indiana Innovation Induction Ceremony. At the ceremony, which reflects the ``Spirit of Innovation'' in Indiana, fifteen individuals and fourteen teams were inducted as members of the 2014-2015 class of The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana. Of these individuals, several members were inducted as Society Fellows for their significant efforts in innovation. These individuals are Scott Albanese, Robert Coangelo, Robert Palumbo, Ph.D., Neeti Parashar, Ph.D., and Roger Pradhan, Ph.D. William E. Nangle was honored as the Gerald I. Lamkin Fellow for Innovation and Service, a special recognition named for the President Emeritus of Ivy Tech College of Indiana. Also honored were two Chanute Prize recipients, the BP ``One Global Team'' for the Whiting Refinery Modernization Project and PCL Alverno. In addition, a new team award designated ``Accelerating Greatness'' was presented for the first time this year, and the recipients were James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility, Valparaiso University, and the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority. For their truly remarkable contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana and their continuous efforts to cultivate a culture of innovation, these honorees were inducted at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, on Thursday, October 16, 2014.   The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana was created by Ivy Tech Northwest with the goal of highlighting and encouraging innovative individuals and groups within the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors, as well as building a ``culture of innovation'' in Northwest Indiana. The importance of innovation in Northwest Indiana, as well as globally, is crucial in today's ever-changing economy. Leading the Northwest Region is Dr. Thomas G. Coley, Chancellor, Ivy Tech Community College North West and North Central Regions.   The fellows selected by the Society of Innovators were chosen for their significant innovative leadership and the impact of their accomplishments throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond. Scott Albanese, founder and chief executive officer of Albanese Confectionery Group, Incorporated, in Merrillville, launched his business thirty years ago. Today, the company generates over $100 million in sales and its products can be found nationwide, as well as in nine other countries. In addition, Scott invented the first gummy candy in the world with a distinguishable flavor, which was previously deemed impossible. Robert Coangelo is the founding farmer of Green Sense Farms, which is the nation's largest indoor, commercial, vertical farm and the largest user of Phillips LED grow lights. The organization grows produce in a controlled environment that is free of pesticides, herbicides, and GMO seeds while distributing its products throughout the Midwest. Robert Palumbo, Ph.D., professor and Alfred W. Sieving chair of engineering, inspired the effort to build the nation's fifth solar furnace at the College of Engineering at Valparaiso University, which is utilized by undergrad students to explore new ideas in solar research. Dr. Palumbo is now part of a ``pioneering'' team at the James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility. Neeti Parashar, Ph.D., spearheaded a High Energy Physics Team at Purdue University Calumet as part of a large global collaboration to discover the Higgs-Boson subatomic particle, which gave the Nobel Prize to Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom and Francois Englert of Belgium. Roger Pradham, Ph.D. played a key role in the development of new carbon steel products for the automotive industry, and he is the leading developer of bake-hardenable steels. Dr. Pradham received an AISI Gold Medal for his research outlining the implementation of bake-hardenable steels at Burns Harbor, and he currently holds four patents.   I am also honored to acknowledge William E. Nangle, executive editor (ret.), The Times of Northwest Indiana, who was recognized as the Gerald I. Lamkin Fellow for Outstanding Innovation & Service. In his role, Mr. Nangle introduced the ``Munster Model,'' which provided the community with in-depth local and neighborhood news while also covering regional news. This model became a huge success in the journalism industry and is utilized nationwide. In addition, Mr. Nangle brought Indiana's seven largest newspapers together, producing statewide access to public records. Under Mr. Nangle's direction, The Times of Northwest Indiana became a national leader in its industry.   The recipients of the Chanute Prize for Team Innovation should be commended for their contributions. The BP ``One Global Team'' for the Whiting Refinery Modernization Project utilized a single team concept on a world scale to conduct the largest and most complex refinery construction project in BPhistory. PCL Alverno introduced total microbiology automation, which revolutionized the delivery of results to patients and physicians. PCL is the first to be designated as a Seimen's Microbiology Innovation Center in the United States.   The Accelerating Greatness Award for Team Innovation included two recipients. The James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility, located at Valparaiso University, houses the fifth solar furnace in the United States and the world's only solar furnace primarily designed, built, and used by undergrad students at an institution of higher learning. The Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority is a regional organization that provides nearly $30 million annually in a proven collaborative model to leverage failing assets into more than $1 billion in infrastructure and economic development.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding innovators. The contributions they have made to society here in Northwest Indiana and worldwide are immeasurable and lifelong. For their truly brilliant innovative ideas, projects, and leadership, each recipient is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
