President.  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us today.  For many decades, Congress found it easier to debate a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution than to actually balance the budget.  Support for the balanced budget amendment was a convenient badge of fiscal austerity at a time when many Members were voting for tax policies and spending proposals that saw our annual deficit and our cumulative national debt explode.  After so many years, it is no wonder that the balanced budget amendment has become a talisman which its supporters clutch, suggesting that it has extraordinary powers to translate the difficult choices that this body must face into some type of simple constitutional formula which will miraculously erase the deficit.  But, as the last few years have indicated, there is no magical constitutional language that will make the choices or the policies of budget balancing easier.  Mr. President, in 1993, the Clinton administration began a process of deficit reduction which has helped to create a strong economy, cut the deficit by 63 percent, brought the deficit when measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product to its lowest level since 1974, and given us the lowest deficit of any major industrialized nation.  It took difficult choices, not constitutional gimmicks; choices that Republicans refused to support.  Whether or not this amendment passes, and I hope it does not, we will still be confronted by these choices.  However, if this amendment does pass, for the first time in our history we will either surrender our role in shaping the budget and the social and economic policies which it defines to the courts, or simply surrender any decision to an adamant minority which could invoke the provision to block necessary action.  Mr. President, the amendment before us today is flawed in many ways. It is the wrong answer to a real problem. It is the wrong way to manage the economy. It disrupts our tradition of majority rule. It needlessly jeopardizes essential programs and it needlessly enhances the role of the courts in budgetary and tax policy. The balanced budget is the wrong way to manage the economy.  Over 1,100 noted American economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, voiced their opposition to this balanced budget amendment on the grounds that it would hurt our economy and graft improper fiscal policy onto the Constitution. They said, ``It is unsound and unnecessary.'' They added, ``It mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.'' They went on to say it ``would prevent Federal borrowing to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education, research and development, environmental protection, and other investment vital to the Nation's future well-being,'' and that it ``is not needed to balance the budget.'' They also ``condemn'' the amendment and suggest it could place our economy ``in an economic straitjacket.''  One Nobel laureate, Prof. William Vickery, developed an analysis of 15 issues with respect to balancing the budget, reducing the deficit and providing for economic growth, and in this analysis he has a compelling and noteworthy passage:       If General Motors, AT, and individual households had been      required to balance their budgets in the manner being applied      to the federal government, there would be no corporate bonds,      no mortgages, no bank loans, and many fewer automobiles,      telephones and houses.  But this balanced budget amendment suggests that the Government do exactly the opposite of what the most sophisticated private industries do, and I think that is a mistake.  While the majority may find it appropriate and even desirable to insert economic formulas into the Constitution, I would urge caution. For example, we all believe and we will say time and time again that we should have a full employment economy and that every able bodied American work. However, if I were to introduce a full employment constitutional amendment, I predict that the very same supporters of this balanced budget amendment would rush to this floor and condemn that approach, invoking the terminology that we should not enshrine economic ideas or formulas into the Constitution of the United States. The same thing would happen if we talked about an anti-inflation amendment.  The point, I think, should be very clear. It is our responsibility, together with other institutions, outside the scope of the Constitution to rationally ameliorate the surges and downswings of the economy. This is what we should do.  Some people might try to say, well, no, look at the States. They provide for a balanced budget. That certainly misses the point. State governments do not manage national economies. They do not issue and support currencies. They do not deal in foreign trade. And most of them, if not all of them, with balanced budget requirements have the good sense to separate capital spending from operational spending. So that logic does not suffice to support this balanced budget amendment.  I also suggest that economically we are not immune from the difficulties of the business cycle. We have been enjoying over the last several years good, substantial economic growth, but we know that in past periods our economy has faltered. If it does falter, this balanced budget amendment could be a straitjacket, confining and constraining us in our response to these economic recessions. When the economy shrinks, revenue shrinks, throwing off our revenue estimates, throwing off our whole plan to get to the balanced budget, and we will be hamstrung by this amendment's proposals in terms of what we can do to address a recession.  For example, the CBO has talked about the impact of recession on the deficit. Their estimates indicate that a 1 percent drop in the gross domestic product would increase the deficit by $32 billion. A 1-percent increase in unemployment would add $61 billion to the deficit. These are staggering figures with which we would have to contend in the context of a very narrowly drawn balanced budget amendment.  These are not just statistics. These are real people's lives. We have all lived long enough to have endured economic recessions and have seen the cost in human lives. We have to, as a Government, to such situations. We cannot, I think, plead, at that moment of need, we would like to help you, but the Constitution prevents us from doing sensible, appropriate things to put people back to work in this country.  One of the aspects of the balanced budget amendment that would severely constrain our response to recessions is the fact that it would suppress the automatic stabilizers contained in our economic policy today, things like unemployment compensation and other entitlement programs which exist to meet the needs of people who have fallen on hard times during a recession.  As the Congressional Research Service cautioned when it examined the economic impacts of this proposal:       In sum, the balanced budget constitutional amendment could      require action to neutralize the automatic stabilizers in the      budget that expand outlays and reduce tax collections in      economic slowdowns and recessions. In this case, the budget      would no longer serve to moderate business cycles.  And, under this amendment, we would lose a valuable tool in aiding the working men and women of America.  There is more than just constitutionally historic interest involved in the question of this amendment's supermajority requirements because this amendment requires not a majority vote, in many cases, but much more than a majority vote. This provision holds the real potential for constraining effective action at the time weneed Government to move decisively and purposefully.  For example, in times of economic crisis, there would be no automatic stabilizers if a small minority of Senators or Representatives objected. Different regions of the Nation experiencing economic hardship could find no comfort in Washington because they could not muster the number of Senators and Representatives to deal with their region's particular problems. Frankly, over the last several years, we have seen economic situations in which the country overall appears to be doing fine, but when you go to the Northeast, to California, or to other parts of the country, you find regional recessions that need the help of this Government. Regrettably, in that situation there may not be sufficient will or political support to do what we must do, which would be extremely detrimental to the citizens who live in these areas.  There is another aspect of this supermajority that is built into this constitutional amendment which should cause us all great concern, and that is in order to raise the debt ceiling a vote of three-fifths would be required.  We have just in the last Congress seen the difficulty of securing approval of a change in the debt ceiling with a simple majority requirement. If we would require a three-fifths vote, we really would be putting our Nation at severe risk.  As Secretary Rubin has pointed out with respect to the issue of raising the debt ceiling and consequently avoiding default on Government debt:       The possibility of default should never be on the table.      Our creditworthiness is an invaluable national asset that      should not be subject to question.       Default on payment of our debt would undermine our      credibility with respect to meeting financial commitments,      and that, in turn, would have adverse effects for decades to      come, especially when our reputation is most important, that      is, when the national economy is not healthy. Moreover, a      failure to pay interest on our debt could raise the cost of      borrowing not only for the Government but for private      borrowers as well.  This super majority provision would affect the Government's ability to deal rationally and prudently with the debt ceiling, and that is another reason, a very strong reason, why this proposed constitutional amendment is inappropriate.  It is bad economics; 1,100 economists would condemn it, but it is also very poor budgeting. As Senator Byrd pointed out, the majority's proposal turns the Congress and the President into fortune tellers who must somehow predict and balance outlays and receipts exactly or find the supermajority needed to waive the amendment.  This appears to be an impossible task, because each year the CBO seems to revise its projected deficit and revenue totals on a regular basis. We should not delude ourselves into thinking we can accurately predict the future, and we should definitely not add this dubious proposition to the Constitution.  In addition to the fact that this amendment's success is predicated on frail human predictions, there are other reasons to oppose this amendment. While the majority claims that States have managed to survive balanced budget amendment requirements, they fail to acknowledge, as I previously indicated, that States do so rationally by creating separate operating and capital budgets. I have supported a balanced budget amendment which recognizes this rational policy. But that proposal is not before us today and we are debating a proposal that does not recognize--in fact some scholars have indicated it would constitutionally preclude--the development of a capital budget by the Federal Government.  Time and time again, the advocates of the amendment have rejected the idea of a capital budget for the Federal Government. I believe, in a sense, not only are we rejecting sound constitutional policy and sound administrative policy, but we are also undercutting this Nation's need to build up our capital infrastructure. So, this amendment, as proposed, is both bad economics and bad budgeting, and finally it is an abrupt departure from the constitutional balance that we have observed through the course of our history. It raises a number of fundamental questions about our Constitution, our tradition of majority rule, and the power of the judicial branch in the United States.  One of the lessons I learned in law school was, where there is a wrong, particularly a constitutional wrong, there must be a remedy. Yet this constitutional amendment makes no mention of how it will be enforced and who has the legal standing to question those issues which arise under the constitutional amendment. This is an invitation to litigate rather than legislate on budgetary matters. If a future Congress finds it too difficult to take the painful steps needed to eliminate the deficit, then we may expect any number of possible claimants, from Governors upset about Medicaid payments to senior citizens upset about their Social Security checks, all of them urging the courts to step in and take action.  Moreover, by placing the requirements that receipts and outlays be reconciled in the Constitution itself, the amendment effectively calls on the Supreme Court to ensure that this mandate is met. While the amendment may leave open the question of how the legislature reaches its positions and what items will be considered outlays and revenues, the Supreme Court will always have an obligation to uphold the Constitution. Once we declare constitutionally that revenues and outlays must be reconciled, the Court will have no inhibition, and, in fact an obligation, to step in and make this reconciliation if Congress fails.  Likewise, under this amendment the President could be forced to impound funds, to cut off checks, to do many things because of a perceived constitutional mandate. I would think long and hard, and I urge my colleagues to think long and hard, whether or not we want to surrender what is traditionally the authority of the Congress over both the courts and the President to manage the public purse. These issues are all very difficult ones, raising profound questions of constitutional law.  One other aspect of the proposal which is disturbing is the departure from a tradition in this country of majority rule. I have mentioned before the supermajorities which would be required to raise the debt limit and to do other things which today only require a majority vote of the Members of the House and the Senate. Indeed, the balanced budget amendment would create new supermajorities in many different areas. When the founders developed the Constitution, they recognized that only majority rule would work for a nation founded on the principles of liberty and opportunity. James Madison argued in Federalist 58 that if more than a majority were required for legislative decision, then:       . . . in all cases where justice or the general good might      require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be      pursued, the fundamental principles of free government would      be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would      rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.  And, indeed, that is what this amendment would do inexorably.  There is a final and significant issue which must be discussed with respect to this balanced budget amendment proposal. I believe it jeopardizes the integrity of the Social Security system and raises the specter of encroachments on the system, not to support seniors but to pay for the reckless spending of the 1980's.  My State has the Nation's third highest percentage population of senior citizens. These are the men and women who fought in World War II and who made our country an economic power. Their sacrifices have made our Nation what it is today. They deserve our support and they rightly demand our assistance to maintain a dignified retirement.  The hallmark of our commitment to these seniors has been the Social Security system. However, this amendment makes no provision to protect this essential program from the choices necessary to achieve a balanced budget. The amendment fails to recognize that Social Security is not just like every other program. It is directly funded through a dedicated payroll tax, and numerous acts of Congress have sought to protect it from improper manipulation or precipitous reductions in benefits. Yet the majority refuses to protect Social Security and, instead, wants to use the Social Security trust fund to mask the deficit.  Mr. President, recently the Congressional Research Service produced a report regarding the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social Security, which contained a shockingrevelation. The report found that the Social Security Administration, even though it has accumulated a very healthy surplus, would not be able to pay benefits in certain years, due to the amendment's requirements that total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. In other words, Social Security could only pay as much in benefits as it receives from payroll taxes in any given year, even if the trust fund was running a multibillion-dollar surplus from previous years. This is a grave matter that deserves more analysis and could jeopardize the 1983 Social Security reform law as well as future reform efforts. But it would be a consequence of this balanced budget amendment if adopted today or in the future.  Some would argue that no legislator would touch the Social Security system, but a constitutional imperative may provide a shield which would allow legislators to break that sacred commitment between ourselves and those seniors who have contributed so much to this country.  I urge my colleagues to reject this balanced budget amendment. The Constitution establishes the durable rights and responsibilities which are the heritage of our past and the best guarantee of our future. We should not let the Constitution fall prey to a proposal that reflects transient economic policy at best, and would erode both majority rule and the principle that the people's representatives, not judges, must be responsible for the public purse.  Mr. President, before I yield, I would like to thank Senator Feingold for his graciousness in delaying consideration of his amendment in order to permit me to go forward with my statement.  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and I yield my time.                            Amendment No. 13
