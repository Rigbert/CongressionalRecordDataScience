 There is a huge market. There is a huge number of people already addicted, and as the price per pack, plus reduction of smokers, comes into play, the opportunity for a black market increases, and particularly if you begin to ratchet down the addicting chemical which is nicotine.  It is a serious question. I am surprised, frankly, that people really don't want to know more about it. I, frankly, am surprised that there is a rush to judgment. It seems to me that because of what we are doing is for 25 years, we better be right. I don't want to see in my State a huge black market in 5 years and know that I voted to help make that market possible.
