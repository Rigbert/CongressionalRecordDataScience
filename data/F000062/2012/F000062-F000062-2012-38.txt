 President, I wish to recognize today an extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S. intelligence community, Ms. Caryn Anne Wagner, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis--I&A--at the Department of Homeland Security. After 30 years of devoted Federal service, Caryn came out of retirement in 2010 when the President nominated her to the Under Secretary position. She was confirmed for this position and has proven herself a manager and leader of what had been a troubled agency. After nearly 3 years in the job, Ms. Wagner will retire again on Friday, December 21. I am sorry to see her leave but wish her the very best as she prepares for her next chapter.  I came to know Caryn when she was nominated to be the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis. Since then, she has drawn on the depth and breadth of her experience in the intelligence community and the Congress to build the foundations of a Homeland Security intelligence office that will long outlast her tenure. The mission of I&A is to provide the Department of Homeland Security with the intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient and to bring to the intelligence community the information and analysis from the Department's thousands of officers posted at our Nation's airports, borders, and numerous other places around the world. It also informs and empowers State, local, and tribal governments and law enforcement on the frontlines of our homeland defense against terrorism.  Caryn's many years of experience in the intelligence community, combined with an indepth knowledge of the National Intelligence Program, collaborative instincts, and insightful thinking on intelligence matters have been key components of her success. She previously held senior positions involving oversight of the collection and analysis of intelligence to include: the Director of Analysis and Production and Director of the Military intelligence staff for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she was responsible for development and management of the General Defense Intelligence Program; the Defense Intelligence Agency's senior representative to the U.S. European Command and North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO--Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Management and the first chief financial officer for the National Intelligence Program; as well as the Executive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs. In that role, she was responsible for the Community Management staff, which provided strategic planning, policy formulation, resource planning, program assessment and budget oversight for the intelligence community. Adding to her experience in the executive branch, she also served for a brief time in the private sector, where she provided support to military operations, intelligence planning, and intelligence systems architecture development. She also served our Nation in uniform for 8 years as a signals intelligence and electronic warfare officer in the U.S. Army, and in the Congress as budget director for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  But I want to note in particular her role as Under Secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. Caryn stepped into a relatively new organization that had some notable problems,to include an unclear mission, a shocking overreliance on a workforce in which government contractors outnumbered employees, and major shortfalls in office budgeting and spending. Drawing upon her considerable experience, Caryn was able to shape I&A's personnel structure to match as closely as possible that of the larger intelligence community; thereby greatly decreasing the number of contractors, flattening the Federal grade structure, and moving junior and midgrade personnel into career ladder positions. She also addressed and conquered basic management challenges that had previously gone unnoticed and unaddressed. As a result, I&A now has a functioning process to develop a budget request and execution plan; procedures in place for hiring and training qualified personnel; and procedures for identifying the need for policies, then writing, publishing and enforcing them.  While overseeing the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence functions, Under Secretary Wagner has promoted information sharing and engagement with State, local, and tribal partners and has championed the consolidation of the Department's counterintelligence mission. In the critical area of cyber security, Caryn has overseen I&A's close collaboration and analytic support to the Department's National Protection and Programs Directorate.  Under Secretary Wagner has approached every issue with a pragmatic and professional approach that should be a model for all who follow her.  I would also like to note that over the past year or so, I have had a series of dinners and informal gatherings with senior women in the intelligence community. In that context, I have gotten to know Caryn on a more personal level, and I hope that we will continue our friendship after her retirement.  Our Nation owes this public servant a tremendous debt of gratitude. I wish to thank her on behalf of the committee for her decades of exceptional service to our country and to wish her and her husband Chad the very best in the days and years ahead. Caryn can at long last dedicate more time to her love of gardening, travel, theater going and fine dining, and I wish her all the very best.                          ____________________
