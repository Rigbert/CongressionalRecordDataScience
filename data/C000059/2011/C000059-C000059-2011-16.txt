Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, a bill that would repeal the disastrous government takeover of health care.  The more we learn about the new health care law, the more we understand how devastating it will be to our economy. Already employers across the country have suffered increases in their health premiums as a result of the health care law, yet we were told that the law would bend the health cost curve downward.  We were told that the bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years. However, we now know that the figures given to the CBO did not accurately reflect the law's real costs. When you add back the $115 billion needed to implement the law and subtract the bill's double-counting of revenue and other budgetary gimmicks, the true cost is a staggering $700 billion over 10 years.  We were told the bill would protect the uninsured; yet all it does is roll them onto Medicaid--a low-performing program that has resulted in more people turning to the ER for their medical needs.  We were told this bill would help seniors; instead, it guts Medicare Advantage leaving 50 percent of beneficiaries on the verge of losing their current coverage. What happened to the promise that if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan?  In addition to all the false promises, the health care bill will impose $52 billion in new taxes on businesses. Our economy relies on the ability of businesses to grow, hire, invest and succeed. The new taxes will devastate our economy and turn the American Dream into a nightmare.  The bottom line is that we cannot afford this new health care law, no matter how well intentioned. We must repeal ObamaCare and replace it with legislation that decreases health care costs, increases competition in the marketplace, maintains the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship and truly helps those without insurance.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2.
