 Madam Speaker, S. 406 amends Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to make permanent the demonstration program at four tribally operated Indian Health Service hospitals that allows for direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. It will also extend the direct billing option to other tribes and tribal organizations.  This demonstration program dramatically increases collections for Medicare and Medicaid services, and significantly reduces the turnaround time between billings and receipt of payment for Medicaid and Medicare services. Additionally, it increased the administrative efficiency of the participating health care providers. All the participants, two of which are in Alaska, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Indian Health Service, report that the program is a great success.  S. 406 will make permanent the demonstration program and will end much of the bureaucracy for Indian Health Care Service facilities involved with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. The bottom line is that it will mean more Medicaid and Medicare dollars to Indian facilities to use for improving health care for their members.  Madam Speaker, I urge an aye vote on this important bill for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
