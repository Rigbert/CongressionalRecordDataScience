 President, now, more than ever, Americans are expressing their patriotism. Patriotism means different things to different people, but for some, like Ed Lawrence, patriotism comes through his ``determination'' to help others.  Mr. Lawrence, a wildlife artist from McGregor, IA, is a retired game warden and a U.S. Air Force veteran. After hearing President George W. Bush's address to the Nation following the September 11 attacks, Lawrence was moved into taking action. Although unsure of what contribution he could make, he retreated to his studio and began to sketch. Out of his sketches rose images of the American bald eagle with the Stars and Stripes waving behind it. These heart-felt images became the foundation for Mr. Lawrence's work, ``Determination.''  With ``Determination,'' Mr. Lawrence was able to give back to the nation. At the end of last year, Mr. Lawrence devoted his energy to the Grant Wood Chapter of the Red Cross in Cedar Rapids. From the proceeds of his ``Determination'' prints, the group was able to pay the shipping costs of care packages sent to troops on hardship assignments in Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait and Uzbekistan. The care packages were meant to send a bit of home abroad and included puzzles, games, footballs, microwave popcorn, toiletries, gum and magazines, among other items to boost the troops' morale.  In addition to covering the costs of sending out the care packages, Mr. Lawrence created 911 numbered prints as a special tribute to U.S. troops. He donates these prints to various community group fundraisers. The limited edition prints go to groups willing to sell a print in support of the Grant Wood Chapter's project.  U.S. Armed Force bases that receive donations also receive a special copy of ``Determination.'' Numbered prints were reserved for Veterans Administration hospitals in Iowa City and Des Moines, and a copy was presented on the floor of the Iowa House at the Iowa State Capitol.  Mr. Lawrence is hoping to take the project nationwide and is working with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and the American Red Cross to do just that. He and his wife, Chris, have made appearances nationwide to promote the project and received warm responses, as they should.  The ``determination,'' of Ed Lawrence to spread patriotism and promote morale nationwide and across the seas has lifted the spirits of troops and civilians alike. Thank you, Mr. Lawrence, for setting such a positive and patriotic example for fellow Iowans and Americans to follow.                          ____________________
