Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dedicated service of Special Agent Thomas W. Fischer to the people of the United States. Mr. Fischer entered the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in 1977 and demonstrated early in his career that he possessed ambition and integrity that would lead him into a successful lifelong career. Special Agent Fischer began his enforcement career on February 27, 1967, with the Baltimore City Police Department. He served honorably and with valor for 10 years. Due to his considerable skills, tact, courage, and dedication to duty, he was promoted from patrolman to detective, tactical sergeant, detective sergeant, and lieutenant (select). While serving with the Baltimore City Police Department, Thomas W. Fischer received nine official commendations for valor and meritorious service.  In 1977 Thomas W. Fischer began a career in Federal law enforcement as a Special Agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. His first assignment was at the Maryland State Capitol in Annapolis. As a seasoned law enforcement veteran he was quickly recognized as a rising star and leader. Continuing in his remarkable career, during the Iranian crisis, Thomas W. Fischer was assigned as the only civilian Federal agent aboard the U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tom set the NCIS Special Agent longevity record for at-sea time as a Special Agent Afloat (SAA), with 247 days at sea out of 255 days on deployment. This record remains to this day.  Following his exploits at sea, Special Agent Fischer was assigned briefly to the NCIS office in Washington, DC. In 1981 Special Agent Fischer, ever in search of a challenge, transferred to NAS Cubi Point, the Philippines. After only a year, he was promoted to Squad Leader for the Foreign Counterintelligence (FCI) Squad, Subic Bay. He was subsequently promoted to the position of Assistant Rgional Director (FCI) for the Regional NCIS Office, Philippines. In June 1985 Special Agent Fischer accepted an assignment as the Assistant Special Agent in Charge for FCI at the NCIS office at Long Beach, CA. In August 1986, Tom transferred to NCIS Headquarters where he served as a Senior Staff Assistant to the Director as the Special Agent Afloat Program Manager.  In 1987, Special Agent Fischer made history while assigned to the Bobsled Task Force investigating Marine Security Guard espionage activity. Special Agent Fischer traveled to Moscow, U.S.S.R. where he conducted interviews and other inquiries at the American Embassy.  In September 1987, continuing supervisory ascent, Mr. Fischer was named Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the NCIS office in Washington, DC. In October 1988, Special Agent Fischer was named Special Agent in Charge of the Regional Fraud Unit, National Capitol Region, Washington DC. During June 1991, Special Agent Fischer assumed duties as the Deputy Regional Director of the NCIS European Region London, United Kingdom. He was then promoted to Regional Director where he served with distinction until his selection as Assistant Director for Inspections in May 1994.  During the past 6 years, Mr. Fischer, as an Assistant Director, has brought vision, candor, and insight to many issues instrumental in building the NCIS of today. Special Agent Fischer served honorably and served as a role model and leader for an entire agent corps, who by living according to his high standard, remains as his lasting legacy to the organization he so nobly served.  Special Agent Fischer's career, which includes active duty service in the U.S. Armed Forces from March 1962 to September 1965, spans five decades of service to the people of the United States.                          ____________________
