I spoke about this subject last week. Since then, it has come to my attention that some officials in the State Department and other governments are upset at Mr. Crane for the timing of this indictment, as they saw it as disruptive to the peace talks in West Africa.  While I can appreciate those concerns, I agree with one of Mr. Crane's statements on this issue, which I will read:     [T]he timing of this announcement was carefully considered in      light of the important peace process begun this week. To      ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is imperative      that the attendees know they are dealing with an indicted war      criminal. These negotiations can still move forward, but they      must do so without the involvement of this indictee. The      evidence upon which this indictment was approved raises      serious questions about Taylor's suitability to be a      guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.  I was wondering if Senator Gregg had any thoughts on this issue.
