President, I rise today to celebrate National Hospital Week. During this week when we pay tribute to our nation's hospitals and health systems. I would like to recognize one particular facility in Kansas that has gone above and beyond the call of duty in order to meet the needs of the community--the Mount Carmel Medical Center in Pittsburg, Kansas.  Mount Carmel Medical Center is located in the southeast corner of Kansas. The community has 20,000 residents. About 25 percent of the town's children are from families who live at or below the federal poverty level. More than half of the families in Pittsburg are headed by single parents who often work two jobs.  As one of the largest employers in the community, Mount Carmel Medical Center recognized that the entire community was suffering from the lack of quality child care. Teachers noticed that children were unready to learn, they needed immunizations and hearing tests. After a confirmation by the hospital's employee assistance program and a staff-initiated community health assessment, Mount Carmel decided to take action. They formed a partnership with the Pittsburg schools and Pittsburg State University to establish the Family Resource Center to meet many of the community's needs. The Family Resource Center now provides child care to more than 200 children and offers a wide range of social services. It also serves as the site of a free clinic staffed with local physicians for those without health insurance coverage.  The Mount Carmel Medical Center has been nationally recognized for its achievements. The American HospitalAssociation recently awarded the Mount Carmel Medical Center the 1999 NOVA award. NOVA awards recognize innovative community partnerships that address communities' needs.  The collaborative outreach efforts of Mount Carmel Medical Center demonstrates true dedication to the community. I am pleased and proud to recognize Mount Carmel Medical Center for its leadership, vision, and achievements. Mount Carmel is an excellent example of a hospital that has made a difference.                          ____________________
