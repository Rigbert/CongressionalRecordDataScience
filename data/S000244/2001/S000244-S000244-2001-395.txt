 Madam Speaker, today the House considers H.R. 768, the Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2001. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank). It makes permanent an antitrust exemption that allows universities to agree on common standards of need when awarding financial aid.  This exemption has been passed on a temporary basis several times without controversy, and the current version is set to expire at the end of September. It appears to be working well, and I am hopeful that it now can be made permanent.  In a moment the sponsors of the bill, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), will seek time for a further explanation. I appreciate their work on this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
