Speaker, with Thanksgiving approaching, let us think about our fellow Americans and ask ourselves the question, what can we do to serve them this coming week and into the future?  Average incomes for Americans, for the average family, have gone down about 6.7 percent, and we know poverty rates have risen 15 percent. For all of those listening today as we look across our country, think about what you can do this week and every week to help our food banks that are short on supplies across our country. Every class, every religious organization, every person can do something extra to help this week to give every American a good Thanksgiving.  Think about how you can help a local feeding kitchen. Think about how you might challenge your sports team to go glean in the fields and to collect, if you live in a part of the country where agriculture exists, the extra cabbage, the extra apples that are there and will be plowed under if you don't pick them.  Across our country this is a year when Americans can say to one another, Happy Thanksgiving, we believein you, we want to help you through these difficult times. It reaches the true heart of the American people, the people full of goodness who know what's right to do. And let's give every American a happy Thanksgiving every day. God bless America.                          ____________________
