Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I appreciate the debate, which is sort of an extension of the debate that happened last week.  I wanted to come down to the floor to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this motion to instruct. I support the motion to instruct, but I wanted to explain a little bit about my perspective in this and, hopefully, clear the air.  What people need to understand, and I hope this House would understand, is that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) came to an agreement on a bill. The bill of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) is basically identical to the bill of the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), except for one part, and that is whether to nationalize the baggage screeners or to federalize them.  From our perspective, we think we ought to federalize them. From the point of view of the gentleman from Minnesota, he thinks they should be nationalized and Federal employees. That is the only real bone of contention on this bill.  The two men, the three men came together, as well as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) too, came together and wrote a very good, strong security bill, which I congratulate everyone for doing. Of course, it got mired in the discussion of whether we ought to have the Senate bill, which is a fatally flawed piece of legislation, or the legislation that was almost worked out by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.  So we get down to this one issue, because the difference between the House bill and the Senate bill is miles apart. It is a huge difference, because the Senate bill did not cover the airports, it only covered airlines and screeners. It did not cover the Tarmac. It did not provide security for the perimeter, the parking lots, the vendors, the caterers, and everything else. They did not do anything about other modes of transportation: bridges, ships, trains and others. The House bill did.  So it comes down to the screeners. Now, some, particularly in the other body, Mr. Speaker, they are comparing screeners to Capitol Hill Police. I have heard people say that the Capitol Hill Police protect us; why can the American people not at least have that kind of protection?                              {time}  1845  Mr. Speaker, I have to say that is an insult to the Capitol Hill Police. I have worked very closely with the Capitol Hill Police. They are highly trained law enforcement officers that deal with all kinds of issues. They are police that carry guns. In fact, there were two wonderful Capitol Hill officers that died in this building, one of them in my office; so I have the utmost respect for the Capitol Hill Police.  We are not asking highly qualified and highly trained law enforcement officers to stand by a screening machine and watch bags go through. We are saying those people should be highly trained, comply with the standards laid out by the Department of Transportation, comply with the criteria laid out by the Department of Transportation, and they should be certified by the Department of Transportation. And once we do that, we add value to that person. That person has a certification. That person is worth more, and it will attract highly qualified people.  The second issue, most people do not understand that the entire judicial branch contracts out their security. The Supreme Court contracts out their security. Even the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, contracts out their security. So the Federal Government understands for specific cases they might want to use the private industry, and those kinds of individuals that are brought to this issue in the private industry.  My point is what we are trying to do is to design a model, a very good model by the way, according to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), a model that brings security to all of our modes of transportation, part of that being the airlines and the airports.  What we are asking is to follow a model that has already been tried in Europe and Israel. A nationalized model is the model that they tried back in the 1970s and 1980s, and it was a disaster.  This model brings the flexibility of private industry under the accountability of the Federal Government. We will have badged law enforcement Department of Transportation people at each station where bags are being screened. We will have baggage screeners that are well trained and certified sitting there screening the baggage.  Mr. Speaker, my point is and what this argument is over is whether we nationalize these employees or federalize them. Nationalize them means, as an example, we want to nationalize all of the pilots that fly these planes. Right now we have a federalized system. The Department of Transportation through the FAA licenses these pilots; yet these pilots work for a private company. The same with flight attendants and mechanics. It works quite well. In fact, I would submit that it would be horrible if we nationalized the airlines and nationalized flight attendants and mechanics. The point here is that we have tried a nationalized system, as examples in Europe show us, and it does not work.  To bring the best security that we know how, we have designed in the House bill that is going to conference a system that actually brings security to the flying public and now people on the ground, a system that the President of the United States understands and supports and will bring us the security that the American people deserve.
