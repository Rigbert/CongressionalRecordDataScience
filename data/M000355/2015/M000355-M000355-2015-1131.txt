 President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of Kentucky's greatest teachers, and a man who has served the public good and the law for 5 decades. My friend Professor Bob Lawson, who has taught law at the University of Kentucky College of Law for 50 years, will be retiring this July 1.  Over the course of his 50 years of teaching, Professor Lawson has become one of the most respected lawyers and teachers in the Commonwealth. He is also well known and admired for his work outside the classroom as the author of much of the Commonwealth's penal code for criminal offenses and its rules of courtroom evidence.  Professor Lawson was born in a small town in southwestern West Virginia, not far from the Kentucky border, in a coal community. Encouraged by his father to get an education and escape life in the coal camps, he attended Berea College in Kentucky and then earned his law degree at UK in 1963.  In 1965, he was asked to teach law at UK, which he has done ever since. His specialty is Kentucky criminal law and evidence law. In the 1970s, he worked with the State legislature to rewrite Kentucky's penal code, which was in need of an overhaul.  I would point out that of Professor Lawson's thousands of students, I was one of them. Bob Lawson was one of my favorite professors, and I still recall his teachings today. I am also proud to call him a friend over the years. UK has greatly benefitted from having him as a member of the faculty for all this time, and he will be sorely missed.  I want to thank Professor Bob Lawson for his five decades of service to the University of Kentucky and to the Commonwealth. For 50 years he led Kentucky's brightest young minds into the legal profession, and his many thousands of students serve as a fitting tribute to his legacy. I wish him all the best as he retires from UK and begins a new stage in life.  The Lexington Herald-Leader published an article detailing Professor Lawson's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  After 50 Years at UK, Professor Who Wrote Much of Kentucky Law and                  Investigated UK Athletics Is Retiring                            (By John Cheves)       Robert Gene Lawson, who is retiring July 1, wrote much of      Kentucky law and taught thousands of the people who practice      it.       Lawson spent 50 years as a professor at the University of      Kentucky College of Law, and he was dean twice. Among his      students were U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,      Gov. Steve Beshear, U.S. Reps. Andy Barr and Ed Whitfield,      and most of the Kentucky Supreme Court.       ``It's been really interesting watching my students go on      in life,'' Lawson, 76, said Friday, sitting in a cluttered      campus office that showed no sign of getting packed up any      time soon. ``They've done important things and mostly have      done them well.''       Lawson built an equally large reputation for himself      outside the classroom. He authored the state's penal code for      criminal offenses and its rules of courtroom evidence. He      harangued the General Assembly, with what he considers      limited success, for packing the state's jails and prisons      with the mentally ill and the addicted. He led investigations      into ethics violations at the UK Athletics Department, which      didn't win him many friends, and into the nightmarish Beverly      Hills Supper Club fire in 1977 that killed 165 people in      northern Kentucky.       ``He was Kentucky law,'' said Allison Connelly, a onetime      Lawson student who later joined him on the law school      faculty. ``He has done so much, when you look at his lifetime      of work, to make Kentucky a better place.''       The son of a coal miner, Lawson was born in 1938 in a tiny      Logan County, W.Va., community almost entirely owned by      Island Creek Coal Co. His father urged him to escape the coal      camp through an education. He worked his way through tuition-     free Berea College and then earned a law degree at UK in      1963.       After two years of practicing law, which he enjoyed, Lawson      accepted an invitation in 1965 to teach at UK.       ``I never thought I'd stay here,'' he said. ``I thought I'd      try teaching for a little bit, see what it was like, and get      back into my law practice. But it was a wonderful experience      from day one--for one thing: being around all of these bright      young people.''       Lawson's specialty is Kentucky criminal law and evidence      law. He wrote the books on those subjects, books that occupy      the shelves of law libraries and judicial chambers. In the      1970s, he worked with the legislature to rewrite the state's      penal code, which was hugely disorganized at the time. ``We      had never reformed our criminal laws in Kentucky, so you had      offenses that had been added one by one over a period of,      what, 150 years, 180 years, and a lot of inconsistency in how      these offenses were treated,'' he said.       To Lawson's frustration, within a decade of his penal code      work, the national ``war on drugs'' and concern over urban      violence led politicians in Kentucky and elsewhere to enact      much tougher sentencing laws.       It's one thing to imprison a murderer for decades, but      these new laws put even minor criminals behind bars for long      stretches, Lawson said. For example: In dozens of Kentucky      cases Lawson researched, people were convicted of the felony      of ``drug trafficking within 1,000 yards of a school'' after      police caught them with a small personal stash of drugs in      their homes or cars several blocks from a school.       ``Bob Lawson's philosophy was always, `You lock up the      people who genuinely scare you because they're dangerous,      they're violent, and for the other people, you see if you      can't rehabilitate them and make them productive members of      society,' '' said Fayette Family Court Judge Kathy Stein, a      former chairwoman of the state House Judiciary Committee.       In 1974, the year Lawson's penal code changes took effect,      Kentucky spent $11 million housing about 3,000 inmates at two      prisons. This year, the state expects to spend about $500      million to keep about 22,000 inmates in 12 prisons and dozens      of county jails that are paid to hold the state's felon      spillover.       The General Assembly's effort four years ago to cut the      inmate population--at Lawson's urging--has fallen short      ``because they aimed too low,'' he said. ``They tinkered;      they did too little.''       Some county jails are so overcrowded that state inmates who      are serving five to 10 years must sleep on the floor and      seldom leave their cells, he said. There is little education      or addiction treatment provided, so felons are no better off      when they're finally released, and in many cases, they're      probably harder than ever, he said.       ``We got mad at the people who were committing criminal      offenses, and we veered away from a philosophy of trying to      correct them, which originally had been the thrust of our      justice system,'' Lawson said. ``We jacked up the penalties      on everything. As a result, we've created this huge problem      of trying to pay for all of this. We're just making things      worse for ourselves than they were.''       One of Lawson's other crusades over the years was trying to      be a watchdog of UK's lucrative and popular sports programs.      At the request of various UK presidents, he led      investigations into possible ethics violations, including      cases that brought about the departures of basketball coach      Eddie Sutton in 1989 and athletics director Larry Ivy in      2002.       In 2002, as a member of the UK Athletics Administration's      board of directors, Lawson cast the sole dissenting vote      against hiring Mitch Barnhart as athletics director. Lawson      said he didn't object to Barnhart, but the $375,000-a-year      salary was ``ridiculous'' compared to the more modest sums      paid to other UK faculty and staff. (Barnhart remains in the      job and now makes $600,000 a year.)       Over the past 50 years, the UK Athletics Department evolved      into its own universe with its own rules, Lawson said.       ``They have become an independent entity, separate from the      rest of the university, which is a problem,'' he said.      ``Their budget is their budget. The athletics department      regards the money that comes in for athletics as their money,      not the university's money.       ``And I guess I have felt, watching it through the years,      that they sort of lost what I would consider to be a      reasonable connection of these students to the university as      compared to athletics. Let me just give you an example. When      I first came here, the basketball season was 20 games. It's      now 40. I have my doubts about how they can be a legitimate      college student when they've got that problem.''       Lawson said he also regrets the explosion in tuition costs      at UK and other state universities around the nation, largely      because of shrinking public support from state governments.      The next UK budget will get just eight percent of its revenue      from state appropriations, the smallest share ever.       ``I think everyone who is 50 years old and older--including      me--ought to be ashamed of themselves for what we're doing to      our young people, making an education all but unaffordable,''      he said.       ``When Mitch McConnell and Steve Beshear were in my      classroom, I doubt they paid much more than $100 a semester      for     their tuition. They went to school almost without any cost,      substantially free,'' Lawson said. ``A resident law student      next year will pay between $21,000 and $22,000 in tuition.      You can't work your way through school at that level. I have      students graduating with $100,000 or more in loan debts that      will affect them for the rest of their lives. Shame on us.''                          ____________________
