 President, I wish to say a few words about oversight hearings on Iraq and the global war on terror.  Just last week, our good friend, the Democratic leader, complained that there has not been ``a single oversight hearing, none.'' That was our good friend, the Democratic leader, saying there hasn't been a single oversight hearing on Iraq and the global war on terror. But the Senate has conducted scores of hearings on Iraq and related issues since 2003. For example, the Armed Services Committee held more than 20--20--hearings on such topics as military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, operations and strategy in Iraq, and Iraq-Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. That is 20 hearings by the Armed Services Committee alone.
