George Baranowski, of Schererville, Indiana. George has always been a dedicated, distinguished, and honorable citizen, and I can say without hesitation that he is one of the most involved individuals I have ever known. As a businessman, entrepreneur, public official, and an avid volunteer, George has served the community in Northwest Indiana for many years. Through his service, he has brought honor to Americans of Polish heritage, and for his efforts, he will be honored with the Polish American Congress Meritorious Service Award at a banquet taking place at The Patio Restaurant in Merrillville, Indiana on Sunday, November 2, 2008.  George Baranowski was born on August 30, 1957 at Saint Catherine Hospital in East Chicago, Indiana. He was the third child born to immigrant parents, Mieczyslaw (Matt) and Janina Baranowski. A lifelong resident of Northwest Indiana, George attended Saint Casmir Elementary School in Hammond before moving on to George Rogers Clark High School. Following his graduation from high school in 1975, George went on to study Electrical Engineering Technology at Purdue University, where he earned both his associate and bachelor degrees.  After receiving his associate degree, George began working at the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), where he remained until the completion of his bachelor degree. At that time, he accepted a position in management with Acme Steel in Riverdale, Illinois. Following seven successful years at Acme, George moved on in 1995, when he accepted a management position at BP Amoco in Chicago, Illinois. Recognized for his professionalism and leadership abilities, in 1999, George was awarded a position as Vice President at Prometheus Network Solution, Inc., thus allowing him to obtain one of his lifelong goals.  Having accomplished a goal he set forth for himself in business, George decided to move on, and after working for IBM for a period of time, he and his wife went into business for themselves. On October 1, 2004, George and his wife, Debra, opened their first Allstate Insurance Agency in Dyer, Indiana. Since then they have achieved great success, having been awarded Allstate's prestigious Honor Ring, Regional Champion, and Chairman's Club Member distinctions. In 2007, they were among the elite at Allstate as part of the top five percent. It is no surprise the couple opened their second branch in 2008.  Undoubtedly, George Baranowski has been extremely successful as a businessman and entrepreneur throughout his career. However, his efforts on behalf of his community have truly set him apart from his peers. As a public official, George is currently the Commissioner of the Dyer Redevelopment Commission and a Trustee for the Lake Central School Board. He has also served as Chairman of the Saint John Township Board as well as a Legislative Committee Member for the Indiana School Board Association, serving all of Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties. He has also served as a member of the Chambers of Commerce for the communities of Schererville and Dyer, for which he is currently the Director. In addition to his many civic responsibilities, George has also been extremely active in various charitable and community-based organizations, including: Christmas in April, the Lions Club, Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rite, and the Polish American Congress.  A devout family man, George spends much of his spare time with not only his business partner, but his loving wife of 28 years, Debra. George and Debra have two sons, Brett and Bryan, and one daughter, Kristy.  Madam Speaker, George Baranowski has given his time and efforts selflessly to the people of his community, and he has served as a source of pride for the Polish American community. His efforts have touched the hearts of many people throughout the years, and at this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
