 But I pled for two reasons. No. 1, I still hope to work with the Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, to see what we can do to facilitate the amendment, whether it is now or a week from now or next year, if we aren't finished with this bill. No. 2, we are trying to get to a situation where we can get to a vote, which is something we promised a Member who has been waiting for a long, long time.  We still have the third situation where Senator Reid and I are going to sit down with our staffs to see what we can do with all of the amendments so we know where we are and have a complete picture. That is why I would plead with her to let the unanimous consent request go through.
