Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, the language of the bill extends to Russian Jews, evangelicals, and to some of the people in Southeast Asia a very basic amount of protection for 1 year. As a matter of fact, this too mirrors exactly the human rights and refugee provisions in the CR, and because this had broad bipartisan support, it was kept in.
