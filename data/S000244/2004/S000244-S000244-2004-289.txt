Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote against it.  I would ask my colleagues to ignore the list of organizations that have supported the bill and read what the bill does. In Federalist Paper number 45, James Madison, in explaining the division of power between the States and the Federal Government envisioned, stated, ``The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.''  This legislation takes away the ability of the 50 States to govern their internal order. Just look at the title of the bill: ``To amend title 18, United States Code, to exempt qualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.'' In exercising its authority to keep internal order, the State has traditionally controlled who, within its borders, may carry concealed weapons and when law enforcement officers may carry firearms.  This legislation undermines the power of the individual states and frustrates the principles of Federalism. As long as they do not infringe on the rights granted under the second amendment to the Constitution, laws regulating the carrying of concealed firearms should remain within the jurisdiction of the State government where they can be more effectively monitored and enforced.  Currently Federal law is silent on the issue of allowing State and local law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons across State lines, allowing each individual State to decide whether or not it wishes and to what extent to allow this practice.  Additionally, current Federal law does not mandate that the States allow both active and retired State and local law enforcement officers to carry a concealed weapon without the permission of each specific State. I understand that at least six States and the District of Columbia currently forbid officers from other States to carry concealed weapons. Thirty-one States restrict carrying a concealed weapon to an officer off duty. And nine States allow an out-of-state officer to carry a concealed weapon.  H.R. 218 would override State right to carry laws and mandate that active and retired police officers could carry a concealed weapon anywhere within the United States. Such a measure is an affront to State sovereignty and the Constitution.  I have received letters from the National League of Cities and State leaders around the country objecting to this legislation because it replaces the judgment of State and local governments with the judgment of Congress on an important safety issue. The International Association of PoliceChiefs, the Major City Chiefs, and the Police Executive Research Forum also object to this legislation. So law enforcement is not unanimous in support of it.  The IACP testified at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security that H.R. 218 will create a dangerous situation for law enforcement and citizens alike because there is so much variation in training standards for law enforcement. In addition to these variations, it may be difficult for officers to recognize official badges held by legitimate officers and fake badges and fake ID cards, which are easily obtainable on the Internet.  I am also very concerned who will bear the responsibility and liability for potential actions that these officers might take while out of their State. It is a real possibility that the law enforcement agency that trained these officers could wind up being forced to defend itself against actions taken by an off duty, out-of-state officer.  I received a letter from Joseph Polisar, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. And I will insert it in the Record in total, but I would like to just read one paragraph.  ``Finally, the IACP is concerned about or concerned over the liability of law enforcement agencies for the actions of off-duty officers who use or misuse their weapon while out of State. If an off-duty officer who uses or misuses their weapon while in another State, it is likely that their department will be forced to defend itself against liability charges in another State. The resources that mounting this defense would require could be better spent serving the communities we represent.''  Because of all of the concerns that I have expressed, I must oppose this legislation and ask that my colleagues join me in my opposition. I realize this is a tough vote, but this is not a good bill. I believe that the issues at hand could be better addressed by the States in an appropriate manner through the use of reciprocity agreements, many of which already exist, rather than taking away the right of the States to legislate in this area which H.R. 218 does.  An approach of reciprocity agreements would allow individual States to have the final say on whether or not it believes allowing out-of-state officers to carry concealed weapons within its borders would enhance rather than undermine public safety.  The letter previously referred to follows:                                      International Association of                                             Chiefs of Police,                                    Alexandria, VA, June 23, 2004.     Hon. James Sensenbrenner,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Sensenbrenner: On behalf of the      International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am      writing to express our strong opposition to H.R. 218, the Law      Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003. This bill would      authorize off-duty and retired law enforcement officers to      carry concealed weapons throughout the country.       It is the IACP's belief that states and localities should      have the right to determine who is eligible to carry firearms      in their communities. It is essential that state and local      governments maintain the ability to legislate concealed carry      laws that best fit the needs of their communities. This      applies to laws covering private citizens as well as active      and former law enforcement personnel.       The IACP strongly believes that each state should retain      the power to determine whether they want police officers that      are trained and supervised by agencies outside of their state      carrying firearms in their jurisdictions. Why should a police      chief who has employed the most rigorous training program, a      strict standard of accountability and stringent policies be      forced to permit officers who may not meet those standards to      carry a concealed weapon in his or her jurisdiction?       However, in addition to these fundamental questions over      the preemption of state and local firearms laws, the IACP is      also concerned with the impact that this legislation may have      on the safety of our officers and our communities.       There can be no doubt that police executives are deeply      concerned for the safety of our officers. The IACP      understands that the proponents of S. 253 contend that police      officers need to protect themselves and their families while      traveling, and that undercover officers may be targets if      recognized on vacation or travel. These are considerations,      but they must be balanced against the potential dangers      involved. In fact, one of the reasons that this legislation      is especially troubling to our nation's law enforcement      executives is that it could in fact threaten the safety of      police officers by creating tragic situations where officers      from other jurisdictions are wounded or killed by the local      officers. Police departments throughout the nation train      their officers to respond as a team to dangerous situations.      This teamwork requires months of training to develop and      provides the officers with an understanding of how their      coworkers will respond when faced with different situations.      Injecting an armed, unknown officer, who has received      different training and is operating under different      assumptions, can turn an already dangerous situation deadly.       In addition, the IACP is concerned that the legislation      specifies that only an officer who is not subject to a      disciplinary action is eligible. This provision raises      several concerns for law enforcement executives. For example,      what types of disciplinary actions does this cover? Does this      provision apply only to current investigations and actions?      How would officers ascertain that an out-of-state law      enforcement officer is subject to a disciplinary action and      therefore ineligible to carry a firearm?       Additionally, while the legislation does contain some      requirements to ensure that retirees qualify to have a      concealed weapon, they are insufficient and would be      difficult to implement. The legislation fails to take into      account those officers who have retired under threat of      disciplinary action or dismissal for emotional problems that      did not rise to the level of ``mental instability.'' Officers      who retire or quit just prior to a disciplinary or competency      hearing may still be eligible for benefits and appear to have      left the agency in good standing. Even a police officer who      retires with exceptional skills today may be stricken with an      illness or other problem that makes him or her unfit to carry      a concealed weapon, but they will not be overseen by a police      management structure that identifies such problems in current      officers.       Finally, the IACP is also concerned over the liability of      law enforcement agencies for the actions of off-duty officer      who uses or misuses their weapon while out of state. If an      off-duty officer who uses or misuses their weapon while in      another state, it is likely that their department will be      forced to defend itself against liability charges in another      state. The resources that mounting this defense would require      could be better spent serving the communities we represent.       The IACP understands that at first glance this legislation      may appear to be a simple solution to a complex problem.      However, a careful review of these provisions reveals that it      has the potential to significantly and negatively impact the      safety of our communities and our officers.       Again, the IACP is strongly opposed to this legislation and      we urge you to oppose it as well.       Thank you for attention to this important issue to law      enforcement executives.           Sincerely,                                                   Joseph Polisar,                                                        President.  Mr CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge Members to vote ``yes'' on my bill, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003 (H.R. 218) to allow qualified off-duty and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in any jurisdiction. The bill has broad bipartisan support with 296 cosponsors.  The benefits of the legislation are twofold--officer safety and improved public safety. Many jurisdictions do not allow off-duty officers to carry concealed weapons. Due to the unique responsibilities and dangers that come with law enforcement, off-duty officers are at a greater risk than most Americans. It is not uncommon for off-duty officers to run into people they have arrested or helped to incarcerate. There have been documented instances where felons have sought retribution against officers who helped to put them in jail or prison. It is only right that the men and women who put their lives on the line everyday when they go to work be afforded the right to protect their families and themselves while they are off duty.  These concerns apply not only to off-duty officers, but to retired officers as well. A criminal who is seeking retribution does not care that the officer who put them away is retired. It is a disservice to those men and women who risked their lives to perform a public service to be deprived of the right to defend themselves and their families simply because they retired.  Legal issues are also posed when neighboring jurisdictions have different regulations for carrying concealed weapons. An off-duty officer is faced with a problem when he is traveling state to state or even city to city. In a circumstance where his/her home jurisdiction requires off-duty officers to carry, but he is traveling to a jurisdiction where the law prohibits carrying concealed weapons, the officer is forced to choose which law to break. Does he leave his gun at home and break the law in his home jurisdiction, or take it with him and break the law when he enters the next jurisdiction?  Aside from the issues of self-defense and jurisdictional conflicts, H.R. 218 provides additional officers to prevent crime, without the cost. There are countless stories of retired and off-duty officers who have prevented crime and protected everyday citizens because they were allowed to carry concealed weapons. Inthis time of heightened security, it seems only logical that additional means to prevent crime and even terrorism be implemented. Off-duty and retired law enforcement officers have the training to recognize suspicious activity and prevent crime. When qualified off-duty and retired police officers are allowed to carry, more law enforcement officers are put on the street at zero cost to taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a minute to read some stories from around the United States where off-duty officers have prevented crimes, in part, because they were allowed to carry their firearm. The first story is from my hometown of San Diego.                   Officer Finds Work on Her Day Off                            (By Joe Hughes)       Hillcrest.--For San Diego police Officer Sandra Oplinger,      it was anything but an off day. Olinger ended up capturing a      suspected bank robber at gunpoint on her day off yesterday.       She happened to be in the area of Home Savings Of America      on Fifth Avenue near Washington Street about 12:30 p.m. when      she saw a man running from the bank, a trail of red smoke      coming from an exploded red dye packet that had been inserted      into a wad of the loot.       With her gun drawn, she tracked down and caught the man.      Citizens helped by gathering up loose bank cash. The incident      began when a man entered the bank and asked a teller if he      could open an account. The teller gave him a blank form and      he left. He returned 10 minutes later, approached the same      teller and declared it was a robbery, showing a weapon and a      demand note he had written on the same form the teller had      given him.       He then grabbed some money and ran out the door. The dye      pack exploded outside, leaving a trail of smoke that      attracted Oplinger's attention and led to the suspect's      arrest.       The names of the man and a possible accomplice in a nearby      car were not immediately released. A gun was recovered.             Deputy Apparent Target of Robbery, Carjacking       Gunfire was exchanged on Milwaukee's north side Wednesday      during an attempted robbery and carjacking.       An off-duty Milwaukee County Sheriff's deputy was the      victim of an attempted robbery and carjacking Wednesday      afternoon as he was leaving the Advance Auto Parts store near      Teutonia and Hampton Avenues, WISN 12 News reported Ben Tracy      said. The deputy, who had a gun exchanged fire with one of      the suspects. No one was injured or hit by gunfire, Tracy      reported. Milwaukee Police and Milwaukee County Sheriff's      deputies were on the scene. They were examining a car they      believe belongs to the suspects. They were searching for two      suspects.                    Off-duty Officer Shoots Attacker       An off-duty Houston police officer shot a man in southwest      Houston early Sunday.       The officer, whose identity was not released, was working      in the parking lot of a reception hall in the 9500 block of      Wilcrest. About 3 a.m., he repeatedly asked two men who were      talking to two women to leave the parking lot and go inside      the building, officials said.       The men refused to leave and confronted the officer. The      confrontation escalated to an assault, according to the      Houston Police Department, with one of the men knocking off      the officer's eyeglasses.       The officer, whose vision was impaired after being hit,      said he saw a man approaching him with his arms near his      pockets, police said. They said the officer asked him to      stop, when he didn't, the officer drew his weapon and fired.      Daryl D. Gorman, 30, was taken to Ben Taub Hospital with      gunshot wounds to the hip and left side investigators said.      He was listed in fair condition Sunday.       The officer, a 16-year veteran of the Fondren division,      received facial injuries. No charges had been filed Sunday.       Off-duty Police Officer, Suspected Robber Shoot Each Other       South Gate, CA. (AP).--An off-duty police officer exchanged      gunfire with a would-be robber early Saturday morning. Both      men were wounded but were expected to survive, police said.      Fabian Mejia, a three-year veteran of the Calexico Police      Department, was using a corner pay phone shortly after      midnight when a 19-year-old gunman demanded money from him,      said Lt. Darren Sullivan of the South Gate Police Department.       After the men shot each other, the suspect got in a car and      left as Mejia called 911. Police arrested the gunman and an      18-year-old woman with him after they arrived at a nearby      hospital, Sullivan said. Their names were not immediately      released. Mejia was in stable condition at a hospital while      the suspected robber was in serious but stable condition,      said Sullivan.       Mejia was in South Gate, just southwest of Los Angeles, to      visit his parents, Sullivan said.                 Officer Shoots at Yard-Statue Thieves                           (By Peggy O'Hare)       An off-duty Houston police officer followed two men who      stole concrete statues from his front yard Tuesday and fired      at the driver when he pointed a gun at him, authorities said.       Officer J.H. Lynn said two men forced their way through his      front yard's locked gate at 12:45 p.m., took two statues from      the lawn and drove off.       The officer followed the thieves to get their license plate      number. When they reached the 1000 block of West 25th, they      turned around and drove toward Lynn, with the driver pointing      a handgun at the officer.       Lynn fired his duty weapon one time at the driver, but the      pair drove through a ditch and sped away.                    Tulsa Policeman Shoots Intruder                            (By Mick Hinton)       Tulsa.--A month after joining the Tulsa police force, Mark      Sole shot the hand of an intruder early Monday in the front      yard of the officer's home. The intruder and an accomplice      are suspected of breaking into Sole's garage. Sole and his      wife were awakened about 6 a.m. by noises coming from their      garage. Sgt. Wayne Allen said. The officer found two men in      his garage. Allen said one man ran, but Sole held the other      at gunpoint in his front yard. ``He ordered the suspect to      take his hands out of his pocket, and the suspect had a dark      metallic object,'' Allen said. The officer apparently thought      it was a weapon and shot the man in the hand, Allen said.       Police arrested John Warren Kays, 29, of Tulsa and took him      to Tulsa Regional Medical Center, where he was being treated,      Allen said.                     Cop Saves Teens From Pit Bulls                           (By Bradley Cole)       East Chicago.--An East Chicago police officer shot and      killed two pit bulls Tuesday as he came to the rescue of two      local teens who faced serious injury. Police Officer John      Mucha was asleep Tuesday afternoon after working a midnight      shift when the piercing scream of a 16-year-old boy woke him      up. Mucha ran to the window and saw two pit bulls attacking a      young man in the 5000 block of Tod Avenue. Before he could      react, Mucha watched as the boy, with the pit bulls chasing      him, jumped a fence to safety. Then he heard a second scream.      As Mucha turned to the window again, he saw the pit bulls pin      a 14-year-old girl to the sidewalk and begin mauling her.       East Chicago Sgt. Joe De La Cruz said Mucha, in his      underwear and T-shirt, grabbed his gun and ran barefoot into      the street. As Mucha approached the girl, the two pit bulls      turned their attention toward him, De La Cruz said. ``Officer      Mucha then positioned himself between the girl and the pit      bulls,'' De La Cruz said. ``The dogs made a pass at him, then      attacked. He shot at the dogs, wounding them both, before      they ran off.'' De La Cruz said Mucha took after the first      dog, which he managed to corner. He said the dog tried to      attack Mucha again, he shot it and killed it.       Within seconds, Mucha ran after and spotted the second dog      on a nearby porch. Once again, as Mucha approached the dog,      it tried to attack and was shot to death.       Police said the boy wasn't seriously injured, but the girl      was taken to St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago, where      she was treated and released. De La Cruz said the dogs'      owner, Anna Gonzalez, 24, of 5013 Tod Ave., received numerous      tickets from East Chicago dog warden Steve Ruiz before the      incident. He said she also received numerous tickets      afterward and has prompted the city to once again crack down      on pit bulls. ``We passed an ordinance 10 years ago that      anyone who owns a pit bull must have $1 million in      insurance,'' De La Cruz said. ``All pit bulls must be      registered at City Hall. They must be on a leash and muzzled      when they're walked.'' De La Cruz said pit bulls are becoming      a problem again, and the city plans to step up its efforts to      ensure that pit bull owners are complying with the law.       Mucha will receive an official commendation from East      Chicago Police Chief Frank Alcala for his bravery, De La Cruz      said.  H.R. 218 is strongly supported by the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Troopers Coalition, the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and many others. In most cases, H.R. 218 is their #1 legislative priority. These groups have worked tirelessly for over 10 years to see the passage of this legislation. I want to thank them for all their hard work and diligence in seeing H.R. 218 come to the Floor.  I also want to thank the 296 members who cosponsored H.R. 218 this year. Their support has been crucial in getting a vote on this bill this year.  During this time of heightened security, it makes sense to put more qualified officers in a position to prevent crime. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' today on this crucial piece of legislation. I thank Members and so will their cops.
