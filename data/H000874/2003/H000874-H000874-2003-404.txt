 Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate and agree with the gentleman's remarks. I want to tell Members that, as they know, at this point in time in the session it is very difficult to communicate with Members, so I urge Members to stay in touch with their offices because we will be giving all Members updates on an hourly to 2-hour basis as to what is going on with the conference committee and what the future may hold for another session tomorrow.
