Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I begin by commending the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for crafting and authoring this resolution. It is very timely and extremely important, given the events in Zimbabwe. I would like to point out that H. Res. 409 condemns the government of Zimbabwe for its horrendous abuses of civil and human rights of its citizens.  Zimbabwe is a Nation that even recently was an economic success, an example to other nations in Africa. However, the serious mismanagement of that country's economy has reduced the gross national income to levels last seen in 1953. Inflation in Zimbabwe today exceeds 500 percent.  When the government of Zimbabwe began its so-called Operation Murambatsvina on May 19, it was supposed to be a limited operation to end the parallel market but developed into the most destructive campaign that country has seen in its post-independence history. Months after this viciouscampaign, there are estimates of as many as 700,000 displaced persons, many of whom are living without food, water or shelter.  By all accounts, this operation has made existing social problems much worse. Nongovernmental organization representatives have told us that now there are 2 million widows, 1.5 million orphans, 500,000 children with only one surviving parent and 8,000 households headed by children.  While many still recall Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's critical role in winning independence for his country, we must hold him accountable for the devastation he has more recently brought upon his country's citizens, serious, serious crimes and human rights abuses. Whatever he has achieved in the past, he is furiously undoing his legacy in the present.  House Resolution 409, which received its due consideration by the House International Relations Committee, seeks to shed light on the profound suffering that this operation has brought and inflicted upon the people of Zimbabwe. It notes that, through this operation, the government of Mugabe has created a manmade humanitarian disaster of epic proportions, which has only compounded the existing human rights and economic crises in Zimbabwe.  It condemns President Mugabe's harassment of the United States Ambassador to Zimbabwe most recently by threatening his expulsion from the country and asserting that he could ``go to hell'' in response to the Ambassador's efforts to draw attention to the crisis in Zimbabwe.  H. Con. Res. 409 also states that the government of Zimbabwe has a duty to protect its people and calls on that government to immediately and aggressively implement policies to promote private sector development, create jobs and build housing to benefit those displaced by this operation.  It further asserts that, absent such meaningful corrective measures, President Mugabe's legacy will be defined by his responsibility for the ruinous policies and draconian laws that have brought untold suffering to his people and the near collapse of Zimbabwe as a nation.  Finally, the resolution calls on the International Monetary Fund to take further action against the government of Zimbabwe should it continue to fail to meet its obligations to the international community.  My subcommittee held a hearing on Zimbabwe's situation and the U.S. policy toward that country last April. We were dissatisfied with the state of U.S. engagement. Despite diligent State Department efforts, we still lack creative ways to address and resolve this crisis.  One of the problems in engaging the government is the failure to speak with a consistent voice. This resolution may seem harsh to some, but it does not even begin to touch what is really going on in that once prosperous nation.  Mr. Speaker, Greg Simpkins is the leader on the subcommittee of our Professional Staff, and he led a staff CODEL to Zimbabwe on July 1 through the 10th. He was joined by Dr. Pearl-Alice Marsh, Senior Professional Staff Member for the Committee, and they did an extraordinary job in gathering a tremendous amount of information about what has really gone on and what the crisis is all about. I submit herewith their staff report for inclusion in the Record.        Staffdel Simpkins Trip Report: Zimbabwe and South Africa                         (By Gregory Simpkins)                                SUMMARY       Staff delegation Simpkins, consisting of myself and Dr.      Pearl-Alice Marsh, Senior Professional Staff Member for the      House Committee on International Relations, traveled to      Zimbabwe and South Africa from 1-10 July 2005. The purpose of      this mission was to investigate the situation on the ground      in Zimbabwe, especially in light of the recent government      actions to destroy allegedly illegal housing and vending      operations. The visit to South Africa was to examine programs      involving Zimbabwe refugees, speak with members of the      Zimbabwe expatriate community and discuss Zimbabwe with      members of the South African government, the ruling African      National Congress, the Congress of South African Trade Unions      and think tanks.       We thank Ambassador Christopher Dell and his staff in      Harare and Ambassador Jendayi Frazer and her staff in      Pretoria for their assistance in making our visit productive.       The report on this operation is the result of our      discussions with a wide variety of people in and around      Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and in Pretoria and      Johannesburg in South Africa (see appendix for list); a 27      June 2005 report by the Solidarity Peace Trust, a non-     governmental organization registered in South Africa, and      various published reports and subsequent contacts with      sources in Zimbabwe.                        OPERATION MURAMBATSVINA       On 19 May 2005, the Government of Zimbabwe commenced      Operation Murambatsvina. While the Zimbabwean government      refers to it as ``Operation Restore Order,'' a literal      translation from the Shona language reveals that      ``Murambatsvina'' more closely means ``discarding the      filth.'' This places the operation in a more accurate      context.       Gideon Gono, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,      called for an end to the parallel market, and hours later the      operation began in Harare and subsequently other urban areas,      such as Bulawayo, ostensibly to oust illegal vendors and      eliminate illegal structures. Very early on, it became clear      that this operation would clean out all vendors and non-     standard and additional structures whether legal or not. In      locations where dozens of vendors had populated longstanding      markets that attracted tourists and local people alike, we      saw empty spaces. But Operation Murambatsvina did not stop      with its urban renewal objective. The operation spread to so-     called squatters' camps and other rural areas, tearing down      structures in which residents had in some cases invested      their life savings in order to construct a substantial house      with electricity and water.       Spreading from central business districts to suburbs to      farms, this operation eventually evicted even supporters of      the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union--Patriotic Front      (ZANU-PF) who had seized white-owned commercial farms since      2000. Not even membership in the ruling party could save      homes from destruction, as police took down houses despite      the pleas of residents wearing ZANU-PF t-shirts. As for the      veterans of the liberation war, who had claimed credit for      assisting the government's land reform process that has so      transformed Zimbabwe's economy, they appear to have been      wiped out. Now landless and homeless, they apparently have      outlived their usefulness to the ruling party. One war      veteran reportedly stood in front of a police bulldozer      that had torn down his home and pleaded for police to take      his life.       A Zimbabwean employee at the U.S. embassy in Harare told us      his supplementary dwelling in the backyard of his property      had been built to house some of his children to relieve      overcrowding in the main house. Nevertheless, authorities      forced him to tear the structure down, despite his holding a      legal permit from local authorities. His experience      apparently was shared by many other homeowners whose homes      were not shacks or shanties and who had locally-provided      permits for their construction.       On June 2nd, BBC News quoted a cobbler (who identified      himself as ``Edson'') on his encounter with police who      arrived to force him and his fellow vendors from their      standard locations in Harare. He told the BBC that the      authorities were uninterested in his legal status as a      vendor: ``They were very firm and just kept saying: `We don't      want you; we don't want you here; we want you to go from this      place.' ''       Clearly, this operation was not restricted to illegal      vendors or dwellings. We were told that police and supporting      forces from youth militias and soldiers were not interested      in differentiating between what was legal or illegal. One      opposition politician showed us a truck load of youth militia      and explained that they had been in government camps and      prepared to take actions such as those associated with      Operation Murambatsvina. Eyewitnesses reported seeing police      looting stalls from which vendors were evicted. Others      reported to us that police confiscated property for which      residents of homes or shops could not produce satisfactory      receipts, even if the goods were personal property and not      for sale.       This operation was cruelly executed. In Bulawayo, Ms.      Shingirai Mmpa told us she had been a vendor for nearly 20      years in the same location. She recounted how police one day      suddenly seized the vegetables she and other women were      selling as usual. Police came to her home and tried to make      her tear it down. She protested unsuccessfully that she was a      renter and did not own the house, and when she proved unable      to tear the house down, police got her neighbors to help her      do so. They then threatened to fine her 1.5 million Zimbabwe      dollars if she didn't dispose of the rubble. Her experience      was not unique.       In Harare, we were told about a grandmother who had been      taking care of her grandchildren and other orphans. They      lived in a cottage that had been declared illegal and was      destroyed. She now faces a bill of five million Zimbabwe      dollars for back rent for a cottage that no longer exists and      another substantial bill for removing the rubble from the      destroyed cottage.       We witnessed families at the Porta Farms camp whose homes      had been utterly destroyed, leaving them to seek refuge,      first in the bushes surrounding their former dwellings and      then in the ruins on which their homes had stood. We saw beds      and furniture sitting in the open, and families living with      no food, running water or sanitation facilities. We saw a      baby who had been born since the demolition, who had to      survive in temperatures that might reach 32 deg. at night.      The     baby's mother, who had an obvious infection, had to manage      without medication from the local clinic that had been      managed by New Life Church. It was destroyed along with      the other structures.       The evictions at Porta Farms involved more than a little      irony. Most residents of Porta Farms had been moved from      Chiuru Farm to keep them out of sight of Queen Elizabeth and      other world leaders who attended the 1991 Commonwealth Heads      of Government meeting in Harare. Some reportedly had been      told that if they paid to install electricity and water that      they would be given permits for their homes. Operation      Murambatsvina abrogated whatever agreement they may have had      with the government.       We witnessed a similar situation at Kilarney squatters'      camp outside Bulawayo. The camp had been established by the      white minority Rhodesian government to move poor blacks out      of Bulawayo during colonial times. More residents of the camp      had been moved by the government of Robert Mugabe in the      1980s in the aftermath of the government massacre of Ndebele      people in Matabeleland. Now residents were on the move again.      This time, the camp was completely razed. Where once      thousands of people lived in houses often made of brick and      mortar, only ruins remained.       Porta Farm residents told us that four people died in the      destruction of that camp: a child who was run over by a      bulldozer, a pregnant woman who died after being thrown into      a truck for transport elsewhere and two critically ill people      whose treatment was interrupted by the destruction. They were      not the only people who did not survive this operation. A      policeman was killed in Bulawayo when the wall of a building      he was helping to tear down fell on him. He died in the      United Bulawayo Hospital. An unknown number of people have      died of exposure or starvation or succumbed to untreated      medical conditions since Operation Murambatsvina began.       Estimates range from 300,000 (U.S. embassy) to 700,000      (United Nations) displaced persons. An estimated 46,000      people have been arrested. More than 300,000 children are      unable to attend school due to being displaced or because      they have to care for siblings or older relatives in      distress. By all accounts, Operation Murambatsvina has      exacerbated existing social problems. Non-governmental      organization representatives told us there are now two      million widows, 1.5 million orphans, 500,000 children with      only one surviving parent and 8,000 households headed by      children.       The official rate of HIV-AIDS in Zimbabwe is 25%, although      it could actually be much higher. The way in which Operation      Murambatsvina has been applied is certain to ratchet that      percentage up much higher. Some women vendors have reported      being required to give sexual favors to get licenses to sell      goods. Moreover, with so many women vendors now unable to get      a license due to being arrested for having an illegal vending      operation, prostitution is likely to soar in coming weeks and      months. Heretofore, prostitution was not seen as a major      contributor to the rate of HIV-AIDS in Zimbabwe. A higher      HIV-AIDS rate also will affect those countries to which      Zimbabweans are fleeing.       The threat of hunger, estimated by the U.S. embassy to be      greater than at any time in Zimbabwe's history, will be      exacerbated by Operation Murambatsvina. The food deficit was      believed to be 1.6 million metric tons prior to the removals      and now will rise dramatically. In the face of rising hunger,      the government outlawed ``urban farming'' and destroyed      gardens in and around cities, despite the fact that many      people were growing crops to make up for the lack of      available produce in Zimbabwe markets.       This operation especially is having an ill effect on      Zimbabwe's economy. Early into Operation Murambatsvina, the      International Monetary Fund was predicting that Zimbabwe's      Gross Domestic Product would fall by 7% this year and that      inflation would rise to 200%. The country's Central      Statistical Office reported in mid-July that inflation had      risen nearly 20 percentage points in June to 164.3%. With the      almost utter destruction of the informal economy in this      operation and no coherent plan on how to restore the      thousands of microenterprises that were shut down, the      contraction of GDP could more than double. In fact, Center      for Global Development researcher Todd Moss is estimating      that Zimbabwe's Gross National Income is now down to its 1953      level.                      the destruction's aftermath       When we spoke to Didymus Mutasa, Minister of National      Security, he virtually bragged of having been part of the      decision to commence Operation Murambatsvina. He echoed the      government position that there were a lot of robberies,      prostitution and illegal money changing involved in the      informal markets that needed to be curbed. Minister Mutasa      added that crime was down significantly (20% by some      government estimates) since the operation began. He was      adamant that only 40,000 people were involved and that they      did not deserve sympathy.       In fact, the government has told diplomatic missions who      had been providing food, blankets and medicines to displaced      people to stop. In a June 17th article in the Zimbabwe      Independent, senior officials at Zimbabwe's Ministry of      Social Welfare were reported to have ordered governors of      provinces to block donor groups from distributing food and      clothing to displaced people since the article noted that it      would ``expose the shortcomings of the controversial      campaign.''       There is opposition within the government to requesting      food assistance, despite the estimated 4.5 million      Zimbabweans believed to need food this year. Discussions with      the World Food Program revolved around the government      allowing assistance while not requesting it and limiting the      supply of food resources to school feeding programs or      through the Grain Marketing Board, which has in the past      distributed food using political considerations.       The government was said to be formulating its own response.      One such response is the establishment of several transit      camps, such as the one at Caledonia Farm. The conditions at      these camps are widely considered to be squalid. According      to a July 3rd report in the Times of London, aid workers      say an epidemic of diarrhea has broken out at the camp.      Conditions were so poor that church leaders we met with      refused to allow the displaced people they were caring for      to be taken to the camp.       This concern was confirmed by Lucy Mwanza, a former      resident of the Harare suburb of Mbare now living at      Caledonia Farm, who told the United Nations Integrated      Regional Information Networks, as reported on June 14th:      ``All they (the government) did was just to come and dump us      here, and we have not heard from them since then. Just like      the other families that were brought here, my five children      and I were forced to set up two shacks using plastic and      cardboard boxes, but the cold is unbearable at night.''       Father Barnabas Nqindi of the Church of the Ascension in      Bulawayo told us he was keeping the more than 100 displaced      persons at his church where the community has been generous      in helping to provide food and other supplies. Father Nqindi      said the transit camps, were too open, lacking proper shelter      and the necessary infrastructure to care for residents. He      said they were established hastily and remain unorganized. He      believes churches will play a major role in ensuring that      such camps are ready before people are transferred. Father      Nqindi said the churches are concerned about maintaining      access to the people once transferred so that they can      continue to ensure the necessary services are provided and      that eventual settlement of people in the camps is handled      humanely.       Subsequent to our visit to Zimbabwe, baton wielding police      in full anti-riot gear reportedly stormed Father Nqindi's      church and other Bulawayo area churches, rounded up about 500      displaced people and took them to a transit camp about 35      kilometers outside the city. According to various reports,      the next morning, the people were dispersed, and the camp was      dismantled. WorldVision staff members were prevented from      distributing food. Only the Red Cross was allowed to provide      any assistance. Father Nqindi was briefly arrested, but has      been released for now.       It is the government's intention to transfer many of the      people displaced from urban areas to their rural home, if      they have one. We saw many trucks carrying furniture leaving      cities, presumably on the way back to the original family      home. This exodus has been stymied, however, by the lack of      fuel in the country. Lacking foreign exchange with which to      buy sufficient fuel, the government has been unable to      prevent the rapid increase in gasoline prices, which have      risen 300% just due to higher world oil prices. In cities,      suburbs and more rural areas, lines of empty cars are parked      at gasoline stations awaiting word that fuel has arrived.       The government also intends to build housing for the      displaced persons more consistent with reasonable urban      planning. Governor Gono told us he is confident that the      government can find one trillion Zimbabwe dollars to add to      three trillion in funding already identified to begin      construction of housing soon. However, the shortage of      foreign exchange currently is forcing the government to      choose between importing food or fuel, and the level of      funding necessary for such a major construction project is      far beyond known government revenues. Furthermore, to      adequately meet the needs of the many displaced people in a      timely manner, the rate of construction would have to      exceed any known rate for such a project anywhere in the      world.       The lack of housing, already a problem even for middle-     class Zimbabweans, is now more acute. Housing prices have now      doubled and tripled, outpacing the ability to pay of working      families, even households headed by professionals. Some      middle-class people were among those whose homes were      demolished, and with this worsened housing crisis, the      homeless in Zimbabwe now include those who make a good      living, but who had the misfortune of losing their homes at      the worst possible time.       One Zimbabwe businessman, who allegedly has a source within      President Robert Mugabe's inner circle, told us that the      Zimbabwe president, commenting on the results of Operation      Murambatsvina reportedly said: ``What a mess!''       Indeed, many of his countrymen would agree, as they are      calling this situation ``the Mugabe tsunami.''                 RATIONALE FOR OPERATION MURAMBATASVINA       With such devastation to the Zimbabwe population and to the      country's economy, one wonders why Operation Murambatsvina      was undertaken in the first place. Of the many reasons      offered by sources to whom we spoke, opposition party Member      of Parliament David Coltart offered four reasons     that encompass what others have suggested as well.       The ZANU-PF government used Operation Murambatsvina as a      tool to punish its political opponents. There certainly seems      to be some truth to this contention since this operation      began in urban areas that had not traditionally voted for      President Mugabe or his party. In the March 2005 elections,      ZANU-PF won only one urban seat. Mr. Coltart and others see      the government's actions as purely retribution for the      communities that did not vote for the ruling party. However,      as mentioned earlier, this operation spread from the urban to      the suburban to the rural areas and punished even ZANU-PF      supporters. Whatever the initial rationale for this      operation, it seems to have gotten out of hand and fallen      victim to a melange of agendas. Some ZANU-PF communities      apparently didn't vote in appropriate numbers in March, and      the so-called war veterans had served their purpose. Still,      the response of many ZANU-PF officials indicated that whoever      was targeted by this operation was not to be pitied or      helped.       The ZANU-PF government feared an urban uprising and used      Operation Murambatsvina to clean out potential armed      opponents. Mr. Coltart and others pointed out that the ZANU-     PF government has mishandled the economy so badly that unrest      is growing, especially with a 70% unemployment rate. The      financial crisis is deep and becoming insurmountable without      outside help that may not be forthcoming. Some sources      reported that youth, whose unemployment is near universal,      were becoming particularly restive, and some have said there      were efforts to obtain weapons by urban youth. I must      emphasize that this report is not broadly corroborated.      Nevertheless, the Central Intelligence Organization is aware      of sentiments, and due to their widespread infiltration of      organizations and movements throughout Zimbabwe, they are      aware of the so-called ``pub talk.'' Depopulating urban      poor areas and destroying the dissatisfied war veterans      likely does provide some protection against those willing      and able to rise up in armed opposition to the government.       The ZANU-PF government was convinced that a vast pool of      foreign exchange was tied up in the parallel market and used      Operation Murambatsvina to obtain this currency. As discussed      earlier, the government has mishandled the economy to a      disastrous extent, and according to Dr. Tony Hawkins,      economics professor at the University of Zimbabwe's School of      Business, there is no turnaround in sight. Dr. Hawkins said      the central bank is printing money and distributing it, but      this is only exacerbating the inflationary spiral the country      is experiencing. The government was widely reported to have      raided hotels in search of significant amounts of foreign      currency, which was not found in the expected amounts.      Businesspeople confirmed that their successful Indian      colleagues had their homes and businesses raided--again in      search of supposed foreign exchange pools that for the most      part were not found. The effort to locate and seize large      amounts of foreign exchange from the informal sector also has      generally failed to turn up enough foreign exchange to      justify the raids.       The ZANU-PF government used Operation Murambatsvina as a      tool of social engineering to turn the country into a feudal      society that is easier to control. With its continual call      for displaced people to return to their rural roots, the      government seems to want to bring people back to the rural      areas where they rule through appointed headmen. Many of the      dispersed people no longer have a home in the rural area,      never came from the rural areas or are foreign-born. Given      the control headmen have in these areas, the displaced who      relocate to rural areas will have to be ``vetted,'' meaning      that they will have to pass a political litmus test to get      land, work or food assistance until they can get established.      At the Fountain of Hope Church we visited in Harare, young      men were told to keep all the necessary identification on      them because if they got picked up by police without it, they      could be shipped off to work on a farm. If the commercial      farming industry is to be revived, Zimbabwe will need an      infusion of farm workers, and the displaced (and possibly      forced) could provide a pliable rural workforce.                      INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FORCES       In considering how to deal with this complex and troubling      situation in Zimbabwe, it is useful to consider those actors      who could be of use in addressing this crisis. They consist      of internal and external forces.                            Internal Forces       There are four primary domestic actors in Zimbabwe:       ZANU-PF: The ruling party is home to competing interests      that are becoming increasingly restive. There are the      loyalists, such as Didymus Mutasa; the pragmatists, such as      Vice President Joyce Mujuru and her influential husband      Simon, and the potential reformers, such as Speaker of      Parliament John Nkomo and Gideon Gono. Make no mistake      about it: all these figures and those allied with them      arrive at decisions based on how they are personally      affected. Independent Member of Parliament Jonathan Moyo      was once a member of Mugabe's inner circle, but he is now      a proclaimed reformer, likely based on his ouster from the      ruling party as much as his natural pragmatism.       The hardliners in ZANU-PF are just about unreachable.      However, there are elements within the ruling party who might      be amenable to working toward a better path for Zimbabwe's      future if discussions were initiated through all available      channels. ZANU-PF central committee member and former Member      of Parliament Pearson Mbalekwa publicly split from the party,      and at least 10 other party MPs are said to be considering a      similar move. Of course, the rapid seizure of Mbalekwa's      assets is a reminder to potential defectors of what is in      store if they leave the party. Mr. Moyo has managed to      survive life after ZANU-PF, so it is not impossible to carry      on successfully after leaving the party if one is as clever      as he is. One also must keep in mind that those loyal ZANU-PF      leaders involved in business ventures know they cannot      withstand the growing isolationism Mugabe's policies are      bringing on Zimbabwe.       MDC: The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)      has been almost absent from the fray involving Operation      Murambatsvina. When we spoke with top officials from the      party, they seemed not to fully understand the political      necessity of identifying with their constituents by spending      time with them in their misery, helping to bring shelter or      food or just helping them clean up the rubble that had been      their homes. While thousands were suffering the after-effects      of Operation Murambatsvina, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was      in South Africa for the release of his autobiography.       This party also is in some turmoil. Mr. Tsvangirai has been      quoted as wanting to get rid of his fellow top party leaders,      although he has denied this. He would have some reason to      question their loyalty, though, since party Vice President      Gibson Sibanda and Secretary-General Welshman Ncube met with      Mugabe while Mr. Tsvangirai was in Nigeria meeting with      Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. There are some who      believe this party could split between the so-called activist      wing, led by former labor leader Tsvangirai and the      parliamentary wing, led by Mr. Ncube and Mr. Sibanda. The      party lacks a strong base among civil society, labor or the      churches because of its failure to bring all these      stakeholders into their political calculations, and MDC has      not adequately supported those civil actions that have taken      place. With a tarnished reputation abroad caused by their      past linkages to white farmers providing their funding, this      party needs to reconceptualize its approach if it is to live      up to its potential and plays significant role in Zimbabwe.       Civil society: We met with a number of NGOs, and the most      impressive was Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA). While much of      the population seems unwilling or unable to respond pro      actively to the crisis in their country, the members of WOZA      put themselves on the line by protesting peacefully against      government repression. Other NGOs are trying to respond in      their own way, monitoring the political process, providing      help for the homeless, offering services to victims of HIV-     AIDS and defending the rights of Zimbabweans in court.      However, other Africans who have fought for their freedom,      particularly in South Africa, look down on Zimbabweans,      who are seen as too passive in the struggle for their      freedom. WOZA members have suffered beatings and arrests      to stand up for the rights of all Zimbabweans.       Despite the fact that the Congress of South African Trade      Unions (COSATU) reached out to labor in Zimbabwe and even      continued to reach out in the face of repeated expulsions      from the country, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions      (formerly headed by Mr. Tsvangirai) has not played a strong      role in the battle for Zimbabwe's future. Strikes have      fizzled because of a lack of commitment by either civil      society leaders or opposition party leaders. The prospect of      facing a brutal police reaction seems to have frozen efforts      to legally, peacefully oppose government actions.       Churches: I have separated churches out from civil society      because until quite recently, most churches have declined to      get involved in issues of political rights in favor of      sticking with a focus on spiritual needs. Operation      Murambatsvina led many churches and church leaders to alter      their focus to include feeding and sheltering people. The      government's heavy-handed evacuation of displaced people from      churches and removal to an uncertain fate may spark a more      activist role by churches. The accompanying arrests of      ministers merely trying to meet the needs of people may cause      more churches to challenge the political status quo and      sharpen their criticism in sermons. Even some of the      hardliners, such as Minister Mutasa, have demonstrated      concerns about their spiritual future, and stronger preaching      against cruel and undemocratic government actions could help      wear them down as similar tactics began to do with white      racists in the American south during the civil rights      movement.                            External forces       There are four categories of external forces that could      impact the situation in Zimbabwe:       International community: Thus far, neither the United      States nor the United Kingdom has been effective in making a      positive impact on the situation in Zimbabwe since      independence. The British, as the former colonial power, have      had to work through the resentment of a government to which      it ceded power. The United States has had to deal with the      resentment of former guerillas who were never supported in      the struggle against white minority rule. President Mugabe      and his loyalists have a long memory for resentment, and in      many ways, they     live in the past, fixated on the wrongs they feel were done      to them in the 1960s, 1970s and even since independence.       The European Union and nations such as Australia have      placed sanctions on Zimbabwe, but much of the rest of the      international community apparently has felt that the problems      of Zimbabwe are the responsibility of the former colonial      power and have shown little patience for engagement with a      difficult Zimbabwe regime that has too often fashioned its      own reality in its interactions with the rest of the world.      Of late, the Mugabe government has ``looked East'' to      Malaysia and China for salvation from an international      community that has pressed that government to respect the      rule of law and make governance and economic reforms. Even      now, the Zimbabwe government is appealing to China and      Malaysia to save it from an international community that      has no faith in its willingness to reform and has lost      patience with its cavalier attitude toward the rights and      welfare of its people.       International institutions: The United Nations has      condemned various actions by the Government of Zimbabwe over      the years, but has done so seemingly reluctantly and      ineffectively. It's most recent efforts in Zimbabwe, however,      were handled carefully, and hopefully will be its most      important contribution to Zimbabwe ever. By sending an envoy      whose portfolio was resettlement, the UN appeared to accept      the government's rationale that Operation Murambatsvina was a      legitimate, if clumsy, exercise. That allowed Ms. Anna      Tibaijuka to not only enter the country, but examine the      situation at length with few restrictions. Her report accused      excoriated Operation Murambatsvina as a ``disastrous      venture'' and accused the ZANU-PF government of creating a      ``humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.''       In contrast, the African Union's initial reaction to the      growing Zimbabwe crisis was to reflexively reject calls to      pressure the Zimbabwe government to end its evictions,      destruction and arrests. AU spokesman Desmond Orjiako told      BBC News on June 6th that ``If the government that they      elected says they are restoring order by their actions, I      don't think it would be proper for us to go interfering in      their internal legislation.'' Evidently, the enormity of this      operation finally convinced AU leaders to take action, but it      was so hastily put together that it failed to appropriately      prepare the way for its envoy. As a result, Mr. Bahamas Tom      Nyandunga, a member of the AU Commission on Human and      People's Rights, was confined to his hotel for several days      before being expelled from Zimbabwe during Ms. Tibaijuka's      mission. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund will      consider expelling Zimbabwe at an August meeting for failing      to make any reasonable attempt to honor its loan obligations.       African community: The AU, as of this writing, has not      reacted publicly to the rejection of its envoy. The      organization's bureaucrats are likely lamenting the failure      to follow protocols in dispatching their envoy and accepting      Zimbabwe's right to reject an envoy forced on them in      violation of the government's sovereignty. African housing      ministers, meeting during our visit, accepted Zimbabwe's      explanation of the reason or Operation Murambatsvina.      Moreover, African government have been known to engage in      similar mass evictions, such as Kenya's recent eviction of as      many as 30,000 people from homes they constructed in the Mau      Forest.       South Africa's quiet diplomacy has failed to move either      the Zimbabweans or their fellow Southern African Development      Community nations. Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia have even      complimented the Zimbabwe government and dismissed criticism.      Meanwhile, an African coalition of civil society groups, in      five news conferences held across the continent, has appealed      to the AU and the UN to stop Operation Murambatsvina. Mr.      Reuel Khoza, chairman of the New Partnership for      Africa's Development (NEPAD) has criticized the AU for      ``shirking its responsibility'' in comments to Business      Day on June 29th, calling on the AU to be ``more      outspoken'' in condemning the actions of the Mugabe      government. The South Africans seem to have heard the      message. In its conditions for funding a financial bailout      of the Zimbabwe government, it is requiring a resumption      of discussions on cooperation between ZANUPF and MDC,      economic and governance reforms and renewed respect for      rule of law. South African government officials told us      Africans were waiting for the UN report. Now that it has      blasted the Zimbabwe government's actions, all eyes are on      Africa for its reaction.       African Diaspora: People of African descent throughout the      world are often overlooked as regards the influence they      could have in bringing to an end the cover under which      African despots often operate. By invoking colonialism, neo-     colonialism and racism, Zimbabwe and other African nations      deflect criticism as efforts by the white international power      structure to either diminish their authority or impugn the      capability of black leadership. In reality, however, African      leaders such as President Mugabe have shown repeatedly that      they do not rule in the interest of their countrymen. When      Mugabe had the white commercial farms seized, he did not turn      the land over to the black farm workers who knew how to till      the land. When black professionals merely tried to defend the      legal rights of the average Zimbabwean, they were beaten and      jailed. When poor black workers tried to create acceptable      shelter until they could afford better dwellings, the      government destroyed their homes and put their lives in      limbo.       African-Americans have a long history of trying to defend      the interests of African people. In the 1930s, African-     Americans were the leading edge of the movement to save      Ethiopia from Italian conquest. Through the 1940s, 1950s and      1960s, African-Americans led the liberation struggle for      African nations struggling to break free from colonial rule.      Many African-Americans, including members of the      Congressional Black Caucus, supported Zimbabwe's liberation      struggle even when the U.S. government did not. Caucus      members and African-American opinion leaders have shown      interest in positively intervening in the Zimbabwe crisis to      benefit that country's people. This is an untapped resource      that should be utilized for the benefit of Zimbabweans and      other African people who need all the help they can get.                            RECOMMENDATIONS       American policy toward Zimbabwe has been unable to make any      significant impact on that country's government and has had a      hostile relationship with the Mugabe government since      independence. Given the factors as presented earlier, I would      suggest the following coordinated strategy to restructure      U.S. policy:       (1) Provide humanitarian assistance to the fullest extent      possible to the many displaced people. Even though the Mugabe      government would be unlikely to receive humanitarian      assistance directly from the United States, it is in the      interest of the people of Zimbabwe to funnel such help      through the World Food Programme or any other available      conduit to meet the housing, food, medical and other needs of      the people of Zimbabwe. This assistance must be provided      as swiftly as possible, and revulsion as bailing the      Zimbabwe government out of the crisis it has created must      not prevent a rapid response to this crisis.       (2) Maintain civil society throughout the current crisis      and enhance their ability to serve the needs of the people.      President Mugabe last year declined to sign a restrictive law      that would virtually tie the hands of NGOs by restricting      their international funding, but the law is expected to be      revived. Therefore, all U.S. efforts to maintain Zimbabwe      civil society must be undertaken to build their capacity to      defend the rights and interests of Zimbabwe's people. This      should take the form of increased funding, as possible, for      Zimbabwe NGOs, as well as technical assistance. As for labor      and the churches, facilitating ongoing contacts with      counterparts in other countries will be vital in enhancing      their ability to carry out the increasingly necessary task of      safeguarding the welfare of Zimbabwe's people. Funding is      included in current authorization and appropriations bills.       (3) Provide support for efforts to inform the Zimbabwean      people and the world community about events in Zimbabwe. The      established media has been hampered in the effort to film and      report on what happens in Zimbabwe. To offset this      limitation, the U.S. government has funded ``guerilla media''      to film and report on Operation Murambatsvina and other      actions taken against Zimbabwe's people. Such support must      not only continue, but be expanded. In addition to equipment      and funding to support guerilla media inside Zimbabwe,      support must be extended to SW Radio, which has broadcast by      shortwave (now medium wave) into Zimbabwe from London.      Moreover, the popular and effective Voice of American      broadcasts must continue and expand as needed.       (4) Work with the Zimbabwe business community at home and      abroad to build their capacity to survive the economic crisis      and strive toward improving the country's economic situation.      With the dismantling of the formal economy and the recent      destruction of the informal sector, efforts to rebuild both      the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, as well as a      legalized small and micro-business sector, will be vital in      enabling Zimbabweans to survive beyond what aid can provide,      accumulate wealth sufficient to escape poverty and produce      tax revenues for a reformed public sector. That will mean      encouraging the legalization of vendors under a rational,      equitable policy, in addition to the reform of the country's      investment policies so that expatriate Zimbabweans, South      Africans and other investors will feel more certain about the      commercial environment. Such investment would be an      encouragement to reformist and pragmatic elements of ZANU-PF.       (5) Help legislators in the ruling party and the opposition      party engage on issues of mutual concern. South Africa is      encouraging talks between the ruling and opposition parties.      The most likely basis for commonality now is in finding ways      to rebuild the country's economy. Rather than tackling      controversial political issues initially, working together to      save the economy could build a basis for broader cooperation,      especially since governance and economic reforms will be      inevitable if Zimbabwe's economy is to be revived. U.S.      resumption of USAID-funded programs to facilitate such      parliamentary working relationships would be a helpful      contribution to this process.       (6) Engage African nations, through their governments and      people, to stimulate African efforts to help resolve the      Zimbabwe crisis. African leaders are loathe be seen as being      forced by the developed world to castigate one of their own.      However, with the help of the Diaspora, especially African-     Americans, a successful way forward may be found to support      good governance and economic policies that build the capacity      of all Zimbabweans to escape poverty and not just make      selected citizens wealthy. This effort could include      encouragement of a team of respected African elders who could      speak with President Mugabe about necessary changes,      including his retirement. It also should include an effort to      work through the African Union and civil society across the      continent to promote a just solution to the current crisis.       (7) Selectively engage government officials and ruling      party legislators to find ways to end the current crisis and      move the country toward true democracy and economic freedom.      By lumping all of Zimbabwe's leaders in the same category,      there are no channels for discussions about how to use the      levers of power to reverse Zimbabwe's current slide. The      Zimbabwe Democracy Economic Recovery Act of 2001 allows for a      selective waiver of the visa sanctions such that cooperative      elements of ZANU-PF could be allowed into the United States      for discussions, or if a visit to the U.S. would pose a      problem for such ZANU-PF officials, then meetings could and      should be arranged in more neutral settings. However and      wherever these talks take place, they must be held if a way      forward is to be found. Isolating the entire ruling party and      government gives no encouragement for any officials to change      their behavior or the direction of the country.       Zimbabwe has been a persistent problem for U.S.      policymakers. It is time for the executive and legislative      branches to devise a mutually agreeable, coordinated policy      to bring Zimbabwe into ranks of African nations who have      developed political and economic stability and help that      nation avoid the certain fate of becoming a failed state if      its course is not changed soon. Such an eventuality will not      only have a tragically negative impact on that nation's      population, but also will be a tremendous burden for the      entire southern African region. It also will represent yet      another missed opportunity for Africa to seize available      opportunities to make advancements in the global economy.
