Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. As the gentleman knows, I am sure both sides of the aisle feel that is a critical piece of legislation, in light of the deficits that are confronting us, as to how we can get those under control. I know there are differences of opinion on that, but I know on our side of the aisle we believe that that is a very important step for us to take in light of the budget deficits.  Lastly, Mr. Leader, if I can ask the leader, it was I think tentatively believed that we would be meeting next Friday. In light of the accommodation on the FSC or jobs bill, would Members be correct in thinking that Friday of next week may not be a legislative day?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, that is very difficult to say. We do have a very ambitious schedule for next week. It could very likely take Friday to complete that schedule. However, we are going to work as hard as we can to get our work done as soon as we can; and, if we can get our work done, we may not have to work on Friday. But I would warn the Members that it is very possible that we would have to be here on Friday.                              {time}  1430
