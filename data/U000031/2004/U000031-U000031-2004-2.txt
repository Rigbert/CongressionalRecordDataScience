Chairman, I rise in support of the Barton Amendment.  Part of the spectrum which the broadcasters are to return at the end of the DTV transition has been earmarked for public safety interoperable radio communications. The tragic events of 9/11 underscore the need for this, and that is why we must move with deliberate speed to complete the transition.  But moving with deliberate speed does not mean moving recklessly, and it does not mean grasping at well-intentioned half-measures that would either cause scores of television stations to literally go dark or would actually set us back in our efforts to get spectrum into the hands of public safety because they are riddled with ill-defined exceptions.  Moreover, we need to consider consumers' analog television sets which could go dark once broadcasters cease analog broadcasts--if we do not take care to do this right. Helping public safety and minimizing consumer disruptions need not be mutually goals.  I support the Barton amendment because it says that we should impose a hard-date for the end of the entire transition as part of a comprehensive digital television transition bill to be enacted next Congress. I look forward to working in the Energy and Commerce Committee next Congress on this and other proposals to minimize consumer disruptions, focusing on how to get low-cost digital-to-analog converter boxes into the hands of consumers, not to mention other policy matters that are relevant to the transition. The Barton Amendment signs us up to move--not with reckless abandon--but with deliberate speed to ensure that we really get spectrum into the hands of public safety in an expeditious fashion.  I urge all of my colleagues to support the Barton Amendment.
