 President, I rise today to recognize a man who has played a pivotal role in the economic growth and development of western Kentucky. Harry Ruth, president of the Greater Paducah Economic Development Council, will be able to retire with the satisfaction of a job well done.  When Ruth interviewed for the job in 1989, the committee members who interviewed him were immediately convinced that he was the right person for the job. Aubrey Lippert, a bank president in Paducah, told the Paducah Sun that Ruth ``has the ability to walk into a room full of strangers and make everyone feel comfortable''.  Since he became president of GPEDC, Harry Ruth has given ``100 percent of his ability and energy'' to making Paducah and the region a better place to live. According to the Paducah Sun, Ruth has played a large part in bringing to Paducah a great deal of infrastructure necessary to expand economic development. This includes the Paducah Information Age Park, a 600-acre high-technology park on the outskirts of the city and a University of Kentucky engineering extension program that will open in about 2 years. In addition, a new industrial park is in the planning stages and the community has improved its image considerably.  Further proof of the growth that has taken place during Ruth's tenure can be found in the general economic indicators in the community. There are more jobs in Paducah than there were 7 years ago, employment is up, unemployment is down, and retail sales are up.  Dwane Tucker, who worked closely with Ruth on the Information Age Park project, told the Paducah Sun that Ruth ``gave an enormous amount of time to positioning [the] community for long-term growth . . . He put the needs of the organization above his own needs.'' Tucker added, ``He's also exceptionally skilled at building long-term relationships with people and organizations.''  It's said that a man's greatest legacy is his friends--and in that regard, Harry Ruth has a rich legacy indeed. As Harry closes this particular chapter in his life, he can take special satisfaction in the relationships he has built. It is with pleasure that I count myself among Harry Ruth's many friends in Kentucky.  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Harry Ruth for his dedicated service to western Kentucky.                          ____________________
