Madam Speaker, this past October, Hungary celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Uprising. As President Bush said in his October 18 Presidential Proclamation, ``the story of Hungarian democracy represents the triumph of liberty over tyranny.'' Like the President, I honor the men and women who struggled--not only in 1956 but for many years thereafter--for democracy in Hungary.  The following remarks were made by Istvan Gereben, a man who came to this country after the 1956 revolution, but who never forgot his homeland. They were delivered by Mr. Gereben in San Francisco on October 22, 2006, at the Remember Hungary 1956 Commemoration, at the California State Building.               Revolution, Rebirth, Freedom: Hungary 1956       From the shadows of blood, iron bars, gallows and simple      wooden crosses we step today into the sunshine of      remembrance, hope, duty and responsibility. During the past      sixteen years the ideas, guiding principles, heroes and      martyrs of 1956 gained amends. The moral and political legacy      of the Hungarian Revolution, however, still, even today, is      misunderstood, misrepresented and waiting to be fully      appreciated.       We remember . . . our friends, the Kids of Pest, the      colleagues, the relatives, the familiar strangers. The brave      Hungarians. Let's remember the dead here, thousands of miles      away from their graves but close to their soul, grieving      woefully, but full with hope. We pray for those who in their      defeat became triumphant. ``For what they have done has been      to expose the brutal hypocrisy of Communism for all      mankind''--declared Archibald McLeish in the Special Report      of Life Magazine in 1957.       Why did it happen? The best answer can be found in Sandor      Marai's poem: Christmas 1956. Angel from Heaven.     The whole world is talking about the miracle.     Priests talk about bravery in their sermons.     A politician says the case is closed.     The Pope blesses the Hungarian people.     And each group, each class, everybody     Asks why it happened this way.     Why didn't they die out as expected?     Why didn't they meekly accept their fate?     Why was the sky torn apart?     Because a people said, ``Enough!''     They who were born free do not understand,     They do not understand that     ``Freedom is so important, so important!''       The fight waged by Hungarians in 1956 was inspired by a      burning desire for freedom of the individual and the nation,      by want for national independence, by thirst for full      national and individual sovereignty and by hunger for inner      democracy. This Revolution against the Soviet occupiers was a      defining moment in Hungarian history and in the nation's      political culture. 1956 was one of the most powerful nails      driven into the coffin of an evil and fraudulent tyranny.       Then and continuously since we witness the expression of      praise, admiration of and support for the aims of this      miracle that is called the Hungarian Revolution.       Let's refresh our memory with some of the more striking      observations by our friends here in America and elsewhere in      the World:       President John F. Kennedy: ``October 23, 1956 is a day that      will forever live in the annals of free men and free nations.      It was a day of courage, conscience and triumph. No other day      since history began has shown more clearly the eternal      unquenchability of man's desire to be free, whatever the odds      against success, whatever the sacrifice required.''      (Statement, October 23, 1960)       President Ronald Reagan: ``The Hungarian Revolution of 1956      was a true revolution of, by and for the people. Its      motivations were humanity's universal longings to live,      worship, and work in peace and to determine one's own      destiny. The Hungarian Revolution forever gave the lie to      communism's claim to represent the people, and told the world      that brave hearts still exist to challenge injustice.''      (Excerpt from the Presidential Proclamation issued on October      20, 1986.)       President George W. Bush: ``On the 50th anniversary of the      Hungarian Revolution, we celebrate the Hungarians who defied      an empire to demand their liberty; we recognize the      friendship between the United States and Hungary; and we      reaffirm our shared desire to spread freedom to people around      the world.'' (Excerpt from the Presidential Proclamation      issued on October 18, 2006.)       Milovan Djilas: ``The changes in Poland mean the triumph of      national Communism, which in a different form we have seen in      Yugoslavia. The Hungarian uprising is something more, a new      phenomenon, perhaps no less meaningful than the French or      Russian Revolutions . . . The revolution in Hungary means the      beginning of the end of Communism.'' (Excerpt from ``The      Storm in Eastern Europe,'' ``The New Leader,'' No. 19, 1956.)       The New York Times: ``We accuse the Soviet Government of      murder. We accuse it of the foulest treachery and the basest      deceit known to man. We accuse it of having committed so      monstrous crime against the Hungarian people yesterday that      its infamy can never be forgiven or forgotten.'' (In an      editorial in the paper's November 1956 issue.)       I could continue with Statements made by Albert Camus,      President Richard Nixon, Sir Leslie Munroe, Henry Kissinger,      Leo Chern, Pablo Picasso, Nehru and I could read hundreds and      hundreds of pages from the Congressional Record listing the      praising remarks of hundreds and hundreds lawmakers uttered      in the past 50 years. All the words were saved for posterity,      everyone can find and savor them.       October 23, 1956 happened when two powerful ideas--     tyrannical communism and the eternal human principles of      democracy--met and clashed in the middle of Europe, in the      small and defenseless Hungary. In this inherently uneven      conflict blood was shed and lives were lost. Imre Nagy and      his colleagues were arrested, tried and most of them along      with countless Freedom Fighters were executed on June 16,      1958.       Since their death, the political and human challenge has      been to find the rationale for their supreme sacrifice. This      rationale is the indestructible dignity of every human being.      By refusing to beg for his life, Imre Nagy repudiated his      personal past for a more hopeful future of Hungary and the      world at large.       The significance of his and countless other Hungarians'      sacrifice is etched onto the political map of the 21st      century. The invented hope of the Hungarian Revolution is      taking shape in the recent developments throughout the world.      That is the real miracle of the events of 1956 and the      subsequent human sacrifices of Imre Nagy and his fellow      Freedom Fighters.       The Revolution was brutally and unavoidably defeated.       Why was the fate of the Revolution predetermined? Why did      it happen so that when we in the last days of October and the      early days of November in 1956 enthusiastically and full with      hope sensing victory strolled the streets of Budapest and the      cities and villages of Hungary not suspecting that our fate,      independently from us, already has been determined. The      deadly sentence was delivered by the powers of the world? And      if it is so why was the verdict such as it was?       Even after 50 years there is still no answer.       The questions are not new. The lack of answer frustrated      many historians, political scientists but none had the      determination, the skill, the objectivity and patience to      provide an authentic answer.       Robert Murphy, who, in the absence of Secretary of State      John Foster Dulles from Washington, attended to the day to      day business of the State Department during the Hungarian      Revolution, summarized his frustration caused by not being      able to find a satisfactory answer to Hungary's demands in      his autobiography, Diplomat Among Warriors, published in 1964      this way:       ``In retrospect, world acceptance of the Russian aggression      in Hungary is still incredible. For sheer perfidy and      relentless     suppression of a courageous people longing for their liberty,      Hungary will always remain a classic symbol. Perhaps history      will demonstrate that the free world could have intervened to      give the Hungarians the liberty they sought, but none of us      in the State Department had the skill or the imagination to      devise a way.''       This answer seems to be the most honest one.       Hungarians have fallen back in the Soviet yoke. But the      nation persevered.       There are times when remembrance is the bravest action--     declared Gyula Illyes, the eminent Hungarian poet in the      middle of the twentieth century. Today such times are present      in Hungary. The time for bravery to remain faithful to the      moral and political maxims of the Revolution. Bravery      witnessed not against the tanks, soldiers and henchmen of the      occupying empire, bravery not contesting a strange, inhuman      ideology, but courage to face insensitivity, to confront and      solve the problems of humdrum everyday life, the bravery      necessary to assume the responsibility and sacrifice of      building a truly modern country, which is democratic,      committed to observe the rule of law and governed by the      constitution. At the present, this kind of bravery does not      uniformly characterize all Hungarians.       Hungary was redeemed 35 years after the defeated      Revolution. During that 35 years her plight to fulfill the      demands of 1956 gained respect and support in the West. The      courage, the intelligence, the determination and the skill of      the Hungarian Democratic Opposition to engage a first      bloodthirsty, later, sophisticated dictatorship resulted in      recognition of the opposition's leaders as authoritative      spokesmen for the fulfillment of the desires of the Hungarian      people. They were inspired by the spirit of the Revolution      and adopted its maxims.       In the United States, Presidents and ordinary citizens      lined up in support behind the Democratic Opposition. The      United States, by publicly expressing support in words and in      action provided protection for individuals and the whole      community of the dissidents.       The U.S. Government published English translations of      selected samizdat literature produced by opposition      activists. Many volumes, each with hundreds of pages of      these, were printed and distributed in the '70s and the '80s.      A collection of these is deposited in the National Szechenyi      Library in Budapest.       Information provided by the dissidents was used by the      Hungarian Freedom Fighters Federation U.S.A. and the      Coordinating Committee of Hungarian Organizations in North      America in their countless testimonies before Congress,      the U.S Commission on Security and Cooperation, and in      numerous briefings presented in the White House and in the      State and Defense Departments.       A longstanding issue between the Hungarian Communist      Government and the Opposition, Hungarians abroad and more      significantly the United States Government was the      unwillingness of the Communist Government to identify the      secret location of the graves in which the executed Freedom      Fighters were buried. A campaign covering several decades by      U.S. Presidents, Congressman, the Commission on Security and      Cooperation, hundreds of leading public figures and civic      organizations culminated in a letter sent on June 20, 1988,      by Congressman Frank Horton, along with 43 other      Representatives urging Prime Minister Karoly Grosz of Hungary      to comply with the many requests filed with the Hungarian      Government in the past and allow the family members of the      executed to have access to the body of their relatives.      Responding in letter dated July 18, 1988 the Prime Minister      wrote:       ``My Government has the intention to settle this problem in      a humane spirit in the near future, enabling the families to      rebury the dead and to pay their tribute at the graves.''       The public ceremony of the reburial took place on June 16,      1989 in the presence of 200,000 grieving Hungarians. With      this act the road opened to free parliamentary and local      elections in 1990 and the formation of a free Government.       The demands of the Hungarian people were fulfilled. The      building of a constitutional parliamentary democracy is under      way.       In these days worrisome news comes from Hungary indicating      that the road is not smooth. The diamond of twentieth century      Hungarian history that was formed in 1956 under the stresses      of the circumstances and in the fire burning in every      Hungarian's heart is being tested today in Hungary. False      prophets, eager mouths, zealous hands driven by dark emotions      attempt to pulverize this gem into powder of coal and then      burn it into ashes and dross. They will not succeed. History      and we will not let them to succeed.       On this 50th Anniversary when we remember and pay tribute      to the ideals and heroes of 1956, we also affirm our deeply      felt conviction that lasting freedom and democracy will not      take hold in Hungary unless the precepts of the Revolution      regarding resolute unity, sacrifice, human and political      wisdom are practically and fully implemented. We call upon      those who are responsible for Hungary's welfare to heed to      the principles for which so many died in 1956 and to whose      memory we pay tribute today.       We pray that it will be so! Lord Hear our prayer . . . God      bless Hungary . . . Isten aldd meg a magyart!                          ____________________
