Mr. Chairman, I claim the 10 minutes in opposition, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided between myself and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall).  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Pease). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska?  There was no objection.
