Leader, but I appreciate the information.  On those additional items, do you expect them as well not to go through the committee process and be considered by the committee, but come directly to the floor?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding further.  As the gentleman has already found out, I thought it was being marked up this week and was told differently. I do not know how to answer that question, other than the fact that each bill will be considered on its own merits by the Committee on Ways and Means, and they will have to make a decision whether the bill merits a markup or allow it to come straight to the floor.
