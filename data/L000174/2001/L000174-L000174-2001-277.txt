I want to point out that while this bill extends the antitrust exemption for participating institutions' methodologies and applications for need-based financial aid, that exemption is still limited to the institutions' dealings with potential students collectively. It has not, and does not, exempt those institutions from the prohibitions of theSherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, with respect to awards to specific individual students. Independent of any antitrust concerns, the participating institutions also assure us that they do not discuss or compare awards for individual students, and we rely on their continuing that practice.
