I will be brief.  The Senator spoke about the dropout rates that face students in schools. I think we have all read the recent census data that suggests a substantial increase in the Hispanic, Latino population in America.  The dropout rate for white students in America is 7 percent. The dropout rate for African American students is 13 percent. The dropout rate for Hispanic, Latino students is 30 percent. It is higher among Latinos, Hispanic American women, than those Latino populations.  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, how can we have this dramatic increase of people coming into this country and dramatic dropout rates in this population without terrible consequences for our Nation? Could the Senator address, in this final question, what we can do, and should do, on this dropout side that is not going to be done if we do not receive adequate funding supported by the Bush White House?
