President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC) as it celebrates the 12th Annual Entrepreneurial Women's Conference. The event, which is to be held on September 9, 1998, at Chicago's Navy Pier, will celebrate the Women's Business Development Center's second decade of outstanding service to women in the business community.  The Women's Business Development Center is a Chicago-based nonprofit women's business assistance center devoted to providing services and programs that support and accelerate the growing role of women business owners in the economy. Since its founding in 1986 by Carol Dougal and Hedy Ratner, the Women's Business Development Center has facilitated more than $20 million in women's business loans and has assisted women-owned businesses in gaining over $90 million of government and private contracts. More than 30,000 women business owners have benefitted from the following programs and services: counseling, workshops, entrepreneurial training, the Women's Business and Finance Programs, the Women's Business Enterprise Initiative, the Entrepreneurial Woman's Conference and the Women's Business and Buyers Mart.  The success of the Women's Business Development Center has inspired similar initiatives across the country. Women's business development programs modeled after the Center have been launched by economic development organizations in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. The tremendous inroads made by women in the business community over the past decade is due in no small part to the efforts of these organizations.  Mr. President, there are now more than 7.7 million women-owned businesses in the United States, and 250,000 of these businesses are located in my homestate of Illinois. Nationally, women's businesses generate $2.3 trillion of sales and employ one out of every four U.S. company workers.  Given the importance of women-owned businesses to the economy, I look forward to hearing about the continued successes of the Women's Business Development Center in the years to come. Once again let me offer my congratulations to the Women's Business Development Center on their 12th anniversary.                          ____________________
