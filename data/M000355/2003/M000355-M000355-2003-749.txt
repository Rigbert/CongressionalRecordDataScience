 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefits bill. We have had a good debate on the issue so far yesterday and today, and a number of Members have come to the floor to speak on the merits of the bill.  Tomorrow, we expect to begin the amending process. Senators who wish to offer amendments are encouraged to contact the chairman or the ranking member of the Finance Committee so they may schedule time for consideration of their amendments.  I also advise our colleagues that rollcall votes are anticipated throughout tomorrow's session. Senators will be notified on when the first vote is scheduled.  In addition, I alert all Senators that votes are expected each day this week. As I indicated a few moments ago, we intend to complete this vital measure before we have the Fourth of July recess.                          ____________________
