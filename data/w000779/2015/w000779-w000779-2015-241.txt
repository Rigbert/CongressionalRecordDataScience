President, I call up amendment No. 968, and I urge Senators to support this amendment because it will cut taxes on the middle class and give millions of Americans a new ladder of economic opportunity. This amendment rewards hard work, makes college more affordable, and helps parents who have a tough time making ends meet. Let's create a new path upward for the middle class and those who want to be middle class. Support this amendment.  I yield back.
