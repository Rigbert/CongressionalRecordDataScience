Speaker, I apologize for my absence from the House of Representatives on May 2, 2000. I was unavoidably detained in Indiana for my Primary election, and unfortunately missed two recorded votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``Aye'' for both Rollcall votes 131 and 132.                          ____________________
