 President, I rise today, along with Senator Hatch, to introduce the Secure Authentication Feature and Enhanced Identification Defense Act of 2003, also known as the ``SAFE ID'' Act. My good friend, the Senior Senator from Utah, is joining me on this important piece of legislation.  Two of the terrorists who perpetrated the acts of 9/11 held false identification documents, which they purchased from a broker of false IDs. That broker was convicted, but sentenced merely to probation. The judge and the prosecutor publicly lamented that the law did not subject such a person to harsher penalties. These events focused new attention on an existing, growing problem--the ease with which individuals and organizations can forge and steal IDs and use them to harm our society. These circumstances weaken our efforts in the fight against terrorism; identity theft; underage drinking and drunk driving; driver's license, passport and birth certificate fraud, among others. In the post-9/11 era, we must do more to prevent the creation of false, misleading or inaccurate government IDs. This has become an issue of national importance and therefore merits a national response.  In recent years, the ability of criminals to produce authentic-looking fake IDs has grown immensely. Today, unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly common for criminals to either steal or forge, and traffic in, the very items that issuing authorities use to verify the authenticity of their IDs. These ``authentication features'' are the holograms, watermarks, and other symbols, letters and codes used in identification documents to prove that they are authentic. Unfortunately, today IDs carrying authentication features can be purchased on the Internet or through mail order outfits. In addition, breeder documents, such as birth certificates, are desk-top published, with an illegitimate embossed or foil seal. Put another way, not only do crooks forge identification documents, they also now illegally fake or steal the very features issuing authorities use to fight that crime.  Under current law, it is not illegal to possess, traffic in, or use false or misleading authentication features whose purpose is to create fraudulent IDs. That is why I am today introducing the SAFE ID Act.  The SAFE ID Act would prohibit the fraudulent use of authentication features in identity documents. Specifically, the SAFE ID Act adds authentication features to the list of items covered by 10 U.S.C. 1028(a), an existing law prohibiting fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents. In addition, the Act requires forfeiture of any violative items, such as false authentication features and relevant equipment.  It is rare that we have before us legislation that would effectively address problems as disparate as homeland defense, identity theft and underage drinking. The SAFE ID Act would do just that, by cutting the legs out from under those who would misuse technology to mislead government authorities.  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and my other colleagues, to secure consideration and passage of this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 731       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
