The question is whether or not we have to make cuts to balance the budget. The answer is ``yes.'' The question is: Should we make more cuts in order to give a tax break to wealthy people and to profitable corporations?  What the Republicans proposed in their Contract on America was a package of about $350 billion in tax breaks. That meant, in order to move toward a balanced budget, we had to cut another $350 billion in spending on other programs, and we are down to the point now, there is still waste we can find, we are also finding they are proposing cuts in education and health care and things so critically essential to our Nation.  So does it make sense to cut a college student loan in order to give a tax break to somebody making $200,000 a year? That is upside down.  If we have limited resources, focus it on the people who need it.  What we said in our tax cut package was let us focus it, for example, on families that want to deduct the cost of college education for their kid. That is sensible. That says let them put together a little account for their kids' college education and get some favorable tax treatment as a result of it. That is a good investment all around, families doing the right thing for their son or daughter, the son or daughter gets a chance of an education, and the tax code is basically giving them incentive instead of for the person making $4,000 a week, handing them a tax break which they will never even notice.
