Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I look forward to working with the gentleman. Just on the issue of the formaldehyde: we have laws and standards in this country still, despite Mr. Pruitt, that regulate the amount of formaldehyde that can be put into plywood. I have many people in my district who make plywood without using formaldehyde glues, and the Chinese put in massive amounts of formaldehyde glue, do not meet our standards, but we don't enforce or prohibit the importation, though we are about to file a case on that issue to prohibit them poisoning the American people. So that is another subject for another day.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  0930  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).  The amendment was agreed to.          Amendment No. 108 Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 108 printed in part A of House Report 115-650.
