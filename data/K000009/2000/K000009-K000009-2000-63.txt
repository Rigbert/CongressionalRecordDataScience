Speaker, I just want to say that the judge of every Member in this House really is the character of that individual in the end. The gentleman from New Mexico truly is a gentleman of his word. There is not a Member of this House on either side of the aisle that cannot go up to him and get a fair hearing. In the end, that is the measure of ourselves as an institution. It is just a joy to work with him and to serve with him.
