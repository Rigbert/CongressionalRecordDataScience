 President, all eyes today are on the House of Representatives. The country is waiting to see whether these House Democrats will give in to the temptation that every other House in modern history has managed to resist and misuse the solemn process of impeachment to blow off partisan steam. I will have more to say on this subject if House Democrats do, in fact, proceed.  Yesterday I came to the floor to discuss one initial aspect of this that concerns our Senate process. Over the weekend, my colleague the Democratic leader began asking the Senate to break from precedent, break with the unanimous template from 1999, and begin choreographing the middle of a potential trial before we have even heard opening arguments.  Back in 1999, all 100 Senators agreed on a simple pretrial resolution that set up a briefing, opening arguments, Senators' questions, and a vote on a motion to dismiss. Senators reserved all other questions, such as witnesses, until the trial was underway. That was the unanimous bipartisan precedent from 1999. Put first things first, lay the bipartisan groundwork and leave midtrial questions to the middle of the trial.  I have hoped, and still hope, that the Democratic leader and I can sit down and reproduce that unanimous bipartisan agreement this time. His decision to try to angrily negotiate through the press is unfortunate, but no amount of bluster will change the simple fact that we already have a unanimous bipartisan precedent. If 100 Senatorsthought this approach was good enough for President Clinton, it ought to be good enough for President Trump.  I hope House Democrats see reason to pull back from the precipice, but if they proceed, I hope the Democratic leader and I can sit down soon and honor the template that was unanimously agreed to the last time.  Mr. President, on another matter, in the meantime, the Senate is busy completing the legislation our country actually needs. Yesterday the Senate passed the NDAA conference report and put it on President Trump's desk. Thanks to the diligence of Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed, this critical legislation to support our armed services will become law for a 59th consecutive year.                             Appropriations  Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote on government funding bills the House passed yesterday. A lot of hard work brought this appropriations process back from the brink. Here are some of the important things that will happen as a result: stable, full-year funding for our Armed Forces, including research and modernization; the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade; and more support for key alliances like NATO, close partners like Israel, and high-priority areas like Hong Kong.  The bills also deliver on vital domestic priorities as well. It funds infrastructure and transportation projects. It repeals even more of Obamacare by cutting out more harmful taxes.  Every single State wins in this bill. By way of example, here are a few ways my State will benefit. This bill keeps the decade-old promise of a new, modern VA medical center with a special emphasis on care for women veterans. There is support for fighting invasive Asian Carp in West Kentucky, for Central Kentucky's role in high-tech agricultural research. Of course, Kentucky has a huge stake in our Nation's battle against opioid and substance abuse. I am proud these bills fund housing and treatment programs established by my CAREER Act to help those in long-term recovery reenter the workforce.  Speaking of addiction, I am especially proud that this legislation includes my T-21 legislation to raise the nationwide age for purchasing tobacco and vaping products to 21 years old and help roll back the explosion in tobacco and nicotine use among our Nation's youth.  I am proud to have worked with Senator Kaine and others on both sides to ensure that the legislation we drafted became law this year. Senator Todd Young of Indiana was also deeply involved in this as well. I am proud that these bills include direct bipartisan action that I urged to shore up the looming pension and healthcare crisis faced by coal communities in Kentucky and across the Nation.  These are some examples from Kentucky. This legislation touches, in fact, all 50 States. This is why full-year funding bills are better than chronic CRs. This is why the Senate should pass these bills this way and send them to the President's desk.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
