Chairman, just so we understand what is occurring here. I just want to make sure that the gentlewoman from North Carolina will have the opportunity to bring up her amendment at a later time, even if it might be out-of-page order, and it may not be able to come up later today, but maybe when we come back from the 4th of July.  Mr. Chairman, we just want to reserve her rights to bring this up and work out whatever needs to be done with the majority.                              {time}  1615
