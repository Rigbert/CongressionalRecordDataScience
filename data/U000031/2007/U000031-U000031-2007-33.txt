 I might just note that this shining amendment will save the taxpayers literally $30 for every bulb that is ultimately replaced. It is not going to require that we take existing bulbs that work out when they expire. We will put in energy-efficient Energy Star bulbs. It will save the taxpayers ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars.  This is a bipartisan amendment. We found two additional cosponsors in terms of Mr. Lipinski and Mr. Inglis of South Carolina. We're also in the middle of a markup, so to be more efficient, I think both of us would like to yield back our time.
