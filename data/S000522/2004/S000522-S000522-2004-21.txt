Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2486, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004. This solid compromise package incorporates 14 benefit bills that have been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, this Congress and contains more than 40 substantive provisions. S. 2468 would enhance a wide range of veterans' benefits, including protections for mobilized servicemembers.  I want to draw my colleagues' attention to Title I of this comprehensive bill, which is derived from H.R. 1716, the Veterans Earn and Learn Act. This is a bill that I introduced last year along with the ranking member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), and others.  The Veterans Earn and Learn Act represents the fifth in a series of employment and business opportunities bills that our Subcommittee on Benefits has offered over the last 3 and a half years. The Veterans Earn and Learn Act would significantly update the Montgomery GI Bill on-job training and apprenticeship programs to reflect learning opportunities in American business and industry today. This legislation is Congress's first major rewrite of the on-job training, or OJT, and apprentice policies for veterans since World War II.  Additionally, effective October 1, 2005, Title I includes a 10 percent increase in the monthly educational assistance allowance the VA furnishes to veterans and others pursuing this particular type of training.  The Veterans Earn and Learn Act is timely because almost 200,000 servicemembers and Reservists separate each year, and they would now all be eligible to use these Earn and Learn initiatives to continue to build transferrable skills.  VA's OJT and apprenticeship program is a valuable program for employers as well. Tapping into veterans as a rich resource of skilled and qualified employees is a shrewd business strategy for employers of all sizes. Veterans bring a unique combination of skill, discipline, character and talent to the workplace.  Title II of the compromise focuses on protecting the civilian job benefits of activated Reservists. In light of longer active duty tours, the major provision here would increase from 18 to 24 months the maximum period of employer-sponsored health care coverage that a Reservist-employee may elect to continue to receive.  Title III, Mr. Speaker, focuses on veterans' benefits matters. The key provision of this title is a $250 monthly increase in dependency and indemnity payments for a surviving spouse with children under the age of 18. This increase would be payable for 2 years following the service-connected death of a servicemember or veteran.  Title IV enhances housing benefits for veterans. Among its important provisions is an increase of the maximum VA home loan to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan amount for a single family residence. The increase raises from $240,000 to $333,700 the maximum VA home loan guaranty.  I am also pleased that this title makes some needed changes to provide flexibility in VA's administration of Transitional Housing program for homeless veterans. The very first loan under this program should close this month, I would point out to my colleagues, and I am looking forward to several more projects getting under way in the next 6 months.  Title V focuses on protecting some of our most vulnerable veterans and dependents when it is necessary to pay the VA benefits on their behalf to a third party.  This bill also makes improvements to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. I am pleased it includes provisions that I had authored, including one to furnish additional protections to servicemembers and their spouses with respect to residential and motor vehicle leases when the servicemember is mobilized or sent to a new duty assignment, sometimes with little advance notice.  Finally, I am especially pleased that one of the sections of Title VIII would allow the principal office of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to be located at any location in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, if that location would allow greater cost efficiencies or a permanent building for the court.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2486, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004.  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Arlen Specter and Bob Graham, the distinguished chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, in writing this comprehensive legislation. I thank them both for their leadership.  The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004 incorporates 14 benefits bills that have been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs this Congress. S. 2486 contains more than 40 substantive provisions which would enhance programs affecting veterans' education, training, employment, reemployment, compensation and pension, housing, fiduciary, protections for mobilized servicemembers, and other benefits.  Mr. Speaker, I want to draw my colleagues' attention to title one of this comprehensive bill, the Veterans Earn and Learn Act, which is derived from H.R. 1716, introduced by Ranking Member Lane Evans and me and many others.  This section represents the fifth of six measures in a Veterans' Jobs and Business Opportunities package that our Subcommittee on Benefits has authored over the last 3\1/2\ years. I appreciate the vision and bipartisan leadership of Jack Quinn and Bob Filner, followed by J.D. Hayworth and Bob Filner, then Mike Simpson and Silvestre Reyes, and now Henry Brown and Michael Michaud on this package.  Title one of the bill would significantly update the on-job training and apprenticeship programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs to reflect learning opportunities in American business and industry today. Indeed, this legislation is Congress' first major rewrite of on-job training, OJT, and apprenticeship policies for veterans since World War II.  Plus, effective October 1 of 2005, the bill would increase by 10 percent the monthly educational assistance allowance that the Department of Veterans Affairs furnishes eligible veterans, dependent widows and children, and Reservists.  The Veterans Earn and Learn title of the bill is timely because 419 military occupational specialties are currently transferable to the civilian economy. Almost 200,000 separating servicemembers per year, including Reservists, would be eligible to use these Earn and Learn initiatives to continue to build transferable skills. This measure represents a unique opportunity for veterans, Reservists, and dependent widows and children to use their VA educational assistance benefits to augment the entry-level wage the employer pays them as they train on the job. As the training wage increases over time, the monthly VA educational assistance allowance decreases.  VA's OJT and apprenticeship program is a valuable program for employers, too. For example, in a 3-year apprenticeship, VA education benefits under this measure would augment the veteran's training wage furnished by the employer by $17,891. In fact, Missouri has documented that VA's on-job training and apprenticeship programs improve employee retention and bring significant federal training dollars to Missouri communities to the tune of $38 million annually. Tapping into veterans as a rich source of skilled and qualified employees is a shrewd business strategy for employers of all sizes, as veterans bring a unique combination of skill, discipline, character, and talent to the workplace.  The monthly OJT/apprenticeship rates vary based on eligibility. But here are some brief examples of the amount of VA educationalprogram allowances beneficiaries would receive in 1- and 2-year on-job training programs and 3- and 4-year apprenticeships under the Montgomery GI Bill:  A Reservist participating in a 1-year on-job training program as a management trainee in a retail establishment would receive $2,471 over 12 monthly payments.  A widow or dependent child who participates in a 2-year training program as a financial adviser with an investment firm would receive $9,643 over 24 monthly payments.  A veteran who participates in a 3-year apprenticeship program in plumbing would receive $17,891 over 36 monthly payments.  A veteran who participates in a 4-year apprenticeship program as an electrician would receive $22,529 over 48 monthly payments.  Mr. Speaker, it's important to note that on-job training and apprenticeships are excellent, practical ways for veterans to use their VA education benefits, especially for those who are married with families to support. VA education benefits are not limited to classroom training.  Let me now highlight other titles in this comprehensive bill.  Title two focuses on employment matters. A major aspect of this title is a provision to increase from 18 to 24 months the maximum period of employer-sponsored health coverage that an employee covered by the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 may elect to continue to receive. This extension of coverage is essential given the longer active-duty tours of our reservists. I commend Representatives Henry Brown and Michael Michaud for their leadership on this issue.  Title three focuses on veterans' benefits matters. A key part of this title is the provision that provides a $250 monthly increase in dependency and indemnity payments for a surviving spouse with children under age 18. These payments are authorized during the 2-year period following the service-connected death of the servicemember or veteran. I commend Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Graham for their leadership on this provision.  Title four enhances housing matters. Among other important provisions, this section of the bill increases the maximum VA home loan to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan amount for a single-family residence. It also annually indexes the maximum amount of VA's home loan guaranty for construction or purchase of a home to that Freddie Mac limit. In effect, the increase raises from 240,000 to $333,700 the maximum home loan purchase amount on a VA-guaranteed purchase.  I am also very pleased this section makes some small needed changes the Department of Veterans Affairs has asked for to provide greater flexibility in its administration of the Transitional Housing program. I was pleased to work with VA in this regard so as to make the Transitional Housing program as effective as possible.  Title five focuses on fiduciary matters to protect our more vulnerable veterans and dependents when they require a third party payee to receive VA benefits on their behalf. These provisions are the result of 2 hearings held by the Subcommittee on Benefits, and I commend Representatives Henry Brown and Susan Davis for their work on this section of the bill.  Title six addresses various memorial affairs issues, including designating a monument constructed at the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, CA, as a Prisoner of War/Missing in Action National Memorial.  Title seven makes various improvements to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. I am very pleased this section of the bill includes the provision I authored to furnish additional protections to servicemembers and their spouses with respect to residential and motor vehicle leases. This provision modifies section 305 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to address the reality of servicemembers having to terminate leases due to longer-term mobilization or deployment. This provision clarifies that if a servicemember terminates a lease entered into jointly with a dependent--usually the spouse--the obligations of both the servicemember and the dependent are terminated. This affords military families the additional protections they need when the servicemember is mobilized to a new duty assignment--sometimes with little advance notice--and the family, too, must relocate.  Lastly, title eight addresses other important matters. I am pleased this section authorizes that the principal office of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to be located at any location in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. Another location may furnish greater cost efficiencies for the court.  In closing, I thank Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Michaud for their leadership and continued bipartisan cooperation. I'd also like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs for their diligent work in bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2486.  Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues, the following is a joint explanatory statement describing the compromise agreement we have reached with the other body and a letter from the Committee on the Judiciary concerning S. 2486 and our committee's response.         Explanatory Statement on Senate Amendments to S. 2486       S. 2486, as amended, the ``Veterans Benefits Improvement      Act of 2004,'' reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the      Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs (the      Committees) on the following bills reported during the 108th      Congress: S. 2485, as amended; S. 2486, as amended; and S.      1132, as introduced (Senate Bills); H.R. 1716, as amended;      H.R. 3936; H.R. 4175, as amended; H.R. 4345; and H.R. 4658,      as amended (House Bills).       The Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of S. 2486, as amended      (Compromise Agreement). Differences between the provisions      contained in the Compromise Agreement and the related      provisions of S. 2485, as amended; S. 2486, as amended; S.      1132, as introduced; H.R. 1716, as amended; H.R. 3936; H.R.      4175, as amended; H.R. 4345; and H.R. 4658, as amended; are      noted in this document, except for clerical corrections,      conforming changes made necessary by the Compromise      Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying      changes.                  TITLE I--VETERANS EARN AND LEARN ACTMODIFICATION OF BENEFIT ENTITLEMENT CHARGES FOR CERTAIN ON-JOB TRAINING                                 PROGRAMS     Current Law       Section 3687 of title 38, United States Code, charges the      Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty and Selected Reserve programs'      entitlement usage based on the actual ``dollars used'' of      monthly VA payment amounts. The entitlement charge under the      Vietnam-era and survivors' and dependents' educational      assistance programs is based on the time spent in certain      training programs.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 102 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would modify the      manner in which VA on-job training and apprenticeship benefit      entitlement is charged under the MGIB, Vietnam-era and      survivors' and dependents' programs. The modification would      charge entitlement usage for all programs based on ``dollars      used'' rather than time spent in training. This provision      would take effect one year after date of enactment.     Compromise Agreement       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with an effective date of months beginning after      September 30, 2005. INCREASE IN BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUALS PURSUING APPRENTICESHIP OR ON-JOB                                 TRAINING     Current Law       Sections 3032 and 3233 of title 38, United States Code, and      Section 16131 of title 10, United States Code, state that      beneficiaries pursuing full-time apprenticeship or on-job      training programs will receive 75 percent of the monthly      educational assistance benefit for the first six months of      training, 55 percent for the second six months of training      and 35 percent for the subsequent months.       Section 3687 of title 38, United States Code, states that      beneficiaries receiving full-time VA monthly Survivors' and      Dependents' Educational Assistance allowances payable to      individuals pursuing full-time apprenticeship or on-job      training programs will receive, as of October 1, 2004, $585      for the first six months of training, $438 for the second six      months of training, $291 for the third six months, and $147      for the remainder of the program.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 104 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would increase by 10      percent the full-time VA monthly educational assistance      allowance payable to individuals pursuing a full-time      apprenticeship or on-job training program. For the first six      months of training, the percentage of the monthly benefit      would increase to 85 percent; for the second six months of      training, to 65 percent; and for subsequent months to 45      percent. These percentage increases would apply to the      Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty and Selected Reserve programs,      and the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance      program. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational      Assistance program would increase to $650 for the first six      months of training, $507 for the second six months of      training and $366 for the third six months. This provision      would be in effect from October 1, 2005 through September 30,      2010.     Compromise Agreement       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows      the House language, but     the 10 percent increase would take effect October 1, 2005      through December 31, 2007.             AUTHORITY FOR COMPETENCY-BASED APPRENTICESHIPS     Current Law       Section 3672 of title 38, United States Code, currently      allows payment of VA educational assistance benefits for      time-based apprenticeships.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 105 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would authorize VA to      pay educational assistance benefits to veterans participating      in approved programs of competency-based apprenticeships;      this new authority is in addition to time-based      apprenticeships. In the case of a competency-based      apprenticeship registered with the Secretary of Labor, this      provision requires VA to consider Department of Labor      standards in determining the appropriate length and structure      of the competency-based apprenticeship. This section would      also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use up to $3      million to develop the computer systems and procedures needed      to carry out section 105(a), 102, 103, and 104 of the bill.     Compromise Agreement       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. The Committees note that this provision      acknowledges competency-based apprenticeships but does not      require employers to use them in lieu of time-based      apprenticeships. In today's workplace, apprenticeship      programs are time-based or competency-based, or a combination      of the two. Lastly, the Committees note that apprenticeships      offered in industries that elect not to register them with      the Department of Labor, but are approved by a State      approving agency or VA, would continue to serve as legitimate      training opportunities for veterans.TEN-YEAR EXTENSION OF DELIMITING PERIOD FOR SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS'  EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR SPOUSES OF MEMBERS WHO DIES ON ACTIVE DUTY     Current Law       Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, entitles the      surviving spouse of a servicemember or veteran who died of a      service-connected injury, or the spouse of a veteran who is      rated by VA as totally and permanently disabled as the result      of a service-connected disability, to educational assistance      provided by the Secretary. An eligible spouse is entitled to      use such educational assistance during a ten-year period      beginning on either: (1) the date the person became eligible      by reason of the servicemember's or veteran's service-     connected death, or (2) the date on which the veteran was      rated by VA as totally and permanently disabled as the result      of a service-connected injury. A spouse may be eligible for      two ten-year eligibility periods as the result of two      distinct qualifying events. A spouse who is entitled to two      eligibility periods will not have a subsequent period of      eligibility reduced by any earlier period.     Senate Bill       Section 203 of S. 2486, as amended, would extend chapter 35      educational assistance eligibility from 10 to 20 years for a      surviving spouse of any person who died on active duty.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.     AVAILABILITY OF EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS FOR PAYMENT FOR NATIONAL    ADMISSIONS EXAMS AND NATIONAL EXAMS FOR CREDIT AT INSTITUTIONS OF                             HIGHER EDUCATION     Current Law       Sections 3452(b) and 3501(a)(5) of title 38, United States      Code, define the term ``program of education'' to generally      include a required course, or combination of courses, that      lead to an identified educational, professional, or      vocational objective. A ``program of education'' also      includes licensing or certification tests that are generally      required to enter into, maintain, or advance in a vocation or      profession. Section 3002(3) of title 38, United States Code,      expands the definition of ``program of education'' provided      in 3452(b) to include preparatory courses for a test required      or used for admission to an institution of higher education      or graduate school.     Senate Bill       Section 204 of S. 2486, as amended, would authorize VA to      provide educational assistance benefits to reimburse eligible      beneficiaries for the cost of certain national tests required      for admission to institutions of higher learning or graduate      schools and for national tests that can qualify veterans for      receipt of college credit.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, but adds the College Level Examination Program      (CLEP) as an example of a test for which educational      assistance benefits may be used.REQUIREMENT FOR COORDINATION OF DATA AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS       AFFAIRS, DEFENSE, AND LABOR WITH RESPECT TO ON-JOB TRAINING     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 107 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would require certain      coordination of information among the Departments of Veterans      Affairs, Defense, and Labor with respect to on-job training      and apprenticeship programs. First, at the time of a      servicemember's separation from active duty, the Secretary of      Defense would be required to furnish the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs with information concerning each registered      apprenticeship pursued by the servicemember during his or her      active duty service. Second, it would require the Secretary      of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with the Secretary of      Labor, to encourage and assist States and private      organizations to accord credit to servicemembers for skills      in any related apprenticeship the servicemember may pursue in      civilian life.     Compromise Agreement       Section 107 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.    PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ON-JOB BENEFITS TO TRAIN DEPARTMENT OF                   VETERANS AFFAIRS CLAIMS ADJUDICATORS     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 106 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would require the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program to      furnish structured on-job training and on-job training      benefits to claims adjudicators training in its disability      compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC),      and pension programs. The Secretary would be required to      submit reports concerning continuation and expansion of the      pilot program.     Compromise Agreement       Section 108 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows      the House language, but authorizes the Secretary to establish      a pilot program to furnish formal, structured on-job      training/benefits to claims adjudicators at the Secretary's      discretion, and not by statutory mandate. The Committees note      that one of VA's four regional offices that adjudicate      educational assistance claims already offer such formal,      structured on-job training. COLLECTION OF PAYMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER MONTGOMERY GI     BILL FROM MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY     Current Law       Sections 3011(b) and 3012(c) require that for a      servicemember to be eligible for Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB)      educational assistance benefits, the servicemember's active      duty pay must be reduced by $100 for each of the first 12      months that the individual is entitled to such pay. The      Secretary of Defense (or, in cases involving the activation      of U.S. Coast Guard personnel, the Secretary of Homeland      Security) is responsible for the collection of the $1,200      payment.     Senate Bill       Section 201 of S. 2486, as amended, would permit the      Secretary of Defense (or, in cases involving the activation      of Coast Guard personnel, the Secretary of Homeland Security)      to collect an activated Selected Reserve member's $1,200      payment before the servicemember commences use of MGIB      educational assistance benefits.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 109 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language with the requirement that the servicemember furnish      a $1,200 payment not later than 1 year after completion of      the 2 years of active duty.                      TITLE II--EMPLOYMENT MATTERS             Subtitle A--Employment and Reemployment Rights   TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE                                 COVERAGE     Current Law       Section 4317(a)(1)(A) of title 38, United States Code,      allows servicemembers covered under the Uniformed Services      Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) to      elect to continue employer-provided health coverage for up to      18 months while on active duty, provided the servicemember      pays up to 102 percent of the premium.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 201 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would increase from      18 months to 24 months the maximum period of employer-     provided health coverage that an employee covered by USERRA      may elect to continue. The coverage would become effective on      the first day of the servicemember's absence from employment      following the date of enactment of this provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                REINSTATEMENT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS     Current Law       Section 4332 of title 38, United States Code, formerly      required that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with      the Office of Special Counsel and the U.S. Attorney General,      provide annual reports to Congress on the disposition of      cases filed under USERRA. This requirement expired on      February 1, 1996.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 202 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would reinstate a      requirement that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with      the Office of Special Counsel and the U.S. Attorney General,      provide annual reports to Congress on the disposition of      cases filed under USERRA, effective February 1, 2005.     Compromise Agreement       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES UNDER                                  USERRA     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 211 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require      employers to provide notice to employees of the rights,      benefits and obligations under USERRA. Section 211 would also      require the Department of Labor to make available to      employers, within 90 days after the date of enactment of this      provision, the text of the notice.     Compromise Agreement       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.  DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR REFERRAL OF USERRA CLAIMS AGAINST FEDERAL                AGENCIES TO THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL     Current Law       Section 4322 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      an individual who believes his or her USERRA rights have been      violated by a Federal executive agency may file a complaint      with the Secretary of Labor to investigate such complaint. If      the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve the complaint,      then in accordance with section 4324 of title 38, United      States Code, the individual may request that the Secretary of      Labor refer the complaint to the Office of Special Counsel      (OSC) for resolution before the Merit Systems Protection      Board.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 212 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the      Secretary of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to      carry out a three-year demonstration project on enforcement      of USERRA rights for Federal executive branch employees. The      demonstration project would allow certain individuals who      allege a Federal executive agency has violated their USERRA      rights to file a complaint with OSC. For the OSC      demonstration project, USERRA cases involving Federal      agencies would be selected by the terminal digit of the      claimant's social security number or, if there is no social      security number, the claimant's case number. Cases with odd      terminal digits would be sent directly to OSC. The      Comptroller General of the United States would be required to      conduct periodic evaluations of the demonstration project and      submit to Congress a final report.     Compromise Agreement       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. While this demonstration project would be limited      to USERRA cases involving Federal executive agency employees,      the Committees intend to examine further USERRA education and      enforcement activities by the Departments of Labor, Justice      and Defense to determine whether all claimants are being      effectively and efficiently served under the current system.                       Subtitle B--Other MattersREPORT OF EMPLOYMENT PLACEMENT, RETENTION, AND ADVANCEMENT OF RECENTLY                         SEPARATED SERVICEMEMBERS     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 206 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would direct the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract for a report within      180 days of enactment on employment placement, retention, and      advancement of recently-separated veterans.     Compromise Agreement       Section 211 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                      TITLE III--BENEFITS MATTERSADDITIONAL DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES                         WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN     Current Law       Section 1311(a) of title 38, United States Code, prescribes      the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) to      the surviving spouse of a veteran or servicemember who dies      as a result of a service-connected disability. Section      1311(b) provides for an additional amount of DIC to be paid      for each of the surviving spouse's children who are under the      age of 18.     Senate Bill       Section 4 of S. 1132, as introduced, would provide for a      $250 monthly increase in DIC payments for a surviving spouse      with children below the age of 18. Such payments would be      authorized during the 5-year period following the service-     connected death of the servicemember or veteran. Such      payments would cease when all children of a surviving spouse      reach age 18.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, except that the $250 monthly increase in DIC would      only be authorized during the 2-year period following the      application for such benefit. The Committees intend that when      the Secretary notifies a DIC recipient of the additional      benefit provided by this section, such notice shall clearly      indicate that this is a transitional benefit which is limited      to two years.    OFFSET OF VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND       INDEMNITY COMPENSATION FROM AWARDS UNDER RADIATION EXPOSURE                           COMPENSATION PROGRAM     Current Law       Under current law, a veteran who first applies for and      receives an award under the compensation program administered      by the Department of Justice pursuant to the Radiation      Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), Public Law 101-426, is      prohibited from receiving benefits from the Department of      Veterans Affairs. However, a veteran who applies for VA      benefits first may then apply for the RECA award, subject to      an offset by the Department of Justice of the amounts      received from VA.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 202 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would repeal the bar      that prevents a veteran or survivor from applying for VA      benefits if the individual had previously received      compensation from the Department of Justice's RECA program.      The bill would allow individuals to receive VA compensation      or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits to      which they are entitled. However, VA would be required to      withhold compensation or DIC payments until the amount of the      RECA award has been deducted. This provision is effective for      compensation or DIC benefits paid after March 26, 2002. This      is the date regulations providing for a presumption of      service-connection for certain radiation-related disabilities      were established.     Compromise Agreement       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. EXCLUSION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS FROM CONSIDERATION AS INCOME FOR                        VETERANS' PENSION PURPOSES     Current Law       Section 1503(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires      VA in determining eligibility for death pension benefits to      consider annual income, including all payments of any kind or      from any source.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 203 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would exclude life      insurance proceeds from consideration of income for death      pension benefits.     Compromise Agreement       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. CERTAIN SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITY BENEFITS AUTHORIZED FOR PERSONS   DISABLED BY TREATMENT OR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROVIDED BY THE                      DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS     Current Law       Section 1151(a) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      disability compensation or dependency and indemnity      compensation for veterans and their dependents who are      injured or die as a result of negligent VA medical treatment,      or in VA-sponsored rehabilitation or training. Under the      decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit in Kilpatrick v. Secretary of Veterans      Affairs, 327 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2003), veterans disabled      under section 1151 are eligible for specially adapted housing      allowances under chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code.      Section 1151(b) prohibits the receipt of VA compensation      benefits or DIC (for amounts attributable to loss of      consortium or society) where an individual, on or after      December 1, 1962, receives a judgment against, or settlement      or compromise payment from, the United States, until an      amount equal to any judgment against, or settlement or      compromise payment from the United States is recouped.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 205(a) of H.R. 1716, as amended, would allow      veterans and dependents who     are injured as a result of negligent VA medical treatment or      rehabilitation or training to qualify for vocational      rehabilitation benefits, in addition to specially adapted      automobile and adaptive equipment grants. Section 205(b)      would provide that where a judgment, settlement or compromise      of a claim is offset against benefits provided by the      Secretary, such offset would be applied only to the      comparable benefit.     Compromise Agreement       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows      the House language, but omits eligibility for vocational      rehabilitation benefits. Section 205(c) is amended to provide      that in the event that a judgment, settlement or compromise      specifically designates a portion of such award for housing      or automobile benefits such as those provided under Chapters      21 or 39, and the beneficiary later applies for benefits      under Chapter 21 or 39, benefits under those chapters would      be reduced by the amount of benefits specifically designated      in the judgment, settlement or compromise. Any amounts in      excess of those permitted under Chapter 21 or 39 would be      offset against benefits paid under Chapter 11.                    EFFECTIVE DATE OF DEATH PENSION     Current Law       Section 5110(d) of title 38, United States Code, provides      that an award based on a death pension claim received more      than 45 days after the veteran's death can be effective no      earlier than the date of the claim. If the application is      received within 45 days of the veteran's death, then the      effective date of the death pension award is the first day of      the month in which the death occurred.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 204 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would repeal the 45-     day rule for the effective date of death pension. Therefore,      a claim for death pension received within one year from the      date of the veteran's death would be effective the first day      of the month in which the death occurred.     Compromise Agreement       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.  CODIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO PRESUMPTIONS OF      SERVICE CONNECTION FOR VETERANS EXPOSED TO IONIZING RADIATION     Current Law       Section 1112(c)(2) of title 38, United States Code, lists      16 diseases that VA presumes are related to exposure to      ionizing radiation. In addition to the 16 listed in statute,      VA regulations list an additional five diseases: bone cancer,      brain cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.      Servicemembers who participated in certain radiation-risk      activities, as defined in section 1112(c)(3)(B), benefit from      the presumption of service-connection to ionizing radiation.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 201 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would add bone      cancer, brain cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian      cancer to the statutory list of those diseases presumed to be      related to ionizing radiation exposure during participation      in certain radiation-risk activities. Section 201 would also      codify additional locations where radiation-risk activities      occurred for purposes of determining which veterans qualify      for the presumption of service-connection of certain diseases      related to ionizing radiation exposure.     Compromise Agreement       Section 306 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                       TITLE IV--HOUSING MATTERS  AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING TO CERTAIN DISABLED                                 VETERANS     Current Law       Chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the      Secretary to provide grants to adapt or acquire suitable      housing for certain severely disabled veterans.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 302 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would extend      eligibility for specially adapted housing grants to veterans      with permanent and total service-connected disabilities due      to the loss, or loss of use, of both arms at or above both      elbows.     Compromise Agreement       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                    TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AMENDMENTS     Current Law       Section 2051 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      the general authority governing loan guarantees for      multifamily transitional housing. Section 2052 establishes      eligibility and other requirements for such loans.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 303 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would provide that a      multifamily transitional housing project that is funded by a      VA-guaranteed loan may accept uncompensated voluntary      services as defined in section 2011(d) of title 38, United      States Code, in connection with the construction, alteration,      or repair of such project. This section would also add      commercial activities, other than neighborhood retail      services or job training programs, to the purposes for which      multifamily transitional housing space may be used.     Compromise Agreement       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. The Committees intend that veterans be hired at      these new centers of commercial activity where practicable.   INCREASE IN, AND ANNUAL INDEXING OF, MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF HOME LOAN             GUARANTY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND PURCHASE OF HOMES     Current Law       Section 3703 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      that a loan of more than $144,000 made to an eligible veteran      under section 3710 for purchase or construction of a home is      automatically guaranteed by the United States in an amount      not to exceed the lesser of $60,000 or 25 percent of the      loan.     Senate Bill       Section 101 of S. 2486, as amended, would increase the      maximum VA home loan guaranty to 25 percent of the Freddie      Mac conforming loan amount for a single-family residence and      annually index the maximum amount of VA's home loan guaranty      for construction or purchase of a home to the Freddie Mac      limit.     House Bill       Section 301 of H.R. 1716, as amended, and H.R. 4345 contain      a similar provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.   EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR GUARANTEE OF ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES     Current Law       Section 3707 of title 38, United States Code, formerly      authorized a three-year test of a VA-guaranteed adjustable      rate mortgage program (ARM). The VA ARM program was in force      from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1995.     Senate Bill       Section 102 of S. 2486, as amended, would reinstate the VA      ARM program and extend its authorization through fiscal year      2011.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language but would extend the VA ARM program authorization      through fiscal year 2008.    EXTENSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF AUTHORITY FOR GUARANTEE OF HYBRID                        ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES     Current Law       Section 3707A of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      VA, during fiscal years 2004 and 2005, to guarantee hybrid      adjustable rate mortgage (hybrid ARM) loans. Annual interest      rate adjustments on VA-guaranteed hybrid ARM loans are      subject to a maximum increase or decrease of one percentage      point and are limited over the term of the mortgage to a      maximum increase of five percentage points above the initial      fixed rate of interest.     Senate Bill       Section 103 of S. 2486, as amended, would extend the      authority of VA to guarantee hybrid ARM loans through fiscal      year 2011. For hybrid ARM loans with fixed periods of      interest of less than 5 years, the initial and subsequent      annual interest rate adjustments would be limited to one      percentage point. For hybrid ARM loans with an initial rate      of interest fixed for 5 years or more, section 103 would give      VA the authority to set an appropriate interest rate cap for      the initial interest rate adjustment. Annual adjustments      thereafter would be subject to a one percentage point cap.      Finally, section 103 would require VA to prescribe the      maximum number of percentage points above the initial fixed      rate of interest that would limit, over the term of a hybrid      ARM mortgage, interest rate adjustments.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 405 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language but would extend the VA hybrid ARM program through      fiscal year 2008.TERMINATION OF COLLECTION OF LOAN FEES FROM VETERANS RATED ELIGIBLE FOR            COMPENSATION AT PRE-DISCHARGE RATING EXAMINATIONS     Current Law       Section 3729(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires      VA to collect a fee from each person obtaining a housing loan      guaranteed by VA. Section 3729(c) prohibits the collection of      loan fees from veterans who are receiving VA disability      compensation. Disability compensation may only be paid upon      an active duty servicemember's discharge from service.     Senate Bill       Section 104 of S. 2486, as amended, would allow a      servicemember who is rated eligible to receive disability      compensation as a result of a pre-discharge medical      examination     to qualify for a waiver of the VA home loan funding fee.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 406 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.  THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PILOT                                 PROGRAM     Current Law       Section 3761 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      the general authority governing a pilot program for housing      loans to Native Americans residing on tribal lands. The pilot      program is authorized through December 31, 2005.     House Bill       H.R. 5153 would extend the Native American Home Loan      Program through December 31, 2010.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 407 of the Compromise Agreement extends the pilot      program until December 31, 2008.                TITLE V--MATTERS RELATING TO FIDUCIARIES                        DEFINITION OF FIDUCIARY     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 301 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would define a      fiduciary for the purposes of chapters 55 and 61 of title 38,      United States Code, as (1) the guardian, curator,      conservator, committee or person legally vested with the      responsibility or care of a claimant (or the estate) or of a      beneficiary (or beneficiary's estate); or (2) any other      person appointed in a representative capacity to receive      money paid from VA.     Compromise Agreement       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.       INQUIRY, INVESTIGATIONS, AND QUALIFICATION OF FIDUCIARIES     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 302 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require VA to      certify, following an inquiry or investigation, the fitness      of a fiduciary. Such inquiry or investigation would be      conducted through, to the extent practicable, a face-to-face      interview, review of a credit report issued within one year      of the fiduciary's proposed appointment, and the furnishing      of any bond that may be required by the Secretary.      Additionally, the Secretary would be required to request      information on whether that person has been convicted of any      offense under Federal or State law resulting in imprisonment      for more than one year. If the proposed fiduciary has been      convicted of such an offense, the Secretary may certify the      person as a fiduciary only if the Secretary makes a specific      finding of rehabilitation and finds that the proposed      fiduciary is an appropriate one to act as the fiduciary for      the beneficiary.       In cases of a parent or step-parent of a minor beneficiary      (natural or adopted), spouse or parent of an incompetent      beneficiary, a person who has been appointed by a court of      competent jurisdiction, or a person appointed to manage an      estate where the annual amount of veterans benefits to be      managed does not exceed $3,600 (adjusted for annual cost-of-     living increases), the Secretary may certify the potential      fiduciary on an expedited basis.       If needed to protect the assets of the beneficiary when a      determination of incompetence is being made or appealed, or a      fiduciary is appealing a determination of misuse of veteran's      benefits, the Secretary would have the authority to appoint a      temporary fiduciary, for a period not to exceed 120 days. If      a final decision has not been made within 120 days of the      appointment of the temporary fiduciary, the Secretary would      not be able to continue the temporary appointment without a      court order for the appointment of a guardian, conservator,      or similar legal fiduciary.     Compromise Agreement       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with modifications. Language requiring a specific      finding of rehabilitation before a person with a prior felony      conviction may be appointed to serve as a fiduciary is      omitted. The Committees intend that the Secretary have      discretion in determining when such a person would be an      appropriate person to serve as a fiduciary. The Committees      expect the Secretary to consider such factors as the length      of time since the conviction, the nature of the offense, the      relationship of the proposed fiduciary to the beneficiary,      and other factors which would demonstrate the appropriateness      of the appointment.                   MISUSE OF BENEFITS BY FIDUCIARIES     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 303 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would, if the      Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction determines the      fiduciary misused some or all of the veterans' benefits,      prohibit a fiduciary from collecting a fee from a beneficiary      for any month benefits were misused. Additionally, any fee      collected would be considered to be misused.       Any fiduciary, except a Federal, State or local government      agency, would be liable for the amount misused, and that      amount would be treated as an erroneous payment to the      fiduciary for purposes of laws pertaining to the recovery of      overpayments. The misappropriated amount would be recovered      in the same manner as any other debt due the United States,      and the Secretary would repay to the beneficiary or the      beneficiary's successor fiduciary, an amount equal to the      recovered amount.       In the event the misused benefits are due to the      Secretary's negligent failure to investigate or monitor the      fiduciary, the Secretary would be liable to reissue all the      benefits. Examples of failure to monitor a fiduciary      adequately would include the Secretary's failing to review,      in a timely manner, a fiduciary's accounting; failing to      act in a timely manner when notified of allegations of      misuse; and any other case when actual negligence is      shown. In any case, a fiduciary who is (1) not an      individual (i.e., an agency) or (2) is an individual who,      for any month during a period when misuse occurs, serves      ten or more individuals who are beneficiaries under title      38, United States Code, the Secretary would also reissue      benefits. When the Secretary reissues a benefit payment,      the Secretary is directed to make a good-faith effort to      recoup the funds from the fiduciary to which the original      payment was made.     Compromise Agreement       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with modifications. The Committees have omitted      language authorizing the Secretary to make a finding of      misuse and treat the portions of benefits misused as      erroneous payments to the fiduciary. Also omitted is language      authorizing the Secretary to impose liability upon the      fiduciary and recover misused funds in the same manner as any      other debt owed to the United States. In addition, the      Committees have omitted the provision that would have made a      determination by the Secretary that a fiduciary has misused      benefits a decision of the Secretary for purposes of section      511(a) of title 38, United States Code. The Committees      recognize that it is the duty of the Federal government to      recover misused funds and expect that VA and other government      agencies will make every effort to recover misused funds.      However, at this time, the Committees need to assess further      the appropriateness of requiring a fiduciary accused of      misuse by the Secretary to appeal such a finding in the      appeals venue established for adjudicating veterans'      entitlement claims.       The Committees have also amended the provision requiring      the Secretary to reissue benefits when the Secretary has      negligently failed to monitor or investigate a fiduciary. In      particular, the Committees have specified that a timely      review of a scheduled accounting or investigation of misuse      is one that occurs within 60 days of the scheduled accounting      or notification of alleged misuse.       ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH FIDUCIARIES     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 304 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the      Secretary to conduct periodic onsite reviews of any person or      agency located in the United States that serves as a      fiduciary to more than 20 beneficiaries and who administers a      total annual amount of benefits administered of $50,000 or      more (to be adjusted annually to reflect cost-of-living      adjustments). Additionally, the Secretary would be authorized      to require a fiduciary to file a report or accounting of      disbursement of benefits in accordance with regulations      prescribed by the Secretary. In the event a fiduciary fails      to file the requested report, the Secretary would be      authorized to require a fiduciary to appear in person at a VA      regional office to receive payment.       In the event the Secretary determines a fiduciary converts      a payment for some use other than for use on the      beneficiary's behalf, the Secretary would be authorized to      assess, in addition to any other penalty that may be      prescribed by law, a civil monetary penalty of not more than      $5,000 per conversion. Such person would also be subject to      an assessment by the Secretary of not more than twice the      amount of any payments converted.       Additionally, any Federal court, when sentencing a      defendant convicted of an offense arising from the misuse of      benefits, could have ordered, in addition to or in lieu of      any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make      restitution to the Department and the court would have been      required to state on the record the reasons for not ordering      restitution, or only ordering partial restitution. Any      amounts received or recovered     would be available to defray the expenses incurred by the      VA's Office of Inspector General for the inquiry or      investigation of fiduciaries.     Compromise Agreement       Section 504 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with modifications. The title of new section 5509,      of title 38, United States Code, has been changed to reflect      more accurately the requirements of that section. The      provision for imposition of civil monetary penalties has been      omitted. The Compromise Agreement omits provisions allowing      amounts received in excess of benefit restitution to be made      available to the Office of the Inspector General.                             ANNUAL REPORT     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 305 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the      Secretary to include in the ``Annual Benefits Report of the      Veterans Benefits Administration'' or the ``Secretary's      Annual Performance and Accountability Report'' information      concerning fiduciaries who have been appointed to receive      benefits. The required report would include the following (1)      the number of beneficiaries in each category (veteran,      surviving spouse, child, adult disabled child or parent); (2)      the types of benefit being paid (compensation, pension,      dependency and indemnity compensation, death pension or      benefits payable to a disabled child under chapter 18 of      title 38, United States Code); (3) the total annual      amounts and average annual amounts of benefits paid to      fiduciaries for each category and type of benefit; (4) the      number of fiduciaries who are the spouse, parent, step-     parent, legal custodian, court-appointed fiduciary,      institutional fiduciary, custodian-in-fact and supervised      direct payee; (5) the number of cases in which the      fiduciary was changed by the Secretary because of a      finding that benefits had been misused; (6) how such cases      of misuse of benefits were addressed by the Secretary; (7)      the final disposition of such cases of misuse of benefits,      including the number and dollar amount of any civil or      criminal penalties imposed; and (8) such other information      as the Secretary considers appropriate.     Compromise Agreement       Section 505 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with modifications. Additional reporting      requirements concerning cases referred to the Office of the      Inspector General and the amounts of money recovered by the      government have been added. Language referring to civil or      criminal penalties has been omitted.                   TITLE VI--MEMORIAL AFFAIRS MATTERS  DESIGNATION OF PRISONER OF WAR/MISSING IN ACTION NATIONAL MEMORIAL,            RIVERSIDE NATIONAL CEMETERY, RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       Section 122 of S. 2485 would designate the Prisoner of War/     Missing in Action National Memorial at the Riverside National      Cemetery in Riverside, California. Federal funds would be      permitted, but not required, at the discretion of the      Secretary for maintenance of the memorial, should private      funding sources prove to be inadequate.     House Bill       Section 402 of H.R. 1716, as amended, contains a similar      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows      the House language. However, the memorial is designated:      ``Prisoner of War/Missing in Action National Memorial.''       LEASE OF CERTAIN NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION PROPERTY     Current Law       There is no applicable provision in current law.     Senate Bill       Section 107 of S. 2485, as amended, would authorize the      Secretary to lease any undeveloped land and unused or      underutilized buildings belonging to the United States and      administered by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).      The term of any such lease would not be permitted to exceed      ten years. Proceeds from the lease of land or buildings and      proceeds from licenses sold in return for the agricultural      use of NCA lands would be deposited in a National Cemetery      Administration Facilities Operation Fund along with any      appropriation, or other authorized payment, designated for      that fund. Fund proceeds would be available to cover costs      incurred by NCA in the operation and maintenance of national      cemeteries.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.           EXCHANGES OF REAL PROPERTY FOR NATIONAL CEMETERIES     Current Law       Section 2406 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary to acquire additional lands for national      cemeteries by purchase, gift, condemnation, or transfer from      other Federal agencies.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize the      Secretary to acquire additional lands for national cemeteries      by exchanging existing national cemetery land.       TITLE VII--IMPROVEMENTS TO SERVICEMEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACTCLARIFICATION OF MEANING OF ``JUDGMENT'' AS USED IN THE SERVICEMEMBERS                         CIVIL RELIEF ACT (SCRA)     Current Law       Section 101 of the SCRA provides definitions for purposes      of the Act. The section does not define the term      ``judgment.''     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 101 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would clarify that      ``[t]he term `judgment' means any judgment, decree, order, or      ruling, final or temporary.''     Compromise Agreement       Section 701 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.        REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO WAIVER OF RIGHTS UNDER THE SCRA     Current Law       Section 107 of the SCRA provides that servicemembers may      waive any of the rights and protections under the Act if      certain requirements are met, including a requirement in      section 107(b) that waivers be in writing for specified      actions.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 102 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would provide that      those actions requiring waivers in writing pursuant to      section 107(b) of the SCRA must also be executed in a      separate instrument. Additionally, section 102 would provide      a new requirement that any waiver, in writing, of a right or      protection under section 107 of the Act that applies to a      contract, lease or similar legal instrument must be in at      least 12-point type.     Compromise Agreement       Section 702 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.RIGHT OF SERVICEMEMBERS PLAINTIFFS TO REQUEST STAY OF CIVIL PROCEEDINGS     Current Law       Section 202 of the SCRA provides for a stay of any civil      action or proceeding when a servicemember who is a defendant      has notice of the action or proceeding.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 103 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would include      plaintiffs as well as defendants under section 202 of the      SCRA.     Compromise Agreement       Section 703 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                         TERMINATION OF LEASES     Current Law       Section 305 of the SCRA provides that servicemembers may,      under certain circumstances, terminate residential or motor      vehicle leases and specifies the manner of termination.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 104 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would clarify that      if, under section 305 of the SCRA the servicemember      terminates a lease entered into jointly with a dependent, the      obligations of both the servicemember and the dependent are      terminated. Section 104 would also modify section 305 of the      SCRA to allow motor vehicle lease terminations for any      permanent change of station move from a state outside of the      continental United States to any other location outside that      state, and the term ``continental United States'' would be      defined as the ``48 contiguous states and the District of      Columbia.'' Further, section 104 would broaden the definition      of the term ``military orders'' to mean ``official military      orders, or any notification, certification, or verification      from the servicemember's commanding officer, with respect to      the servicemember's current or future military duty status.''      Finally, section 104 would amend section 305 of the SCRA to      include individual as well as unit deployments for a period      of not less than 90 days among the circumstances under which      a servicemember could terminate a lease.     Compromise Agreement       Section 704 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.                       TITLE VIII--OTHER MATTERS  PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS                                  CLAIMS     Current Law       Section 7255 of title 38, United States Code, requires the      principal office of the U.S. Court     of Appeals for Veterans Claims be located in the District of      Columbia.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 1 of H.R. 3936 would authorize the principal office      of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to be      located at any location in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan      area. Section 2 would make findings and express the sense of      Congress regarding a new veterans' courthouse and justice      center.     Compromise Agreement       Section 801 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language, but omits section 2 of the bill.EXTENSION OF BIENNIAL REPORT OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON FORMER PRISONERS                                  OF WAR     Current Law       Section 541 of title 38, United States Code, establishes an      Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. The Advisory      Committee is required to submit to the Secretary, no later      than July 1st of each odd numbered year through 2003, a      report on the programs and activities of the Department as      they pertain to veterans who are former prisoners of war.     Senate Bill       Section 302 of S. 2486, as amended, would extend the      reporting requirement through 2009.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 803 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.    AVAILABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REDRESS FOR CERTAIN      VETERANS DENIED OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT     Current Law       Section 3304(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, grants      ``preference eligible'' veterans (generally, veterans who      served during a wartime period; veterans who served during a      period for which a campaign badge or expeditionary medal was      awarded; or veterans with service-connected disabilities) and      veterans who separated from the armed forces under honorable      conditions after three years or more of active service the      opportunity to compete for vacant positions in the Federal      government for which an agency is accepting applications from      individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion      procedures.       Section 3330a of title 5, United States Code, allows      preference eligible veterans who allege their veterans'      preference rights have been violated to seek administrative      redress by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.      Section 3330b of title 5, United States Code, provides      preference eligible veterans with judicial redress for claims      arising from allegations of violations of veterans'      preference laws.     Senate Bill       Section 204 of S. 2486, as amended, would provide a veteran      who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable      conditions after three years or more of active service with      administrative and judicial redress for alleged violations of      his or her rights under section 3304(f)(1) of title 5, United      Stated Code.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 804 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.REPORT ON SERVICEMEMBERS' AND VETERANS' AWARENESS OF BENEFITS AVAILABLE       UNDER LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS     Current Law       Section 7722 of title 38, United States Code, requires the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to distribute full information      to eligible servicemembers, veterans and dependents regarding      all benefits and services to which they may be entitled under      laws administered by the Department.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       In conjunction with the improvements in veterans' benefits,      section 805 of the Compromise Agreement would direct the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit a report to Congress      detailing VA's efforts to make veterans and servicemembers      aware of VA benefits and services to which they are entitled.      The report would include: (1) a description of the outreach      activities conducted by VA at each of its three      Administrations and by other internal VA entities; (2) the      results of a national survey to ascertain servicemembers'      and veterans' level of awareness of VA benefits and      services; and (3) recommendations the Secretary may have      to improve VA's outreach activities. The report would be      due 1 year after the enactment of the Compromise      Agreement.                   LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED        IMPROVED VETERANS' BENEFITS FOR FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR     Current Law       Section 1112(b) of title 38, United States Code, specifies      16 disabilities that VA presumes are related to the prisoner      of war (POW) experience for the purposes of veterans' and      survivors' benefits.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 4 of H.R. 4175 would add osteoporosis to the list      of diseases presumed to be the result of the POW experience.    FINDINGS RELATED TO ON-JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 101 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would make      Congressional findings with respect to broad purposes for      VA's OJT and apprenticeship programs in both the private and      public sectors of our economy. These include: helping      employers hire and retain skilled workers; establishing a      link between the training afforded to servicemembers while      serving in the Armed Forces and the training available in      civilian settings for purposes of occupational licensing and      credentialing; and developing a more highly educated and      productive workforce.   INCENTIVE PAYMENT FOR EARLY COMPLETION OF APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING     Current Law       Sections 3032, 3233, and 3687 of title 38, United States      Code, and Section 16131 of title 10, United States Code, do      not currently contain any incentive to finish on-job training      or apprenticeships earlier than the established completion      date.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 103 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would establish an      incentive payment for program participants who finish their      apprenticeship training early. As an incentive for trainees      to complete their apprenticeship or attain journeyworker      status early, this provision would require VA to pay the      trainee a lump-sum amount for the months of VA entitlement      remaining that would have been needed to complete the      apprenticeship. This provision would be applicable for months      beginning on or after October 1, 2005, and ending on October      1, 2010.    ELIGIBILITY OF CERTAIN PERSONS FOR BURIAL IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL                                 CEMETERY     Current Law       Eligibility for burial at Arlington National Cemetery is      governed by Federal regulations at section 553.15 of title      32, Code of Federal Regulations. The following categories of      persons are eligible for in-ground burial: active duty      members of the Armed Forces, except those members serving on      active duty for training; retired members of the Armed Forces      who have served on active duty, are on a retired list and are      entitled to receive retirement pay; former members of the      Armed Forces discharged for disability before October 1,      1949, who served on active duty and would have been eligible      for retirement under 10 U.S.C. 1202 had the statute been in      effect on the date of separation; honorably discharged      members of the Armed Forces awarded the Medal of Honor,      Distinguished Service Cross, Air Force Cross or Navy Cross,      Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, or Purple Heart;      former prisoners of war who served honorably and who died on      or after November 30, 1993; provided they were honorably      discharged from the Armed Forces, elected Federal officials      (the President, Vice President, and Members of Congress),      Federal cabinet secretaries and deputies, agency directors      and certain other high Federal officials (level I and II      executives), Supreme Court Justices, and chiefs of certain      diplomatic missions; the spouse, widow or widower, minor      child and, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Army,      certain unmarried adult children, and certain surviving      spouses of persons eligible for in-ground burial.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 401 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would make eligible      for in-ground burial at Arlington National Cemetery (1) a      member or former member of a reserve component of the Armed      Forces who at the time of death was under 60 years of age and      who, but for age, would have been eligible for military      retired pay under title 10, United States Code; and (2) a      member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces who dies in      the line of duty while on active duty for training or      inactive duty training. Eligibility in both instances would      also extend to the servicemember's dependents.          TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO EDUCATION PROGRAM PROVISIONS     Current Law       Section 3452(e) of title 38, United States Code, as amended      by section 301 of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public      Law 108-183; 117 Stat. 2658) authorizes education assistance      benefits for certain self-employment     and on-job training programs (franchises) for less than six      months under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) when the      beneficiary receives a training wage.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 403 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would make a      technical correction to waive the training-wage requirement      for programs of less than six months beginning October 1,      2005, and ending on September 30, 2010. The Department of      Veterans Affairs would be required to review and approve all      such programs before any MGIB educational assistance benefits      could be dispersed.        PREVENTION OF DOUBLE TAXATION OF CERTAIN SERVICEMEMBERS     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 105 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would prohibit a tax      jurisdiction from imposing a use, excise or similar tax on      the personal property of a servicemember who is not a      resident, if the tax jurisdiction's laws do not provide a      credit against such taxes previously paid on the same      personal property in another tax jurisdiction. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NEW VETERANS COURTHOUSE AND                              JUSTICE CENTER     Current Law       There is no applicable current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R. 3936 would make findings and express the      sense of Congress that all other Article I courts of the      United States are located in a dedicated courthouse; that the      U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, since its creation      in 1988, has been located in a commercial office building;      and that a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center      should be provided for the Court and the veterans it serves,      and should be located, if feasible, at a site owned by the      United States that is part of or proximate to the Pentagon      Reservation. Section 2 would also require that not later than      90 days after the date of enactment of this provision, the      Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and      the Administrator of General Services submit to the House and      Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services a      joint report on the feasibility of locating a new Veterans      Courthouse and Justice Center at an appropriate Pentagon      Reservation site.EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MONTGOMERY GI BILL FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE WHO AGGREGATE TWO OR MORE YEARS OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE                       DURING ANY FIVE-YEAR PERIOD     Current Law       Section 3012 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide Chapter 30      educational assistance benefits to an individual who, after      June 30, 1985, first enters on active duty and has his or her      pay reduced by $100 per month for the first 12 months of      active duty and serves at least two continuous years on      active duty.     Senate Bill       Section 202 of S. 2486, as amended, would grant entitlement      to Chapter 30 educational assistance benefits to an      individual in the Selected Reserve who, during any five-year      period beginning on or after September 11, 2001, and ending      on June 30, 2008, serves an aggregate of two years of active      duty service. The activated Selected Reserve member would be      required to make a $1,200 contribution within one year of      completing two years of aggregate active duty service.     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.  MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF MINORITY GROUP MEMBER FOR PURPOSES OF                 ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS     Current Law       Section 544 of title 38, United States Code, establishes an      Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. For purposes of that      section of law the term ``minority group members'' includes      veterans who are: Asian American; Black; Hispanic; Native      American (including American Indian, Alaskan Native, and      Native Hawaiian); or Pacific-Islander American.     Senate Bill       Section 303 of S. 2486, as amended, would amend the      definition of ``minority group member'' to conform to the new      Race and Ethnic Standards used in Federal statistical      reporting and in the 2000 United States Census. Specifically,      section 303 would redefine the categories of minority group      members making the following changes: substituting ``Asian''      for ``Asian American;'' ``Black or African American'' for      ``Black;'' ``Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin'' for      ``Hispanic;'' and ``American Indian or Alaska Native'' and      ``Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander'' for ``Native      American (including American Indian, Alaskan Native, and      Native Hawaiian).''     House Bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.    INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND                          INDEMNITY COMPENSATION     Current Law       Current law does not require an annual cost-of-living      adjustment to veterans' and survivors' disability      compensation.     Senate Bill       S. 2483 contains a similar provision.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R. 4175 would provide, effective December 1,      2004, a cost-of-living adjustment to the rates of disability      compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities      and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for      survivors of certain service-connected disabled veterans. The      percentage increase would be equal to the percentage increase      for benefits provided under the Social Security Act.                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2004.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: In recognition of the desire to      expedite floor consideration of S. 2486, the ``Veterans      Benefits Improvement Act of 2004,'' the Committee on the      Judiciary hereby waives consideration of the bill. Section      504(b) of the bill creates a new Sec. 6108 of Title 38 of the      U.S. Code. This new section gives courts the authority to      order restitution to the Department of Veterans Affairs when      a fiduciary is convicted of missing veterans benefits. These      provisions fall within the committee on the Judiciary's Rule      X jurisdiction. However, given the need to expedite this      legislation, I will not seek a referral of S. 2486 based on      their inclusion.       The Committee on the Judiciary takes this action with the      understanding that the Committee's jurisdiction over these      provisions is in no way diminished or altered. I would      appreciate your including this letter and your response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of S. 2486 on      the House floor.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of November      16, 2004, regarding the jurisdictional interest of the      Committee on the Judiciary in section 504(b) of S. 2486, the      Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004.       Your willingness to forego a sequential referral to      expedite House consideration of S. 2486 is most appreciated.      The Committee on Veterans' Affairs understands that your      letter does not waive jurisdiction of the Committee on the      Judiciary over the bill and is not a precedent for other      bills.       Again, thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Be      assured I will include our exchange of letters in the      Congressional Record.           Sincerely,                                             Christopher H. Smith,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
