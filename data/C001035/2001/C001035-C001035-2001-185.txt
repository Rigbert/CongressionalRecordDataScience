President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in introducing bipartisan legislation, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, that is designed to make health insurance more affordable both for individuals and for small businesses that provide health care coverage for their employees.  In the past few years, Congress has taken some major steps to expand access to affordable health insurance for all Americans. One of the first bills I sponsored on coming to the Senate was legislation to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act. States have enthusiastically responded to this program, which now provides affordable health insurance coverage to over two millionchildren nationwide, including nearly 10,000 in Maine's expanded Medicaid and CubCare programs.  Thanks to these efforts, coupled with an increase in employer coverage fueled by our strong economy, we are making some progress. For the first time in twelve years, the number of Americans without health insurance actually dropped from about 44 million to 42.6 million. While this is good news, it by no means minimizes the problem. There are still far too many Americans without health insurance. Clearly, we must make health insurance more available and affordable.  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the workplace, it is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured Americans are members of families with at least one full-time worker: 85 percent of the Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family with a worker.  Uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small businesses, the backbone of the economy in Maine. Some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. If we want to reduce the number of uninsured Americans, we need to consider how we can help more small businesses afford health insurance for their employees.  According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses survey, the cost of health insurance is the number one problem facing small businesses. And it has been since 1986. It is time for us to listen and to lend a hand to these small businesses.  Small employers generally face higher costs for health insurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer coverage. Premiums are generally higher for small businesses because they do not have as much purchasing power as large companies, which limits their ability to bargain for lower rates. They also have higher administrative costs because they have fewer employees among whom to spread the fixed costs of a health benefits plan. Moreover, they are not as able to spread risks of medical claims over as many employees as can large firms.  As a consequence, only 42 percent of small businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer health insurance to their employees. By way of contrast, more than 95 percent of businesses with 100 or more employees offer insurance.  Moreover, the smaller the business, the less likely it is to offer health insurance to its employees. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their employees, but the cost is often just too high.  Simply put, the biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the United States today is cost. While American employers everywhere, from giant multinational corporations to the small corner store, are facing huge hikes in their health insurance costs, these rising costs are particularly problematic for small businesses and their employees. Many small employers are facing premium increases of 15 to 30 percent or more. This can cause them either to drop their health benefits or to pass the additional costs on to their employees through increased deductibles, higher copays or premium hikes. This, too, is troubling and will likely add to the ranks of the uninsured since it will cause some employees, particularly lower-wage workers who are disproportionately affected by increased costs, to drop or turn down coverage when it is offered to them.  According to another survey of small businesses, two-thirds of small business owners said that they would seriously consider offering health benefits if they were provided with some assistance with premiums. Almost one-half would consider doing so if their costs fell 10 percent.  To respond to these findings, we are introducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which will help small employers cope with these rising costs. Our bill will provide new tax credits for small businesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health insurance to do so and will help businesses that currently do offer insurance to continue coverage even in the face of rising costs.  Under our proposal, employers with fewer than ten employees will receive a tax credit of 50 percent of the employer contribution to the cost of employee health insurance. Employers with ten to 25 employees will receive a 30 percent credit. Under the bill, the credit would be based on an employer's yearly qualified health insurance expenses of up to $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage.  The legislation we are introducing will also make health insurance more affordable for individuals and families who must purchase health insurance on their own. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide an above-the-line tax deduction for individuals who pay at least 50 percent of the cost of their own health and long-term care insurance. Regardless of whether an individual takes the standard deduction or itemizes, he or she will be provided relief by the new above-the-line deduction.  The bill also will allow self-employed Americans to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. Some 25 million Americans are in families headed by a self-employed individual, of these, five million are uninsured. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large businesses is not just a matter of equity. It will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working Americans. Our bill will make health insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores that dot communities throughout the state.  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, will help small businesses afford health insurance for their employees, and it will also make coverage more affordable for working Americans who must purchase it on their own. I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
