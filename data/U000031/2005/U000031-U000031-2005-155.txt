Speaker, prematurity is a serious and growing problem in the United States. It is the number one cause of infant death in the first month of life. In February2004, the National Center for Health Statistics reported the first increase in the U.S. infant mortality rate since 1958.  Prematurity has enormous human, societal, and economic costs. Sadly, premature infants are 14 times more likely to die in their first year of life, and premature births account for nearly 24 percent of deaths in the first month of life. The estimated charges for hospital stays for premature and low-birth weight infants were $15,000,000,000 in 2002, and the average lifetime medical costs for a premature baby are conservatively estimated at $500,000. About 25 percent of the youngest and smallest babies live with long-term health problems, including cerebral palsy, blindness, chronic respiratory problems, and other chronic conditions. A study published in 2002 by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that children born prematurely are at greater risk for lower cognitive test scores and behavioral problems when compared to full-term children.  Although we've made vast improvements in treating premature infants, we've had little success in understanding and preventing premature birth, and the knowledge that we have gained has not been translated into improved perinatal outcomes. The three known risk factors for preterm labor most consistently identified by experts are multiple fetal pregnancies, a past history of preterm delivery, and some uterine and/or cervical abnormalities. Other possible risk factors are chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity in the mother, certain infections during pregnancy, and cigarette smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use during pregnancy. But as the science stands now, nearly 50 percent of all premature births have no known cause.  That is why today, my colleague Rep. Anna Eshoo and I are introducing the bipartisan Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early or PREEMIE Act. The Preemie Act calls on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ``expand, intensify, and coordinate'' research related to prematurity. It formally authorizes the Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit Network--which includes university-based clinical centers and a data coordination center--through which perinatal studies to improve maternal and fetal outcomes are conducted. It also authorizes the Neonatal Research Network to improve the care and outcomes of newborns. The bill will ensure better coordination on prematurity research priorities across federal agencies and also includes provisions for disseminating information on prematurity to health professionals and the public and for establishing family support programs to respond to the needs of families with babies in neonatal intensive care units.  I encourage my colleagues to join Rep. Eshoo and me in cosponsoring and strongly supporting the enactment of the PREEMIE Act.                          ____________________
