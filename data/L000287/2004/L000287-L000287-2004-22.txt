Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support, my strong support for H.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.  There are over 40,000 tobacco farms in Kentucky alone. Tobacco farming is the primary source of livelihood of tens of thousands of Americans supporting local economies in nine U.S. States. Every tobacco dollar is said to turn over 6 to 7 times in its community.  Under current Federal policy, American farmers lose while farmers in countries like Brazil win. American tobacco farmers simply cannot respond to new market pressures and opportunities while beholden to an outdated government-controlled system.  With this bill, farmers can move beyond tobacco. By ending the quota system, economists anticipate as many as two-thirds of current tobacco farmers would exit the business without increasing taxes or the national debt.  Our obligation as Members of Congress is always to our constituents, not to special interest groups. Including a buy-out provision in H.R. 4520 provides long-awaited relief to American farmers, replacing lost jobs and revitalizing thousands of communities across the Nation who depend upon tobacco for their economic stability.  I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) for his leadership and vision on this issue, understanding the plight of American farmers and working with a bipartisan coalition to include this important provision in the Jobs Creation bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4520.
