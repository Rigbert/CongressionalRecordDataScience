  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent, following the debate tonight on the pending Hatch amendment, the Senate then resume consideration of the amendment beginning at 9 o'clock in the morning, and there be 30 minutes of debate remaining, equally divided, in the usual form. Finally, I ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the amendment.
