Mr. Speaker, the United Nations' push for global population control continues to lead to ugly and inhumane outcomes, especially for girls.  China, as you know, imposes a barbaric ``one child per couple'' policy that relies on forced abortion, involuntary sterilization and ruinous fines to implement. But a UNFPA report sheds new light on sex selection abortion in India. According to the U.N. report, increasingly parents are using sex selection technologies that enable practitioners first to identify female unborn girls and then to abort them. As a result, fully 60 million girls are now missing according to the United Nations, effectively falling into a demographic black hole from which analysts fear there will be no return.  The report says as many as 2 million unborn baby girls are aborted each year for no other reason than they happen to be female.  In Punjab, the government claims that the numbers of missing girls will increase by 40 percent in the forthcoming generation.  Mr. Speaker, abortion is violence against children. It relies on dismemberment of the baby. Abortion relies on chemical poisoning. Sex selection abortion in India or anywhere else is a particularly heinous crime. All children--boys or girls--are precious. None deserve death by abortion.                          ____________________[Page H10234]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            SEX SELECTION ABORTION IN INDIA A MASSIVE CRIME  (
