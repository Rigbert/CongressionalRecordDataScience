President, I rise today to pay tribute to an extraordinary Maine family, distinguished both by its record of public service and the accomplishments it has achieved in many other walks of life. The Washburn family included three sistersand seven brothers who helped guide this country through the Civil War and prepare our Nation for the 20th century. I am proud, as all Mainers are, that the Washburns hailed from Livermore, Maine, where the Norlands Living History Center still honors their memory and provides people of all ages with a chance to experience rural life in the late 1800's.  Israel and Martha Washburn raised 10 children in Livermore, Maine, during the early years of the 19th century. Included among the children were seven brothers who made substantial contributions to our Nation. The Washburns hold the distinction of being the only family in the history of our Nation to have three brothers serve in Congress simultaneously. In the 1850's Cadwallader Washburn representing Wisconsin, Elihu Washburn representing Illinois, and Israel Washburn, Jr., representing Maine were all Members of Congress in the tumultuous era leading up to the Civil War. Years later, William Washburn followed his brothers to Congress, representing Minnesota for three terms. William concluded his time in Washington with a term in the United States Senate.  The Washburns served the public outside of Washington as well. Cadwallader Washburn was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1872. His brother, Israel, was Governor of Maine from 1861 to 1863 and is ranked as one of the great ``war governors'' of the Civil War era for his skill and dedication in raising and equipping volunteer regiments for the Union cause. Israel was also an early member of the Republican Party and is given credit by some for naming the party.  The Washburns also served their country abroad. Charles Washburn served as a Minister to Paraguay in the 1860's. During the War of the Triple Alliance, he was forced to flee the country when the dictator of Paraguay, General Francisco Solano Lopez, accused Washburn and other embassy staffers of conspiring with Paraguay's enemies.  Elihu Washburne, who added the English ``e'' to his last name, was also a diplomat. After 16 years in the House of Representatives, where he was known as the ``watchdog of the Treasury'' for his unyielding oversight of the ``peoples money,'' he was appointed to a 2-week term as President Grant's Secretary of State. Following the courtesy appointment, he was selected as our Nation's Ambassador to France. Elihu rose to diplomatic greatness during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, which resulted in the fall of Napoleon III and the French Empire. Throughout the Siege of Paris and the upheaval of the Commune, he alone among foreign ambassadors remained at his post and gave refuge to hundreds of foreign citizens trapped in the city. His memoirs, ``Recollections of a Minister to France, 1869-1877,'' provide an important historical accounting of the end of France's Empire and his service is a model of exemplary diplomatic performance during a crisis.  The Washburn brothers also served our Nation in the military. Samual Washburn spent his life on the sea and served in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War as the captain of the gunboat Galena. Cadwallader recruited and commanded the Second Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry, which served with distinction in the Civil War's southwestern theater. He rose to the rank of major-general, serving with Grant at Vicksburg and later as military commander of the Memphis District of the Army of the Tennessee.  As remarkable as they were, the achievements of the Washburn Brothers were not limited to military and governmental pursuits. Four of the brothers, Israel, Elihu, William, and Cadwallader, were lawyers. Charles was a writer and journalist who invented a typewriting machine that was sold to the Remington Company. Algernon Sydney Washburn was a successful banker in Hallowell, Maine. ``Sid,'' as he was known, provided loans to his brothers that financed many of their ventures. Cadwallader was also a successful businessman and founded a large milling operation in Minneapolis that produced Gold Medal flour, which can still be found on the shelves of America's grocery stores. Today, his company is known as General Mills. William also engaged in milling, and his company later merged with the Pillsbury Corporation.  Though the adventures of the seven brothers Washburn took them all over the globe, the Norlands in Livermore, Maine, was always their home. In 1973, their descendants donated the property, which included the family mansion, surrounding historic buildings, and hundreds of acres of land, to the non-profit Washburn-Norlands Foundation. Today, the property that was once home to this remarkable family is a living history center. Each year, approximately 25,000 visitors have the opportunity to sample life in the 1800's through Norland's hands-on educational programs. Moreover, the museum and property honors the many accomplishments of a family that is nearly without peer in the history of public service to this great nation. The Norlands Living History Center is significant for both the history it preserves and the innovative education it provides, and I commend those associated with the center for the important work that they do.  Mr. President, the legacy of the Washburn family is yet another example of why Maine and its people are so special. I am grateful for having had this opportunity to share with you the story of this remarkable family and to acknowledge the important work being done by the dedicated staff and friends of the Norlands Living History Center to protect and share this important piece of our heritage.                          ____________________
