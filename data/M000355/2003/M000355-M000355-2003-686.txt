 President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, he is absolutely right. Not only does it affect decisionmaking at the end of one's career but at the beginning. The younger doctors taking a look at which speciality to choose are shying away from obstetrics because they believe they cannot afford to go into that specialty, thus creating a shortage at that end as well as on the other end where doctors who have been in the field a number of years are no longer able to afford it. This is truly a national problem that cries out for a national solution.  One modest estimate from CBO, in response to Senator Lott's earlier question--this is from my staff--this bill would probably save the Federal Government at least $11 billion. Our suspicion is it is higher than that.  In conclusion, as this map shows, most of America is either nearing or facing a medical liability crisis. There are not many white States on this map. The white States are the ones that are currently OK. There are six of them. The rest are either in yellow, States showing problem signs, or red, States now in crisis, to which we have added a reasonable number just since this debate last year.  During the last 8 years, the House of Representatives has recognized this brewing storm and has passed meaningful medical liability reforms on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, during this same period, the Senate has served as a graveyard for meaningful legal reforms.  However, I believe the tide has begun to turn. The American people are beginning to understand this is not a battle about doctors, personal injuries, lawyers, and insurance companies; it is about ensuring their access, the patients of America, to needed medical care. Expectant mothers are worried that their obstetricians will have to discontinue practice before their baby is born. Parents are concerned that their local trauma center might not have a neurosurgeon on staff to treat a child injured in a car accident. Seniors worry that the double whammy of rising malpractice premiums and reduced Medicare payments will drive their doctors out of business.  I believe the Patients First Act encompasses the key reforms needed to address this crisis. This legislation allows patients to be fairly compensated--fairly compensated--while placing badly needed limits on often out-of-control damage awards. I believe it is time for the Senate to address this crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support the Patients First Act.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1  Testimony--United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Patient     Access Crisis: The Role of Medical Litigation--February 11, 2003       Ms. Leanne Dyess. Chairman Hatch, Chairman Gregg, Senators      Leahy and Kennedy, distinguished members of the Senate      Judiciary and HELP committees, it's an honor for me to sit      before you this afternoon--to open up my life, and the life      of my family, in an attempt to demonstrate how medical      liability costs are hurting people all across America. While      others may talk in terms of economics and policy, I want to      speak from the heart.       I want to share with you the life of my two children and I      are now forced to live because of a crisis in health care      that I believe can be fixed. And when I leave and the lights      turn off and the television cameras go away, I want you--and      all America--to know one thing, and that is that this crisis      is not about insurance. It's not about doctors, or hospitals,      or even personal injury lawyers. It's a crisis about      individuals and their access to what I believe is, otherwise,      the greatest health care in the world.       Our story began on July 5th of last year, when my husband      Tony was returning from work in Gulfport, Mississippi. We had      started a new business. Tony was working hard, as was I. We      were doing our best to build a life for our children, and      their futures were filled with promise. Everything looked      bright. Then, in an instant, it changed. Tony was involved in      a single car accident. They suspect he may have fallen      asleep, though we'll never know.       What we do know is that after removing him from the car,      they rushed Tony to Garden Park hospital in Gulfport. He had      head injuries and required immediate attention. Shortly      thereafter, I received the telephone call that I pray no      other wife will ever have to receive. I was informed of the      accident and told that the injuries were serious. But I      cannot describe to you the panic that gave way to      hopelessness when they somberly said, ``We don't have the      specialist necessary to take care of him. We need to airlift      him to another hospital.''       I couldn't understand this. Gulfport is one of the fastest      growing and most prosperous regions of Mississippi. Garden      Park is a good hospital. Where, I wondered, was the      specialist--the specialist who could have taken care of my      husband? Almost six hours passed before Tony was airlifted to      the University Medical Center--six hours for the damage to      his brain to continue before they had a specialist capable of      putting a shunt into his brain to drain the swelling--six      unforgettable hours that changed our life.       Today Tony is permanently brain damaged. He is mentally      incompetent, unable to care for himself--unable to provide      for his children--unable to live the vibrant, active and      loving life he was living only moments before his accident.       I could share with you the panic of a woman suddenly forced      into the role of both mother and father to her teenage      children--of a woman whose life is suddenly caught in limbo,      unable to move forward or backward. I could tell you about a      woman who now had to worry about the constant care of her      husband, who had to make concessions she thought she'd never      have to make to be able to pay for his therapy and care. But      to describe this would be to take us away from the most      important point and the value of what I learned. Senator      Hatch, I learned that there was no specialist on staff that      night in Gulfport because rising medical liability costs had      forced physicians in that community to abandon their      practices. In that area, at that time, there was only one      doctor who had the expertise to care for Tony and he was      forced to cover multiple hospitals--stretched thin and unable      to care for everyone. Another doctor had recently quit his      practice because his insurance company terminated all of the      medical liability policies nationwide. That doctor could not      obtain affordable coverage. He could not practice. And on      that hot night in July, my husband and our family drew the      short straw.       I have also learned that Mississippi is not unique, that      this crisis rages in states all across America. It rages in      Nevada, where young expectant mothers cannot find ob/gyns. It      rages in Florida, where children cannot find pediatric      neurosurgeons. And it rages in Pennsylvania, where the      elderly who have come to depend on their orthopedic      surgeons are being told that those trusted doctors are      moving to states where practicing medicine is affordable      and less risky.       The real danger of this crisis is that it is not readily      seen. It's insidious, like termites in the structure of a      home. They get into the woodwork, but you cannot see the      damage. The walls of the house remain beautiful. You don't      know what's going on just beneath the surface. At least not      for a season. Then, one day you go to hang a shelf and the      whole wall comes down; everything is destroyed. Before July      5th, I was like most Americans, completely unaware that just      below the surface of our nation's health care delivery      system, serious damage was being done by excessive and      frivolous litigation--litigation that was forcing liability      costs beyond the ability of doctors to pay. I had heard about      some of the frivolous cases and, of course, the awards that      climbed into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And like      most Americans I shook my head and said, ``Someone hit the      lottery.''       But I never asked, ``At what cost?'' I never asked, ``Who      has to pay for those incredible awards?'' It is a tragedy      when a medical mistake results in serious injury. But when      that injury--often an accident or oversight by an otherwise      skilled physician--is compounded by a lottery-like award, and      that award along with others make it too expensive to      practice medicine, there is a cost. And believe me, it's a      terrible cost to pay. Like     many Americans, I did not know the cost. I did not known the      damage. You see, Senator Hatch, it's not until your spouse      needs a specialist, or you're the expectant mother who needs      an ob/gyn, or it's your child who needs a pediatric      neurosurgeon, that you realize the damage beneath the      surface.       From my perspective, sitting here today, this problem far      exceeds any other challenge facing America's health care--     even the challenge of the uninsured. My family had insurance      when Tony was injured. We had good insurance. What we didn't      have was a doctor. And now, no amount of money can relieve      our pain and suffering. But knowing that others may not have      to go through what we've gone through, could go a long way      toward healing us heal.       Senator Hatch, I know of your efforts to see America      through this crisis. I know this is important to you, and      that it's important to the President. I know of the priority      Congress and many in the Senate are placing upon doing      something . . . and doing it now. Today, I pledge to you my      complete support. It is my prayer that no woman--or anyone      else--anywhere will ever have to go through what I've gone      through, and what I continue to go through every day with my      two beautiful children and a husband I dearly love.
