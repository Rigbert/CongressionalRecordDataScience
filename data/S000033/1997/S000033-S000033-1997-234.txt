 Speaker, today I would like to salute four outstanding young women who are being presented with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are Melissa D. Jones and Tina M. Newell of Senior Girl Scout Troop 707 in Vergennes, VT and Jennifer R. Tobin and Vincenza Tortolano of Senior Girl Scout Troop 817 in Rutland, VT. They are being honored on May 29, 1997 for earning the highest achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting.  The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14 to 17, or in grades 9 to 12. To receive the award, these Girl Scouts first earned four interest project patches, the career exploration pin, the Senior Girl Scout leadership award and the Senior Girl Scout challenge as well as designing and implementing a Girl Scout Gold Award project to meet a special need in their communities.  As members of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Melissa Jones and Tina Newell first earned badges in understanding yourself and others, child care, games, creative writing, and reading. The girls then combined their efforts in a project to combat illiteracy. They designed a series of three workshops for young children about the magic of books which they put on at their local town library. The workshops featured a magician, hired with moneys the girls raised themselves, magic tricks and crafts taught by the girls and wonderful stories featuring magic. They attracted a large number of youngsters. The girls reported ``Everything we did interested and excited the children; they wanted to read more books and they now know the library and are planning to come to their future children's programs.''  Jennifer Tobin and Vincenza Tortolano put their efforts into making a special place for some elderly members of their community. The girls designed and established a conversation garden to give nursing home residents and their guests access to sidewalks, shade and beauty, putting in two settees and planting bulbs and a flowering crabapple tree, all financed by the girls' sale of handmade cookbooks. To quote the nursing home administrator, ``These two young people have earned the respect and appreciation of 125 nursing home residents and 160 employees of Eden Park.''  These four Senior Girl Scouts have earned my respect and appreciation, too, and I believe all four of the girls should receive the public recognition due them for such significant services to their communities and their country.                          ____________________
