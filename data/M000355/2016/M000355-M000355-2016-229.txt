 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m., on Tuesday, November 15, the Rules Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4511 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; I further ask that there then be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate.
