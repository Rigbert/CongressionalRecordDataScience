Speaker, the President of the United States, despite confusion in the press, does not have a plan to ensure the long-term financial solvency of Social Security. His privatization plan would actually reduce Social Security's income and accelerateits financial problems. His privatization commission, which met a few years ago, did have some solutions to the financial solvency of Social Security. Generally, their preferred solution was to dramatically reduce future benefits, to change from wage indexing to price indexing, which means a young person who retires in 40 years would see generally a Social Security benefit reduced by 40 percent, far in excess of the predicted possible shortfalls that Social Security might have if we did nothing.  Now the President says he has not recommended that. He has not recommended dramatic reductions in benefits; it is just on the table. He has also said increasing the retirement age is on the table, and it is already programmed to go up to 67 by 2020. We are going to have people 70 years old logging in the Oregon forests and working other back-breaking jobs across America. But he says that is just on the table. He has not recommended that yet.  He did, in an encouraging manner, leave open the door a tiny bit to a fair solution, which would be lifting the cap on wages. Only people who earn less than $90,000 a year pay Social Security taxes on all their income. He left that door open.  In fact, I have introduced a plan in the last 30 Congresses which would fully ensure the future of Social Security by lifting the cap, reducing taxes for those who earn less than $94,000, and people who earn more than $94,000 pay more in taxes. But that door was promptly slammed by the Republican leaders in Congress. No, they are not going to do that. That would benefit working people too much.  So we are back to the point where the Republicans do not have a plan to ensure the financial security of Social Security. They do have a plan to make it worse, to carve out resources, to redirect income from Social Security into a privatization plan.  Some people get excited when they hear privatization. They think: It is my money; I can do what I want with it. No. Here are the details. They are detailed in this proposal, very detailed. Wage earners can divert 4 percent, two-thirds of their contribution. They can divert it into government-chosen conservative, as the President says, index funds that will be managed by a company chosen by the government. You could not touch your money, could not borrow against it, like people in 401(k)s, or withdraw it early. The government would control the money until retirement, and then the government would compute a bill, and the bill would be how much your taxes would have earned in the Social Security trust fund plus inflation plus management fees, and they give you that bill.  If investments did not do well, the wage earners might end up writing a check to the Federal Government when they retired. No privatization account for them. Other people who did pretty well will see they have to pay that money back to the government, and then the government will say your Social Security benefits are really low. This is the President's so-called privatization plan. The government would force, force people retiring to buy an annuity, to bring their Social Security benefit for their predicted lifetime up to the predicted poverty level. It would force people to do that. What a boon for the private insurance industry. Of course, these would not be guaranteed by anybody. You buy one of those plans. That insurance company goes broke. Sorry, you just lost everything.  So instead of an assured benefit under Social Security, taxpayers would be purchasing a very expensive annuity that does not have survivor's benefits, is not indexed for inflation, unlike Social Security, but then very few people maybe, according to a Wall Street Journal article a couple of weeks ago, none of the people in all probability, but maybe a few would do even better, and they could keep that extra money.  So we would undermine the guaranteed benefit indexed for cost of living with survivor's and disabilities benefits for all working Americans so maybe a few could do better, but the insurance companies could do a lot better. The brokers who manage the accounts could do a lot better, but other people would be left in the cold.  And what about survivor and disabilities benefits? They cannot talk about that, because it is impossible. You are 18 years old. You go into the so-called optional account. You save every penny you are allowed to invest. At 24, you are tragically hurt in an accident. You are not capable of working for the rest of your life, and you can withdraw your $8,000 in your Social Security private account and live on that. No, you cannot.  We need to deal with disability benefits, survivor's benefits and financial problems of Social Security, and the President has not done that with his so-called privatization plan.                          ____________________[Pages H992-H993]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  NO PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENCY
