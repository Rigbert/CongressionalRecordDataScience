 I am proud to say that he is a resident of my home State of Kentucky. His name is Ralph Rose. Mr. Rose is being honored in a Veterans Day ceremony in Hardinsburg, KY, this November for his heroic action in defense of our Nation and for his continued service to veterans in the local community.  Mr. Rose was born in Mystic, KY, in 1922. He entered the U.S. military at age 20. During his time in the Armed Forces, Mr. Rose served in General Patton's Army and fought the Germans in France. But on a fateful night, Mr. Rose and several of his fellow soldiers were captured by Axis forces. He was held as a prisoner of war for more than 8 months until the Allies occupied Munich.  Mr. Rose suffered unimaginable hardships at the hands of the enemy, but by all accounts, he does not dwell on them. In fact, he has said that if given the choice to serve in the Army again--even knowing what he would have to endure as a prisoner of war--he would have done the same thing.  As a true testament to his dedication to the Armed Forces, Mr. Rose continues to serve his country by helping and inspiring other veterans in the Commonwealth.  There is a special flag that honors our American heroes like Mr. Rose. It is called the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action flag, and it has a simple statement at the bottom: ``You are not forgotten.'' Just as surely as that flag sits outside my office each day, I can guarantee you that those whose lives have been touched by Mr. Rose will never forget the sacrifices he made to keep our Nation free and prosperous.                          ____________________
