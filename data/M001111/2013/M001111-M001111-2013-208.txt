 President, reserving the right to object, let me explain so that the Senator understands. We are offering in this unanimous consent request to allow the Senate to speak on the very issue the Senator is requesting, to do it in what a democracy does, and to allow an amendment on it and let the Senate speak. That is what we do here.  I object to his request, and I reask our unanimous consent request that would allow an amendment on his issue of the debt ceiling and allow this body to speak on it before we go to conference.
