President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Greg Katsas to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but I want to begin with some general observations.  This year, the Republican-controlled Senate has repeatedly fallen short when it comes to serving as a meaningful check and balance in our constitutional system. Senate Republicans have abandoned longstanding norms of due diligence and careful scrutiny, all in the name of advancing the agenda of President Trump.  We saw this when Senate Republicans voted in near lockstep to confirm President Trump's Cabinet nominees. Republicans simply looked the other way when nominees failed to pay all of their taxes, did not disclose millions in assets, had conflicts of interest, or could not even answer basic questions at their hearings. Senate Republicans have repeatedly tried to rush through partisan bills in the dark of night. Remember when they revealed the text of the TrumpCare bill just a few hours before the Senate voted on it? Now Senate Republicans are trying to pass massive tax cuts for the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans, by ramming through an enormous bill with little debate and public scrutiny of how the bill would explode the deficit and raise taxes on many in the working class.  This pattern, of the Senate abandoning its responsibility to do basic due diligence when it comes to the agenda of President Trump, has also infected our process of considering judicial nominees. When it comes to President Trump's judicial nominees, we are seeing the Senate's constitutional responsibility of ``advice and consent'' turn into ``rush through and rubberstamp.''  All year, Senate Republicans have been removing guardrails that help ensure that judicial nominees have the qualifications, temperament, and integrity that we need for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Don't just take it from me. Take it from the conservative Wall Street Journal. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a November 20 article from the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Checks on Trump's Court Picks Fall Away'' at the conclusion of my remarks.  This article talks about the series of procedural changes Senate Republicans have made this year to expedite Trump's judicial nominations--most recently, the November 16 announcement by Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that he would hold hearings on nominees who do not receive positive blue slips from both home-State Senators, something that never happened under the Obama administration. The article begins by saying:       The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has      curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's      power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more      freedom than any U.S. president in modern times to install      his judges of choice, legal experts said.  Consider the other changes Republicans have already made in just the first year of the Trump administration.  First, President Trump subcontracted the selection of Supreme Court nominees out to rightwing special interest groups like the Federalist Society. President Trump publicly thanked the Federalist Society for assembling a list of candidates from which Justice Neil Gorsuch was selected. The White House even asked Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society to call Justice Gorsuch to let him know he was a candidate for the job. Never before had a President credited a special interest group with serving as a de facto selection committee for the Federal judiciary. For anyone who wonders what the Federalist Society is all about, I urge you to watch the video of this group laughing and applauding at their convention a few weeks ago when Attorney General Sessions joked about meeting with Russians. It was shameful.  Senate Republicans also changed the rules of the Senate in order to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed. He couldn't get 60 votes on the Senate floor, so the Republicans changed the rules to make 50 votes the threshold for appointments to the Supreme Court.  When it comes to lower-court nominees, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are doing half-hearted vetting at best. We are constantly learning information that nominees initially failed to disclose. For example, Alabama District Court nominee Brett Talley failed to disclose that his wife was an attorney in the White House Counsel's Office and that Talley had apparently posted online comments defending the early KKK and calling for shooting death row inmates. Court of Federal Claims nominee Damien Schiff failed to disclose that he had called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy a ``judicial prostitute'' in a blog post. North Carolina District Court nominee Thomas Farr reportedly failed to fully disclose his role in an African-American voter suppression effort during the 1990 campaign for Senator Jesse Helms. Yet all of these nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee on party line votes.  There are other changes that Republicans have made to the nominations process this year. Republicans have decided not to wait for the American Bar Association to do their nonpartisan peer review of a nominee's qualifications before holding a hearing. When the ABA unanimously finds nominees not to be qualified, Republicans still support the nominees anyway. Republicans have also begun regularly holding hearings on two circuit court nominees at a time. Why? Apparently, they are afraid to let each of their nominees stand on their own two feet and face questioning from Senators individually. The circuit courts have the final word on tens of thousands of cases every year. Every single lifetime appointment to these courts deserves to be scrutinized on its own individual merits.  Furthermore, Judiciary Committee Republicans are looking to relax the standards for nominees with a history of past drug use. Republicans repeatedly blocked judicial candidates proposed by President Obama who had smoked marijuana in the past, but Republicans now want a more lenient standard for Trump nominees. I am open to a different standard, but it must not be a double standard for Democratic versus Republican nominees.  That takes us to the changes to the blue slip. Republicans now want to disregard this 100-year-old tradition--meaning they will ignore the vetting that home-State Senators do for nominees from their State. Remember, blue slips were respected throughout the Obama administration. Republicans sent a letter in 2009 asking President Obama to respect blue slips, and he did. Republicans then proceeded to block 18 Obama nominees by withholding blue slips. Now, Republicans have announced that they are doing a 180-degree turn for Trump nominees and that they will disregard blue slips whenever they feel like it.  Why are Republicans abandoning so many longstanding traditions and guardrails when it comes to judicial nominations? It is because many of President Trump's nominees simply wouldn't pass muster under the traditional ground rules. Many Trump nominees have minimal experience, a history of ideologically biased statements, serious questions about their temperament and judgment, or a lack of independence from President Trump. Senate Republicans want to rubberstamp these nominees anyway--and confirm them as quickly as possible in their effort to pack the courts.  Just look at some of the judicial nominees who have already been confirmed this year--like John Bush, confirmed to sit on the Sixth Circuit, who blogged about the false claim that President Obama wasn't born in the United States and said at his hearing that he thinks impartiality is an aspiration for a judge, not an expectation; or Stephanos Bibas, now a judge on the Third Circuit, who wrote a lengthy paper calling for corporal punishment, including putting offenders in the stocks or pillory and applying multiple calibrated electroshocks.  Now, consider DC Circuit nominee Greg Katsas, who is before us today. Mr. Katsas works in the White House for President Trump. He is a Deputy White House Counsel. He testified that he has been personally involved in many of the Trump administration's most controversial policies, ranging from the Muslim travel ban to the creation of the Pence-Kobach election commission, to ending the DACA program, to the Trump administration's rollback of protections for LGBTQ-Americans.  Mr. Katsas also said that, while working for President Trump, he has given legal advice regarding the Emoluments Clause, advised on the administration's efforts to cut off Federal public safety funds to cities because of disagreements over immigration enforcement, and even provided legal advice on the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.  This is a laundry list of Trump administration controversies that Mr. Katsas has been personally involved with. It is likely that many of these issues will end up in litigation before the DC Circuit. I don't think appointing President Trump's staff lawyer to the DC Circuit will strengthen the American people's confidence in the fairness of our justice system. Instead, we need nominees with a strong track record of independence and good judgment.  Let me talk for a minute about Mr. Katsas's judgment.  At his hearing, I asked Mr. Katsas some simple questions about the torture technique known as waterboarding. I was deeply troubled by his answers. I asked him if waterboarding is torture. He said, ``I hesitate to answer the question in the abstract, not knowing the circumstances, the nature of the program.'' I asked him if waterboarding is cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. I noted that Senator John McCain, the author of the 2006 law that made it clear that cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is illegal, has said ``waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear violation of U.S. law''--so did all four Judge Advocates General--the top lawyers in the military--during the Bush administration. But Mr. Katsas responded evasively, saying ``anything that is cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment would be clearly unlawful.'' I then asked Mr. Katsas is waterboarding illegal under U.S. law. He said ``to the extent it constitutes either torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, yes it is.''  What a pack of weasel words. Mr. Katsas's tortured logic about waterboarding is unacceptable. Mr. Katsas should have said, with no equivocation and no uncertainty, that waterboarding is illegal, that it is cruel, inhuman, and degrading and that it is torture. That is the law, and a Federal judge should know it.  I am concerned that Mr. Katsas's refusal to give those answers reflects a troubling ideological viewpoint when it comes to questions of torture and interrogation techniques. My concerns were amplified by a speech Mr. Katsas gave in April 2009 when his speech notes said ``high bar--a lot of coercive interrogation does not equal torture.''  This is a clear-cut issue for me. I have voted against nominees in the past who gave the wrong answers to questions about waterboarding, and I will do it again. In my view, Mr. Katsas has not demonstrated the independence and judgment that we need for the critical position of DC Circuit judge. I cannot support his nomination.  Here is the bottom line. Before I was a Senator, I was a lawyer in downstate Illinois, and I looked up to Federal judges. I thought that, to get that job, you had to be a cut above. Otherwise, you wouldn't make it through the Senate's rigorous advice and consent process. Sadly, this Republican Senate is turning advice and consent into ``rush through and rubberstamp.'' Republicans want to pack the courts with judges who will support President Trump's agenda, and so they are hurrying to confirm as many of his picks as possible--even if they are unqualified, ideological, hiding things from the Senate, or too close to President Trump. Our Federal judiciary is being diminished as a result.  I wish my Republican colleagues would stand up for an independent judiciary and a meaningful advice and consent process. We should fill this vacancy on the DC Circuit with someone who is independent of President Trump, not one of his staff attorneys. We should choose nominees who are unafraid to say what the law is on torture, instead of what they might wish the law to be.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Katsas nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 20, 2017]                Checks on Trump's Court Picks Fall Away                    (Joe Palazzolo and Ashby Jones)Move to curtail `blue slips' gives the president, and successors, wide                    leeway in picks for federal bench       The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has      curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's      power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more      freedom than any U.S. president in modern times to install      his judges of choice, legal experts said.       Last week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) reined in a      tradition that empowered senators to block federal appeals-     court nominees from their home state. His decision came about      four years after Democrats, citing Republican filibusters of      President Barack Obama's circuit-court nominees, eliminated a      Senate rule that required the majority party to mount 60      votes to advance a nominee to a confirmation vote.       Together, the threat of a filibuster--or delaying tactic--     and use of ``blue slips''--so named because senators indicate      support or opposition to nominees on blue slips of paper--     guarded against lifetime appointments for nominees deemed far      outside the mainstream, court experts said. Getting rid of      these checks could foment distrust in judges' work if Mr.      Trump and later presidents prioritize ideology over      experience or legal talent, some of the experts said.       ``When judges lose legitimacy in the public eye, they lose      the ability to enforce unpopular decisions,'' said Arthur      Hellman, an expert on the federal judiciary and law professor      at the University of Pittsburgh. ``And that's when you see an      unraveling in the rule of law.''       Others said the changes were part of a natural progression      away from Senate traditions that allowed the minority party      to stall nominations for partisan reasons.       ``If you're not a fan of the Senate-wide filibuster, you're      probably not a fan of a filibuster by one senator,'' said      Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at      the Cato Institute, referring to the practice of senators      blocking nominees from their states.       So far, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary      Committee has approved two nominees pronounced unfit to serve      by the American Bar Association, including Brett Talley, a      Justice Department lawyer who has never argued a motion in      federal court and whose wife is the chief of staff for the      top White House lawyer.       ``If Senate Republicans will confirm him, then there is no      realistic sense of checks and balances,'' said Christopher      Kang, who worked on judicial nominations in the Obama White      House.       The White House declined to address criticisms of Mr.      Talley.       The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has      deemed two other Trump nominees ``not qualified''--ratings      Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee dismissed as      the product of what they called a liberal advocacy group.       The ABA has rejected that criticism, saying it has rated      potential judges for more than 60 years, drawing on dozens      and sometimes hundreds of interviews with a nominee's      colleagues and other peers.       Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump has      delivered on his promise to nominate ``highly qualified      judges.''       ``We appreciate the hard work of Chairman Grassley and      [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell, and we urge the      Senate to confirm all of the remaining nominees because it's      what the American people deserve,'' he said in an emailed      statement.       Mr. Grassley said on Thursday that he would hold a hearing      on two nominees--David Stras, a nominee to the midwestern      Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Kyle Duncan, a      nominee to the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans--over the      objections of home-state senators Al Franken of Minnesota, a      Democrat, and John Kennedy of Louisiana, a Republican.       The blue-slip practice began in the 1910s and, for a large      portion of its history, ``gave Senators the ability to      determine the fate of their home-state judicial      nominations,'' the Congressional Research Service, a research      arm Congress, said in a 2003 report.       Mr. Grassley said that after his recent move, a negative      blue slip would be a ``significant factor'' for the committee      to consider but wouldn't prevent a hearing, a break with the      practice of Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen since at      least 2005.       He blamed the Democrats for abusing the blue slip after      eschewing the filibuster.       ``The Democrats seriously regret that they abolished the      filibuster, as I warned them they would. But they can't      expect to use the blue-slip courtesy in its place. That's not      what the blue slip is meant for,'' he said on the Senate      floor last week.       Mr. Grassley also has parted with common practice by      stacking two circuit court nominees in a single confirmation      hearing, reducing time for preparation and questions, and      holding hearings before the ABA finished its judicial      evaluations.       ``Taken together, it's clear that Republicans want to      remake our courts by jamming through President Trump's      nominees as quickly as possible,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein      (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee, in an emailed statement.       The median time from nomination to Senate confirmation for      circuit-court nominees was less than a month in the      administrations of presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard      Nixon, said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the      Brookings Institution who studies federal courts. That number      rose through the 1980s and 1990s and ballooned to 229 days      during President Barack Obama's two terms, he said.
