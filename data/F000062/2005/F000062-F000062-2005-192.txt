 President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition to the motion to proceed on the gun liability bill.  Before I begin, I want to say I find it incongruous that we had the Defense Authorization bill up, an important bill--we were about to consider some amendments affecting enemy combatants and detainees, I think very important amendments, by Senator McCain, Senator Warner, and Senator Graham.
