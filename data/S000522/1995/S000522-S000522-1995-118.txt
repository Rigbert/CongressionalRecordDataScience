To get an accurate picture of how population funds are used one has to know they come from a variety of spigots, including the African fund, including some ESF funds, including the actual population account, and only a reading which says, ``You're looking at all these accounts, what is the aggregate'' can tell you whether or not that funding is going up or down. Since 1984 that figure has gone up dramatically, and I cite those figures for the record. They were produced by the Agency for International Development.
