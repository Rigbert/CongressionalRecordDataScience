 It is so bad that one small business owner in Paducah, KY, recently wrote to my office asking for relief because, as he said, ``Taxes are suffocating my company, and me personally.''  The pain isn't just being felt in Kentucky. It is an urgent problem nationwide. Families and job creators are doing their best to get ahead, but too often our Tax Code keeps them from reaching for the American dream. Working families and small businesses in our country deserve better than our outdated Tax Code, and that is what we are trying to deliver.  Tax reform represents the single most important thing we can do right now to spur economic growth, help support good jobs, and boost the middle class. This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity, and we should meet the challenge.  Overhauling our Tax Code can mean more money for small businesses to hire, to invest, and to expand. It can mean families keeping more of what they earn to save for a rainy day or an emergency. This relief can even mean getting one step closer to sending a child to college, buying a new car, or saving more for retirement.  This week, the Senate will continue our years-long effort toward tax reform. Under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, the Senate Finance Committee reported out legislation to replace our noncompetitive, complex, and outdated Tax Code.  Through dozens of hearings, substantial hard work, and an open amendment process, the committee has produced a bill that would prioritize the middle class and small businesses so they can keep more of their hard-earned money.  Our plan doubles the child tax credit, preserves the adoption tax credit, and roughly doubles the standard deduction to reduce how much income is taxed in the first place.  Put it all together, and a typical middle-class family of four making a median family income could see a tax break of around $2,200. As families sit around the table to balance their budgets and plan for the future, this money will make a significant impact.  In addition, our tax reform proposal will provide much needed relief for low- and middle-income families by repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate tax. By ending an unpopular tax from an unworkable law, this plan can help those who need it most.  The bottom line is this: We want to take more money out of Washington's pocket and put more money into the pockets of American families. To accomplish this goal, we will continue to consider the plan under regular order. Every Member will have a chance to offer amendments on the floor, and then we will vote.  There are many places in this legislation where we should all--Republicans and Democrats--be able to agree. For instance, our Democratic colleagues have the opportunity to help us end tax incentives that contribute to American jobs going overseas. That sounds like something our friends across the aisle should support. In fact, many of them have identified those incentives as the fundamental problem in our current Tax Code. This is our chance to put an end to it. I hope they will join us in our effort to help jobs and investments stay right here at home.  I am proud to continue working with my colleague to get this legislation one step closer to the President's desk. Let's keep working together to deliver tax relief for the American people.  Now, Madam President, on another matter. Later today, the Senate will consider two more talented nominees to the Federal judiciary. First, we will vote to confirm the nomination of Dabney Friedrich to serve as district court judge for the District of Columbia.                      Nomination of Gregory Katsas  Next, we will vote to advance the nomination of an exceptionally well-qualified nominee to the Federal judiciary, Gregory Katsas to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Mr. Katsas clerked for Judge Edward Becker of the Third Circuit and Justice Clarence Thomas, both on the DC Circuit and on the U.S. Supreme Court. He then joined the litigation group at a prominent law firm focusing on State and Federal appellate litigation, including arguing before the Supreme Court.  In 2001, Mr. Katsas became the Deputy Assistant Attorney General supervising the Justice Department's appellate staff of the Civil Division. The Senate later confirmed him by a voice vote to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, where he was responsible for overseeing hundreds of lawyers and some of the government's most complicated litigation. For his work, he was awarded the Edmund Randolph Award for outstanding service, the highest award given by the Department.  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey expressed his support for Mr. Katsas's nomination. This is what Attorney General Mukasey had to say:       It was my great privilege to work with Greg when he headed      the civil division and argued many of the most difficult and      challenging cases the Department faced at that time. Greg      worked tirelessly to defend the interests of the United      States in court, whatever his personal views about them may      have been.  Former Attorney General Mukasey, who has also previously served as a Federal district court judge, went on to say that ``it is Greg's character, temperament and virtue that most set him apart, and that suit him to serve as a Circuit Judge. There are many smart lawyers in Washington, and probably many nice ones,'' he concluded, ``but I know of no others who have Greg's unique combination of legal skill coupled with humility, integrity, and good judgment.''  That high praise was echoed by many of the other officials who knew Mr. Katsas well at the Justice Department. A large group of them wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting his nomination.       Greg is an exceptionally talented and brilliant fellow      lawyer. His commitment to public service and academic      qualifications are impeccable. In addition, we can attest to      Greg's thoughtfulness, temperament, and character.  Furthermore, a group of distinguished attorneys who have, in their own words, ``worked with Greg or litigated against him in the Supreme Court or federal courts of appeals, or are otherwise familiar with his work'' penned a letter of support for Mr. Katsas's nomination.  ``We hold a broad range of policy and jurisprudential views'' they wrote, ``but [we] are united in our view, based on our experience and knowledge of Greg's work, that he is highly qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit.''  Once he completed his time at the Department of Justice and returned to private practice, Mr. Katsas continued to impress his colleagues with his legal skill and judgment.  His firm's managing partner wrote a letter, also signed by partners from around the globe, recommending his nomination. Here is what they wrote:       Greg is a truly great legal thinker with a well-earned      reputation for integrity, fair-mindedness, and respect for      others. He has been a brilliant, conscientious advocate--  They continued--     for the firm's clients in the Supreme Court and appellate      courts throughout the nation in a wide variety of difficult,      high-profile cases.  Mr. Katsas is an impressive individual who is well-qualified to serve on the DC Circuit.  I thank Chairman Grassley, once again, for his outstanding work in moving President Trump's judicial nominees to the floor. I look forward to confirming the nomination of Ms. Friedrich and advancing the nomination of Mr. Katsas later today.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting their nominations.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
