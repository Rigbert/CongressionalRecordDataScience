President, before I make a statement on Scott Pruitt, to my colleague and friend from Colorado, I couldn't agree with you more. What happened in Colorado was an environmental tragedy, and we saw the photos. It is horrible. I don't know who is responsible for it, but it appears to be a government agency, and they should be held accountable. I will join you in that effort. I don't think there is any Member who wouldn't join you in saying there ought to be justice done here.We shouldn't let them off the hook because they are EPA employees or employees of the Federal government.  But I don't understand the leap in logic from that position to Scott Pruitt. Scott Pruitt is a man who, as attorney general of Oklahoma, has filed more than 14 lawsuits to restrict the authority of the EPA to clean up rivers.
