 Department of Defense bills are essentially language that changes for different military programs, all kinds of things in the bills. But certainly the issue of whether or not a woman has a right to have safe and legal health care overseas when she is serving her country has been ruled as germane in the past. It seems obviously pretty out of order and extraordinary that that would be where we are tonight.  Let me just do this, because I think all of us agree this amendment is one that has been considered on the bill before. It does deal with a woman's ability to have safe health care. It is one that has been ruled germane twice in postcloture times. I would just ask unanimous consent that the rule on relevancy at this time be waived so I can offer the amendment tonight, because I think it is important that we allow a procedure that has been done many times before to continue under this bill.  I ask unanimous consent to do that.
