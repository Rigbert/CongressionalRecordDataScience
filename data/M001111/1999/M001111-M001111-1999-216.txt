 I listened with respect to his arguments.  But in this amendment, we are simply assuring that the patients will get the best care. And if the best care for their particular condition is a clinical trial that will not only benefit themselves but the rest of the people with that condition as well--and NIH has paid for the vast majority of this. I understand from CBO that 90 percent of insurance companies have been paying for clinical trials. The amendment ensures that won't go away. We are seeing more and more HMOs look at their bottom line and that benefit is being taken away. We want to make sure the insurance companies continue to pay their part. Certainly, a patient who goes in cannot afford to pay for that clinical trial, but they have been paying premiums for years. Shouldn't that be part of what they expect when they pay a premium to an HMO?
