We are talking about this as being a major national defense issue. That is what it is really all about.  I am deeply concerned because I understand, certainly not as well as some of the others around here, that the Senate rules do provide that any one Senator can stop the train, can stop and can kill a bill.  I see Senator Thurmond down there, the chairman of our committee, the hours that we put into this thing. I just hope that those who disagree with one small part--this is a tiny part of this bill. We have pay raises for our guys in Bosnia. We have modernization programs in there. We have barracks that are starting construction right now that we have to continue. We have literally hundreds of things that are totally out of this realm, not associated with the depot maintenance, that are in this bill.  So I just hope that those who are opposed to this part or any part of the bill would not use the Senate prerogative that each Senator has to stop the bill altogether so that we will not have the defense authorization bill, but merely offer amendments to take out those parts that they find offensive. I am prepared to debate against such amendments that might cause this to come out.  So, I just respond by saying, I hope that you share my concern that we do not want to hold up the defense authorization bill. Let us go ahead, as Senator Thurmond had suggested in a meeting yesterday and said we have a good bill here. A lot of good things are in it. If somebody does not like some provision, they have every right to stand here on the floor and argue that case and be as persuasive as they can to take that out. I think that is the process, for the sake of America's defense, that should be used.  I assume the Senator from Georgia would agree with that.
