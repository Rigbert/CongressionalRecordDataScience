Chairman, I appreciate what the gentleman from Florida is putting forth and the position he has taken. I certainly believe there is merit, if you would, in the technology.  As you may know, we have included some very encouraging language in the report for this bill, noting our pleasure with the Air Force incorporating this type of technology into their nonkinetic counterelectronics analysis of alternatives.  However, we have carefully refrained from prejudicing the Air Force's analysis of alternatives by adding funds from one program to another.  I would like to work with the gentleman further to ensure, again, that the technology is given consideration, without prejudicing the study undertaken by the Air Force. I do think we ought to give them a full breadth of options, so that the best choice can be made on behalf of this country.  I reserve the balance of my time.
