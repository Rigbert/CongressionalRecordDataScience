Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize and thank Mr. Randy Erickson, a constituent from Kodiak, Alaska.  Recently, on behalf of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association's International Foundation, he traveled from Kodiak, Alaska, to South Sudan. While there, Mr. Erickson repaired and serviced power generators for the two utilities that provide these towns with electricity. This work is part of the Electrification Sustainability Program in South Sudan, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.  One project has evolved into a self-sustaining municipal electric cooperative serving approximately 1,300 consumer members. The other project also serves approximately 550 customers, including household, commercial enterprises, public institutions, and nongovernmental organizations.  After the 2005 peace agreement in South Sudan, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association International Foundation sent a team of experienced engineering and management staff to establish the first electric cooperative, and later to build two more rural utilities in other areas.  The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association International team provided training at these utilities to strengthen the competency of their directors, management, and employees.  Civil unrest broke out again last December, and many people were evacuated. Recently, USAID and the State Department began approving travel for its employees and partners to South Sudan, and Mr. Erickson volunteered his time and skills for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association International Foundation to help ensure that, despite the unpredictable situation, the people in these areas could still have electricity.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Erickson for his hard work.                          ____________________
