 All along the retail industry, whether it is Starbucks or whether it is various retail establishments; like Gottschalks department stores--38 stores in California--going into bankruptcy; whether you have banks closing; whether you have Macy's laying off 10,000 people, buying patterns have changed. I read a study where people are not buying as much toothpaste. That is an indication that there is an angst out there, a worry about this economy.  The point of this package is to get jobs out to people. I reserve the right, at the end of the day, to vote against a package that I don't think puts those jobs out there. That is my point.
