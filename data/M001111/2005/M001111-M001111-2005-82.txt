 President, I am here this morning to talk about a dangerous flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program that is about to take effect. This flaw is a ticking time bomb for more than 6 million Americans, for our communities and our health care providers. That fuse is going to detonate on January 1.  We cannot allow low-income seniors and the disabled to lose their direct coverage. We cannot leave our doctors and hospitals and nursing homes unprepared for the biggest change in decades. And we should not be pushing hundreds of thousands of people who need care onto our local communities. We can't wait. We have to fix this problem today. That is why I will be offering an amendment later this morning.  I have been working with Senators Rockefeller and Bingaman to address the immediate crisis. I thank them for their leadership. I have also introduced my own bill to protect our most vulnerable. It is the Medicare HEALS Act, S. 1822.  I have been traveling around my State. I have been meeting with people in Seattle, Lakewood, Yakima, Aberdeen, and Olympia. I want my colleagues to know, everywhere I go, people are angry and confused. And they are very worried, with good reason.  One senior told me:       Everyone I have talked to is totally confused--my doctor,      my pharmacist, even the Medicare number you are supposed to      call.  Another one said:       If we can't understand this, this whole [Medicare] plan is      going to fail.  Everywhere I went, people were confused.
