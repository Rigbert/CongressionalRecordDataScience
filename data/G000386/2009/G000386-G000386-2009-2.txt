 President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to object to proceeding to the nominations of Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury, Michael Mundaca to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Mary Miller to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Charles Collyns to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.  My support for the final confirmation of these nominees will rest on the response to concerns I have with respect to Internal Revenue Code section 6707A. A letter outlining these concerns was sent to both Secretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman on December 22, 2009, and I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2009.     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary,     U.S. Department of Treasury, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Douglas Shulman, Commissioner,     Internal Revenue Service, Constitution Avenue, NW,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman: I am      writing to express my disappointment with actions taken by      both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to Internal      Revenue Code (IRC) sections 382 and 6707A.       On November 18, 2008, I wrote to then Secretary Paulson      regarding Notice 2008-83, which changed the rules governing      the deductibility of losses under IRC section 382(h). The      facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of that      Notice raised concerns about the independence and merits of      the decision.       Treasury's most recent guidance on this same issue, Notice      2010-2, raises the same concerns. Accordingly, I request that      you provide the Finance Committee with all records relating      to communications pertaining to the issuance of Notice 2010-2      between Treasury officials, Citigroup, Inc., or other      Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) participants and/or      their representatives. Please also provide a timeline for,      and documentation of, Treasury and IRS discussions and      approvals for Notice 2010-2 as well as any discussions about      the impact this notice would have on the tax gap. In      cooperating with the Committee's review, no documents,      records, data, or other information related to these matters,      either directly or indirectly, shall be destroyed, modified,      removed, or otherwise made inaccessible to the Committee.       I understand that Treasury believes that Notice 2010-2 was      justified, in part, because it would help protect the      government's interest in Citigroup, Inc. Yet, it appears that      Notice 2010-2 may generate billions of dollars of tax savings      for Citigroup, Inc. Please provide documentation of any      discussions of impact on the tax gap resulting from Notice      2010-2.       The quick and immediate relief provided to Citigroup, Inc.      stands in stark contrast to Treasury and IRS's position on      providing relief to small business owners who have been      assessed penalties under IRC section 6707A. As you know,      Chairman Baucus and I have been working throughout this year      with our counterparts in the House of Representatives     to provide relief that can only be accomplished through      legislation and we expect that legislation to be enacted very      soon. As a supporter of closing the tax gap, I very much      appreciate the IRS's difficult position with respect to      protecting the government's interest in collecting taxes and      penalties due and appreciate the IRS's moratorium on      collection enforcement activity.       However, according to Commissioner Shulman's letter to      Chairman Baucus dated July 17, 2009, 72% of section 6707A      penalty assessments were imposed on small businesses and      small business owners. The penalty is clearly being assessed      disproportionately on small businesses compared to larger      taxpayers. In addition, the placement of liens on these      taxpayers, even though they are not yet being enforced, is a      significant threat to their operations. Many small businesses      use business assets or mortgage personal residences to secure      lines of credit for the businesses. Imposing liens has      significant negative implications for a small business that      has limited access to capital.       I discussed this issue with Commissioner Shulman last      month. I understand my staff has also discussed this again      with IRS staff since then but that the IRS insists that      placement of liens is necessary to protect the government's      interest. I am troubled and frustrated by this position. It      is inconsistent with the administration's publicly expressed      concern about the difficulties facing small businesses in      accessing capital.       I am also concerned that there is a disconnect between what      Treasury and IRS staff in Washington, DC think is happening      and what is actually happening in the field. For example,      when my staff discussed with your staff the issue of IRC      section 6723 being used to justify the placement of liens,      your staff denied this was happening. Yet, after providing      the name of a specific taxpayer who was subject to such a      lien, my staff was informed that there may be a systemic      issue in either the Automated Lien System or the Integrated      Collection System.       My staff has also informed me that some of the assessments      and liens are the result of Treasury and IRS regulations and      procedures, such as the decision to disallow disclosures on      amended returns and the decision to pursue 6707A assessments      while other examination issues remain unresolved. Until      Treasury regulations and IRS procedures can be revised to      clear up the confusion, I request that IRS remove all liens      on small businesses resulting from 6707A assessments unless      there is a known risk that the taxpayer will evade payment of      the penalties. Since the pending legislation will      significantly reduce the 6707A assessment amount, liens may      no longer be necessary.       As a supporter of closing the tax gap, I very much      appreciate the IRS's difficult position with respect to      protecting the government's interest in collecting taxes and      penalties. If the IRS believes that removal of a lien would      result in the IRS being unable to collect the penalty amount      as revised by the pending legislation, please provide a      description of these situations. However, I ask you to      consider using your discretion as was done for big financial      corporate TARP participants who will benefit from Notice      2010-2.       I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please      contact my staff with any questions or concerns.       Sincerely,                                                   Chuck Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.
