 I am pleased that we were able to work out a provision which may help more children who are eligible receive free or reduced price breakfasts and lunches. I commend my colleagues for their good work on this important legislation.  I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Harkin, and Baucus, that this Medicaid amendment will not authorize States to share Medicaid information other than that which is necessary to verify a child's participation in Medicaid or his or her family income.
