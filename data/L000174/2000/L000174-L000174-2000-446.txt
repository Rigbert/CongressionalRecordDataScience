President, I note that even without a time agreement, we have had a good debate. Senators on both sides of the issue have spoken. We have had practically no quorum calls. We should have debate like this where Senators can speak.  I see two of the most distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war on the floor, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, and the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb. Both are highly decorated veterans of that war.  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield to the Senator from Nebraska, and then upon completion of his statement, that he be able to yield to the Senator from Virginia.
