President, I would like to recognize the more than three decades of contributions by Bob Klein. . . ========================= END NOTE =========================   Bob Klein is the founding Director of the Vermont Nature Conservancy, and under his guidance, its mission has been to protect Vermont's unique and rare landscapes, important wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Parcels are selected for their natural attributes, not necessarily for size, and in total, the Vermont Nature Conservancy has helped to conserve an incredible 188,000 acres during Bob's tenure. I followed his example, and one of my priorities through my work in the Senate has been to add approximately 200,000 acres to the Green Mountain National Forest. Bob has accomplished this scale of conservation within the framework of a relatively small private organization. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S1579, March 12, 2014, in the first column, the following language appears: Bob Kline is the founding Director of . . .    The online Record has been corrected to read: Bob Klein is the founding Director of. . . ========================= END NOTE =========================   The Vermont Nature Conservancy has transferred most of the conserved land to the State and other land managers, while retaining ownership of the gems, to ensure their careful stewardship. These parcels included 55 natural areas dispersed across the State and open to visitors and naturalists. Bob has guided the Nature Conservancy in protecting forever iconic Vermont landscapes such as Camel's Hump, Hunger Mountain, Shelburne Pond, Alburgh Dunes, the Maidstone Bends of the Connecticut River and the Green River Reservoir.  Bob's contributions to conservation go well beyond lands that the Nature Conservancy has purchased. His leadership within the State was instrumental in the 132,000 acre Champion Lands conservation project when he helped bring together the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Vermont legislature and multiple private partners. At the Nature Conservancy, Bob has carefully assembled a team of conservation biologists, geographers and naturalists whose work has transformed conservation thought and practice. Vermont State agencies, recreational trails organizations, Federal agencies and private developers look first to the Nature Conservancy when seeking a better understanding of Vermont's ecosystems and how to protect them.  Other Nature Conservancy Chapters across the United States have been modeled on the Vermont office that Bob created. Bob's patient, generous and kind work with members and the general public is reflected in the fact that the Vermont has, by far, the highest per-capita Nature Conservancy membership of any State. I have often looked to Bob for advice on national conservation policy and he has led national Nature Conservancy visits to Washington, D.C.  Bob is retiring as the State Director of the Vermont Nature Conservancy but I know that he will continue to pursue his passions of botany, photography and exploration of nature. Bob's photographs have graced national publications and gallery walls. I will continue to look to Bob as an advisor on conservation policy and wish him all the best as he begins this new chapter.                          ____________________
