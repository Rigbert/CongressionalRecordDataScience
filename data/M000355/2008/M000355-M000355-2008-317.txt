 President, I would like to address the heartbreaking humanitarian crisis in Burma and the actions of the military junta there which have shocked our consciences over these last days.  A govrnment that was swift to mobilize last year against a peaceful protest by unarmed monks has astonished us with its sluggish response to the devastating May 3 storm.  With thousands dead and perhaps 2 million now at risk of further suffering, the military junta has treated the cyclone as more of a political inconvenience than a national tragedy, focusing on a sham constitutional referendum instead of relief efforts. Andthe consequences of this callous response are tragic. As precious time was wasted, what was already a terrible natural disaster became a manmade disaster of spreading hunger and disease. We have heard reports of aid workers being turned away and of visas for aid workers being refused on the grounds that consulates were closed for the weekend.  Today, finally, an American C-130 was permitted into Burma carrying desperately needed supplies. Two more flights are expected tomorrow. This is a positive development, but it is also an extremely modest concession.  It is my hope that these halting steps by the regime in the last day or so augur a greater openness to humanitarian assistance.  The people of Burma should know that, if permitted, America stands ready to help.                          ____________________
