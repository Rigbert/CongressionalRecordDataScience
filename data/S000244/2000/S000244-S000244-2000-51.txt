Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.  This resolution changes the title of section 205 from Space Station Management to Space Station Research Utilization and Commercialization Management in order to make the title more informative. It also replaces specific references to the Russian ServiceModule in section 201 with generic references to any Russian element in the International Space Station's critical path, and moves the due date for an educational study required in section 317 from October 1, 2000, to December 1, 2000.  Finally, the resolution removes some commas to reduce the number used in a series to address stylistic preferences. These are minor changes that do not affect the substance of the bill adopted by the House on a vote of 399-17 on September 14. They have been discussed with the minority and with the other body and all parties have agreed to them.
