President, I can think of some ads I see on local TV at night that are not violent but I find of a personal nature offensive, some of which are filled with backgrounds of Government land. Should we start taking those out?  The fact is, we have a lot of Government sites. Do we stop a movie, for example, that is filmed with somebody driving down Pennsylvania Avenue because the Department of the Interior, the Justice Department, and other Government buildings are seen in the background? Do we make sure there is never any depiction of the Capitol? One of the most violent things was ``Independence Day'' when a model of the Capitol was blown up. There may have been exterior shots actually made of the Capitol prior to that time. Does that go out?  I suggest these because we are getting into a terribly subjective area, and we are asking people who are trained to do very good things for our Government, whether it is fishing permits, lands permits, or agricultural subsidies--they are not trained, nor should they be, in this Nation especially to be censors.  I know the time of the Senator from Kentucky has expired. I yield back all my remaining time.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.
