 President, recent studies have indicated that the violent crime rates are decreasing in many cities, but that there is a disturbing rise of violent crimes being committed by teen-agers.  I think there is no more important issue facing this Congress than violence. Congress must take steps to reduce violent acts--in the home, in the workplace, and on our streets --that occur with numbing frequency in America.  I have been particularly troubled by the content of many programs that air on television networks in this country. Ultra-violent acts appear almost around the clock. While I have spoken out frequently about the problem of television violence, I also wanted to take a moment to praise an upcoming television documentary that details the positive steps taken by many companies to help troubled and disadvantaged kids.  ``Everybody's Business: America's Children,'' a network documentary produced by the Oscar- and Emmy-Award winning Arnold Shapiro, will air this Saturday, December 23 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.  This program showcases the volunteer and funding efforts made possible by many American companies and corporations to help troubled and disadvantaged kids. Katie Couric is the host of this special which praises many companies for providing mentoring programs and community support efforts to support our children.  During this holiday season, it is particularly refreshing to see a network television program which promotes the good deeds of American companies.  As we look ahead into the coming year, it is my hope that more television programs will give this type of positive reinforcement to America's companies that make an investment in our youth.  It also gives me pleasure to note the program is produced by one of Los Angeles's leading producers, Arnold Shapiro. He is well known for his quality programs and documentaries, including ``Scared Straight'' and ``Scared Straight: Exposing and Ending Child Abuse.'' He recently won the Peabody Award for his CBS children's special, ``Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse.''  Arnold Shapiro's brand of television--straight forward, informative and educational--is exactly the type of programming I hope to see more of on network television in the coming years.                          ____________________
