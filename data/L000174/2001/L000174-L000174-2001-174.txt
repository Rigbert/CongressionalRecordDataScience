 The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.                     HONORING KENNETH MARTIN LUDDEN  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, each year, many people assist in the creation of the Foreign Operations bill. Besides the efforts of our staffs, hundreds of individuals from the Federal Government provide information and expertise on the Administration's funding requests. Unfortunately, on September 10, we lost one of the people who played a very important part of the creation of this bill for a number of years, Ken Ludden. Ken worked at the Department of Treasury as their Legislative Coordinator to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs. Ken was a very capable and attentive liaison. Not only did he go the extra mile in trying to answer any questions we had, but he was so good at his job that he would know which member might be more concerned about one issue and provide information before staff would request it.  This was not Ken's first position in Government, in fact he dedicated most of his life to public service. He worked for Congressman Edwin Forsythe, at the United States Agency for International Development, for Senator Lugar on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Department of State and then Treasury. In between his time at the Departments of State and Treasury, Ken did spend some time in the private sector but then returned to public service to work as a congressional liaison. He seemed to genuinely enjoy working with the Hill. Like many former staff, Ken never forgot his Hill roots. he understood the needs of staff and members and the demands and expectations we face from our constituents. Ken also even made bad news easy to take--he would not stall or press an unworkable position but would work until common ground could be found between the Department and Congress.  In light of his dedicated service to the Committee, Senator Leahy and I have offered an amendment in the manager's package that would designate the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations bill as the ``Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, for Fiscal year 2002.'' This is just a small gesture to acknowledge our appreciation for a life time of service to the American people. On behalf of the Senate, Senator Leahy and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Mary, and their daughters, and his colleagues at the Department. We will miss him.
