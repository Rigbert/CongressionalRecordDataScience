 I would like to observe that yesterday and today, up until the time we pass the tax reconciliation bill, we are actually engaging in an utterly futile activity that should have been avoided by the simple act of granting consent. In effect, the minority, in apparently a display of pique, wants to make the Senate, in effect, do again a bill it already did in December.  I am not opposed to dilatory tactics when they are not pointless. I have been in the minority in this body and have been a proud guardian of gridlock from time to time when there was a point to it, when we were actually trying to defeat a measure. But it seems to me to some extent it demeans the institution and grates on the nerves of everyone when common courtesy of granting consent is not offered.  Nevertheless, yesterday and today, we will plod through a bill that we did about 5 weeks ago one more time; at the end, with the same result.  Let me report that at this point there are 7 hours remaining for that debate, although we do not believe all of that time will be necessary. At some point early this afternoon, we expect on this side to yield back time, and we would begin voting. The so-called vote-arama will be a series of consecutive votes on amendments to the bill which will eventually lead to passage. We hope it is not a lengthy voting series because that will simply inconvenience all Members on both sides of the aisle. However, that is up to the Members ofthis body as to how many amendments they choose to offer.  In any event, the majority leader has stated that we will stay on the bill until we complete it this week. I encourage Senators to stay close to the Chamber once the voting sequence begins because, as we all recall, there is not much time between those votes.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S465-S466]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
