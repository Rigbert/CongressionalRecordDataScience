Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my strong support for setting aside sufficient funding for Beach Protection projects, and to keep the current language in the bill which states that 65 percent of the initial construction costs of beach replenishment projects are to be financed by the Federal Government, and 35 percent of the costs are to be paid by states and local governments.  The fact of the matter is that our beaches are national assets that deserve national protection. Just like our national parks, our beaches are not enjoyed solely by those who live near or on them. Just the opposite is true: our beaches are visited by tens of millions of people from all over the country. Foreign tourists come from all parts of the globe to visit our coasts and beaches.  My good friend, Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, has offered an amendment today to strike language in the bill that directs the Secretary of the Army to honor existing Federal contracts with States, counties, and cities throughout coastal America. Under the gentleman's amendment, the Federal government would essentially shirk its responsibility, and shuffle it onto the shoulders of state and local governments, by switching the cost share ratio to 35 percent federal/65 percent local.  I rise in opposition to this amendment, because it is bad national policy, as well as bad for local taxpayers in coastal communities.  Mr. Speaker, the record is clear: states and local governments have consistently shown their commitment to assist in the preservation and replenishment of beaches along the Nation's coastlines. The proposed Federal change in cost sharing would result in the delay or elimination of several important Corps of Engineers projects, which would potentially increase the property damage from hurricanes and severe storm events. Additionally, states and localities would not be able to absorb the increased costs without raising taxes or cutting other vital priorities.  Our nation's beaches contribute to our national economy--four times as many people  So to suggest, as the amendment from Mr. Tancredo does, that beach protection confers benefits to only a handful of beach-house owners, is simply false. Just look at my own State of New Jersey. Tourism is the second greatest contributor to the New Jersey economy. In 1999, tourism brought $27.7 billion to the state. Out of the 167 million trips made to New Jersey in 1999, 101 million were to the Shore area.  I would also like to thank the Committee for setting aside $413,000 in funds to complete the next stage of the Manasquan Inlet Project, which extends from the Manasquan Inlet to the Barnegat Inlet and includes the beaches of several coastal towns in Ocean County, which are in my district.  Additionally, the Manasquan Inlet is absolutely crucial the fishing industry and the general economic health of the New Jersey metropolitan shore. It is through the Manasquan Inlet that many large deep-sea fishing vessels gain their entry to the ocean and where they can return with their catch. Nearly 22,000 people are employed by the fishing industry in New Jersey, with an economic output of almost $2.1 billion. Protecting the beaches and preventing erosion benefits more than just the tourism industry.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members of Congress to protect our nation's beaches, coastal communities and tourism industry by keeping the Federal/Local cost share at 65 percent Federal, 35 percent local.  Vote ``no'' on the Tancredo amendment.                          ____________________
