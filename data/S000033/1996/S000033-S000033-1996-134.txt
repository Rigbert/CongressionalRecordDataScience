 Speaker, I was unavoidably absent during the votes on default legislation. If I had been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on the motions to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair with regards to the resolutions offered by Mr. Gephardt (rollcall No. 26) and Ms. Jackson-Lee (rollcall No. 27), I would have voted ``nay'' on the ordering of the previous question on House Resolution 355 (rollcall No. 28). I would have voted ``nay'' on H. Con. Res. 141 (rollcall No. 29). I would have voted ``yea'' on H.R. 2924 (rollcall No. 30).                          ____________________
