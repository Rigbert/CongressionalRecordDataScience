 Mr. Chairman, I will suggest that I would find the amendment acceptable. I do believe it is largely duplicative of the general provision of section 8110 that is already found in the bill. Again, I understand the gentleman's intent and would agree with it and do believe it is acceptable to the subcommittee.
