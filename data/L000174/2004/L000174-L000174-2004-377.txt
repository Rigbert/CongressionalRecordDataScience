President, I want to discuss an issue concerning U.S. efforts to rebuild Iraq. Before I begin, however, I want to again recognize the bravery and sacrifices that are being made every day by Americans and Iraqis, and especially those who have been killed or wounded. There have been, almost daily, horrific, cowardly acts of terrorism, increasingly aimed at citizens. The appalling attacks this week, where the bodies of Americans were dragged through the streets, disgust and deeply sadden us all. My deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of those who have died.  Yesterday, the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority, CPA-IG, issued his first report on the reconstruction efforts in Iraq. I want to remind people that it was Senator Feingold, and later in the process, Senator Stevens, not the Bush administration, who worked hard to establish the CPA-IG office during the debate on the Iraq supplemental. I had the privilege of working with Senator Feingold to help draft some of the provisions of his amendment, and he, along with Senators Stevens, are to be commended for their leadership on this issue.  Page 33 of the CPA-IG's report contains a table, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.
