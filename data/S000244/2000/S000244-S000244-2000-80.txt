Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3125, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. During Judiciary Committee mark-up, I brought up my concerns relating to the tribal gaming exemption. I am pleased that the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, and the Gentleman from Alaska, Mr. Young, were willing to work with me to include language which addresses my concerns about what I believe was an ambiguous section of the bill.  I would like to take a moment to explain my concerns and how, through the manager's amendment, these concerns were addressed. The provision exempting gambling on a closed loop system requires both the sender and the receiver to be on Indian lands. This is not limited to the Indian lands on which the game is conducted, therefore, it would allow linking of all Indian lands nationwide. My concern with this language was how multi-Tribal linking could impact individual Tribal/State gaming Compacts.  Let me provide an example: If State A's Compact allows for slots, and State B's Compact allows for blackjack and slots, absent clarification, the tribe in State A could argue it can now participate in blackjack. Included in the manager's amendment is additional language on this section to ensure that no Class III gaming activity can occur without the explicit authorization of a Tribal/State Compact. This language does not require Tribes to re-negotiate their Compacts with states; rather it reinforces the Tribal/State Compact.  In conclusion, the Indian gaming language has been clarified so that the carefully negotiated Tribal/State compacts are not at risk. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
