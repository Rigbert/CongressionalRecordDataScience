 President, my thoughts go out today to the people of Washington as they assess the damage and begin recovery from the earthquake there yesterday afternoon.  Yesterday's event is a reminder that earthquakes are a national problem, and one that can strike at any time, without warning.  It is in this light that I introduce, today, the Earthquake Loss Reduction Act of 2001. This bill provides incentives to encourage responsible state and local governments, individuals, and businesses to invest in damage prevention measures before an earthquake strikes. It is an ``ounce of prevention'' that will save the federal treasury, homeowners, businesses, and state and local governments the ``pound of cure'' for relief and recovery.  The legislation builds on the excellent work of our nation's earth scientists and engineers by making implementation of loss reduction measure a federal priority. We know where earthquake hazards exist, which buildings and utility and transportation systems are most vulnerable, and what the consequences will be to public safety, community character, and our economy if an earthquake strikes. We also know how to reduce losses. Guidelines exist that provide rational, common sense approaches to upgrade weak facilities.  The challenge as we enter the 21st century is to put this knowledge to work to reduce future losses, and improving the safety of Americans and the performance of privately and publicly owned buildings and facilities. The time to implement our knowledge is now.  There is no question that mitigation efforts save dollars and lives in the long run. It worries me greatly that the President, in his Budget, proposes a cut to existing mitigation efforts.  First, the President proposes eliminating the Project Impact program. Project Impact is the nation's premier disaster prevention initiative. Communities use Project Impact funds to retrofit hospitals and schools, to create flood barriers, and to help shore-up communities against any number of other possible natural disasters.  California has eight Project Impact communities, and has used Project Impact funds to stabilize emergency facilities and other important structures. Local communities do not always have the resources to mitigate these facilities on their own.  There are two other proposals in President Bush's budget that are cause for alarm.  1. The President's budget outline assumes $83 million in FEMA savings by including a public buildings disaster insurance requirement, phased in over three years. This provision would mean that public entities like the U.C. system would have to have insurance on ALL structures before they could apply for federal assistance in the event of a disaster.  This proposal simply is not feasible for states like California. Insurance companies in California do not offerdisaster insurance or, specifically, earthquake insurance.  It will be interesting to see how the cities affected by the Washington earthquake would be affected by this rule. Insurance companies in Washington do offer earthquake insurance and will be paying-out over the coming months. It will be interesting to see if the insurers are able to withstand the costs.  2. The budget also proposes reducing from 75 percent to 50 percent the federal share of funding for hazard mitigation grants. Once again, this is simply not feasible in California. California public institutions would not be able to afford 50 percent of clean-up costs after a major earthquake. It would be difficult for them to pay even 25 percent, which is current law.  These two provisions could cause my State, and others, great harm if enacted. I am prepared to fight them, and I will.  The United States Geological Survey tells us there are 40 states and five territories with a moderate or higher earthquake risk. Entire metropolitan areas in these states and territories are at risk of being crippled by earthquake damage because existing buildings and infrastructure were built without appropriate seismic requirements.  Areas lying outside ``earthquake zones'' are also affected. Even localized damage threatens complex economic systems and the magnitude of federal disaster aid. Let me give you a few examples of potential losses estimated by FEMA's regional earthquake loss estimation model, HAZUS.  A magnitude of 7.0 earthquake on California's Newport-Inglewood fault running through the Los Angeles basin could cause an estimated $80 billion in losses. Damage to buildings and business interruption would affect Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego Counties. About 58 percent of the damage would be to residential buildings, displacing about 400,000 people. An estimated 100,000 people would need shelter.  A magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault running along the east side of the San Francisco Bay could cause about $37 billion in damage. About 56 percent of the damage would be to residential buildings, displacing about 140,000 people. More than half of the losses would stem from damage to wood-frame homes and small business buildings.  A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Border Ranges fault near Anchorage, AK could cause about $5 billion in losses. Anchorage, a city of about 260,000 people, would suffer most of the damage. More than 60 percent of the damage would be to wood-frame buildings serving as homes and small businesses.  A magnitude 7.2 earthquake on the Wasatch fault on the east side of Salt Lake City could cause about $13 billion in losses to the eight counties in that region. Most of the damage, about $11 billion, would occur in Salt Lake County. Throughout the region, about 150,000 people would be displaced, nearly 38,000 would require shelter, and nearly $10 billion of the losses would result from damage and disruption to residential buildings.  As large as these estimates seem, the actual losses could be even greater. Make no mistake, earthquakes will strike these regions and others, we just do not know when. In each estimate, over half of the losses are expected to come from residential buildings. Most vulnerable residential buildings can be upgraded for reasonable levels of expenditures. The incentives proposed in this bill could make it happen.  While it is too early to determine the extent of the damage of yesterday's earthquake in Washington, taking a look at the losses from the 1994 earthquake in Northridge, CA. The direct losses from that quake totaled more than $44 billion. For all disasters declared since 1989, FEMA has paid nearly $28 billion in disaster assistance for repairs to public buildings and infrastructure and for humanitarian aid. FEMA's outlay for Northridge alone represents 25 percent of this 12-year aggregate figure, approximately $7 billion.  You and I know that supplemental relief funds disrupt carefully planned budget decisions and undermine on-going programs. For some people, reducing recurring demands for federal disaster aid may be reason enough to support this bill, but there are more compelling reasons.  The cost and consequences of earthquakes are painful to the victims, both individuals and businesses. The plight of those in the disaster area may be obvious, but the effects extend outside of the disaster area, often across state borders affecting those who depend on damaged businesses and affected customers. The American economy depends on closely linked businesses, suppliers of raw materials and components, manufacturers, transporters, and marketers. Worldwide competitors seek the market share of American business when a disaster disrupts our economy.  Research from the Northridge earthquake indicates that even when businesses did not suffer direct damage in that quake, their presence in or near areas of wide-spread damage or disruption caused economic hardship. Economic losses can be large and have long-term effects on the future of businesses and regions. Simply put, earthquake loss reduction efforts improve the sustainability of American businesses.  What we need is a widespread investment in loss reduction by many parties, not just the federal government. Responsibility for earthquake safety rests with state and local government, individuals, and companies. The federal role I advocate is one of leadership backed by incentives to inform and motivate those responsible to implement loss-reduction actions. The result I seek is reduced pain and suffering, and more sustainable communities and businesses.  The Federal Government is already contributing to earthquake disaster prevention. In a little over twenty years, our National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program has sponsored research and development activities in earth sciences and engineering and has produced the knowledge and tools, such as the HAZUS estimates I noted earlier, we need to reduce our risk. If we are to reduce losses, however, we must put this knowledge to work.  Reducing earthquake losses depends on the actions of millions of individual decision-makers, homeowners, business owners, and government officials. Many successful measures are easy to implement, but may seem expensive when considering competing demand for funds between immediate issues and the perceived low probability threat of an earthquake. The incentives in this bill provide good reasons to undertake loss reduction efforts. This bill will move knowledge from the laboratory to the community. The bill recognizes that shared responsibility for prevention means that those responsible for the facilities at risk accept responsibility for reducing the risk.  This legislation does the following:  1. It provides a credit against federal income taxes equal to 50 percent of a homeowner's investment in seismic retrofit, not to exceed $6,000.  2. It provides businesses an opportunity to depreciate the cost of seismic retrofit over five years.  3. The bill defines a seismic retrofitting bond as a bond for which 95 percent of the proceeds are used for seismic retrofitting expenditures or used to finance loans to borrowers for seismic retrofitting expenditures as ``qualified bonds.''  4. It encourages private investments in seismic retrofitting of residential properties by allowing deduction of passive activity losses.  5. The legislation provides mortgage insurance incentives for seismic retrofitting of residences.  6. It authorizes a $1 billion Loss Reduction Trust Fund to provide matching grants for mitigation measures and recovery planning grants to reduce damage to buildings and utility and transportation systems critical to disaster response. Provided to local government entities, public and private hospitals, institutions of higher education, and special districts, the trust fund grants would require that the state and the local entity recipients benefitting from the investment fund a portion of the cost. To be eligible, the local entities must also have in place a long-term strategic earthquake loss reduction plan and enforce land use, building code, and other measures to reduce the vulnerability of facilities in the jurisdiction.  7. And the bill authorizes establishment of the Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring Systemby the United States Geological Survey.  The incentives offered in this bill are available only if the recipient, sometimes with state aid, invests in the effort to prevent losses. These investments will spawn meaningful loss prevention actions that will benefit all of the stakeholders involved and will reduce the need for disaster aid.  Public/private partnership work:  City of Berkeley, CA, has demonstrated that even small incentives work. This city of 109,000 people spends about $1 million each year in hazard reduction activities. It rebates a portion of its real estate transfer tax, up to $1,500, to homeowners for loss reduction actions, waives permit fees for seismic residential retrofit projects, and offers low income loans up to $15,000 and some grants to low income senior and disabled homeowners for retrofit work.  In the 10 ears since these incentives were put in place, 38 percent of the single-family homes have had some form of retrofit work done and 30 percent of small apartment buildings have been improved.  Berkeley has also passed seven special taxes that concentrate funding on pre-disaster mitigation.  Federal incentives can empower similar results nationwide. Cities like Berkeley, where the earthquake threat is a critical community concern, will benefit from the additional inducements included in this bill.  Preventing damage makes sense, and it benefits our nation in many ways besides reducing the need for disaster aide. Not all benefits are easily quantified because they accrue to a variety of stakeholders and many of the indirect and human effects are subtle, yet important.  Earthquakes impact all segments of the communities they strike, individuals, businesses, and public services such as police, fire, hospitals, and schools. Damage often creates economic ripples throughout the community and beyond state borders. Homeowners, building owners, their tenants, neighboring businesses, local and state government, and the Federal Government will benefit.  Let me give you three examples of loss reduction projects that have widespread benefits:  1. Water officials in Memphis, TN recently made the wise decision to invest in a structural upgrade of the Davis Water Pumping station. Strengthening this critical station cost about $488,000.  What the officials at the Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division recognize is that there is a fifty-fifty chance that a moderate earthquake will strike the Memphis area within the next fifteen years. It would cost $17 million to replace the water pumping station after such an earthquake. Plus, every day the station is inoperable costs about $1.4 million in lost services.  The loss of drinkable water affects the entire community and cripples business activity. Considering the time to repair or replace a damaged pump facility, it is estimated that the cost of lost services would be $112 million. Clearly, a $488,000 investment is a good one.  The Loss Reduction Trust Fund established by this bill authorizes $1 billion in matching grants to strengthen critical infrastructure like the Davis Water Pumping Station.  2. Another good example of forward thinking is the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Los Angeles. After realizing its facilities were vulnerable to earthquake damage, the company began a $20 million program to retrofit critical buildings and equipment. The brewery is a critical company asset because it supplies the Southwest and Pacific regions. Although located only a few miles from the epicenter of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the brewery was able to return to operation after just minor cleanup, repairs, and restoration of off-site water supply.  Anheuser-Busch estimated that damage and business interruption costs could have exceeded $300 million after the Northridge quake, had it not strengthened its facilities. There was more at stake than the viability of a major business. Damage affects employees, federal, state, and local government income, suppliers, vendors, and the surrounding community.  By accelerating depreciation of seismic retrofit expenses, this bill will encourage other businesses to carry out similar projects.  3. And there is another example from the Northridge earthquake. Three months before that quake, a homeowner in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles spent $3,200 to retrofit his 1911-vintage home. The house survived with only minor damage, while similar houses on the same block suffered severe damage. In fact, several of those neighboring homes were demolished by the earthquake.  Many homes across the nation are built on poorly braced foundation walls or piers and posts and are vulnerable to damage during even mild earthquake activity. The cost to add the bracing needed generally is only a few thousand dollars, yet the cost of repairing a home after it falls is tens of thousands of dollars. As with a business, when a home topples, there is more at stake than injury to family members and the cost of repairs. Not to mention the fact that a falling home can spark a fire that can burn an entire community.  This bill creates a tax credit for half of the cost of the seismic retrofit of a residence, makes mortgages for earthquake resistant homes more attractive than those for homes meeting lower standards, and makes it easier for local government to use general obligation bonds financing for loss prevention project loans.  FEMA's HAZUS software was recently used to estimate how the individual actions provided by the bill could add up to significant savings of importance to our communities, economy, and governments.  If a magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault under Los Angeles today, it could cause about $80 billion in damages. Thousands of businesses would be interrupted, 400,000 people would be displaced, and there would be several hundred deaths. If every existing building in that area were retrofitted to the standards in current codes, the losses would drop by $28 billion to $52 billion. Business interruption losses would drop from $15 billion to less than $6 billion. The number of people displaced would shrink to 93,000, and the estimated number of deaths would drop by over 90 percent.  Similarly, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault in the San Francisco Bay area would cause about $37 billion in damages, if it struck today. 140,000 people would be displaced. However, if every existing building were retrofitted to the standards in current codes, the losses would be reduced by a third. Business interruption losses would drop from $6.5 billion to about $2 billion. The number of people displaced would shrink to 40,000 and the estimated deaths would drop by more than 90 percent.  Assuming that all buildings meet the latest seismic standards is ambitious, but the resulting estimates give convincing evidence that implementing loss reduction measures can pay handsome dividends.  Moreover, the importance of loss reduction efforts extends beyond these quantitative estimates. Less damage means less psychological pain, more sustainable communities and businesses, protected stocks of low-income housing and architecturally and historically significant buildings and neighborhoods, and protected family savings. Every time a neighbor, employer, or local government invests in prevention, the entire community benefits.  Earthquakes are a nationwide problem. They have struck the Northeast and Northwest, damaged Charleston, Saint Louis, and Memphis, struck our mountain states, Alaska, and Hawaii. They will strike these and other places again.  Much of the knowledge we need to reduce losses from future earthquakes exists. While some forward thinking businesses, individuals, and local governments are already using the knowledge to invest in measures to reduce future losses, the Earthquake Loss Reduction Act creates modest federal incentives to foster a needed increase in the implementation of hazard mitigation measures.  This bill also establishes a $1 billion grant program to match the investments from local government entities, hospitals, and institutions of higher education. It challenges states to add to this match, and makes investment in properties for the purpose of seismic retrofit an attractive investment inour future. While the occurrence of large-scale earthquakes may be perceived as a low probability, our experience shows the high consequence of these events.  Strong federal leadership, and modest incentive, can lead Americans to undertake loss reduction measures and can lead us to a safer tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Earthquake Loss Reduction Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 424       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Earthquake Loss Reduction      Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) After 23 years of research funded by the National      Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, a substantial body of      knowledge exists about earth sciences, geotechnical, and      structural engineering and human behavior relating      earthquakes.       (2) The foremost challenge as we enter the 21st century is      putting this knowledge to work by reducing future losses to      improve the safety of Americans and the performance of State      and local government facilities and private buildings and      facilities.       (3) Earthquakes and tsunamis cause great danger to human      life and property throughout the United States and continue      to threaten Americans significantly in over 40 States and      territories.       (4) Too few States and local communities have sufficiently      identified and assessed their risk and implemented adequate      measures to reduce losses from such disasters and to ensure      that their critical public infrastructure and facilities will      continue to function after the disaster.       (5) Too much of the Nation's stocks of housing and      commercial buildings remain inherently vulnerable to      earthquake shaking. Future losses in these facilities can be      lessened using currently feasible technology.       (6) Too much of local government infrastructure remain at      risk and are likely to be non-functional in the aftermath of      foreseeable earthquake events at the time when the services      they provide are critically necessary.       (7) Federal, State and local government expenditures for      disaster assistance and recovery have increased without      commensurate reduction in the likelihood of future losses      from such earthquakes.       (8) Feasible techniques for reducing future earthquake      losses are readily available.       (9) Without economic incentives, it is unlikely that States      and local communities and the public will be able to      implement available measures to reduce losses and ensure      continued functionality of their infrastructure.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a      national disaster mitigation program that --       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering,      economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs resulting      from earthquakes;       (2) offers financial incentives to encourage private sector      efforts to reduce earthquake losses;       (3) provides matching finds to encourage and assist States      and local governments and the private sector in their efforts      to implement measures designed to ensure the continued      functionality of public infrastructure, commerce, and      habitation after earthquakes; and       (4) creates Federal, State and local government      partnerships to reduce the vulnerability of public      infrastructure, commercial enterprises, and residential      buildings to earthquakes.
