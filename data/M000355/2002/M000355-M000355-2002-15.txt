 President, first, let me say to my good friend from Connecticut, this is, indeed, something to celebrate on a bipartisan basis in a Congress that could use a celebration. This may have been the most unproductive and unsuccessful session of the Senate in my 18 years here: no energy bill; no terrorism insurance bill and--until tomorrow, at least--no appropriations bills; no budget; no homeland security bill; only 44 percent of President Bush's U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed.  A couple of items we did pass were--at least in this Senator's judgment--not very good: a flawed campaign finance reform bill and a bloated farm bill.  We could use a celebration. And the Senator from Connecticut and I would like to encourage all of our Senators to feel good about the piece of legislation that will be adopted tomorrow.  This is, indeed, a significant accomplishment, an important piece of legislation. Even if we had a very productive Congress, and a Senate that was passing landmark legislation on virtually a weekly basis--even if that had been the case this year--this legislation would have stood out as something important for the Nation and something well worth doing.  So, Mr. President, I rise today with a tremendous amount of pride and enthusiasm about this landmark legislation. Although the Senate, as I just suggested, has been mired in partisanship and virtually calcified over various pieces of legislation, and the confirmation of judges, the House-Senate conference committee on election reform has achieved an historic bipartisan, bicameral consensus.  Nearly 2 years ago, this Nation had a painful lesson on the complexities and complications State and local election officials face in conducting elections. In response, legislators on both sides of the Hill introduced legislation to address the problems exposed in the 2000 election. The various pieces of legislation ran the gamut in approach and emphasis, but all were unified in their goal of improving our Nation's election systems.  In December of 2000, Senator Torricelli and I introduced the first of what was to become four bipartisan compromise bills that I have sponsored or cosponsored. From the beginning, I have been committed to providing notonly financial assistance but also informational assistance to States and localities.  The best way to achieve both of these goals is by establishing an independent, bipartisan election commission. The commission will be a permanent repository for the best, unbiased, and objective election administration information for States and communities across America.  And that is really important because what happens--I used to be a local official early in my political career--is that you are confronted with vendors selling various kinds of election equipment, and there is really no way to make an objective analysis of what your needs are. On the other hand, this new commission will be a repository for expertise and unbiased advice to States and localities across America about what kind of equipment might best suit their situation.  This concept has been one of the cornerstones of each of the bills that I have sponsored. It was recommended by the Ford-Carter Commission, supported by the President, and has been perfected in this conference agreement. The commission will not micromanage the election process, but will instead serve as a tremendous resource for those across America who conduct elections.  This conference report will help make all elections more accurate, more accessible, and more honest, while respecting the primacy of States and localities in the administration of elections. For the first time ever, the Federal Government will invest significant resources to improve the process, roughly $3.9 billion. Every State will receive funds under this legislation, and the smaller States are guaranteed a share of the pot. The funds will be used by the States in a manner they determine best suits their needs, rather than the Federal Government prescribing a one-size-fits-all system. Whether it is by replacing a punchcard or a lever voting system or educating and training poll workers, States are provided the flexibility to address their specific needs.  The mantra of this legislation, coined by the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, has been to ``make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.'' We have achieved that balance in this conference agreement by setting standards for States to meet, standards which the Federal Government will pay 95 percent of the cost to implement. Voting systems will allow voters to verify their ballots and allow voters a second chance, if they make a mistake, while maintaining the sanctity of a private ballot.  Voting will become more accessible to people with disabilities, an issue admirably and vigorously championed by Senator Dodd. Provisional ballots will be provided to all Americans who show up at polling sites only to learn their names are not on the poll books. Such a voter's eligibility will be verified, however, prior to the counting of the ballot to ensure that those who are legally entitled to vote are able to do so and do so only once; again, making it easier to vote and harder to cheat.  To protect the integrity of every election, this conference report makes significant advancements in rooting out vote fraud. Congress has acted properly to curtail fraudulent voting and reduce duplicate registrations, both interstate--found to be more than 720,000 nationwide--and intrastate. The provisions of this bill are carefully drafted to address this impediment to fair and honest elections, and we provided the States with the means and the resources to address this problem.  First, States will establish secure, computerized Statewide voter registration databases that contain the name and information of each registered voter. The accuracy of the voter registration list is paramount to a fair and accurate election. The motor voter bill of 1993 has done grievous harm to the integrity of the system by junking up the voter rolls and making it extremely difficult to systematically ensure that only eligible voters are registered.  Second, every new registrant will be required to provide their driver's license number, if they have been issued one, or the last four digits of their Social Security number. If they have neither, the State will assign them a unique identifier. This information will be matched with the department of motor vehicles which will in turn match their data with the Social Security Administration. States which use the full nine-digit Social Security number for voter registration are given the option to avail themselves of this important new provision. Contrary to the assertions of some, the only thing this provision impedes is vote fraud.  Third, first-time voters who register by mail will have to confirm their identity at some point in the process by photo identification or other permissible identification. This provision was championed by Senator Bond, and its importance was once again highlighted just this past week in South Dakota where there is an ongoing joint Federal and State investigation of fraudulent voter registrations.  According to press reports in South Dakota, people are registering weeks after they have died, and one eager voter even completed 150 voter registration cards. Is that an enthusiastic voter or what?  The South Dakota Attorney General succinctly summed up the problem:       It's pretty easy to register under a false name, have the      registration confirmation sent back to your home, then send      in by mail an absentee ballot request, get it and vote under      the false name, send it back and get it counted.  Under this legislation, that is not going to be possible any longer. That is a step in the right direction for our democracy.  These three provisions will ensure that dogs such as Ritzy Mekler, Holly Briscoe, and other stars of ``Animal Planet'' will no longer be able to register and vote. These provisions will ensure that our dearly departed will finally achieve everlasting peace and will not be troubled with exercising their franchise every 2 years. And importantly, the provisions will ensure that voter rolls will be cleansed and protected against fraudulent and duplicate registrations.  This conference report also provides remedial safeguards for every American's franchise. The Department of Justice will continue its traditional role of enforcing Federal law. In addition, each State will design and establish a grievance procedure available to any voter who believes a violation of law has occurred. States are best equipped to promptly address the concerns of its voters, and I compliment Senator Dodd for his foresight on this issue.  This legislation also makes significant improvements to protect the votes of those who have committed themselves to protecting all Americans, and that is our men and women in uniform.  I have touched upon just a few of the highlights of this historic piece of legislation. After nearly 2 years of discussions, negotiations, introductions and reintroductions of election reform bills, we now stand ready to vote on the most important piece of legislation before Congress in many years.  I thank, again, Senator Dodd for his steadfast leadership. He committed 110 percent of himself to this issue and worked tirelessly to bring us to this day. I also thank Senator Bond for all of his work to protect the integrity of the election process. I also congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the Hill for their significant achievement: Congressman Bob Ney of Ohio, chairman of the conference, did a superb job; and our good friend Steny Hoyer, ranking member, who was outstanding as well.  And to the staff people involved in this, my own staff on the Rules Committee: Tam Somerville; I particularly commend Brian Lewis, who was there from beginning to end in this process--as far as I am concerned, this will be known as the Brian Lewis bill around my office--and his able right hand, Leon Sequeira, and Chris Moore and Hugh Farrish, all of the Rules Committee staff.  For Senator Bond, Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's staff were superb. And for Senator Dodd, Kennie Gill, Shawn Maher, Ronnie Gillespie, we enjoyed working with them, and they, too, should feel about good about this. From Congressman Ney's staff, Paul Vinovich, Chet Kalis, Roman Buhler, Pat Leahy--they have a staffer named Pat Leahy, how about that--and Matt Petersen. And from Congressman Hoyer's staff, Bob Cable, Keith Abouchar and Len Shambon.  This is indeed a happy day, not just for Senator Bond and myself, but forall Members of the Congress. This is a remarkable achievement we can all feel good about. We look forward to seeing it pass tomorrow by an overwhelming margin. I am sure the President at some point will want to sign this with appropriate flourish down at the White House.  Again, I thank my colleague from Connecticut and yield the floor.                             weekend voting
