Speaker, I always enjoy hearing from the gentleman. He is right that we are underspending the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but it is not a tax assessed individually on the American people as a sales tax. It is fees paid by the oil and gas industry, which you can say: Oh, they are having to pay a fee to use Federal land,to take and extract a resource. Therefore, it is not quite the same thing.
