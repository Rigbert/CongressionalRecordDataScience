Speaker, on November 24, 2003, the Senate passed unanimously S. 1947, the ``Preserving Independence of Financial Institution Examinations Act of 2003.'' This bipartisan legislation was introduced by Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, the Chairman and ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would update two provisions of the Federal Criminal Code enacted in the mid-1900s.  As the Nation's banking system has consolidated, it has become extremely difficult for bank examiners to obtain credit cards or mortgages for themselves because of these outdated provisions. This affects the hiring, retention, morale, and work of our Nation's bank examiners.  To alleviate this problem, the bill would amend sections 212 and 213 of title 18 of the United States Code to reflect the changes in our Nation's banking system. Under current law, these sections prohibit examiners from borrowing from banks they have examined, and prohibit a financial institution from extending credit to anyone who examines or has authority to examine that institution. These provisions have been interpreted to cover all kinds of borrowing, including standard credit cards and mortgages.  In a December 4, 2003, letter the Legal Division of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System explained that:     [under current law] . . . an examiner could commit a crime by      obtaining a department store credit card that is ultimately      issued by a bank the examiner examined five years ago.      Examiners also have encountered difficulty in obtaining home      mortgage and other loans at the best available rates because      of restrictions on the range of permissible lenders.  The proposed legislation updates the Criminal Code allowing for narrow exceptions to the statutes for bank examiners who hold credit cards and residential home mortgage loans on standard terms from the banks they are examining.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
