 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 3 p.m., Monday, September 15; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of S. 3001, the Defense authorization bill, with no motions to proceed in order during Monday's session. I further ask that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived and that the filing deadline for first-degree amendments be 4 p.m. Monday.
