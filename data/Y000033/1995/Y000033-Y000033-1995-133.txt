Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I commend my colleague for his tenacity on this issue. At every point in the reauthorization of this act, he has shown his commitment by continually pushing me and the members of the committee on this matter.  Mr. Chairman, in response to the specific questions of the gentleman from California, I assure the gentleman I will make it a priority of the committee to find a solution that will adquately protect those stocks not covered by a fishery management plan from overharvest.  Mr. Chairman, may I suggest to the gentleman this has been one of my goals. The gentleman is absolutely correct that many areas for other reasons have not had a fishing plan that would cover them, consequently I think they are being overfished and we will address this issue. Probably in conference, by the way.
