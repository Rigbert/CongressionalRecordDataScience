 President, today I am joining with Senator Max Baucus in introducing a bill that would make permanent the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance under Sec. 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 127 allows public or private employers to provide up to $5,250 per year to each of their employees in tax-free reimbursement for tuition, books and fees for job or non-job related education. Section 127 is a purely private-sector initiative and the one vehicle that encourages employer investment and assistance in providing educational assistance to its workers. There is no bureaucracy administering this program--it is run through the generosity of private sector employers who provide educational opportunities to their employees in the interest of raising workforce productivity and making their businesses more competitive. Like other types of benefits, Sec. 127 employer-provided educational assistance must be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis and may not favor highly-compensated employees.  The Revenue Act of 1978 created Sec. 127 and established employer-provided educational assistance as excludable for any type of course, other than a hobby or a sport. Prior to 1978, only specific ``job-related'' education was excludable from taxable income. The provision hasbeen extended numerous times since its inception. It is time for the exclusion to become permanent.  I commend the leadership of Senator Max Baucus for bringing this bill before the Senate and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. I hope the rest of our colleagues in the Senate will join in supporting the enactment of this bill.                                 ______                                       By
