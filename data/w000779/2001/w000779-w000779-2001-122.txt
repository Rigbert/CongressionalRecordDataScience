I really appreciate the Senator's explanation. I think the position the Senator has taken not only is correct, but it is very gutsy.  We all know this is a divisive issue in many quarters. I want the public to know the reason we have nailed down the protection for those various public entities, such as those California municipalities, is because Senator Boxer stood up for them. I want it understood that those FERC provisions, again, in the name of fairness, came about because the Senator helped us put that language together. I think when one looks consistently at who is out on the floor of the Senate standing up for the consumer, the Senator has shown that again and again. I think the spirit the Senator has shown in working with us on this issue is exactly what it is going to take to bring folks together in the Senate and on the west coast to really address this issue in a comprehensive way for the long term.  I thank the Senator and would be happy to yield to her for any other comments.
