President, I understand under the prior UC that the Senator from Vermont at some appropriate time--not now, the Senator from Maine has the floor--but the Senator from Vermont would be recognized for not to exceed 20 minutes on the landmines issue. I wonder if it would be appropriate--I see the distinguished chairman on the floor--that I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of the comments of the Senator from Maine that I be recognized for my time? If there is somebody else who wants it, I am perfectly willing to do a different time. I wonder if that would be satisfactory.
