Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding. I certainly associate myself with her remarks and am opposed to the amendment.  I would respond to an earlier remark made by the gentleman from Texas when he complained about the deficits. There are two sides to balancing the budget. There is the expenditure side, and I do think the debate taking place here is very healthy. I would hope that the gentleman would also have the same debate initiated as far as the 70 percent of the spending taking place. And that is mandatory spending. And those tax provisions, once they are a precedent to the Tax Code, inure to the benefit, the last time I look, of people that pay taxes, which are not units of the government, but private citizens and private corporations.
