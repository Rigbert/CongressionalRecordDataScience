 President, I am proud to join so many of my colleagues in submitting this important resolution, to proclaim the week of October 15, 1995 through October 21, 1995 as the ``Week Without Violence.''  As a mother and as a woman, I am deeply troubled about the epidemic of violence in our Nation. And I have devoted myself to doing all I can, as a Senator, to make our streets, our neighborhoods, and our homes safe for our children and families.  The numbers are shocking. But, often the real story gets lost in the statistics. Let us take a moment to reflect about what we mean when we say that violence is ever-present in our society. We are referring to senseless crimes committed among strangers; husbands physically and emotionally battering their wives; parents at the end of their ropes driven to abuse and neglect their own children; and young people with guns on the playground who have lost hope about their futures.  I believe that education and public awareness are some of our best tools in bringing about an end to violence in our country. And that is why this ``Week Without Violence'' is so important. We must lead by example, and send a message to all Americans that we are committed to ending the cycle of pain, hurt, and fear destroying America's families and society as a whole. We need to work together with our neighbors, and local and national groups to communicate loud and clear the message that ``violence is unacceptable, abuse is wrong, and it's got to stop.''  But, education is not enough. We must maintain the Federal Government's commitment to preventing and reducing violent crimes. I am pleased the Senate recently restored funding for the Violence Against Women Act, and I encourage my colleagues to continue to support important programs like VAWA which are critical to ensuring the safety of our citizens.  I also would like to commend the YWCA, the oldest womens' membership movement in the United States, for its ongoing efforts to resolve societal ills through nonviolent means, and for helping to reduce violence through prevention and education initiatives. And I also would like to recognize the invaluable services the YWCA provides to survivors of violence through job training programs, shelters, child care, and support groups for rape and assault victims.  Together, we can make our country a safer place to live and raise our families. This ``Week Without Violence'' is an important step in that direction, and I am proud of our commitment to creating a safer tomorrow for all Americans.                          ____________________
