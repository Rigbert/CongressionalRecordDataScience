President, I am pleased to join Senator Lugar today in supporting the passage of S. 178, which reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC]. The last authorization for appropriations for the CFTC expired in 1994. An authorization for appropriations through fiscal year 2000 is necessary to continue orderly funding of the Commission and support for its activities.  The CFTC is a small agency with an important mission--protecting the integrity and effective functioning of our Nation's futures markets. The volume of commodity futures and options contracts traded on the Nation's commodity exchanges exceeded half a billion transactions last year. Since 1974, the year Congress created the CFTC, trading on U.S. futures exchanges has increased by more than 1,500 percent. The pricing and hedging functions of these markets are vital to our economic well-being.  The last reauthorization of the agency occurred only 2 years ago with passage of the 1992 Futures Trading Practices Act [FTPA]. Passage of that bill was one of the outstanding achievements of the Agriculture Committee during my tenure as chairman. The FTPA was the toughest, proconsumer futures reform package in a generation.  The 1992 reforms are the right course for the CFTC and the exchanges to pursue. I am pleased that all witnesses and committee members agreed at the January 26 hearing that no changes to the FPTA are necessary at this time.  The Agriculture Committee will continue its careful oversight of the Commission and the exchanges. Compliance with the enhanced audit trail standard and developments in derivatives markets will receive my close attention.  I expect the exchanges and the CFTC to work diligently to complete the 1992 reforms on a timely basis. With the leadership of the Commission's new Chairman, Mary Schapiro, I am confident this will happen.  So the bill (S. 178) was deemed to have been read three times and passed, as follows:                                 S. 178       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``CFTC Reauthorization Act of      1995''.     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       Section 12(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.      16(d)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(d) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as      are necessary to carry out this Act for each of fiscal years      1995 through 2000.''.                          ____________________
