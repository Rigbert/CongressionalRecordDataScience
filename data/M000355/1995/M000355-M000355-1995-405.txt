 President, it should surprise none of her acquaintances that when Janie Catron retired from my office, her farewell statement was motivational as well as emotional. For those of us who have known and worked with Janie for years, her parting words were an affirmation of her remarkable drive and sense of purpose. For those whose association with her is relatively recent, it was a memorable primer on how to succeed through hard work.  Janie Catron was, officially, my eastern Kentucky field representative from the beginning of my first term in the Senate until her retirement this winter. But her official title did not do justice to the work she did. Janie was not just my representative in eastern Kentucky, she was the region's representative in my office. And she remains the staunchest advocate of that very special place. Anyone without a personal grounding in eastern Kentucky need only spend time with Janie to know that the people and the area are extraordinary.  I will not soon forget our travels over Appalachian mountain roads, the stunning vistas--notably unmarred by guardrails--framed by Janie's keen insight and observations as we drove to meet with constituents. Staffers, present and former, will long treasure the tours she arranged and the hospitality she and her husband, Frank, provided at their home in Corbin.  Janie fostered much of the cohesiveness which has made our office more than simply a collection of individuals. She has worked to instill a sense of shared purpose, responsibility, and loyalty. In fact, loyalty was the thrust of her farewell statement. It is a quality she has personified through deeds as well as words. It was never more evident than the day last November when she summoned the strength to speak through grief and deliver a stirring eulogy in the Mansfield Room during a memorial service for a member of our staff. In reflecting on this aspect of Janie, one could substitute the term ``love'' for loyalty because it is so clearly evident in her actions and achievements. Loyalty to and love of nation, state, party, family, friends and colleagues--a hallmark of Janie Catron and, if she has anything to say about it, qualities she will impart on others.  Born and reared in Pulaski County, KY Janie has stated that she was born a Democrat but changed her registration upon marrying a Republican. She has often said that she became a Republican by convenience and remained one out of conviction. As anyone who knew her would expect, however, Janie was not just a registered Republican--she was an outspoken, unabashed, active big-``R'' Republican. This was rather bold in a State where, until recently, Republican were an endangered species.  Mr. President, on March 11, Janie Catron will be duly recognized when she is inducted into the Fifth Congressional District Republican Hall of Fame. When she receives this honor at the Fifth District Lincoln Day Dinner she will joining other notables such as the legendary Kentucky Senator John Sherman Cooper and Congressman Tim Lee Carter. It is a distinction well-deserved.   I am honored to have been associated with Janie these many years. Her departure leaves a void in my office that probably never will be filled because, by force of her personality and energy, Janie created a niche. I am confident that I speak for my entire office when I say we miss her and wish her well in future endeavors.                          ____________________
