 President, I rise today to recognize John Engber for his 11 years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of Washington State. John served as my State Director during this time, and he was a critical part of my staff. On June 1, he ended his tenure in my office. We were sad to see him go, but we wish him all the best in his next endeavor.  John was a thoughtful and dedicated public servant. As my State Director, he helped ensure that even though Washington State residents are 2,500 miles from DC, their needs are up-front and center. Overseeing my State operations, he was responsible for listening to the people in our communities and for connecting them to the Senate and the Federal Government. And thanks to his hard work, residents of towns from Forks to Clarkston have access to me and my office.  One of John's greatest accomplishments during his time with my office was his help in drafting the recently enacted Wild Sky Wilderness law. John worked closely with local leaders, the environmental community, outdoor enthusiasts, and others to create a wilderness proposal built on community consensus. We faced some tremendous obstacles over the 9 years that we worked on the bill, but John helped us all remain dedicated to the goal of preserving Wild Sky for future generations.  Finally, I would like to thank John for his years of service to me and the people of Washington State. His leadership and his dedication are truly appreciated, and I know that he will always have Washington State's interests at heart. I wish him happiness and success as he moves on to the next phase of his career.                          ____________________
