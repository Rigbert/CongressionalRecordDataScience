Iowa does grow more corn, but we grow more soybeans. I make that clear now.  I support this bill. This bill is introduced by Senator Allen and cosponsored by many of my colleagues, and I am sure it will pass with flying colors. It is a great bill that seeks to address the technology gap that exists at many minority-serving institutions across America. I commend Senator Allen for his leadership on this bill. I am sure that it is going to make a difference.  I also take the floor to acknowledge a man who is not here today. His name is Max Cleland. Max Cleland, during the 107th Congress, introduced S. 414, the Digital Network Technology Program Act.
