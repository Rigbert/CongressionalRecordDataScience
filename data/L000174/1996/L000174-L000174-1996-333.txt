President, I support the mission of AmeriCorps. I believe that engaging Americans of all ages to help communities solve their own problems is a worthy goal.  One of the greatest threats facing our cities and towns today is the loss of a sense of community responsibility. AmeriCorps invites Americans to put something back into their communities--to reestablish the local ties that have been so important to this country.  I am very concerned about the provision in this omnibus appropriations bill which terminates AmeriCorps grants through Federal agencies. Right now, about half of AmeriCorps participants in my home State run through the USDA AmeriCorps Program. This includes the Vermont Anti-Hunger Corps and a rural development team. These projects have involved nonprofit groups, and a unique partnership of Federal, State, and local organizations. All of which have contributed to their success.  I want to clarify with the Chairman that this language would not preclude these local programs currently funded through Federal agencies to continue through national direct grants or through State commissions.
