 Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman: the bill which you just indicated would be on the floor next week and you asked for amendments to be filed in a timely fashion is a very important bill. It came out, as you pointed out, with overwhelming bipartisan support. I think you said 65-7. Since that time, it is my understanding that there has been some change in the bill. In particular, I refer to the provision which deals with the ability of those who may receive dollars under the provisions of the bill for the purposes of constructing affordable housing, that if they receive Federal funds that they will be unable to thereafter participate in encouraging voter registration drives or getting more people on the rolls to vote. That is something that I think the whole House ought to address.  I believe the ranking member is going to ask that that be struck from the bill so that there not be a preclusion on voter registration drives or participation. The Catholic Conference is very concerned about that. I would presume a number of faith-based organizations are very concerned about that provision. I may have a discussion briefly with the acting majority leader on that issue as well.  But can the gentleman tell me whether or not he believes the Rules Committee will allow the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) to offer an amendment which would put the bill back in the position which 65 people in the committee supported at the time it was reported out.  I thank my colleague for yielding and would ask him if he can give us some thought on that issue, which we feel very strongly about, and hope that that amendment can be protected and made in order by the committee and that we will have a full and fair debate on the floor of the House with reference to that amendment.
