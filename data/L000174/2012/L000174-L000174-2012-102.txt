I have discussed with them that I am not bringing up an amendment at this point. But let me talk about an amendment that I will bring up and expect to pass at some point.  The amendment I will call up at some appropriate point is legislation I have been trying to get enacted for more than 3 years called the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act. This legislation improves the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, which is the Federal death and disability program for our Nation's first responders who are killed or disabled in the line of duty.  Just so Senators will know, an earlier version of this legislation was adopted here on the Senate floor by voice vote in December 2011. The Presiding Officer will recall it was almost exactly a year ago when we brought that up. It was adopted as part of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. During the course of conference negotiations related to the FAA legislation, the House Judiciary chairman Lamar Smith and I negotiated additional measures to be added to the legislation. Our work together produced a package of improvements that contains a modest expansion of benefits for deserving emergency medical responders, and a host of reforms to make the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program stronger, more effective, and more cost efficient.  The legislation has become one of the cornerstones of the partnership we have between the Federal Government and our first responders and will make that partnership even stronger. In fact, the reforms Chairman Smith and I developed in consultation with the Department of Justice and the first responder community completely offset and eliminate an estimated modest increase in spending.  Unfortunately, at that time, due to an error made by the Congressional Budget Office, the matter was dropped from the FAA conference report. The CBO, to their credit, later corrected their error, and provided an official cost estimate which makes clear this legislation will result in no new Federal spending. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate     June 22, 2012.  H.R. 4018--Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvements Act of 2012     As ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary          on June 6, 2012       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4018 would have no      significant cost to the federal government. Enacting the bill      could affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go      procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any effects      would be insignificant for each year. The legislation would      not affect revenues.       Under current law, the families of public safety officers      who have died as a result of injuries sustained in the line      of duty are eligible for a one-time payment of about      $320,000. Public safety officers who have been permanently      disabled are eligible for the same payment, but this payment      is subject to the availability of appropriated funds.       This legislation would make members of rescue squads or      ambulance crews operated by nonprofit entities eligible for      benefits paid when public safety officers are permanently      disabled or die as a result of injuries sustained in the line      of duty. H.R. 4018 also would narrow the eligibility of      members of rescue squads or ambulance crews for benefits      under the Public Safety Officers' Benefit (PSOB) program; as      a result, some individuals would no longer receive benefits      that they could receive under current law. The bill would      prevent individuals from receiving certain benefits under the      program if they receive payments from the September 11th      Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. In addition, the proposed      legislation would make many technical and administrative      changes that aim to expedite the processing of claims for      benefits.       Based on the number of fatalities of members of nonprofit      rescue squads or ambulance crews in recent years, CBO expects      that, on average, a few persons each year would be affected      by the proposed legislation and that additional payments from      the PSOB program would be made. CBO estimates that those      payments would total $13 million over the 2013-2022 period.      However, based on information from the Department of Justice,      we expect that those costs would be offset by savings from      other provisions of the bill that would result in fewer      persons receiving PSOB payments than will receive them under      current law. As a result, CBO estimates that enacting the      legislation would have no significant net effect on direct      spending or discretionary spending from the PSOB program.       H.R. 4018 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz.      The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.
