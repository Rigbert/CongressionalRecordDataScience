 I think what people throughout this country should appreciate is that very often when the President, any President, when the leaders of Congress want to get something done that benefits the [[Page H387]] wealthiest 1 or 2 percent and puts it to the average American, what they do is move very, very quickly, because their feeling is that the less information the average American has about the situation, the better they are able to pull off the swindle. I think that is exactly what we are seeing right now.  It is astounding to me that when some of us say, ``Let us do something about 5 million children in America who are hungry, provide help to them,'' there is never a sense of urgency. But when we talk about changing our trade policies so that we do not encourage American corporations to take our jobs to China or to Mexico or to poor Third World countries, there is never a sense of urgency. But suddenly, boy, are things flying around here--$40 billion, even in Washington, DC, is a lot of money.  Loan guarantees of $40 billion can rebuild communities from one end of America to the other, could put millions of American people back to work at decent wages.  Suddenly, however, for some reason, that discussion never takes place here. But now, because Wall Street and the investment houses want to make sure they are not going to lose any money on their Mexican investments, wham, like a bullet, is that process flying through here.
