Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of House Rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to present a question of privilege to the House. The form of the resolution is as follows and relates to maintaining antidumping and countervailing measures as relates to our trade laws. It calls on the President to abstain from renegotiating international agreements governing antidumping and countervailing measures.       We know the World Trade Organization is about to meet in      Seattle, and whereas under Article I, Section 8 of the      Constitution, the Congress has the power and responsibility      with regard to foreign commerce and the conduct of      international trade negotiations;       Whereas the House of Representatives is deeply concerned      that in connection with the World Trade Organization      ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle, Washington, later      this month, and the multilateral trade negotiations expected      to follow, a few countries are seeking to circumvent the      agreed list of negotiation topics and reopen the debate over      the World Trade Organization's antidumping and anti subsidy      rules;       Whereas the Congress has not approved new negotiations on      antidumping or antisubsidy rules and we have clearly, but so      far informally, signalled opposition to such negotiations;       Whereas strong antidumping and antisubsidy rules are a      cornerstone of the liberal trade policy of the United States      and are essential to the health of the manufacturing and farm      sectors here in our country;       And whereas it has long been and remains the policy of the      United States to support antidumping and antisubsidy laws and      to defend those laws in international negotiations;       Whereas the current absence of official negotiating      objectives on the statute books must not be allowed to      undermine the Congress' constitutional role in charting the      direction of U.S. trade policy;       Whereas, under present circumstances, launching a      negotiation that includes antidumping and antisubsidy issues      would affect the rights of the House and the integrity of its      proceedings;       Whereas the WTO antidumping and antisubsidy rules concluded      in the Uruguay Round have scarcely been tested since they      entered into effect and certainly have not proven effective      in view of our trade deficit;       Whereas opening these rules to renegotiation could only      lead to weakening them, which would in turn lead to even      greater abuse of the world's open markets, particularly that      of the United States, which has become the greatest dump      market in the world;       Whereas conversely, avoiding another decisive fight over      these rules is the best way to promote progress on the other      far more important issues facing the World Trade Organization      Members;       Whereas it is therefore essential that negotiations on      these antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened      under the auspices of the World Trade Organization or      otherwise:       Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of      Representatives calls upon the President (1) not to      participate in any international negotiation in which      antidumping or antisubsidy rules are part of the negotiating      agenda; (2) to refrain from submitting for Congressional      approval agreements that require changes to the current      antidumping and countervailing duty laws and enforcement      policies of the United States; and (3) also calls upon the      President to enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty      laws vigorously in all pending and future cases.
