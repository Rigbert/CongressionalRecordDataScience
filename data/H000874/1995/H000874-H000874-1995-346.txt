Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  I am not going to comment on the courthouse in Tennessee that was in this bill under my chairmanship. I know the gentleman from Tennessee would not want to talk about that pork.  This was a Reagan-Bush initiative. It was an initiative to save money, to consolidate, to cut lease costs, as the gentleman says, to buy a new car that is not costing you a lot of money, that you own, not lease.  The Gilchrest amendment speaks to the substance of making sure the authorizing committee controlled by the majority party, the Republicans, makes a determination that this building is a correct initiative, and what the Gilchrest amendment says is that no money is going to be spent unless a prospectus is approved.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, you ought not strike this money, because if you do, the Taxpayers Union, the Citizens Against Waste, and all of those groups are going to end up seeing that this is going to cost the taxpayers they allegedly are trying to protect more money out of their pockets.  The reason the Reagan and Bush Administrations, under whom the FDA, by the way, did all of these awful things, suggested this was to save money, make it more efficient. If you eliminate it, fine, we do not build the building, because the committee will not approve the prospectus.  Vote for the Gilchrest amendment. It makes sense for the taxpayer, and it makes sense for good government and the safety of the American public.
