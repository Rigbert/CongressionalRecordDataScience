 President, I thank my friend, the majority leader.  Today is indeed a day to celebrate the life and extraordinary service to our country of our friend, Senator Dan Inouye. I will have more to say about that later, but what a remarkable individual he was. It has been our privilege to have the opportunity to get to know him and observe his great work for a very long time.  I thank my friend, the majority leader.                          ____________________
