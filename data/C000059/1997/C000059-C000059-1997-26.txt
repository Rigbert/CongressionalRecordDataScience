Chairman, although the manufactured housing program is largely financed through industry-funded label fees and currently has a surplus of $7.5 million, there are significant staffing shortfalls in the Manufactured Housing and Standards Division in the Department of Housing andUrban Development. Currently there are only 10 professional and 3 clerical staff administering the entire program, compared with the staffing level of 35 in 1984 when production levels were significantly lower.  Even though these personnel costs are primarily funded by the manufactured housing industry, and there are more than enough funds to pay for some reasonable personnel additions, program staffing levels are subject to overall HUD and OMB salary and expense caps.
