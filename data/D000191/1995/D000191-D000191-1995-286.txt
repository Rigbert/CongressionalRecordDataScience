Speaker, it states, ``Questions of privilege shall arise whenever the rights of the House collectively are affected,'' and, further to the point, ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''  The issue is whether or not the authority previously extended by the House in a 1933 statute has been exceeded, and if it has been exceeded, then certainly the House is collectively affected, and most certainly we see a violation of section 9, article I of the Constitution.  Further, as the Speaker knows, appropriations are to originate in the House. In this instance we are dealing with large sums of money to be drawn on the U.S. Treasury which have not been appropriated by this House. So we feel that it is essential that the House assert its prerogative.  To tell the truth, Mr. Speaker, I do not believe we can come to a final and dispositive determination whether or not there is a violation of the constitutional prerogatives of the House unless we have these questions answered, and unless the resolution goes forward they will not be answered.
