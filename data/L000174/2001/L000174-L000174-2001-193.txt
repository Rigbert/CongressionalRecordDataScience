And of course our friendship, of nearly a generation now, I value as much as any friendship in this body. It is interesting, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada knows that last week when a number of buildings were being closed down and all, I had several members of the other party come to me and tell me privately: I assume, of course, you won't have an executive meeting and pass out judges; you certainly aren't going to be able to have any hearings on judges.  In fact, some of them were saying they not only assumed that, they hoped I wouldn't because they wanted to get out of town.  The Senator from Nevada told me one of President Bush's nominees had made a 3,000 mile trip here and is there some way we could hold the hearing for this Republican judge, having made the trip. Of course, I had the hearing. Of course, we met. In fact, we had a picture in one of the papers showing we had about 100-some-odd people crowded into the President's room and a couple other people crowded into Senator Byrd's Appropriations committee room to have both of the hearings. We voted out about 20 nominees between U.S. attorneys and judges. And then we had a hearing on four or five more judges that afternoon, even including one from a State where the Republican Senator didn't bother to show up.
