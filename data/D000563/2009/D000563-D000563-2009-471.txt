' We have to move toward a new mindset that health insurance companies don't think about--wellness and prevention. If we put a little money into those, we can keep people healthier and keep costs down.  I am sure the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from New Mexico will recall the visit we had from the CEO of a major grocery store chain--Safeway/Dominix--and how they decided for their management to try to do preventive care. I recall the CEO telling us that because of preventive care, they have been able to keep their health insurance, which is a self-insured plan, even for 3 straight years without increases.  So prevention and wellness not only keep people healthier but reduce cost. But if you were trying to drive the bottom line and just said no to people who need a colonoscopy or need a mammogram or prostate cancer treatment, diabetes maintenance--if you are saying no to all of those things and those people--the ultimate cost in human life and in dollars goes through the roof.
