President, next week I will join many Vermonters to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Burlington Police Department, which was established in early 1865 with the appointment of the city's first constable, Luman A. Drew. For the sake of historical perspective: Mr. Drew was chosen for this high post after his service in the pursuit and capture of a group of Confederate cavalrymen who had raided nearby St. Albans, robbing its banks and burning its buildings before fleeing toward Canada.  For many months now, Burlington Detective Jeffrey Beerworth has been compiling that bit of history and other stories in his research of the department's history, and his vignettes are both entertaining and informative. They are particularly interesting to me, as I reflect on my work as a prosecutor with law enforcement agencies in Burlington and other communities as State's attorney for Chittenden County earlier in my career. Most importantly, they show us how the role of law enforcement officers has evolved over the years. I imagine that First Constable Drew could not have foreseen police wearing body cameras in 2015, nor would he recognize the challenges that heroin and other drugs pose to our society. Back in his day, First Constable Drew's main concerns were horse theft and public drunkenness.  A visit to the Burlington Police Department website today offers a glimpse of the many investigative units, programs and community outreach services that fall under today's rubric of police work. I am proud of the efforts of Police Chief Michael Schirling and his team in connecting one-on-one with the residents of Burlington. Community policing is alive and well in Vermont's largest city, and other departments around the country could learn much from what Burlington has done. The Junior Community Police Academy creates relationships among police officers and the city's youths, who someday may become officers themselves. In partnering with the Howard Center, officers work with the Street Outreach Team to support those with psychiatric and substance abuse issues, or those who cope with homelessness or other behavioral challenges. These cases traditionally account for a large percentage of police calls, yet this innovative program allows for trained professionals to address social service needs and allow police officers to focus on public safety.  The Daily Activity Log of the Burlington Police Department offers a glimpse of the range and volume of calls to which today's officers must respond. In a recent 2-day period, 223 records were logged, ranging from the minor to the tragic. Of course, there are many that are recorded simply as ``traffic stops,'' but we know that every traffic stop has the potential for the unknown. That is why I have worked hard over many years to support these officers by providing Federal funds for bulletproof vests. Officers need this protection and deserve nothing less.  Chief Schirling has laid out a series of upcoming events to mark the department's 150 years of service. These will include a community barbecue and open house, along with his monthly ``Coffees with the Chief.'' This is all in keeping with his vision of community policing, and this celebration will be shared by all who benefit from the work of a highly professional and dedicated police force.  On this historic occasion, I thank Chief Schirling and the entire Burlington Police Department for their continued service and dedication, upholding a long and valued tradition. The Queen City is most fortunate for their service.                          ____________________
