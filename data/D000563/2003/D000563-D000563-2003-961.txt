But let us argue for a moment that it is the case. Let's say, forget whether or not it is a questionable position. Let's assume it is right; that is, what you say is correct. Under the law, the client can always waive the privilege. If I have hired an attorney to represent me, and that attorney has written legal memoranda inserting a point of law, and then someone asks for that legal memoranda, that client or the attorney says, sorry my client, Durbin, hasn't given a waiver of this privilege, this is privileged communication between the attorney and client, but I, the attorney, say, will you waive that privilege, will you disclose it, and if I say, yes, I affirmatively waive the privilege, at that point it becomes public.  The obvious question here is, Who was Miguel Estrada's client when these legal memoranda were written? His client was the Department of Justice. His client was the White House. His client was, in fact, the group that has now nominated him to this DC Circuit Court.  And so here you have a curious situation. Miguel Estrada says, I would love to let you see this, but my client won't allow me and won't waive the privilege, and, therefore, I can't.  The client--the White House--is saying, go ahead and approve this man. There is nothing to worry about. But we will not let you see what he has written. He was our attorney. He wrote for us. We will not let you see what he has written.  Would that raise a question in the Senator's mind, in all honesty and good faith? If the Department of Justice won't waive this privilege so we can read these documents, does it raise a question in the Senator's mind as to whether there is something in there that bothers them and worries them?
