President, with this nomination, I note we have confirmed more in this session of the Senate--of President Bush's judges--than the total number of judicial nominations the Republicans confirmed in all of 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2006. I thought I would mention that.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
