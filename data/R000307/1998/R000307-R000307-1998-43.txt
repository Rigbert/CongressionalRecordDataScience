President, I rise today to congratulate the Men and Women of the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. The crew at the 22d won recognition as the top KC-135 maintenance team in the world at a recent competition known as the Air Mobility Rodeo. This is an event sponsored by the Air Mobility Command. It is an accomplishment that requires skill, training, leadership, teamwork, pride, professionalism and unselfish dedication to the task at hand. I take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge their great success and professionalism.  The Air Mobility Rodeo is a binannual, multinational event that is designed to develop and improve techniques and procedures that enhance air mobility operations--something that is very crucial in today's world. In this year's competition at McCord Air Force Base, the participants included more than 2,500 competitors formed in 80 teams from over 300 active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve command, Air National Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and other Allied Nations. Winning this award is an important event worthy of real recognition. What also makes this such an important win is that for the 22d, it is a repeat win for this team. They walked away with the prize in the 1996 competition as well. And this leads me to say there is no question that the KC-135 aircraft at McConnell are the best maintained in the world.  Let me acknowledge the leadership at Team McConnell because without their leadership and guidance, the atmosphere at McConnell would never support the effort required to win this competition. The two key players are the Wing Commander, Col. Michael C. Gould, and the Senior Enlisted Advisor, Chief Master Sergeant Herbert V. Williams, Jr. Anyone who has been around the military understands how much the senior leadership of an organization sets the tone for the entire command.  There is one other member of the team whose contribution I want to recognize. That member is Lead Crew Chief, Sergeant Jeffery Gass. He was singled out for special recognition and was selected as Air Mobility Command's Crew Chief of the year.  It is men and women such as Sgt. Gass who make our military the most successful in the world. They are the unsung heroes--quietly working in the background, exceptionally professional, dedicated to their service and their nation, and serving the communities where they are stationed. The award nomination for Sgt. Gass is testimony to his unselfish dedication, his professional knowledge, and his service to his country and the local community.  I am particularly proud to recognize this team from McConnell Air Force Base and Sgt. Gass not only because they contribute so much to the defense of our nation but because they contribute so much to Wichita and Kansas. Well done to the 22nd Air Refueling Wing and well done to Sgt. Gass.                          ____________________
