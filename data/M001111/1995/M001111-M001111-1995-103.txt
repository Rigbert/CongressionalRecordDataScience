 President, this Sunday, July 30 marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Medicare Program. As this 30th anniversary approaches, it is important for us to reflect on the reasons this program was enacted, and its successes.  President Truman offered several proposals to Congress, and President Kennedy made health care for seniors an issue in his 1960 campaign. Over and over again, Democrats attempted to pass Medicare legislation. Over and over again, Republicans voted overwhelmingly to defeat it. In 1965, despite a record-setting barrage of advertisements by the American Medical Association and many doctors' threats to boycott elderly patients, President Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law on July 30, 1965. Even then, a majority of Republicans voted against it.  The Medicare Program is an important contract the U.S. Government has made with senior citizens. It is a lifeline for our Nation's elderly. It seems as though times have not changed--Republicans are still fighting against the Medicare Program. The same arguments are being used. And, Democrats are still fighting for seniors, and fighting to strengthen the program.  During this year's budget debate, Democrats tried to put money back into the Medicare Program by eliminating the tax breaks in the budget. We were defeated, time and time again.  I have heard rumors of a Republican plan to save Medicare. I have not seen an official copy of this plan, and this is worrisome. The Senate will be expected to act on the budget reconciliation plan by September 22, which is less than 18 legislative days away. How can we possibly ask our constituents to accept a plan that we have not even debated yet? From the little I have heard, this secret plan relies heavily on a voucher system, which will encourage seniors to buy the least costly health plan. This means losing their family doctor in many instances. If a senior chooses to stay in their current health plan, they will pay more--as high as $1,000 more in premiums, copayments and deductibles.  Seniors simply cannot afford these additional expenses. The average senior citizen makes only $25,000 a year. How can we expect them to pay more, while we give out tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans.  I realize the Medicare system of yesterday does not meet the needs of the Medicare population today. It needs improvement. It needs reform. But simply forcing seniors into HMO's and cutting benefits to seniors is not the answer.  Seniors will pay more for less. Our aging population is growing, and growing faster than the money put into the Medicare system in the Republican budget. I worry about the families that have elderly parents, like I do. This so-called sandwich generation takes care of their own children and their elderly parents at the same time. They will feel the pain as their parents are unable to pay for their health care. The middle class will feel the squeeze.  My question is this: What will this secret plan the Republicans are proposing do to the seniors of this country? Why will they not make the details public?  As we near the 30th anniversary of Medicare, let us fix what is broken in the system. Let us get rid of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the system. And let us be honest and sincere with the American people. They understand sacrifice. What they do not understand is secret tactics, and bearing an undue portion of that sacrifice. We need to give some hope back to middle-income, working families in this Nation. Let us strengthen the program our predecessors rightly worked so hard for.                          ____________________
