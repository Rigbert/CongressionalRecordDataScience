Speaker, I rise today to submit the following article for the Record.        Comment: Ukraine-U.S. Relations Hinge on Fall Elections        (By Richard Holbrooke, Jan Kalicki and Mark Brzezinski)       Sept. 27.--Americans are increasingly focused on our      pivotal presidential choice on Nov. 2. But many may not be      aware that partway around the world, at the doorstep of an      expanded Europe, the citizens of Ukraine will be making an      important choice in their Oct. 31 elections for president.       Ukrainians will decide whether a pro-Western reformer,      Viktor Yushchenko, or a pro-Russian statist, Viktor      Yanukovich, will be elected. That choice is theirs and theirs      alone to make. But friends of Ukraine can certainly express      concern about issues at stake. The first issue is the freedom      and fairness of the election process--to ensure that the      power of the incumbent president, who cannot run again, is      not mobilized to suppress open debate and unfettered choice.      There is reason for concern, because oligarchic interests      will likely try to stack the political deck, and to protect      ill-gotten gains from past and pending privatizations.       The second issue affects the United States even more      directly, for Ukrainians will decide whether to support those      who favor integration into NATO and the European Union, or      those who favor realignment with Russia and Belarus, the      latter already under the sway of an unsavory dictator.       After meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last      month, Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma amended his      government's national security doctrine to turn away from      NATO and the EU. The impact was felt immediately: Instead of      continuing to plan to transport Caspian oil from the Black      Sea to central Europe and eventually the Baltic, Kuchma now      plans to transport Russian oil to the Black Sea and further      congest the environmentally sensitive Turkish Straits.       Both the EU and the Turkish government have expressed deep      concern about this development. But the Bush administration      has been largely silent.       Our European and Turkish allies recognize the stakes. Will      a country of 48 million people, almost the size of Texas,      have the opportunity to pursue a common destiny with its      neighbors to the north and west? Or will Ukraine take a      course in which new lines could be drawn across post-Cold      War Europe? Will energy flows continue to be subject to      control by Russian monopolies, or will they reach markets      competitively and support the freedom of Ukraine and the      Caspian states?       Strategically located between a newly assertive Russia and      an expanded NATO and EU, Ukraine can be a bridge to increased      cooperation between these two realms. Or it can create new      grounds for division. What remains to be seen is whether this      pivotal European country will take the path of reform or the      path of increased state control. This decision will impact a      similar drama being played out between reformers and statists      across the vast expanse of Russia itself. The most important      interest here is to create durable political, economic and      security ties engaging the Euro-Atlantic community with both      Russia and Ukraine.       Americans can make clear where we stand: with those in      Ukraine supporting free and democratic choice. With our      European allies, we can make clear that EU and NATO doors are      open if Ukrainians choose the path of integration and reform.      But this brings us back to our own elections in November.      There is one candidate who believes in democratic action,      rather than ideology, and favors making common cause with our      allies. There is another who has failed to do so, to the      great detriment of America's vital national security      interests. The stakes in the United States, as in Ukraine,      could not be higher.                          ____________________
