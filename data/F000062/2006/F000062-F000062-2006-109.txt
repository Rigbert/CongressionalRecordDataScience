 President, if I might, I thank the chairman, my friend, the Senator from Texas. We usually have a very easy time with this bill. There are usually not many amendments to this bill. But perhaps because this is the first vehicle to move a number of items, they seemed to come up this afternoon. I think the chairman has shown great leadership and flexibility. Sometimes they go together and sometimes they do not, but she has possessed both today.  I am very grateful, and the Democratic side is very grateful for it as well. This is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It takes good care of veterans. It eliminates the problem of financing that we had last year. Overall, it is an excellent bill. I am very proud to have worked with the chairman. I thank her.  I thank the majority staff. And, of course, I thank my staff, of which Christina Evans is sitting on my left, and B.G. Wright and Chad Schulken back in the box.  It has been a good day. At least we have accomplished a substantial bill.  I yield the floor.
