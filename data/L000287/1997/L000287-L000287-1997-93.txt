Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago the Democrats were doing the heavy lifting to help hard-working families. The Family and Medical Leave Act, to help working parents, was law by February. The Motor-Voter Act, to bring more Americans into the democratic process, was law by May.  But now what are we doing? Nothing. We are not meeting, we are not working, we are not voting.  There is no excuse. There is work to be done. Too many of our young people cannot afford a college education. Too many children are dropping out of school. Ten million kids have no health insurance. In fact, while this Congress has done nothing, more than 300,000 children lost their health insurance.  Mr. Speaker, show us a bill on education, show us a bill on children health, show us a bill on campaign finance.  Where is the leadership? Where is the action? Where is the vision? Where is the beef? It is time to act, it is time to lead.                          ____________________
