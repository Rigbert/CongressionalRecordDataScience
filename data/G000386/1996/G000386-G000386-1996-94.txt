 Out of the defense control we only had one instance where the material did not get there--only one instance.  I think the statement by the Senator from Alaska was questioning the reliability of foreign-owned flag ships and foreign crews, but they delivered. Only one did not deliver. U.S.-flag components, total, 17. The rest out of the 500 that made it into the zone were foreign.  I have heard my colleague state U.S. flags charged less than foreign flags during the Persian Gulf war.  I want to provide my colleagues with what the Department of the Navy reported to me on the cost of charter vessels:       The cost of foreign voyage chartered ships is approximately      60 percent of U.S.-flag voyage charters.  The Navy said:       Only 41 of 283 vessels were U.S. flag.  My amendment does not prohibit transfers of smaller feeder vessels to deliver war materiel in the war zone. My amendment simply says that these smaller feeders must be U.S. flag and U.S. crewed, not foreign flag. This is what we are led to believe this bill is all about. We are led to believe that if this bill passes, only U.S. flags and crews will deliver our goods into the war zone. Without my amendment, this will not be guaranteed. My amendment says U.S. flag and U.S. crews will deliver our goods into the war zone. This is what Senator Lott--and I quoted him twice--said 2 months ago that we need to assure.  I think it is appropriate at this point to repeat a section of a letter that I got from Vice Adm. George P. Steele, U.S. Navy, retired. He was one of those who had his name on the original National Security Council memo in support of this legislation. Then when I sent him a lot of material to study, he sent me back a very nice letter.  The last paragraph reads:       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for      only that part of a U.S. merchant marine that is configured      in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense      requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of Federal      programs mostly designed to line the pockets of unions,      owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly      inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start; not      a continuing jobs program.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record two pages detailing the cost of cargo preference as determined by the Office of Management and Budget.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         CARGO PREFERENCE PROGRAM COSTS                                                                                       [Millions of dollars]                                             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              1994                      1995                      1996                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Obligations    Outlays    Obligations    Outlays    Obligations    Outlays  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Agency:                                                                                                             Department of Agriculture.....          113          132           74           74           79           79    Department of Transportation--                                                                                   Maritime Administration......           50           50           61           61           43           43    Department of Defense.........          450          450          436          436          462          462    Agency for International                                                                                         Development..................           11           11            4            4            4            4    Export--Import Bank of the                                                                                       U.S..........................            4            3            5            3            8            4    Department of State \1\.......  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Total.......................          628          646          580          578          596          592----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Estimate for costs related to transportation of preference cargo is less than $2 million.
