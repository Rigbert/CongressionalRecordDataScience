 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Kathryn Tucker Windham, who passed away in her home on Sunday, June 12, 2011, at the age of 93. Kathryn was a renowned storyteller for whom I had deep respect. She enjoyed an accomplished career as an author, playwright, photographer and journalist. Kathryn also demonstrated a fierce dedication to her community. I mourn her passing.  Born on June 2, 1918, Kathryn spent the majority of her childhood in Thomasville, AL, where she also began her career in writing and photography. She graduated from Huntingdon College in Montgomery and remained supportive of her alma mater for the duration of her long and successful career.  Kathryn's trailblazing accomplishments include publishing many well-loved ghost stories and autobiographical memories as well as three cookbooks. She was also recognized as the first woman journalist in the South to cover a police beat at a major daily newspaper, and she had stints at the Alabama Journal, the Birmingham News, the Selma Times-Journal, the Area Agency on Aging and WUAL radio. Kathryn also wrote several plays, including a one-woman show that she, herself, performed. She was also a contributor to NPR's ``All Things Considered'' and a regular at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, Tennessee. Always giving back to her community, Kathryn founded the Alabama Tale-Tellin' Festival, which takes place each year in Selma.  Kathryn's achievements garnered recognition, both in the State of Alabama and nationally. She received the Alabama Humanities Foundation's Alabama Humanities Award, the University of Alabama's Society of Fine Arts' Alabama Arts Award, the National Storytelling Association's Circle of Excellence Award and Lifetime Achievement Award as well as numerous other distinguished awards and honors throughout her lifetime. Additionally, the Alabama Southern Community College in Thomasville opened the Kathryn Tucker Windham Museum in her honor.  I am honored to have known Kathryn and to have enjoyed her great works of literature and journalism. She was truly an inspiration to her community, the literary world, and the nation. Her legacy will forever be preserved through her timeless stories. My thoughts and prayers are with her friends and family, especially her children, Dilcy Hilley and Ben Windham, as they mourn the loss of this gracious and wonderful woman.  Kathryn cleared a path for women writers and journalists to follow after her and should be revered for her bravery, stamina and grace. Her life's contributions to the State of Alabama will forever be remembered.                          ____________________
