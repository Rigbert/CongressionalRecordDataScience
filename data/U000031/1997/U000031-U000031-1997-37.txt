Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas, Mr. Barton, and the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, as well for their fine work to get this bill on the floor today for a vote.  For my colleagues I have to say that this bill is much along the lines of the Castle-Upton-Martini approach that was adopted in the last Congress and was supported in fact by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget as well as the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. I am proud to be labeled as the deficit hawk because I know that deficits are harmful to our economic growth and our future prosperity. All of us in this body are heartened by the recent news that the deficit in fact is coming down. Who would have guessed the deficit this year could have been as low perhaps as $50 billion?  I once worked at the Office of Management and Budget. I watched a Congress that back in the 1980's promised to cut taxes and cut spending.
