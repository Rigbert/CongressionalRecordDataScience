President, we have heard a lot about the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, and on this session after Veterans Day I wish to talk about another 1 percent, the 1 percent who have volunteered to defend us. I want to say a few words about veterans in earlier wars. Thirty years ago, thousands of veterans of the Vietnam war came home. They gave themselves a homecoming parade that they deserved but almost none had ever received. The Presiding Officer here from Virginia, I know as a Senator and as an ace Vietnam veteran, knows of what I speak.  With wounded veterans in wheelchairs leading the parade, they marched up Constitution Avenue to dedicate the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on whose polished granite walls were etched the names of nearly 58,000 dead and missing comrades-in-arms.  Here is a photograph that was taken that day. This is Joseph Ambrose of Joliet, IL. Mr. Ambrose was 86 years old then. He is wearing the same uniform he wore as a 19-year-old U.S. Army private in France in World War I. In his arms he carries a flag, the flag that covered the coffin of his son who gave his life for our country in Korea.  Joseph Ambrose wore his old Army ``doughboy'' uniform and carried his son's flag often to Veterans Day parades and VFW conventions. He confessed that some years he had to go on a crash diet to get back into the uniform, but he did it to honor the veterans of Vietnam and Korean wars that he believed Americans needed to remember, and he wanted to remind us of an important truth, that no matter the outcome of the war, those who answer the call of duty and risk everything to defend our country deserve the respect of a grateful nation.  In the 30 years since its dedication, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has become an almost sacred place of remembering, reconciliation, and healing. It has a special impact on visitors. I was one. As you walk down that incline and this polished granite monument starts to loom higher and higher, and the names grow until you are engulfed by them, you have a feeling of the immensity of sacrifice that was involved in that war.  This past weekend in Chicago and Quincy, IL, big cities and small alike across America communities held Veterans Day parades. Volunteers assembled and sent thank-you packages to the troops serving overseas. I was at Union Station in Chicago yesterday. Fifth Third Bank sponsored the sending of these packages to those who are currently serving. It is all good and it is important, but it is only a fraction of what we owe to veterans.  Mr. President, I want to give special thanks to you and a special shout-outfor what you have accomplished in your service in the Senate. I remember the first time we ever sat down and had any serious conversation about your service in the Senate for the State of Virginia, and you told me your No. 1 priority was a new GI bill. You were brandnew to this place, but you sure knew that subject inside and out. I respected you so much for it and respect you even more for sticking with it. Your determination led to the creation of a new GI bill. Thousands--thousands--of veterans are going to have better lives and their families as well because you were determined to make it happen.  I know you are retiring and nearing the end of your term here in the Senate, but it is a lasting contribution to this country, and I am glad that since it was at the top of your list when you arrived that you got it done. Some Senators spend a lifetime around here and never get No. 1 on the list accomplished, but you did it, and I thank you very much for your leadership in that regard.  It was 2\1/2\ years ago that we also created the family caregivers act to help veterans who survived catastrophic and disabling injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan and the family members who sacrificed so much to help them. I introduced this bill after Senator Hillary Clinton moved on to the State Department 4 years ago. I thought it was a good idea and it was recommended to me by the family of wounded veteran Eric Edmundson. His mom and dad and sister came to me, and we talked about the caregivers act. Traumatic brain injuries, as we know, are one of the signature casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In 2005, Eric Edmundson was a 26-year-old Army sergeant. He survived a roadside blast but then went into cardiac arrest while awaiting transport to a military hospital. His brain was deprived of oxygen for almost 30 minutes. Doctors told his parents that Eric would spend the rest of his life in a vegetative state, and they should choose a nursing home for their 26-year-old son. But Eric's mom and dad said, no, we are not giving up on this young man. They fought for Eric to be transferred to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, one of the best--in fact, the same hospital that my colleague Senator Mark Kirk has been returning to time and time again for rehabilitation from his stroke.  I visited Eric at that hospital several times. He worked so hard to heal and to make progress and his family was with him every day. I will never forget the time I visited Eric in his hospital room in Chicago and his mom said, Eric has a gift for you. I thought, wait a minute, Eric is giving me a gift, at which point his mom and dad walked over on each side of his wheelchair, grabbed one of his elbows each, lifted him up, and Eric took three steps. It was amazing. There wasn't a dry eye in that hospital room, tears of joy that this young man finally could take a few steps.  His dad said at that time, In about a month Eric is going to walk out of the front door of this hospital. Can you be there? Of course I was. It was a proud day not only for Eric and his family but for all of us to see the dramatic progress he made.  Today Eric lives in North Carolina with his wife and two young children. His mom and dad are there by his side every day. They have moved in today to be full-time caregivers for their son, and the family caregivers act helps their family and so many others make sure that Eric is home with his family where he wants to be, receiving the kind of care he deserves for service to our country. So far more than 130 families in Illinois and more than 5,000 nationwide are part of the caregivers program. I am proud of that program. I thank Senator Clinton for a great idea. I thank Senator Danny Akaka, who was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee when it passed as part of larger legislation.  Posttraumatic stress syndrome is another signature wound of these wars that we recently engaged in. These wounds aren't visible, but they are wounds to the spirit. They can be just as debilitating and deadly as a visible wound. We know that active-duty servicemembers are taking their own lives at alarming rates, and the suicide rate among veterans is even higher. The VA estimates that 18 veterans a day take their own lives. The VA has made heroic efforts to keep up with the surge of mental health needs in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Yet despite those efforts only a fraction of veterans with PTSD are receiving timely, effective care.  President Obama recently issued an Executive order to improve mental health care for servicemembers and veterans. The order will expand by 50 percent the capacity of the VA on their crisis line to make sure that any veteran facing a crisis can get professional help within 24 hours.  There is a bill pending in the Senate that would do even more. The Mental Health ACCESS Act introduced by Senator Patty Murray, who has been an amazing champion of veterans--she is the daughter of a severely wounded veteran, and a fierce champion for veterans and their families--the Mental Health ACCESS Act, which I am proud to cosponsor, would make comprehensive improvements in VA suicide prevention counseling and mental health staffing. It would also expand eligibility for a variety of VA health and mental health services to family members, which are so important. We also need to step forward as well and make sure that we go beyond welcoming home parades for veterans and find them a job. Parades are just fine, but if you really want to support a veteran, hire that veteran. Give that veteran a job. America's military today is the best trained, best educated in the history of the world. They have done an enormously good job for our country, and they can do the same for businesses across America.  I hope the bipartisan plan which we are working on with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida to pass will be enacted soon and become part of the law of the land to help these veterans. The President is prepared to sign it, and the sooner we do it the better.  Let me salute some of the veterans in the Senate who are here: Senator Frank Lautenberg, who served in World War II; Senator Danny Inouye, a Medal of Honor recipient from World War II; Senator John McCain, Senator Tom Carper, Senator Kerry, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Jim Webb, both of whom served with honor in Vietnam, as well as Senator Lindsey Graham, who continues to serve as a colonel in the Air Force Reserve; and my colleague Senator Mark Kirk, who is a commander in the Navy Reserve. And not to leave out Senators Akaka, Bingaman, Blumenthal, Scott Brown, Carper, Coats, Cochran, Enzi, Harkin, Inhofe, Isakson, Tim Johnson, Kohl, Lugar, Bill Nelson, Reed, Roberts, Sessions, and Wicker.  The elections earlier this month saw at least 9 new veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan elected to Congress, bringing the total of new veterans in the next Congress to at least 16. They are still counting the ballots in some States.  The people of Illinois are proud that 3 of those 16 veterans are from our State: Congressman Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, and two exceptional leaders who will join the next Congress, Bill Enyart, a new Congressman from downstate Illinois, a veteran of Vietnam and former adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard. Then, of course, my friend, my ``sheroe,'' Tammy Duckworth. She is the daughter of a Vietnam vet and one of the first women to ever fly a combat mission in Iraq. She was copiloting a Black Hawk helicopter when an RPG struck her helicopter. She lost both her legs and the use of her right arm. She has worked in both State and Federal Government on behalf of veterans. What a proud day it will be for America when Tammy stands to take the oath of office in just a few weeks as the newest member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  I want to say a word about my first boss in the Senate, another veteran by the name of Paul Douglas, a man who at the age of 50 enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1942, went through Parris Island training, talked himself into combat, where he was wounded at Peliliu and then more seriously wounded at Okinawa and lost the use of his left arm. He was an extraordinary man who refused to take his veterans' disability pay. He sent his checks back to the government every single month. He joked that you could do the work of a Senator with one arm tied behind your back, so it wasn't really fair for him totake disability pay for too long. In too many issues we in the Senate have tied our own hands with excessive rancor and bipartisanship.  I hope in this lameduck session and beyond, that at least on the issue of helping our veterans, we can come together on a bipartisan basis.                           Immigration Reform
