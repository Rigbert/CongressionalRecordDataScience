 President, I think everyone knows today is the anniversary of 9/11. Many of us here remember evacuating this very building on September 11, 2001. We knew the world would never be the same.  For the people of New York, an ordinary beautiful morning was brought to a screeching halt as the clear blue sky filled with smoke. For those at the Pentagon, the workdays in service of our Nation turned into a literal nightmare. For hundreds of air travelers, routine flights gave way to tragedy, and, thanks to the bravery of passengers and crew, incredible acts of heroism.  The Senate stands with the entire Nation as we remember the terrible events of 18 years ago today and the nearly 3,000 innocent lives that terrorists stole away. We stand in solidarity with those who still grieve, and we honor the patriotic resolve that inspired first responders, U.S. servicemembers, and countless Americans who dedicated themselves, that day and since, to selflessly keeping our Nation safe.  May our remembrances renew our commitment to building a world where terrorist evil has no home. May we never forget.
