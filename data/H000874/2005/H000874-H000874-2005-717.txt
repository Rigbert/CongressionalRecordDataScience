Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that assurance. As the gentleman knows, we have had some problems, at least from our perspective, in being included in the conferences from time to time. That is an important one.  Our citizens are confronting, as my colleague knows, very high gas prices, $2.20, $2.30, $2.50 in some areas of the country. I understand that the committees of jurisdiction are expected to be marking up next week or are in the process of marking up the energy bill. Can the gentleman tell me when that bill might be on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, the gentleman iscorrect, and we are all concerned about the higher gas prices and as important as that is to higher prices of oil and gas. We have been trying to pass or get to the President an energy bill for almost 5 years or 6 years. We have an excellent chance of actually getting a bill to the President this year.  We have had three committees scheduled to mark up components of the energy bill this week, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Resources, but due to the shortened week, only one of those was able to begin their markup. I hope, and we are going to work very hard, and I expect that all three of those committees will complete their markups next week, and we will be able to have a comprehensive energy bill on the floor hopefully by the following week.
