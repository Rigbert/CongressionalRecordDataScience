Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio). Last week, I observed the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) rise and ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey) if it would be possible to delay votes on Tuesday to accommodate West Coast members.  If I leave my district at 6:00 in the morning, I can barely make it here by 5:00 in the evening. That is common to many people who live on the West Coast. I realize the gentleman can walk to his district in that time period. This is a problem. It is a real problem.  So I scheduled to come in on Monday afternoon. My plane was canceled. So I took the first plane out on Tuesday morning. I find, when I get here at 4:30 that the House concluded business at 2:30 in the afternoon, and I missed the votes, as did some other people from the West Coast. I saw the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) from not even quite the west coat on the plane on Tuesday also.  I would hope that the majority will consider this schedule in the future. I would further note, and no one should take offense at this, because even though my name is DeFazio, my mother is an O'Shea, and I come from the O'Sheas and Crowleys, I note that, on Wednesday, the House of Representatives delayed all votes until after 3 o'clock this afternoon because there was a Saint Patrick's Day parade in New York.  Now for some reason, we can delay all the proceedings of the House of Representatives until after 3 o'clock in the afternoon for a joyous occasion, a parade, but for regular business and accommodating the schedules of West Coast Members, who constitute a significant minority of this body, they apparently can do nothing.  Mr. Speaker, I would just ask the gentleman if there is any consideration going to be given on that side to putting those votes, the two or three votes that were done by 2:30 in the afternoon later in the day on Tuesday?
