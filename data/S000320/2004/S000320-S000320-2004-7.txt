S. Coast Guard's Deepwater program.  The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, has the good fortune of representing a coastal State on the Gulf of Mexico very similar in geography to my State of Alabama. The chairman is an outstanding steward and supporter of the United States Coast Guard and in particular the ongoing Deepwater modernization program in the Coast Guard. This bill addresses numerous issues related to Deepwater and I appreciate the chairman's support and leadership on this vital issue to every coastal State, as well as the Nation.
