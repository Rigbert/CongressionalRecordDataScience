 I would be happy to enter into negotiations to talk about accepting this amendment if it didn't actually gut the provisions we have before us. This administration basically says to the President--actually the White House attorney would designate it--the provision of the underlying bill violates NAFTA. That is their position, not ours. It is their decision. They could revoke the Mexican driver's license provision we have, or the inspection of the trucks across the border and the insurance issue on Mexican trucks. At their whim, they could say we think that violates NAFTA.  I think the Members of the Senate have spoken quite loudly, 70-30, that we believe the provisions in this Senate bill are ones that we believe will protect drivers in the country. We have already seen what the DOT protections were. I believe the underlying amendment certainly as written is not safe for American drivers.
