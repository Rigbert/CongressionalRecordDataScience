So it is necessary, I suggest respectfully to the Majority Leader, that we come to agreement on that fairly soon if we are going to have the ability to pass and send to the President that legislation.  Thirdly, the third of the items, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which Mr. Hensarling just wrote an op-ed about. I know that the committee has acted or is contemplating action on that.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not TRIA--and I know there has been some discussion about including it in the omnibus. I don't know whether that is rumor or fact that it is being considered. But can the gentleman tell me where we are on the Terrorism Risk Insurance?  As the gentleman knows, it passed 93-4 in the United States Senate, so it was not a partisan bill in the Senate, overwhelming support for it, and I would hope that we could move it through the House in a similar bipartisan, overwhelming fashion.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have just met with our chairman and he is scheduled to meet with the Senate on the other side of the aisle early next week.  The Speaker and I have both put a statement out that we know the timeline of this. If they can't come to agreement, we are open to doing a 1-year extension, making sure that it doesn't have any problems. But we would like to see a resolution of this with a negotiation between both sides.
