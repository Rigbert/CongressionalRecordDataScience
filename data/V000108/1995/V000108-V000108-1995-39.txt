Speaker, the budget resolution is just around the corner and it is time to put the money where our mouths are and actually balance the budget.  Our deficits have left us with a debt of $4.7 trillion or $47,000 per taxpayer. Our yearly interest payments on the debt exceed $200 billion or $2,000 per taxpayer. This reduces wage rates, destroys jobs, and mortgages our future.  To start balancing the budget today, Mr. Stenholm and I have introduced the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act. This bill will force us to make the tough decisions to balance the budget in 2002.  Unlike past attempts to balance the budget, this bill holds everyone's feet to the fire. There are no loopholes. Everything's on-budget. And all smoke-and-mirror projections will be checked by a nonpartisan Board of Estimates at the beginning and end of the annual budgeting process.  Mr. Speaker, everyone says they want to balance the budget, but we have not even come close. I have been in Washington long enough to know that the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act will work. If we are really serious about balancing the budget, the House will include this bill in the budget resolution.                          ____________________
