Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Speaker, we have heard an awful lot about the transactions relative to what the President said at the deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit relating to Monica Lewinsky's affidavit. I do not think the Members who thundered on denouncing what the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) said have read page 63 of the committee report. I shall do so.  After reading from the affidavit out loud, the President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, asked the President, is that a true and accurate statement as far as you know it? The President answered, that is absolutely true.  That is at page 204 of the deposition of President Clinton in the case of Jones versus Clinton.  During the same deposition, Robert Bennett, the President's attorney, stated, Counsel is fully aware that Ms. Jane Doe No. 6 has filed, has an affidavit in which they are in possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind, any manner, shape or form with President Clinton.  That is at page 54.  Now, a few months later, the grand jury testimony of Monica Lewinsky, which was given under oath and following a grant of transactional immunity, confirmed that the contents of her affidavit were not true.  Question: Paragraph 8 of the affidavit says, I have never had a sexual relationship with the President; is that true? Answer: No.  That is the transcript of the grand jury testimony of Monica Lewinsky at page 924.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).  (
