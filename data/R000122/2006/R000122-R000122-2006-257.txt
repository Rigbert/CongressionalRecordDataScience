GREGG. I just want to explain the parliamentary situation for the record.  Mr. President, these last two amendments are totally outside the traditional process of reconciliation. But the practical effects of the motion to waive, which the Senator from Iowa has made on his amendments, is that neither amendment can survive conference. I think it is important to understand that reconciliation cannot include spending under this bill, and that we would be doing fundamental damage to the process were either of these amendments to survive conference. And, therefore, I support the motion on this point of order and hope we proceed the same way we have with the other points of order.
