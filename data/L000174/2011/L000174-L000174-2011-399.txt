World Press Freedom Day was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993 and provides an important opportunity for us all to remember the journalists and other members of the news media--of all nationalities--who have sacrificed their personal safety, and in some cases their lives, to ensure the free flow of information to the public.  The Nation's Founders prized and protected a free and vibrant press. Its prominence is found in the first amendment of the Constitution. Since the founding of this great Nation, American journalists have courageously documented volatile turning points in our history and the world's history. Elijah Lovejoy, the first of too many American journalists who have paid the ultimate price in service to press freedom, remains a stalwart figure in media history, even today.  The International Federation of Journalists reports that at least 94 journalists and other members of the media have been killed in the line of duty during 2010. Countless others have been detained or arrested simply for performing their professional duties.  In recent months, we have witnessed the troubling case of American and foreign journalists being detained, assaulted, and even killed in their efforts to tell the world about the democratic uprisings in the Middle East. Last month, Oscar-nominated war-film director and photojournalist Tim Hetherington and photojournalist Chris Hondros were both killed while reporting on a battle between Libyan Government forces and rebels in the city of Misrata. In February, CBS war correspondent Lara Logan was brutally attacked and sexually assaulted while reporting on the historic uprising in Egypt. The recent news that Osama bin Laden has been killed--a price paid for his crimes against the American people and the world--has focused even more attention on the unrest in the Middle East. The efforts of journalists and members of the media in that region now have even greater significance.  Preserving press freedoms and freedom of expression remains one of my highest legislative priorities as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That is why I have once again joined with Republican Senator John Cornyn to introduce the Faster FOIA Act. This bill would create a bipartisan Commissionto help ensure that the Freedom of Information Act one of the most important tools by which the press can obtain critical information about what our government is doing is not hindered by excessive delays.  A few days ago, President Obama observed that ``in the last months, we've seen journalists threatened, arrested, beaten, attacked, and in some cases even killed simply for doing their best to bring us the story, to give people a voice, and to hold leaders accountable. And through it all, we've seen daring men and women risk their lives for the simple idea that no one should be silenced, and everyone deserves to know the truth.''  As we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, we are reminded that an open and accountable society comes with not only the right of its citizens to know the truth but the duty to empower themselves with that knowledge. All of us--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--have an interest in preserving press freedoms and protecting the public's right to know. Enacting the Faster FOIA Act will help to accomplish this goal. For this reason, I strongly encourage all Members to join me in celebrating World Press Freedom Day and in supporting this very important bipartisan bill.                          ____________________
