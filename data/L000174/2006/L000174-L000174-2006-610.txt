President, I am glad the senior Senator from Louisiana is on the floor. I commend her for her statement. She has been a Senate leader on this very important humanitarian matter. We have discussed the question of international adoptions many times. I know how wonderful she has been in--I don't mean to embarrass her--not just her position as a Senator, but in her personal life. She has been wonderful. She has worked with Republicans, Democrats, and those who have no political affiliation on this issue.  I have to think that because of her work there are many children throughout this country who are going to have a life much better than they would have had otherwise. I commend my colleague. I am glad to serve with her and I know she wants to bring forward an amendment on this subject. I believe it is No. 3225, which I should also note is a bipartisan amendment.  I support this amendment, the ICARE Act. I hope we can agree to have it formally offered and successfully considered. International adoption cries out for this relief. I will work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to see if we can get this adopted. I would be surprised if there is any Senator--Republican or Democrat--who would object to it. I certainly will give it my strong support.  Again, I commend the Senator from Louisiana.
