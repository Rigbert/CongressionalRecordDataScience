President, I rise today to honor a Chicago institution and a good friend, Irv Kupcinet, on the occasion of his 90th birthday on July 31, and to pay tribute to his outstanding contributions to the veterans of the Chicago area. While best known for his work in journalism, Kup has also dedicated a major part of his life to serving his community's veterans.  Born in 1912, Irv grew up in Chicago. Early on, he had a job cleaning Pullman Co. railroad cars so that he could earn money to attend college. He went on to receive his journalism degree from the University of North Dakota in 1934. While in college, he was involved as both the director of athletic publicity and as the quarterback of the football team. So, during the week, he wrote about sports and on Saturday, he played them. Initially he was headed toward a future in football. He was even selected for the 1935 College All-Star football team, which led him to begin a short career in professional football with the Philadelphia Eagles.  However, a shoulder injury led him to a new path in life, as he shifted from sports player to sports writer. Kup began as a writer for the Chicago Times in 1935. Chicago readers have been enjoying the writings of ``Kup'' ever since. After all these years, Irv still writes ``Kup's Column'' in the Chicago Sun-Times today.  Additionally, Kup broadcast Chicago Bears games on the radio for 24 years with another Chicago icon, Jack Brickhouse. In 1959, he debuted his own local television talk show which ran for 27 years. He has been honored with the coveted Peabody Award and has won a total of 16 local Emmy awards for his show.  Irv has been inducted into two halls of fame--one for journalism and one for Chicago sports. And, he also is recognized in the Hall of Fame at the University of North Dakota and the National Jewish Hall of Fame. In 1986, the Wabash Avenue Bridge in Chicago officially became the Irv Kupcinet Bridge in honor of his 50 years with the Chicago Sun-Times.  One of the things that has always impressed me about Kup is that despite all of his endeavors in sports and in journalism, he always made time to give back to his community, to give back to Chicago. That is what truly puts Irv Kupcinet in a league of his own. He is the founder and the host of the annual Chicago Sun-Times Purple Heart Cruise for veterans, which began in 1945 and continues today.  At the end of World War II, Irv wanted to recognize the soldiers who risked their lives for their fellow Americans. He found a way to do so in conjunction with the Purple Heart veterans organization. The Military Order of the Purple Heart of the U.S.A. is a Congressionally chartered national service organization for veterans that offers educational programs, outreach programs, computer training courses, and a long list of other programs aimed at serving our country's veterans. Illinois, alone, has over 860 Purple Heart veterans. With the Purple Heart and the Chicago Sun-Times, Irv has hosted this annual cruise. He said in his autobiography that his cruise ``celebrates the veterans of all our wars, men and women who put their lives on the line so that the rest of us could live in peace and freedom.'' In a sense, this cruise is a reprise of the USO servicemen club, a oneday floating revival held each year sometime between Pearl Harbor and V-J Day. The veterans who attend the cruise leave with no less than 50 gifts when they step off the boat. That is a small gift compared to the sacrifices each veteran made for his or her country. Through Kup's initiative with the Purple Heart Cruise, Chicago is the only city that shows this brand of gratitude to our veterans. Irv has been recognized with the General John Logan Chicago Patriot Award for his service for the Purple Heart cruises.  Kup, on his 90th birthday and every day, serves as a role model to all who read his column, listened to his television and radio broadcasts, followed his sports career, and benefit today from his many good works.  A few weeks ago it was my good fortune to be invited to join Kup and his buddies for their Saturday brunch at a Michigan Avenue hotel. It was a great gathering of old friends, swapping stories, telling jokes and celebrating good times in life.  I extend my sincere congratulations to Kup on his 90th birthday, thank him for the difference he has made in his hometown of Chicago and ask that a great column by Bob Greene, written in his honor, be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  The Deadline Dash: Kup Is Turning 90       I suppose stranger things have happened than this--a column      in the Sunday Tribune celebrating and praising a columnist      for the Sun-Times--but special moments call for special      gestures. Kup is about to turn 90.       Irv Kupcinet's 90th birthday is on the last day of this      month. Kup's Column is now in its 60th year--he began writing      it in 1943. He lost his dear wife Essee last year, and his      health has not been so great, but he is as much a part of      Chicago as . . .       Well, I was going to say as much a part of Chicago as the      John Hancock Center, but Kup's Column was around way before      the Hancock was constructed. I was going to say as much a      part of Chicago as the Wrigley Building, but Kup was born      years before the Wrigley went up. In the end, there is no      comparison. You properly say that a person or an object is as      much a part of Chicago as Kup, not the other way around.       He has always loved this city so. The son of a bakery truck      driver, Kup set for himself a work ethic that is phenomenal.      When he attended the University of North Dakota and played      quarterback on its football team, he also served as the      university's director of athletic publicity, writing press      releases during the week and leading the team on Saturdays.      The late Gene Siskel and I would often marvel to each other      about Kup's work schedule. In essence, during his peak years,      Kup worked a nine-day week: He wrote six newspaper columns a      week, skipping only Saturdays; he taped his ``Kup's Show''      television program over two days; and on Sundays during      football season he and Jack Brickhouse were the play-by-play      men on Chicago Bears radio broadcasts on WGN.       Brick and Kup--there was nothing like them anywhere else in      the country. It might not have sounded like a symphony, but      it sure sounded like Chicago. Kup in his prime was this      physically huge, commanding poresence--he played professional      football for the Philadelphia Eagles, and later was an on-     field NFL head linesman. When he began writing his column in      Chicago, he became an instant and larger-than-life star.       He made the decision early to try to be fair both in print      and on the air, and chose generosity over smallness. He was      the biggest name in this town before anyone now working in      any print or broadcast newsroom got started, yet he made a      practice of going out of his way to be welcoming to new      colleagues. When I was given a column at the Sun-Times at the      age of 23, the first note I got was from him. Written in      heavy copy pencil over a tearsheet of the story announcing      the new column, the message was short: ``Bob--Congrats!      Kup.'' Did it matter? More than 30 years later, I still have      it.       The pride of his life was Kup's Purple Heart Cruise. Each      year he would take military veterans, many of them from      hospitals, out on a boat in Lake Michigan for a day of      entertainment, food and fun. He started the cruise while      World War II was still raging, and it lasted for 50 years.      Once I was with him on the cruise--there was Kup on the      gangplank, wearing a commodore's cap--and an elderly former      soldier said to him, ``Kup, I bet you don't remember who I      am.'' Not missing a beat, Kup gave him a hearty Kup      backslap--I thought the old soldier was going to go tumbling      into the water--and boomed out: ``Of course I know you!      You're a grand old veteran!''       Kup's interviewing style on ``Kup's Show'' was one of a      kind--I remember him leaning close to Henry Kissinger once      and thundering out, in that amazing Kup voice: ``Henry, what      the hell, pardon my French, is going on in Cambodia?''--and      like everything else he did, it was pure Chicago.       I talked with him the other day. Like so many people who      reach 90, he finds that most of his friends are gone; he said      he spends most of his time at home, and that ``I'm weak much      of the time.'' He always worked so hard, he said, because      ``turnout out a good story was more fun than anything else I      could think of.'' Feeling weak or not, he seems to have made      a determination, based on the toughness and strength of the      old Kup: A great and legendary era in Chicago newspapering is      coming to an end, and he is going to be the last man      standing.       In newsrooms not just in Chicago, but all over the      country--newsrooms where people who once here are now      employed--the mention of Kup brings a smile and thoughts of      home. It's probably not possible to speak for all of those      men and women--all of the editors, writers and photographers      with a Chicago connection--but as he turns 90 I'll bet I      speak for most of them right now. He has never liked fancy      writing, and he has always tried to make his point directly      and unambiguously with as few words as possible, so I'll say      it that way:       We love you, Kup.                          ____________________
