President. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his graciousness.  Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the ranking member regarding the Intelligence Transportation System Program.  Would the Senator from Montana agree the policy in the program intended to encourage private sector investment should be implemented in a manner that does not interfere with ongoing technology, deployment, and system implementation in States that have already made a substantial investment in its tests and deployment?
