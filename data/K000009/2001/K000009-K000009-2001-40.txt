Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts so very much for speaking out again today, and for providing the type of national leadership that we need in order to make this Global Food for Education Program permanent.  I think, if the gentleman might want to engage in a colloquy at this point, I know he has thought a great deal about how our commodities leverage food from other countries, and the participation of other nations in this Global Food for Education Initiative.  Perhaps the gentleman would wish to place some of that on the Record at this time.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, what we are proposing here is not just a program where the United States goes it alone. What we are trying to do here is inspire other countries around the world to follow suit, and to make a strong effort to eliminate hunger among the world's children.  We have the ability to do that. Our country, working with other countries around the world, we can eliminate hunger among children. We could eliminate hunger among the entire world if we had the political will to do so.  As Senator McGovern has said time and time again, hunger is a political condition. It is something that we can solve if we have the political will to do so.  Our goal here is to have the United States be a leader in this effort, but to go to other countries around the world, as we have been trying to do, to get them to participate in this program. So it is a worldwide effort, a worldwide effort to combat hunger.
