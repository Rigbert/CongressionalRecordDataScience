Greenwood) for yielding me this time.  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) is my good friend, but this amendment is misguided. I do not believe that the vast majority of the American public agree with the proposition in this amendment.  The fact is, this issue is not about abortion. It is about the health of millions of women and children in some of the poorest nations in the world. The United Nations Population Fund is the single largest global source of multilateral funding for maternal health and family planning programs, supporting programs in 150 developing nations. It helps mothers deliver healthy babies through prenatal care and safe delivery kits and counseling. It enables couples to determine the number and spacing of their children through the voluntary, and I stress voluntary, use of safe modern contraception. The gentleman from New Jersey, I do not think, believes in that, and I understand that.  This program reduces the incidence and prevents the transmission of HIV/AIDS and others sexually transmitted diseases.  Let us be clear. The United Nations Population Fund does not provide abortion or abortion services anywhere in the world. Not one penny of program funding is used to promote or to perform abortions. In fact, the U.N. Population Fund program in China was developed with the express purpose of moving China away from coerced abortion and involuntary stabilization practices.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and to support the bipartisan provision offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) that was adopted in committee.  Today, we do not ask the proponents of this amendment to abandon their deepest principles on abortion. They should not now ask us to put our heads in the sand and ignore the plight of millions of women and children.
