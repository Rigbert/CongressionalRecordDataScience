President, it is no secret that this Transportation bill is not the Senate's first choice. However, the alternative to acting tonight on transportation is to put at risk America's economy, our communities, and our quality of life. As Senator Hatch noted earlier tonight, the Senate had a real transportation debate this week with amendments, alternatives, and bipartisan initiatives. This will serve us well as we begin to work as soon as the Senate returns to develop a long-term, bipartisan transportation plan that ensures that our big-league economy is not plagued by little-league infrastructure.  I urge the Senate to support the legislation.
