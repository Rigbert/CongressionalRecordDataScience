 President, the first provision says that no one shall be appointed to the important post of U.S. Trade Representative, or a Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, if that person had in the past directly represented a foreign government at a trade dispute or negotiation with the United States.  The second provision says that nobody who served as U.S. Trade Representative, or Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, may, after his or her employment has ended, represent, aid, or advise any foreign government, foreign political party, or foreign business entity with the intent to influence a decision of any officer or employee of any executive agency.  I do not know whether the Senator from Michigan would like me to go on. I think that basically explains the amendment.
