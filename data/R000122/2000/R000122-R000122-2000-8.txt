President, I rise today to join my colleague from Iowa, the Chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Aging, to introduce legislation that we hope will begin to address an immediate and critical laborshortage facing nursing home facilities across the nation as well as the long term objective of establishing nursing home staffing thresholds.  In late July, the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, released the first phase of its long awaited report on the feasibility and appropriateness of minimum nursing home staffing ratios. The initial phase of this report explored the relationship between staffing levels and quality of care. The HCFA study found a strong correlation between certain staffing thresholds and the quality of care provided to nursing home residents. The report also found that nursing homes are having great difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff to work in their facilities. Clearly, we can and should be doing more to ensure that the care of our elderly and disabled is not being placed at risk.  In my home state of Rhode Island, we have been dealing with a critical shortage in the number of Certified Nursing Assistants, CNAs, in particular. CNAs provide direct care in a skilled nursing setting to residents who need help with essential daily living tasks, such as dressing, feeding and bathing. A state task force comprised of long term care providers and nursing home consumer advocates found that over 26,000 individuals were licensed as CNAs, but only 14,000 are currently working in the field. The task force also found that the turnover rate for CNAs rose to an unprecedented 82.6 percent in 1999.  The two most important issues identified in the state report were wages and adequate staffing levels. In terms of wages, a person in my state can make more in starting salary as a hotel maid in Providence ($9.50/hour) than they would as a licensed CNA ($7.69/hour). Those individuals who have dedicated their careers to caring for our most vulnerable citizens certainly deserve better and the legislation we are introducing today will help to restore respect and dignity to the caregiver profession.  The Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act will address these problems in essentially two ways. First, the legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to complete the second phase of the nursing home staffing report by July 2001. The Secretary will then be called upon to use the findings and recommendations of the final report to develop appropriate caregiver to resident and supervisor to caregiver ratios for nursing facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The second major component of the bill is the establishment of a grant program to States for the purpose of augmenting staffing levels. This provision, which is based on a initiative announced by President Clinton in mid-September, will support projects aimed at improving the recruitment and retention of direct nursing staff. The bill also requires nursing homes to post, on a daily basis, the number of staff and residents at the facility as well as submit staffing information to the Secretary.  As a member of the Special Senate Committee on Aging, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act, a balanced piece of legislation that I believe will go a long way in stabilizing nursing home staffing levels nationwide. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and my other colleagues to enact this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
