Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the advocacy of the gentlewoman. She has been incredibly persistent since she earmarked this project back in 2004 before the Republicans banned earmarks. Of course, then it was a $220 million project. Now it is an $810 million project. The Federal share has gone from $110 million to over $500 million, and included in the total cost are the basketball courts, the splash pool, and all that, but it is coming out of the local share. No, that is not the way this is supposed to work.  If this is a Corps project, the only things which the Corps is authorized to do would be in the calculated total cost, and then a percentage of that goes to the local jurisdiction. In this case, they are counting the contributions of the local developers as part of the local cost share. So, essentially, it is coming out of the taxpayers' pockets.  I include in the Record a letter from the Taxpayers for Common Sense and the National Taxpayers Union.                                               September 27, 2016.       Dear Representative: While less expensive and problematic      than the Senate version of the Water Resources Development      Act (S. 2848), we urge you to oppose H.R. 5303, the ``Water      Resources Development Act of 2016.'' Instead of much needed      reform, this legislation piles billions of dollars in      additional water projects on the U.S. Army Corps of      Engineers' plate. The legislation also makes     policy changes that will be costly to taxpayers.       The largest challenge facing the Corps of Engineers water      resources program is the lack of a prioritization system for      allocating the limited available tax dollars. The legislation      directs the executive branch to better explain its budgeting      decisions, but this should not serve as an abdication of      congressional authority. Congress should develop the criteria      and metrics to prioritize Corps projects in the three primary      mission areas (navigation, flood/storm damage reduction, and      environmental restoration). The executive branch should be      required to allocate funds in the budget request in a      transparent manner through merit, competitive, or formula      systems developed by Congress. Lawmakers could then conduct      oversight, hold the administration accountable, and adjust      the systems, criteria, and metrics as needed.       H.R. 5303 fails to include such a prioritization system. It      does many other things, however. Between committee      consideration and the floor, the bill grew by over $6      billion. A provision from the Water Resources Reform and      Development Act of 2014 dedicating maintenance dredging funds      to emerging ports is made permanent. It doesn't make sense to      invest in a port that is continually ``emerging.'' It also      extends set-asides for ``donor'' and ``energy'' ports without      reforming the massive cross-subsidies in the existing      maintenance dredging program. The legislation authorizes      funding for a project in Fort Worth, Texas, costing more than      $800 million. The Upper Trinity River project is portrayed as      a flood damage reduction effort, but is really a massive      economic development initiative that would divert precious      Corps resources to construct soccer and baseball fields,      basketball courts, and even a splash park. Money spent on a      splash park in Fort Worth is money that cannot be spent to      further the Corps' core mission areas. At the least we urge      you to remove or limit the funds for this project.       Again, we urge you to oppose H.R. 5303 the ``Water      Resources Development Act of 2016.''           Sincerely,     Ryan Alexander,       Taxpayers for Common Sense.     Pete Sepp,       National Taxpayers Union.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I will just read briefly: ``The legislation authorizes funding for a project in Fort Worth, Texas, costing more than $800 million.

That is from Taxpayers for Common Sense and the National Taxpayers Union.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
