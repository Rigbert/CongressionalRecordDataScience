 1, the prescription drug benefits bill. There are two amendments currently pending to the bill. One is the Enzi amendment relating to disclosure and the other is Senator Bingaman's amendment regarding asset tests. These amendments are being reviewed and it is the leader's hope we will be able to set votes in relation to these amendments sometime tomorrow.  As mentioned earlier, we have now begun the amendment process and I hope we will continue to make progress on the bill each day until we are done with it, and the chairman and ranking member will be working together to try to get Senators in a queue to offer amendments.  Rollcall votes will occur throughout the day during Thursday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
