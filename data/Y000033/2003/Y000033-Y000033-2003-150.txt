Mr. Speaker, the legislation I am introducing today calls for the federal government to buy 349 acres of recreational land from the City of Craig, Alaska. The land includes a trail leading to Mount Sunnahae, its trailhead, a parking area, and mountaintop property. The legislation requires an appraisal before purchase. The bill also allows for a $250,000 appropriation to the U.S. Forest Service for trail maintenance and property rehabilitation.  I am introducing the bill at the request of Prince of Wales Island residents. The City of Craig is the economic center of Prince of Wales Island--which is the third largest island in the country. The town contains the major retail shopping and service outlets on the island. Craig also has the most active and largest commercial fishing harbor and fleet on the island. But the local economy, like many other parts of South East Alaska, has suffered from a downturn in the timber industry. In the early 1980's, the city and Prince of Wales Island were the center of a solid timber economy that provided thousands of direct and indirect jobs to the Island. Much of that is now gone as a result of terrible Federal forest management policies. According to the Alaska Department of Labor, unemployment rates in Craig regularly exceed 20 percent. This is more than twice the national average. This bill will help community expansion and development as well as facilitate Forest Service land management.  One of the Forest Service's main administrative facilities, the Craig Ranger District Station, is located in Craig. The Craig Ranger has management authority over approximately one million acres on Prince of Wales Island. Right now, there is not any Forest Service land near the Ranger Station. In an unusual situation for Alaska, the Ranger Station is an in-holding among private, state, and City owned land. So when visitors come to the Craig Ranger Station to orient themselves to the Forest, there is no onsite recreation. However, the city of Craig owns almost 350 acres of prime recreational land including a dedicated trail in the immediate vicinity from the Ranger Station. The Forest Service should own this land so that it can integrate the parcel into its land management plans.  The property to be acquired by the city of Craig is a cannery site dating from the early 1900's which has not been used since the early 1980's. It is prime land for the city to redevelop in order to provide economic stimulus in Craig. The parcel could be used by Craig to develop a good port and harbor and to provide first class land for retail merchants and other community services.  The Federal Government will receive equal value in land from the city. The passage of this Act is good for the public and for the residents of Craig.                          ____________________
