  I intend to work with my colleagues to strengthen this legislation further before it is enacted. There may well be a need to include additional provisions for regulation and oversight. For one thing, I believe that we should add the full text of Subparts A and B of 45 CFR 46 to this legislation to make clear what the bill actually says. And I will work with my colleagues to do so. Unfortunately, competing legislation goes far beyond such regulation. It would completely ban nuclear transplantation--criminalizing scientific research that offers the promise of saving the lives of millions and relieving the suffering of countless others. In fact, it would even make it a crime for a doctor to cure a patient if that cure was developed overseas from nuclear transplantation research.  I strongly oppose such legislation. I believe that passing such a sweeping ban would be a huge mistake. As is the case with many medical technologies, it is not stem cell research techniques that are the problem, but some of their potential applications. The scientific and medical evidence is overwhelming that nuclear transplantation offers the promise of curing many deadly diseases and debilitating conditions. As Professor Irving Weissman, chair of the National Academies' panel on cloning, testified before a Judiciary Committee hearing I chaired, ``[T]here are no scientific or medical reasons [for banning nuclear transplantation], and such a ban would certainly close avenues of promising scientific and medical research.'' In fact, over 80 major organizations and associations have already come out in favor of our approach.  These include the American Medical Association, National Health Council, Parkinson's Action Network, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, which represents over 600,000 medical researchers around the country. Moreover, the leading blue-ribbon scientific and medical panels that have examined the cloning issue have also supported our approach.  The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, the National Academies' Panel on Scientific and Medical Aspects of Human Cloning, and the California Advisory Committee on Human Cloning all concluded that we should ban human reproductive cloning, but not interfere with important areas of scientific research, including nuclear transplantation.  I have been very moved by the many sick people and their relatives that have contacted me and told me that my legislation offers them hope. One of the most compelling stories is that ofKris Gulden who testified at our hearing on the subject. Ms. Gulden, a former veteran police officer, received several awards for her outstanding law enforcement work. She also maintained an active schedule outside the office, including winning the women's triathalon gold medal in August 1996 at the biannual International Police Olympics in Salt Lake City. Tragically a car struck Ms. Gulden while she was training for the 1998 AIDS Ride, leaving her with a severe spinal cord injury. That accident changed her life. Nine days before the accident, she was participating in a triathalon in Memphis. Nine days after the accident, she was left exhausted just trying to brush her teeth. I'll never forget her words: ``In my dreams, I still walk. I run, I play basketball, and I wear the uniform of the Alexandria Police Department. When the sun rises each morning, it brings reality with it. I rise to the sight of a wheelchair, yet I rise with the hope that maybe this will be the morning that I can move my legs.''  In the face of the enormous promise of nuclear transplantation research, it is difficult to see why anyone wants to dash the hopes of Kris Gulden and the millions of others facing debilitating and painful illnesses and ailments. As former Senator Connie Mack has testified before the Senate:       A cell isn't human life if it hasn't been fertilized by a      sperm and placed in the womb'' and `[t]he research value of      these cells is enormous. They have the potential to form any      cell in the body and can reproduce indefinitely. Studies in      animals demonstrate that this could lead to cures and      treatments for millions of people.  The legislation we introduce today would ban human reproductive cloning and preserve valuable medical research. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I would also ask unanimous consent that several letters I have received supporting the Specter-Feinstein-Kennedy-Hatch approach to cloning be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Joint Steering Committee                                            for Public Policy,                                      Bethesda, MD, April 9, 2002.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to seek your help with      efforts being made by many disease advocacy groups and by      many of us in the scientific community to protect highly      valuable scientific research from an overzealous legislative      proposal intended to prohibit the cloning of human beings.       The measure in question, S. 1899, introduced by Senator      Brownback and others, would, in effect, establish criminal      penalties for three things: (i) attempts to produce a human      being by methods that include transfer of a somatic cell      nucleus (``nuclear transfer'') and placement of any resulting      embryos into a uterus; (ii) the transfer of a human cell      nucleus into an egg cell for any purposes; and (iii) the      important of any products of nuclear transfer, including      those used for medical treatment.       No scientist of my acquaintance believes that it is      currently appropriate or safe, even if it were feasible, to      undertake the complex process intended to result in the birth      of a cloned human being. For that reason, you are unlikely to      hear objections to the first prohibition established by the      Brownback bill, even from those who may question whether      legislation and criminal penalties are useful instruments for      preventing attempts at cloning that might be undertaken by      irresponsible individuals.       The second and third prohibitions, however, are deeply      disturbing to many people, including those of use who have      given considerable thought to the difficult ethical issues      presented by these new technologies. The third prohibition is      inappropriately punitive in the more obvious way: it could      lead to punishment of seriously ill patients who have gone      abroad to seek novel treatments that are unavailable in this      country because they are based on nuclear transfer. But the      second prohibition is troubling in a more profound way. For      the first time in my experience, an American law would create      criminal penalties for the use of a highly promising      scientific method, regardless of the intent of the      investigator, and would threaten to delay development of new      therapies for common diseases.       To appreciate our concerns, it is important to understand      the nature of what is called ``nuclear transfer''. Recent      studies with experimental animals show that a cell nucleus      containing all, but expressing only some, of the genes of an      organism can undergo extensive changes, or ``reprogramming'',      when moved from one cell environment to another. This means      that a nucleus from a highly specialized cell--for example, a      skin call--can radically revise the set of genes that it uses      when it is put into another cell, such as an egg cell, from      which the pre-existing nucleus has been removed. In the new      environment of the recipient cell, the genes in the nucleus      appear to function as appropriate to that environment.       Thus, when the recipient cell is an egg, the genes regain      the ability to direct the progeny cells, which arise by      division, to form nearly any of the many cell type that are      found in a mature organism, if the cells are coaxed to do so      by appropriate stimuli. This phenomenon has the potential to      lead to great things a deeper understanding of human      development, important insights into disease mechanism, and      the abundant production of normal cells of virtually any      type, which could then be used to treat a wide variety of      diseases. Moreover, if a parent is the source of the      transplanted, reprogrammed nucleus, the normal cells could be      used to treat that individual without fear of immune      rejection.       Clearly we have a lot to learn before we can efficiently      apply nuclear transfer and reprogramming to medical      purposes--most obviously, we need to learn the best recipes      to foster reprogramming and development into the various cell      types. But studies with certain animal models of disease      already show that these strategies can work, and the      fundamental discoveries that have emerged from work with      nuclear transfer offer legitimate hope for still greater      discoveries in the future.       Unfortunately, the opportunities make such discoveries and      develop new therapies may well be denied to American      scientists because of any inappropriate equation of the      method used in reprogramming cells (nuclear transfer) and the      goal of cloning whole organisms. This confusion is based in      part on the use of nuclear transfer in an otherwise very      different multi-step process that led ultimately to the birth      of Dolly the sheep and other cloned animals. Indeed, S. 1899      considers transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus into an      nucleated human egg for the purpose of reprogramming to be a      punishable act of human cloning.       It is crucial to emphasize how nuclear transfer, the      reprogramming step, differs from attempts to generate a full-     fledged organism. Absent transfer to a uterus, the cells that      result from nuclear transfer into an egg cytoplasm will not      form the complex and organized collection of cell types that      characterize a developing organism. The initial aggregate of      fewer than 200 cells, formed after introduction of a nucleus      into an egg, lacks the recognizable types of cells that are      needed to develop into the organs of a human being, and it      is barely visible to the naked eye. Individual cells from      this aggregate, however, can be used to develop stem cell      lines, to study development of specialized cell types in a      Petri dish, and to prepare materials for cell-based      therapies.       Furthermore, in the future, it is possible that cell      reprogramming can be carried out in ways that do not involve      the use of human egg cells or nuclear transfer itself. The      chemicals in the cytoplasm of an egg cell that guide      reprogramming have not yet been identified, but when they are      it will be possible to use other cells and even simpler      defined recipes to reprogram adult cells. Of course, these      things will never happen, at least in this country, if the      use of nuclear transfer to human eggs is outlawed.       The Brownback bill that we are worried about today closely      resembles a bill (S. 1601) proposed in 1998 by Senator Bond      and others. At that time, you helped to derail the passage of      that ill-considered measure with an insightful letter to one      of the bill's sponsors and a speech on the Senate floor. Many      of my colleagues and I believe that the concerns you raised      then about the need to ``ban cloning of human beings but do      so in a way that allows, to the extent ethically proper,      valuable research to continue'' are still valid. For that      reason, I hope you will join us in opposing S. 1899.       Thank you for your consideration of my views on this      important legislation. Needless to say, I am prepared to      discuss any of the points I have made with you or your staff      at any time.           With best personal regards,                                                Harold Varmus,                                   Chair, Joint Steering Committee      for Public Policy.                                  ____                           California Institute of Technology,                                      Pasadena, CA, April 8, 2002.     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,     Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing in opposition to the      Brownback bill on cloning.       I am a Nobel Laureate who has worked for 40 years in basic      biological science and biotechnology. I have seen how a      glimmer of an idea can grow to transform a technology, and I      have great faith in the ability of basic science to create      miraculous treatments for medical conditions.       The use of nuclear transfer into the embryonic cells for      reproductive purposes (so-called reproductive cloning) is a      technology that is a long way from being safe enough to be      used to create human beings. So, issues of morality aside, I      am totally opposed to using cloning technology for human      reproduction. All of my colleagues with whom I have talked      are equally opposed, but I am aware that there are people      threatening to try to carry out the procedure. Thus, I      support a legislative ban on reproductive cloning. I hope      that any such ban will have a sunset clause so that in 5      years the question can be revisited.       There is another use of somatic cell nuclear transfer into      early embryonic cells     that is quite different from the process of reproductive      cloning. This is often called therapeutic cloning, although      that is a terminology that many people find confusing. Such      nuclear transfer could be used to produce individual stem      cells that may have extraordinary medical value. It is also a      valuable technique for probing the causes of genetic      diseases. Twice this week, I have heard of new advances that      make such a technology increasingly promising. Furthermore,      the procedure whereby mouse cells derived by somatic cell      nuclear transfer can be used therapeutically has just been      described in the journal Cell, erasing any doubt about the      feasibility of the method. Thus, it would be a great loss to      medical science for somatic cell nuclear transfer for      therapeutic use to be legislatively banned.       I am aware that there are bills in the Senate that would      fit the requirements that I have set out. Senator Feinstein      of my state along with Senator Kennedy has proposed such a      bill as has Senators Specter and Harkin. They make the      distinction between banning nuclear transfer for reproductive      purposes and continuing to allow nuclear transfer for      research and therapeutic purposes. These are bills that I can      support.           Sincerely yours,                                                  David Baltimore,     President.                                  ____                                      American Association for the                                       Advancement of Science,                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2002.       Dear Senator: The Board of Directors of the American      Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) recently      adopted a policy statement on human cloning. I am enclosing a      copy for your attention.       Citing the serious risks associated with the procedure, the      AAAS statement supports a legally enforceable ban on human      reproductive cloning. At the same time, however, it backs      stem cell research using cells derived with nuclear      transplantation techniques, a procedure sometimes called      therapeutic or research cloning. Such research offers      enormous potential health benefits. However, because it also      raises serious ethical, social, and religious concerns, it      must be conducted under close scrutiny by the federal      government.       AAAS is the world's largest general scientific society with      over 135,000 individual members and 275 affiliated societies      representing all fields of science and engineering. Founded      in 1848, it is also the publisher of Science magazine and has      long been a leader in promoting ethical and responsible      science.           Sincerely,                                                  Alan I. Leshner,                                          Chief Executive Officer.       Enclosure.                    AAAS Statement on Human Cloning       The American Association for the Advancement of Science      (AAAS) recognizes the intense debates within our society on      the issue of human cloning. Since 1997, AAAS has engaged the      public and various professional communities in dialogue on      the scientific and social issues associated with human      cloning and stem cell research. Those experiences form the      backdrop for this statement on human cloning.                        ban reproductive cloning       AAAS endorses a legally enforceable ban on efforts to      implant a human cloned embryo for the purpose of      reproduction. The scientific evidence documenting the serious      health risks associated with reproductive cloning, as shown      through animal studies, make it unconscionable to undertake      this procedure. At the same time, we encourage continuing      open and inclusive public dialogue, in which the scientific      community is an active participant, on the scientific and      ethical aspects of human cloning as our understanding of this      technology advances.      support stem cell research (including ``research cloning'')       AAAS supports stem cell research, including the use of      nuclear transplantation techniques (also known as research or      therapeutic cloning), in order to realize the enormous      potential health benefits this technology offers. Such      benefits are likely to be many years away. If they are to be      realized at all, however, it will only be through carefully      designed research subject to peer review. Because there are      religious, ethical, and social concerns raised by the      prospect of creating stem cells for research purposes, we      believe that research cloning should only proceed under close      scrutiny by the federal government over both the public and      private sectors.                     exercise appropriate oversight       A thorough assessment of existing guidelines and policy,      including consideration of possible new regulations specific      to this type of research, should be undertaken in light of      the concerns surrounding it.       Adopted by the AAAS Board of Directors, Boston,      Massachusetts, February 14, 2002.                                  ____                                              The American Society                                            of Human Genetics,                                   Bethesda, MD, February 5, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Society of Human      Genetics (ASHG) is a society of researchers and professionals      in human genetics that represents nearly 8000 scientists,      physicians, nurses, genetic counselors, and students actively      engaged in genetic discovery, teaching, and application of      knowledge of human genetics and the human genome.       As a major scientific organization whose members have broad      expertise and interest in matters related to human genetics,      and in the application of genetic knowledge to the well being      of people, the Society strives to be extremely thoughtful,      thorough and ethical in pondering many of the scientific      issues raised in public debate today. As stewards of the      field of human genetics elected by the membership of the      Society, the Board of Directors of ASHG affirms that basic      research and the development of future applications of that      research require the ongoing commitment to scientific      integrity and social responsibility that has served our      organization well for the last 50 years. In other words,      scientists must proceed with commitment to rigorous critical      evaluation and a heightened sense of responsibility to the      patients who entrust their life and health to us.       In concert with these principles, it is important for you      and your colleagues to know that the ASHG concurs      wholeheartedly with your bill ``The Human Cloning Prohibition      Act'' that bans reproductive human cloning but is finely      crafted so as not to prohibit new and evolving techniques      that could potentially change the course of human illness as      we know it today so that the collective quality of life is      enhanced for all of us. Dr. Bert Vogelstein, in his testimony      before the Labor Health and Human Services subcommittee on      December 4, 2001, so eloquently captured the distinction      surrounding two very different medical endeavors--     regenerative medicine and the cloning of a human--the former      being the potential key to the problem of immune rejection,      the latter being morally and medically unacceptable.       In closing, the Senate must be sure that any legislative      action only bans cloning to create a human being and does no      harm to legitimate biomedical research. Each Senate vote on      proposed legislation must make this distinction clear or any      ban would have profound negative impact on the advances that      have been made thus far in this pioneering and exciting      field.       We congratulate you and your fellow senators for your      insight and conviction to advancing the field of biomedical      research.           Sincerely yours,                                     Dr. P. Michael Conneally,                                                   ASHG President.                                        Dr. Joann A. Boughman,     ASHG Executive Vice President.                                  ____                                                   April 12, 2002.                  Closing Minds to Stem Cell Research       The United States Senate is about to consider legislation      that will determine the fate of a remarkable new form of      medical research known colloquially as ``therapeutic      cloning''. The research could lead to unprecedented      treatments for human disease, but has fallen prey to the      confused debate over human stem cell research on the one      hand, and the prospects of creating a cloned person on the      other--two very different exercises that are now intricately      entwined.       The debate has its roots in the medical potential of human      stem cells. All the tissues in our bodies arise from stem      cells that are found in the early human embryo. Over the past      several years, scientists have learned how to isolate and      propagate human stem cells. There is hope that we will      eventually be able to use these cells to more effectively      treat cancer, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's and      Parkinson's diseases, and others. This prospect has inspired      great hope among individuals with ailments that had      previously seemed incurable.       Human stem cells can be isolated in several ways. The most      visionary approach utilizes a procedure that was first dubbed      ``therapeutic cloning'', but should more accurately be termed      ``somatic cell nuclear transfer'' or simply ``nuclear      transplantation''. To perform nuclear transplantation,      scientists replace the genetic material of an unfertilized      human egg with that from an adult cell. The egg is then      induced to proliferate into a primitive structure known as      the ``blastocyst'', from which stem cells can be harvested.      Tissue derived from such stem cells would be immunologically      compatible with the donor of the genetic material, thus      circumventing rejection of the tissue when it is transplanted      into the donor in order to renew a failing organ.       Blastocysts produced by nuclear transplantation can also be      implanted into the uterus in order to produce fully developed      organisms that are genetically identical to the original      donors--``clones'' such as the celebrated sheep Dolly. The      prospect of using such ``reproductive cloning'' to create      humans is repugnant to most scientists and the general public      alike. Consequently, there is widespread support for      legislation that would prohibit the production of human      clones.       But the use of nuclear transplantation to obtain stem cells      is another matter. At the time stem cells would be isolated      from blastocysts produced by nuclear transplantation, the      structures are no larger than the head of a small pin, of the      order of 100-150 cells, and have no distinctive tissues--in      particular, no neural tissue. Moreover, they have been      obtained artificially, without even the intervention of      fertilization, and will not be used to produce cloned      individuals. They are biologically akin to the very early      embryos produced in fertility clinics by fertilization in      test tubes, except that they contain the genes of only one      individual rather     than those of two. The U.S. condones the discard of surplus      embryos made in fertility clinics. Why should it criminalize      the medical use of blastocysts produced by nuclear      transplantation? Unfortunately, the term      ``therapeutic'' cloning'' was originally used to describe      nuclear transplantation, so the procedure is now tarred      with the same brush as reproductive cloning. Rarely has      semantic inaccuracy been more misleading.       The Senate will be offered two very different legislative      approaches to nuclear transplantation. One approach,      sponsored by Senator Sam Brownback, would prohibit both      reproductive cloning and nuclear transplantation itself. The      other approach, sponsored in two similar forms by Senators      Dianne Feinstein and Edward Kennedy, and by Senators Tom      Harkin and Arlen Specter, would ban reproductive cloning, but      permit research with nuclear transplantation to go forward.      Also in the wings is a proposed moratorium on nuclear      transplantation as an alternative to full fledged      prohibition, but this has yet to take legislative form.       The Brownback bill is an onerous piece of legislation. It      would criminalize a form of medical research that is intended      to explore the prospects for stem cell therapies, not to      create cloned persons; importation of treatments developed in      other nations by the use of nuclear transplantation; even the      receipt of such therapies abroad. It holds out the prospect      of a U.S. diabetic returning from Great Britian--where the      production of stem cells by nuclear transplantation is      authorized--with a pancrease restored through the agency of      nuclear transplantation and finding herself a felon.       The proposed moratorium is not a satisfactory alternative.      It raises the specter of interminable discussion and      political machinations, perhaps stalling research on nuclear      transplantation indefinitely. The proponents of a moratorium      argue that ``the widespread creation of clonal embryos would      increase the risk that a human clone would be born, and would      further open the door to eugenic procedures.'' But nuclear      transplantation itself is in no way a ``eugenic procedure''.      And any legislative prohibition of reproductive cloning      automatically forbids the use of nuclear transplantation for      that purpose.       Congress should unite around legislation that would      prohibit reproductive cloning, but permit research on nuclear      transplantation to go forward under suitable regulations and      oversight. The makings of such legislation are already before      the Senate, in the form of the Feinstein-Kennedy and Specter-     Harkin bills. Legislation fashioned from these bills could      offer a forthright, progressive and humane solution to the      impasse over nuclear transplantation. The U.S. public      deserves no less.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to let you know that      the Association of American Universities has now adopted a      position on human cloning, which is attached. The AAU      represents 61 leading public and private research      universities in the United States and two in Canada.       Our university membership adopted this statement      unanimously, and we look forward to working with you to enact      legislation consistent with it, which would include the      legislation you have introduced on this topic, S. 1758.       Your leadership in the fight to ensure that appropriate      restrictions against human reproductive cloning are enacted,      while allowing important research on nuclear transplantation      to produce stem cells to continue, is most appreciated.           Cordially,                                                    Nils Hasselmo,                                                        President.       Enclosure.                     AAU Statement on Human Cloning       The Association of American Universities has a long history      of supporting academic and scientific freedom. It also      recognizes the importance of conducting research consistent      with ethical, legal, and safety requirements.       AAU strongly opposes human reproductive cloning, and      supports legislation to ban this practice. The National      Academy of Sciences (NAS) has concluded that cloning      procedures are currently not safe for humans and that no      responsible scientists or physicians are likely to undertake      to clone a human. We generally do not support legislation to      limit fields of research, but since some organizations have      announced an intention to clone humans, we concur with the      NAS that a legal ban is more likely to deter any attempt to      close a human than would any voluntary system or moratorium.      The ban should be reconsidered at five-year intervals, based      on current scientific knowledge.       In contrast to human reproductive cloning, AAU continues to      support both basic and applied stem cell research. AAU      therefore supports nuclear transplantation to produce stem      cells, also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, as      nonreproductive cloning, and as therapeutic cloning. AAU      concurs with the NAS that nuclear transplantation to produce      stem cells has considerable potential for advancing our      fundamental knowledge and developing new medical therapies to      treat debilitating diseases. Continuing the investigation of      stem cells produced by nuclear transplantation is the only      way to assure that the value of this nascent technology is      realized. Before applications to humans should be considered,      we need further study of cells derived from the process of      nuclear transplantation, subject to federal safeguards. This      research should proceed in parallel with other types of stem      cell research, including human embryonic and adult stem cell      research.       Adopted by the AAU Membership on April 23, 2002.                                  ____ Patient Stories From California Supporting Specter-Feinstein Approach                                on Cloning               From Stefanie Sonico in Cathedral City, CA       ``I totally and completely support stem cell research in      hopes that it will lead to a cure for juvenile diabetes and      other such devastating diseases. My son developed juvenile      diabetes at 20 months old and is now 16 years old. Without      stem cell research, his future is frightening. He does not      need to look forward to kidney failure, eye damage, heart      disease and stroke, and death 15 years before his time. He      needs to believe that the United States of America, a free      country, supports research, done by renowned scientists, to      find a cure for diabetes. He needs to believe that the United      States will not imprison scientists for their knowledge and      their skill. I am a Christian that believes that we have an      obligation to use our God-given brains and skills to better      mankind. The research I support involves a cell in a petri      dish that will produce cells to cure a disease like diabetes      and that is called therapeutic cloning. My son and the      millions of children like him, need the research and the      results that will come from therapeutic cloning. Thank you.''                  From Lisbeth Dermody in Monterey, CA       ``My son sustained a spinal cord injury 4 years ago and is      now a quadriplegic; my husband developed the first symptoms      of Parkinson's Disease 10 years ago and is now deteriorating      and experiencing Parkinson's dementia. Stem cell therapy is      our best hope that these two brilliant and productive men may      expect some improvement in their lives and an alleviation of      the psychological and physical suffering they endure every      hour of every day. I urge defeat of the Brownback Bill; I      urge support of intelligent and humane research that will      help my loved ones.''                    from hellen mueller, modesto, ca       ``I am a type 2 diabetic with severe neuropathy. Recently,      I had surgery for thyroid cancer and have lost the use of my      parathyroids. I look to science particularly the science of      cloning for help in treating my ailments. Life has become      difficult as I am in pain much of the time. Even normal      activities are limited for me. I would like to live the years      I have left relatively pain-free, diabetes free too.       My husband has terrible knees. He suffers from degenerative      cartilage and arthritis as does my sister. It would be      wonderful if they could be helped by SCNT [somatic cell      nuclear transplantation]. My husband is still able to work;      however he pays a great price in the pain that he suffers.      Only by using a large amount of pain killers is he able to      get thru a work day. My sister is very incapacitated by her      problems.       My sister's husband has had by-pass surgery which resulted      in cognitive problems. Stem cell research, cloning, etc seem      to be the only hope on the horizon.       In 1990 I lost a husband to ALS [Amyotropic Lateral      Sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease]. Today I understand      scientists are very hopeful that stem cell research will lead      to a cure for this killer. He was gone one year after      diagnosis. I was left without a husband, my son without a      father. What a miracle it would be if this could be avoided      for other people.''                                  ____   Summary of Human Subject Regulations as Incorporated Into Specter-                         Feinstein Legislation                      general research provisions     Types of Research Covered       Would cover ALL research involving somatic cell nuclear      transplantation, regardless of who performs it or whether it      is funded by the government.     Assurance and Certification Procedure       The institution conducting the research must: Submit a      statement of ``written assurance'' outlining the procedures      by which the institution will abide by federal regulations,      and certify that the research has been reviewed and approved      by an institutional review board (IRB) (see below for      definition of IRB).     Penalities       HHS may require that the project be terminated or suspended      if it finds an institution has failed to comply with federal      regulations       HHS may also require the institution to pay a civil penalty      of up to $250,000.                      definitions and requirements     Institutional Review Board (IRB)       Research institutions must establish (or hire outside)      Institutional Review Boards to     review and approve research involving somatic cell nuclear      transplantation. Each IRB must have at least five members.       In order to approve this research involving human subjects,      the IRB must determine that all of the following requirements      are satisfied: Risks to subjects are minimized and are      reasonable in relation to any anticipated benefits and      importance of the knowledge expected; selection of subjects      equitable; informed consent is sought and appropriately      documented from each subject; when appropriate, the research      plan makes adequate provision for monitoring and protecting      the data collected, to ensure the safety and privacy of      subjects; and when some of the subjects are likely to be      vulnerable to undue influence (such as mentally disabled or      disadvantaged persons), additional safeguards must be      included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of      these subjects.       The IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval      of research that fails to meet these requirements, or that      has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.     Informed Consent       No investigator may use a human subject in research unless      the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed      consent of the subject.       An investigator can seek consent only under circumstances      that minimize the possibility of undue influence.       No informed consent, whether oral for written, may include      any language through which the subject waives his legal      rights, or the investigator is released from liability for      negligence.       Basic elements of informed consent: The following      information must be provided to each subject: A statement      that the study involves research, an explanation of the      purposes of the research, the expected duration of the      subject's participation, a description of the procedures to      be followed, and identification of any procedures which are      experimental; a description of any reasonably foreseeable      risks or discomforts to the subjects; a description of any      benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be      expected from the research; a disclosure of appropriate      alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that      might be advantageous to the subject; a statement      describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of      records identifying the subject will be maintained; for      research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation      as to whether the subject will be compensated, and an      explanation as to whether any medical treatments are      available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist      of, or where further information may be obtained; an      explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent      questions about the research and research subjects'      rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-     related injury to the subject; and a statement that      participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will      involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the      subject is otherwise entitled, and that the subject may      discontinue participation at any time without penalty or      loss of benefits, to which the subject is otherwise      entitled.     Additional Protections for Pregnant Women and Fetuses       General Restrictions: Research on fetuses and pregnant      women cannot be undertaken, unless: Appropriate studies on      animals and nonpregnant individuals have been completed; the      risk to the fetus is caused solely by interventions or      procedures that hold out the prospect of direct benefit for      the woman or the fetus; or, if there is no such prospect of      benefit, the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal      and the purpose of the research is the development of      important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by      any other means; any risk is the least possible for achieving      the objectives of the research; if the research holds out the      prospect of direct benefit to the pregnant woman, the      prospect of a direct benefit both to the pregnant woman and      the fetus, or no prospect of benefit for the woman nor the      fetus when risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal and      the purpose of the research is the development of important      biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by any other      means, only the mother's consent is needed; if the research      holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely to the fetus      then the consent of both the pregnant woman and the father      must be obtained, except that the father's consent need not      be obtained if he is unable to consent because of      unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity or the      pregnancy resulted from rape or incest; individuals engaged      in the activity will have no part in (i) any decisions as to      the timing, method, and procedures used to terminate the      pregnancy, and (ii) determining the viability of the fetus at      the termination of the pregnancy; and no inducements,      monetary or otherwise, may be offered to terminate pregnancy      for purposes of the activity.                          ____________________
