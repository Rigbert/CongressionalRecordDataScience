President, I rise today in honor of Black History Month, a 76-year tradition recognizing and celebrating the contributions of African-Americans throughout our history.  Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the son of former slaves, earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago in my home State of Illinois, before continuing his studies at Harvard University and the Sorbonne in Paris. Since African-American history had barely begun to be studied or even documented, Dr. Woodson established what is now called the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and founded the Journal of Negro History. In 1926, he started Negro History Week and chose the second week of February because it marks the birthdays of two men who have had a great impact on African-Americans: Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Woodson and those who have followed him, we now celebrate the outstanding achievements of African-Americans past and present during the entire month of February.  Illinois has a rich African-American legacy. Gwendolyn Brooks was the first African-American poet to win the Pulitzer Prize, and in 1968, she was named the poet laureate of Illinois. In 1985-86, she was the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress and focused her efforts on encouraging elementary school students to write poetry.  Black History Month is also a celebration of lesser-known African-Americans, and I would like to recognize the far-reaching contributions of Illinoisan Lloyd Augustus Hall. Mr. Hall was a chemist who earned more than 100 patents in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. His work revolutionized the meatpacking industry, and his method for sterilizing spices is used today to sterilize medicine, medical supplies, and cosmetics. He was the first African-American elected to the National Board of Directors of the American Institute of Chemists, and President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the American Food for Peace Council in 1962.  Today, Illinoisans continue to build upon Dr. Woodson's legacy of preserving and celebrating African-American history. Last month, Jewish leaders at the Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois, released a restored recording of a speech Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gave there 44 years ago. It took months of digital forensic audio techniques to clean background noise and to convert the reel-to-reel tape to compact disc, but the effort was well worth it, and Dr. King's words then are still instructive today.  Dr. King observed that there had been three distinct periods in our nation's history of race relations: slavery, segregation, and desegregation. He also declared that the issue of civil rights is ``an eternal moral issue which may well determine the destiny of our nation'' and looked toward a fourth period--a period of real integration.  This month, we honor the great strides made by African-Americans in overcoming obstacles and color barriers. But I am afraid we have not yet reached Dr. King's goal of real integration. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has jumped to 9.8 percent, over four percentage points higher than the rate for all workers. The 2000 Presidential election illustrated the disenfranchisement of thousands of African-American voters nationwide, whose votes did not count. There is disturbing evidence that some law enforcement agencies and agents ``profile,'' or make pre-determinations about, people based on their race.  Dr. King noted the important role that we in the Federal Government must play in addressing issues such as these. In his 1958 speech at Beth Emet, he said, ``As we look to Washington, so often it seems that the judicial branch of the government is fighting the battle alone. The executive and legislative branches of the government have been all too slow and stagnant and silent, and even apathetic, at points. The hour has come now for the Federal Government to use its power, its constitutional power, to enforce the law of the land.''  The time indeed has come for Congress to show that it is no longer slow and certainly not apathetic. I have been working for several months to try to extend unemployment benefits and to help unemployed workers continue their health benefits. I proposed an amendment that would have increased weekly unemployment benefits by $25 or fifteen percent, whichever is greater. It also would have expanded coverage to part-time and low-wage workers, helping nearly 80 percent of the laid-off workers who currently are not receiving benefits.  In addition, I am an original cosponsor of the bipartisan election reform measure and introduced an amendment to eliminate the unnecessary special treatment of punchcard voting systems. The overwhelming majority of African-American and Hispanic voters use the punchcard system, which loses at least 50 percent more votes than optically-scanned paper ballots. My amendment would have reduced the number of these discarded votes by permitting a voter to verify the votes he or she selected on the ballot and notifying the voter if more than one candidate had been selected for a single office. The voter also would have had the opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error before the ballot was cast and counted.  I am also an original cosponsor of the End Racial Profiling Act of 2001, which prohibits law enforcement agencies and agents from engaging in racial profiling and provides for enforcement in civil court. This legislation would also require Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies receiving Federal grants to maintain adequate policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling. Furthermore, I have introduced the Reasonable Search Standards Act to prohibit U.S. Customs Service personnel from searching or detaining individuals based on racial and other discriminatory profiling criteria.  The official theme for this year's Black History Month is ``The Color Line Revisited: Is Racism Dead?'' This month, and every month, we must push forward until the answer to this question is a resounding ``Yes.'' We must continue to fight for economic opportunity, equal justice, and equity in education and health care. While we celebrate the accomplishments of African-Americans throughout our history, we must build upon those achievements, until we can finally reach Dr. King's vision of real integration.                          ____________________
