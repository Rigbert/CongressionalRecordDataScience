Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of former Congressman Steve LaTourette from Ohio who passed away in August.  I had the pleasure of serving with Steve throughout his time in the House and worked closely with him while we both sat on the Transportation Committee. Steve was a great legislator, and I admired his relentless dedication to cutting through the gridlock that often plagues D.C.  After leaving the House, Steve continued to be a voice of reason as he led the Republican Main Street Partnership. Steve's profound understanding of Congress as an institution and the dynamics we face as members will be missed.  Steve was a fine soul. He was never without a smile on his face, and I always enjoyed his rapier wit. I am glad to have counted him a friend.
