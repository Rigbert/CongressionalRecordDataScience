Chair, I just want to say that this is a very good amendment. It is bipartisan. It is critical that--I know our Great Lakes Caucus, on a bipartisan basis, in both bodies, the House and Senate, have taken strong actions against the Asian carp.  This is a good amendment. We are certainly prepared to accept it, and I commend you for taking the time on the floor.
