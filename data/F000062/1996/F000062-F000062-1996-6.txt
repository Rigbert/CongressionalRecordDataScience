 President, I echo the comments of my colleague, Senator Boxer, on the parks bill in the hopes that some accommodation can be formulated in the next few hours that will give us a bill.  One of the most difficult things about this body, and I suppose any other body, is that we do not always get what we would like to get or think we deserve in good conscience or what the body owes or what the Government should respond to. However, this is an important bill, and literally dozens of States are impacted, all of them positively, by this bill. For California, it is a particularly important bill.  I thank the chairman of the committee for his indulgence, and I hope in the next few hours there can be some conclusion to this which will bring before us a bill that is significant for every Member of this body.                          ____________________
