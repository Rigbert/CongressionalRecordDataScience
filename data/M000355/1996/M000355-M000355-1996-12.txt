 2106. A bill to amend the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to prohibit the placement of members of the United States Armed Forces under the command, direction, or control of the United Nations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.   the united nations participation act of 1945 amendment act of 1996 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for several months, I have tried to get a straight answer from the administration on the legal justification for the deployment of U.S. troops under United Nations' command in Macedonia. While the soldiers have a mission, I do not believe they have a clear, legal mandate.  The question of our involvement in Macedonia was first brought to my attention by Ron Ray, a constituent of mine who was representing Michael New. Apparently, Michael New asked his commanding officer to provide some explanation as to why an American Army specialist was being asked to wear a U.N. uniform and deploy to Macedonia under the U.N. flag.  In a recent hearing with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, usually one of the more plain spoken members of the President's foreign policy team, we reviewed the procedures for deploying American troops under the United Nation's flag. She offered the view that while there were clear guidelines defining chapter VII deployments, using chapter VI to justify a mission had evolved as a matter of U.N. custom and tradition.  Since 1948, 27 peace operations have been authorized by the United Nations Security Council. In addition to being authorized by a specific chapter of the United Nations Charter, U.S. troop deployments must be authorized consistent with U.S. legal requirements spelled out in the United Nations Participation Act.  In July 1993, President Clinton wrote the Congress stating, ``U.N. Security Council Resolution 795 established the UNPROFOR Macedonia mission under a chapter VI of the U.N. Charter and UNPROFOR Macedonia is a peacekeeping force under chapter VI of the Charter.'' But this assertion is not substantiated by the record of resolutions and reports passed by the United Nations.  Between 1991 and the end of 1995, the United Nations passed 97 Security Council resolutions related to the former Yugoslavia. In addition, 13 reports were issued by the U.N. Secretary General relative to the mandate of the UNPROFOR Macedonia operation. None of these resolutions or reports mention a chapter VI mandate for Macedonia. In fact, there are 27 resolutions which specifically refer to UNPROFOR, which includes Macedonia, as chapter VII. It is worth pointing to just one ofthese resolutions which states that the United Nations Security Council was ``Determined to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and its freedom of movement for all its missions (i.e., Macedonia) and to these ends was acting under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.''  In spite of the record, the administration continues to insist that Macedonia is a chapter VI operation. When I asked them to document this determination, I was provided the following guidance by the Acting Assistant Secretary of State:       The U.N. Charter authority underlying the mandate of a U.N.      peace operation depends on an interpretation of the relevant      resolutions of the U.N. Security Council. As a matter of      tradition, the Security Council explicitly refers to a      ``Chapter VII'' when it authorizes an enforcement operation      under that Chapter. The absence of a reference to Chapter VII      in a resolution authorizing or establishing a peacekeeping      operation thus indicates that the operation is not considered      by the Security Council to be an enforcement operation.      Neither does the Security Council refer explicitly to      ``Chapter VI'' in its resolutions pertaining to peacekeeping      operations. This practice evolved over time as a means for      the Security Council to develop practical responses to      problems without unnecessarily invoking the full panoply of      provisions regarding the use of force under Chapter VII, and      without triggering other Charter provisions that might impede      Member States on the Security Council if Chapter VI were      referenced.  In essence what this explanation means is U.S. troops can be deployed in harm's way as a matter of U.N. tradition rather than U.S. law. It means U.S. soldiers are deployed in a combat zone with an absence of reference to the actual legal mandate because the U.N. Security Council does not want to refer explicitly to chapter VI due to a reluctance to inconvenience member states on the Security Council.  Mr. President, let me try to add a little clarity to just what the Acting Assistant Secretary means when stating the administration does not want to invoke a ``panoply of provisions regarding the use of force.'' In simple English, when a chapter VII mission is authorized by the U.N., U.S. law requires the operation to be approved by the Congress. In simple terms, the State Department is using a chapter VI designation to avoid having to come to the Congress to justify the financial and military burden the United States has assumed in Macedonia.  When the State Department calls a panoply of provisions problem, I call surrendering U.S. interests to U.N. command. This is not the first time Congress has been circumvented. I had hoped the administration had learned from our experience in Somalia. I had hoped the tragic loss of life would help the President understand the value and importance of a full congressional debate and approval of the merits of deploying American soldiers overseas into hostile conditions. Apparently, the lesson is lost on this administration. When the U.N. calls, we send our young men and women to serve.  Mr. President, I have taken the time to review the circumstances of our military involvement in Macedonia, in order to explain why I am introducing legislation today which assures U.S. troops will not serve under U.N. commanders and will not be forced to wear a U.N. uniform. Our soldiers sign up to serve and pledge allegiance to their Nation--not the United Nations. This bill will protect them as they fulfill both their oath and responsibilities.                                 ______                                       By
