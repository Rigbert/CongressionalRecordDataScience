Speaker, this morning's Wall Street Journal discloses that the conservative Heritage Foundation is holding a closed-door, Republicans-only meeting to discuss changes in Federal telecommunications policy, changes involving billions of dollars.  The list of participants include Chairman Rupert Murdoch, owner of the same publishing company that has offered the Speaker a multimillion-dollar book contract.  Mr. Speaker, this closed-door meeting and the special interests attending it make it clear why your multimillion-dollar book deal is an issue which will not go away. It is time for at least full disclosure of your book deal, and as painful as it may be, it is time to realize good government may require you, Mr. Speaker, to end this book deal once and for all.                          ____________________
