 President, today I wish to honor David Hurd on his passing.  David was 86 years old, but his family and friends would tell you he packed much more into his years than even his long life would suggest.  He was a prominent businessman, chief executive officer of the Principal Financial Group from 1989 to 1994, and a member of the Iowa Business Hall of Fame.  He is credited with helping to build Principal into the global powerhouse company it is today.  David also was a well-regarded civic leader.  He wasn't a native Iowan, but Des Moines became his home in 1954 when he came to work for what was then Banker's Life, now Principal Financial.  Having lived in Des Moines for so many years, he became an advocate and an activist for making Des Moines an attractive place to live and work.  Des Moines is a thriving city today, and David did a lot to contribute to its success.  It was fitting that his longtime home was a high-rise building downtown, right in the middle of everything, where he could enjoy the benefits of city living and watch Des Moines change in so many positive ways.  David also held many hobbies and interests in diverse areas: running, patronizing the arts, playing Scrabble, rowing, protecting the environment, and more.  He made friends across these many fields who were united in their regard for his zest for life, sense of humor, and intellectual curiosity.  The phrase ``renaissance man'' is sometimes overused, but in David Hurd's case, it is 100-percent accurate.  Des Moines and the State of Iowa are richer for having had this renaissance man in our midst.                          ____________________
