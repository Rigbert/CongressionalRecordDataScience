 President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Kyl, to once again introduce a constitutional amendment to provide rights for victims of violent crime.  We have achieved significant progress in our effort to pass the amendment. After working extensively--indeed, exhaustively--with prosecutors, law professors, the Justice Department, the White House Counsel's Office, and leaders of victims groups from around the country to carefully craft and hone the amendment's language, we succeeded in bringing the amendment to markup in the Judiciary Committee.  After numerous committee business meetings, and one of the most high-minded debates in which I have been privileged to participate, the Judiciary Committee passed the amendment by a strong, bipartisan vote. Unfortunately, with the press of final business at the end of the Congress, there was not sufficient time to consider the amendment on the Senate floor and work it through the House.  So here we are now, carrying the fight forward into this new, 106th Congress. We are fighting to ensure that the 8.6 million victims of violent crime in the country receive the fair treatment by the judicial system which they deserve. Too often in America victims of violent crime are victimized a second time, by the government.  Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. What really focused my attention on the need for greater protection of victims' rights was a particularly horrifying case in 1974, in San Francisco, when a man named Angelo Pavageau broke into the house of the Carlson family in Portero Hill.  Pavageau tied Mr. Carlson to a chair, bludgeoning him to death with a hammer, a chopping block, and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly raped Carlson's 24-year-old wife, breaking several of her bones. He slit her wrist, tried to strangle her with a telephone cord, and then, before fleeing, set the Carlson's home on fire--cowardly reteating into the night, leaving this family to burn up in flames.  But Mrs. Carlson survived the fire. She courageously lived to testify against her attacker. But she has been forced to change her name and continues to live in fear that her attacker may, one day, be released. When I was Mayor of San Francisco, she called me several times to notify me that Pavageau was up for parole. Amazingly, it was up to Mrs. Carlson to find out when his parole hearings were.  Mr. President, I believe this case represents a travesty of justice--It just shouldn't have to be that way. I believe it should be the responsibility of the state to send a letter through the mail or make a phone call to let the victim know that her attacker is up for parole, and she should have the opportunity to testify at this hearing.  But today, in many states in this great nation, victims still are not made aware of the accused's trial, many times are not allowed in the courtroom during the trial, and are not notified when a convicted offender is released from prison.  I have vowed to do everything in my power to add a bit of balance to our nation's justice system. This is why Senator Kyl and I have crafted the Crime Victim's Rights Amendment before us today.  The people of California were the first in the nation to pass a crime victims' amendment to the state constitution in 1982--the imitative Proposition 8--and I supported its passage. This measure gave victims the right to restitution, the right to testify at sentencing, probation and parole hearings, established a right to safe and secure public school campuses, and made various changes in criminal law. California's Proposition 8 represented a good start to ensure victims' rights.  Since the passage of Proposition Eight, 31 more states have passed constitutional amendments guaranteeing the rights of crime victims. Just this past November, Mississippi, Montana and Tennessee added victims' rights amendments to their state constitutions. These amendments were overwhelmingly supported by the voters, winning with 93%, 71% and 89% of the vote, respectively.  But citizens in other states lack these basic rights. The 32 different state constitutional amendments differ from each other, representing a patchwork quilt of rights that vary from state to state. And even in those states which have state amendments, criminals can assert rights grounded in the federal constitution to try to trump those rights.  The United States Constitution guarantees numerous rights to the accused in our society, all of which were established by amendment to the Constitution. I steadfastly believe that this nation must attempt to guarantee, at the very least, some basic rights to the millions victimized by crime each year.  For those accused of crimes in this country, the Constitution specifically protects:  The right to a grand jury indictment for capital or infamous crimes;  The prohibition against double jeopardy;  The right to due process;  The right to a speedy trial and the right to an impartial jury of one's peers;  The right to be informed of the nature and cause of the criminal accusation;  The right to confront witnesses;  The right to counsel;  The right to subpoena witnesses--and so on.  However, nowhere in the text of the U.S. Constitution does there appear any guarantee of rights for crime victims.  To rectify this disparity, Senator Kyl and I are putting forth this Crime Victims' Rights Amendment. This provides for certain rights for victims of crime:  The right to be notified of public proceedings in their case;  The right not be excluded from these proceedings;  The right to be heard at proceedings to determine a release from custody, sentencing, or acceptance of a negotiated plea;  The right to notice of the offender's release or escape;  The right to consideration for the interest of the victim in a trial free from unreasonable delay;  The right to an order of restitution from the convicted offender;  The right to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any release from custody; and  The right to notice of your rights as a victim.  Conditions in our nation today are significantly different from those in 1789, when the founding fathers wrote the Constitution without providing explicitly for the rights of crime victims. In 1789, there weren't 9 million victims of violent crime every year. In fact, there are more victims of violent crime each year in this country now than there were people in the country when the Constitution was written.  Moreover, there is good reason why defendants' rights were embedded in the Constitution in 1789 and victims' rights were not--the way the criminal justice system worked then, victims did not need any guarantee of these rights.  In America in the late 18th century and well into the 19th century, public prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence criminal cases themselves, by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant, and initiating a private prosecution. The core rights in our amendment--to notice, to attend, and to be heard--were inherently made available to the victim. As Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, observed, ``At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often hired a prosecutor.''  Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private prosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in recent years (the rate of violent crime has more than quadrupled over the last 35 years), it became easier and easier for the victim to be left aside in the process.  As other scholars have noted:       With the establishment of the prosecutor the conditions for      the general alienation of the victim from the legal process      further increase. The victim is deprived of his ability to      determine the course of a case and is deprived of the ability      to gain restitution from the proceedings. Under such      conditions the incentives to report crime and to cooperate      with the prosecution diminish. As the importance of the      prosecution increases, the role of the victim is transformed      from principal actor to a resource that may be used at the      prosecutor's discretion.  Thus, we see why the Constitution must be amended to guarantee these rights:  There was no need to guarantee these rights in the Constitution in 1789;  The criminal justice system has changed dramatically since then; and  The prevalence of crime in America has changed dramatically creating the need and circumstances to respond to these developments and restore balance in the criminal justice system by guaranteeing the rights of violent crime victims in the Constitution.  Among the amendment's supporters are Professor Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School.  Let me just briefly quote portions of his testimony from the House hearing on the amendment last Congress:       The rights in question--rights of crime victims not to be      victimized yet again through the process by which government      bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and release the      accused or convicted offender--are indisputably basic human      rights against government, rights that any civilized system      of justice would aspire to protect and strive never to      violate.       [O]ur Constitution's central concerns involve protecting      the rights of individuals to participate in all those      government processes that directly and immediately involve      those individuals and affect their lives in some focused and      particular way . . . The parallel rights of victims to      participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even      though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit      text of the U.S. Constitution.       The fact that the States and Congress, within their      respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative      authority to enact rules protecting these rights is . . . not      a reason for opposing an amendment altogether . . . The      problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience      to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection      whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit,      traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an      accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are      genuinely threatened.  Some people argue that state victims' rights amendments are sufficient.  However, crime victims throughout the country, including those in the other 18 states, deserve to have rights, just as we applied civil rights to people throughout our great nation 30 years ago.  Moreover, state amendments lack the force that a federal constitutional amendment would have, and too often are given short shrift:  Maryland has a state amendment. But when Cheryl Rae Enochs Resch was beaten to death with a ceramic beer mug by her husband, her mother was not notified of this killer's early release only two and a half years into his ten year sentence, and was not given the opportunity to be heard about this release, in violation of the state amendment.  Arizona has a state amendment. But an independent audit of victim-witness programs in four Arizona counties, including Maricopa County where Phoenix is located, found that:  Victims were not consistently notified of hearing during which conditions of a defendant's release were discussed . . .  Victims were not consistently . . . conferred with by prosecutors regarding plea bargains . . .; and  Victims were not consistently . . . provided with an opportunity to request post-conviction notification.  Ohio has a state amendment. But when the murderer of Maxine Johnson's husband change his plea, Maxine was not notified of the public hearing, and then was not given the opportunity to testify at his sentencing, as provided for in Ohio law.  A Justice Department-supported study of the implementation of state victims' rights amendments, released last year, made similar findings:       Even in states with strong legal protections for victims'      rights, the Victims' Rights study revealed that many victims      are denied their rights. Statutes themselves appear to be      insufficient to guarantee the provision of victims' rights.       Nearly two-thirds of crime victims, even in states with      strong victims' rights protection, were not notified that the      accused offender was out on bond.       Nearly half of all victims, even in the strong protection      states, did not receive notice of the sentencing hearing--     notice that is essential if they are to exercise their right      to make a statement at sentencing.       A substantial number of victims reported that they were not      given an opportunity to make a victim impact statement at      sentencing or parole.  State amendments simply are not enough--they provide different rights in different states, they do not exist at all in others, and they are too often ignored when they do exist.  We implore members of this body to examine this amendment, and to help to secure passage of this monumental piece of legislation.  The text of the amendment which we are introducing today is the very same text which the Judiciary Committee passed on a strong bipartisan basis last summer. Sen Kyl and I urge the leaders of the Senate and of the committee to move this amendment expeditiously, so that the clock does not run out on us yet again. This amendment has been the subject of three Senate hearings, two hearings in the House, and an extensive examination and debate in the Judiciary Committee.  We urge Senators Hatch, the distinguished Chairman of the committee, to schedule a hearing on the amendment in January or February, with a markup to follow shortly thereafter. It is our hope that the committee can complete its action with all deliberate speed, and we call upon our distinguished Leaders, Senators Lott and Daschle, to commit to a floor vote on the amendment during National Victims' Rights Week in late April.  After two hundred years, doesn't this Nation owe something to the millions of victims of violent crime? I believe that is our obligation and should be our biggest priority--not only for the crime victims, but, for all Americans--to ensure passage of a Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment.  I want to personally thank Senator Kyl for his tireless efforts to accomplish this amendment, and to say that I look forward to continuing to work with him in the months to come.                                 ______                                       By
