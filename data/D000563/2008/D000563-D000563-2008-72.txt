President, at 12:30 today the Senate will consider a procedural motion to go to the Amtrak reauthorization bill. I am urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.  For a long time Amtrak has been a question mark in Washington--will it survive? Do we need it? It will survive if we have the will to support it.
