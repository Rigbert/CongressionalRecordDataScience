Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a component of a broad effort in Alaska to resolve a long running debate over subsistence hunting and fishing. This amendment affects no other State. It concerns only Alaska.  My amendment extends until October 1, 2000, a current moratorium on a Federal takeover of Alaska's fish and game resources. However, the extension of the moratorium is effective only if the State of Alaska adopts a constitutional amendment to resolve the subsistence debate. If a constitutional amendment is not in place by December 1, 1998, the moratorium does not extend under this amendment.  Now the State of Alaska has until election day to decide whether to amend its Constitution. I am hopeful my State can come to a resolution in time. But I strongly believe my amendment is necessary to forestall and prevent a Federal takeover while the State proceeds in this effort.  A Federal moratorium is necessary because Federal control of Alaska fish and game would be devastating to the wildlife, and especially the people of Alaska. A Federal takeover is not my choice, and should not be Alaska's choice either.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of my amendment.
