Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me one additional time.  I am constrained to say with all the charity in my heart that, of course, you didn't violate the PAYGO rule, you eliminated the PAYGO rule. So it was not an issue on your side.  We have reinstated the PAYGO rule, which was adopted, as the gentleman knows, in a bipartisan way, and supported again in 1997, overwhelmingly adopted by the bipartisan Republicans and Democrats in this House and in the Senate. We hope that the PAYGO rule will lead us back from the abyss of what we believe to be a fiscally dire situation to a point that we were in 2001, where we had the President of the United States, President Bush, projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus. We are now, for various reasons, in part because we did not comply with and didn't have a PAYGO rule, confronted by a deficit in excess of $3 trillion.  So I say to my friend, I share his view that we need to comply with the PAYGO rule. We adopted a PAYGO rule, we intend to comply with it, and we intend to move towards restoring the fiscal discipline that we had. I think, working together, we can do that.
