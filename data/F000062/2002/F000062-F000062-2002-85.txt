 Our bill is already co-sponsored by Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, Wyden, Corzine, Leahy, Durbin, and Boxer.  The Senate Agriculture Committee held a hearing on this bill yesterday and I understand it is the intentions of the chairman and ranking member to try and have a bill that can be marked up before the recess.  The bill closes the loophole that was created when Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000 which exempted on-line energy and metals trading from regulatory oversight.  The bill is supported by: The New York Mercantile Exchange, The Pacific Exchange, Aquila Energy Corporation, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Mid-America Energy Holding Company, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, Calpine, The Apache Corporation, The American Public Gas Association, The American Public Power Association, The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Association, The California Municipal Utilities Association, The Consumers Union, The Consumer Federation of America, The Derivatives Study Center, The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association U.S. PIRG, The Transmission Access Policy Study Group, The Sierra Club, and all four FERC Commissioners.  This bill could not be more timely in light of what we have learned about the energy sector in the past couple of months and the operations of these energy companies: 1. CMS Energy admitted that 80 percent of its trades were round trip or wash trades and were made simply to increase volume; 2. Reliant admitted to $6.4 billion in wash trades from 1999-2001 which the company characterized as energy swaps; 3. Duke confessed to $2 billion in wash trades and stated that $650 million of these trades were executed on the Inter-Continental Exchange, ICE, and electronic trading facility exempt from CFTC oversight because of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.  But electronic exchanges like ICE have no responsibility for trades or wash trades executed on its exchange and does not even have any responsibility for checking that a transaction has been executed. Thus, a company that wanted to manipulate prices or game the market would not have to even execute a single trade.  In the past year, 12 of the largest energy companies in the U.S. have lost about $188 billion of capital, accounting for 71 percent of the market value. The credit ratings of several of those energy companies have been severely downgraded; some are at junk bond or near-junk bond status.  In May, 2000, a severe energy crisis began in California. Electricity that had typically sold for about $30 a Megawatt hour all of a sudden started selling for 10 times that. This led to the bankruptcy of California's largest utility and the near-bankruptcy of California's second largest utility. It also resulted in overcharges of billions of dollars to California ratepayers and taxpayers.  In November, California encountered a natural gas crisis. Natural gas is the main cost component of electricity. At one point gas was selling for $12 per decatherm in San Juan New Mexico and $59 in Southern California when the cost to transport it was less than one dollar.  Just about the time Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act exempting electronic energy trading exchanges from oversight, the crisis began spreading to the other western states. For more than six months Oregon, Washington, and the other Western States experienced the same price spikes as California.  The entire crisis lasted for more than a year while energy companies like Reliant, Enron, Duke, Williams, and AES enjoyed record revenues and profits. Obviously we are all a bit wiser today about energy markets and about wash trades in particular.  Wash trades or round trip trades involve two or more companies plotting together to execute offsetting trades. These trades would be illegal if they were done on NYMEX, the Chicago Merc, or the Pacific Exchange and those exchanges would have the responsibility to report it.  However, there is no such reporting or enforcement requirement on electronic exchanges because as I said before, the CFMA created a big loophole. This legislation would ensure that wash trades are subject to full CFTC oversight no matter where they are done.  And of course there is Enron which controlled a large share of the energy market while they engaged in activities that were downright illegal. Many of these activities could have been prevented or at least stopped if regulators simply had the proper authority and the will.  Let me recap what happened with the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. In November, 1999, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the CFTC and the Department of Treasury produced a study titled Over the Counter Derivative Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act, A Report of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets.  It was signed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and CFTC Chairman Bill Rainer.  The report said that the case had not been made that energy or other tangible commodities should be exemptedform CFTC oversight. The report found that because of the immaturity of the energy market, the lack of liquidity in the market and finite supplies, in energy markets, energy markets were more susceptible to manipulation than the deep and liquid financial markets.  Recent history has certainly borne that to be correct; these commodities are more subject to manipulation!  On June 21, 2000 shortly after the President's Working Group issued its report, the Banking Committee and Agriculture Committee held a hearing on the Report and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.  Let me read from that committee report:       The Commission has reservations about the bill's exclusions      of Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives from the Commodities      Exchange Act. On this point he bill diverges from the      recommendations of the President's Working Group, which      limited the proposed exclusions to financial derivatives. The      Commission believes the distinction drawn by the Working      Group between financial (non-tangible) and non-financial      transactions was a sound one and respectfully urges the      Committees to give weight to that distinction.  And the Senate Agriculture Committee marked up the Commodity Futures Modernization Act consistent with what was in the President's Working Group Report.  That version of the bill however, was not reflected in the final provision that passed Congress as part of a much bigger bill at the end of the 106th Congress.  I urge my colleagues in Congress to pass this legislation and fix this problem as soon as possible.                          ____________________
