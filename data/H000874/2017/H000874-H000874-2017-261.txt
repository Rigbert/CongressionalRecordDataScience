Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to ========================= END NOTE =========================   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, the House will consider several reform bills straight from our Better Way agenda:  First, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Further Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, sponsored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, which ensures that only similarly injured parties can be in the same class for purposes of a class action suit, as well as requires public disclosure of reports on the receipt and disposition of claims for injuries based on exposure to asbestos.  Next, H.R. 725, the Innocent Party Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Ken Buck, which establishes a uniform standard for determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a lawsuit.  And third, H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, sponsored by Chairman Lamar Smith, which restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits.  Our Federal litigation system is plagued with broken rules that unnecessarily harm American businesses and consumers. With these measures, we will follow through on our pledge to take on trial lawyers and crack down on lawsuit abuse through meaningful litigation reform.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider the Fiscal Year 2017 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, sponsored by Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen.
