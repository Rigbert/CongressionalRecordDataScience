President, I am pleased with the Chairman in offering this important legislation, the Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998, to combat international crime.  Crime and terrorism increasingly have an international face. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are just the most recent reminders of how vulnerable we are to terrorist attacks. In a shockingly brutal attack, more than 250 men, women and children, were murdered in cold blood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow citizens. And none of us can forget that it was only a short time ago that there was another assault right here at home, in the Capitol itself.  With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it.  This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. The bill offers tools and protection to investigators and prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy.  I initially introduced some of the provisions of this bill as early as April 30, 1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs Act in Prisons of 1998 with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden many of these provisions set forth in the bill on behalf of the Administration in S. 2303, the International Crime Control Act of 1998. I again included almost all of the provisions in another major anti-crime bill, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998, on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli.  It is a particular pleasure now to be able to draw from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete, very important improvements that can enjoy bipartisan support, and which I hope and trust can be enacted into law, even in the short time remaining in this session. All of these provisions enjoy the full support of the Administration, and each of them is a law enforcement priority.  The bill would criminalize murder and other serious crimes committed by organized crime against U.S. nationals abroad, and against state and local officials who are working abroad with federal authorities on joint projects or operations.  The bill also protects our maritime borders by providing realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to ``heave to'' or otherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able to stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity.  The bill also increases our authority to exclude from entry into our country international criminals and terrorists, including those engaged in flight to avoid prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug trafficking under specific circumstances. At the same time, we ensure that the Attorney General hasfull authority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons.  The bill includes important money laundering provisions. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh noted the importance of money laundering laws as a tool in stopping not only international drug kingpins, but also international terrorists, such as Usama bin Laden, the multi-millionaire terrorist who has been linked to the recent embassy bombings.  The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it provides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover computer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over access device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, where the victim of the fraud is within the U.S.  We cannot do it all alone, however. This bill facilitates international cooperation by allowing our country to share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage participation by those countries. It streamlines procedures for executing MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. Furthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role of state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, and authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their cooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our prosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission of foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, the bill would speed the wheels of justice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited with any time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges in our country.  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I must close with a special thanks to my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. It has been pleasure to work closely with him to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.                                 ______                                       By
