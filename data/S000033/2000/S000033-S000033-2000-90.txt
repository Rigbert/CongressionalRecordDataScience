 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson), if I might, he is, of course, a Republican; and I would imagine that he is familiar with the 1997 Republican budget resolution which touched on this issue. So let me quote it for him. This is from the Republican budget resolution of 1997:  ``The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars on research and development since the oil crisis in 1973 triggered this activity. Returns on this investment have not been cost effective, particularly for applied research and development, which industry has ample incentive to undertake.''  I think that is the point that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) is trying to make.  Some of this activity is simply corporate welfare for the oil, gas, and utility industries. Much of it duplicates what industry is already doing. Some has gone to fund technology in which the market has no interest.  That is not me. That is the Republican budget resolution of 1997 regarding the Fossil Fuel Energy Research and Development Program.  I do not often agree with the Republican budgeteers, but I think on this one they are right.
