 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged of the following resolutions: S.J. Res. Nos. 27 through 48 and the Senate proceed to their en bloc consideration; further, that the Senate debate the resolutions concurrently, and that at 11:30 on Thursday, June 20, the Senate vote on passage of the resolutions in the following order: S.J. Res. 36, S.J. Res. 38, and then vote on the remaining resolutions en bloc with no intervening action or debate. Finally, if the Senate receives a veto message with respect to any or all of the enumerated joint resolutions of disapproval, then, not withstanding rule XXII, consideration of the veto message be limited to 30 hours of concurrent debate for all messages and the Senate vote on passage of the joint resolutions, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, in the following order if a veto message is received: S.J. Res. 36, S.J. Res. 38, all remaining joint resolutions en bloc. I further ask that the en bloc votes on passage and with respect to the override vote be shown separately for each resolution when printed in the Record.
