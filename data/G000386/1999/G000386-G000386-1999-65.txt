 President, I add to what the Senator from Nevada has said about bringing this bill, hopefully, to finality within just the last few days of this session, and I remind everybody that should be possible because of the bipartisan cooperation we had in drawing up the bill that brought the Senate to this point, as well as the fact that similar legislation passed last year on a vote of 97-1, I believe.  I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending Moynihan amendment aside.
