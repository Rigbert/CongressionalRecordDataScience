Speaker, it is with mixed emotion that I say goodbye to my dear friend and colleague, Tony Hall.  Anyone who knows Tony, knows him to be one of the most considerate, and kindest gentlemen ever to grace this House with his presence. There is a reason why he has been nominated three times for the Nobel Peace Prize, where most of us would be honored just to be considered once.  Tony's commitment to the survival of children, particularly in poor countries, along with his support of development assistance programs in the world's neediest countries, makes him eminently qualified to represent the United States to the United Nations food and agriculture agencies in Rome. Tony's work and dedication in promoting hunger relief programs and improving international human rights conditions is legendary. I still remember when, nine years ago, in an effort to draw attention to the plight of hungry people in the US and around the world, he fasted for three weeks in response to the abolishment of the Hunger Committee.  Mr. Speaker, it's this dedication and compassion that will make Tony an excellent Ambassador. While the House will lose a dear and respected friend once he is confirmed by the Senate, the United Nations will gain a fair and principled man who, I am certain, will do wonders for the poor and needy of the world.  Though I am sad to see Tony leave, I am happy for him, and for all the good work that lies ahead of him.                          ____________________
