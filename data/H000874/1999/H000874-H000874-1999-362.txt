Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated volunteer and advocate, Leo Smith.  Mr. Smith, a tireless defender of social justice, died Wednesday, January 13th at the age of 80 after a lifetime of standing up for what he believed in.  Remembered by many as conscientous, Mr. Smith belonged to many church and public service groups including several that looked out for the rights of seniors. Working with a Southern Maryland group that aimed to improve housing conditions and eliminate open-air drug markets, he was often a mentor and a leader.  Mr. Smith was a founding member of the local chapter of the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) and was the La Plata Richard R. Clark Senior Center's representative in 1994. It was in that year that the AARP, Sheriff's office, State Police and La Plata police signed an agreement to form TRIAD to both reduce crime and help seniors become more aware of protecting themselves.  Occasionally described as controversial because he went all out for what he believed, Mr. Smith was described by one of his co-workers as ``a selfless community servant''. The seniors of Charles County and the citizens of Southern Maryland will sorely miss his enthusiastic spirit and informed voice.  Leo Smith was born in Washington, DC and served in WWII in the U.S. Navy. He worked for 30 years for the U.S. Government in Greenbelt at NASA. He is survived by his wife Mary, five sons and six daughters.                          ____________________
