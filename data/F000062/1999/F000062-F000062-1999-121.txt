 President, I thank the Chair.  I want to begin by thanking the Senator from Georgia. We have been at this for a few years now. I want him to know it has been a great pleasure for me to work with him, and I thank him for the leadership and the spirit he has shown on this issue.  It has been very heartening for me to work across that center divide and hopefully see this amendment finally enacted today, and hopefully after going to the House in conference, come back here, and then be signed by the President.
