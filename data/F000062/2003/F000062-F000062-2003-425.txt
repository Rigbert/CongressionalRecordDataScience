 President, I rise to state my opposition to the fiscal year 2004 budget conference report.  At a time when the United States is engaged in a war and will shortly begin a massive reconstruction effort whose costs are still unknown, at a time of growing deficits and rising debt, and at a time of increasing entitlement spending and increasing interest payments to service that debt, it is highly irresponsible for Congress to engage in such unprecedented maneuvering and gamesmanship to try to force through an overlarge, unstimulative, and unnecessary tax cut.
