Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of the House of Representatives a very momentous event which occurred on September 25, 2000 and involved two constituents of mine: Willy and Thekla (Stein) Nordwind of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  After more than five decades of denials, avoidance and legal maneuvering, Germany--for the first time--returned to the rightful heirs, a major work of art previously confiscated by the Third Reich. On September 25, the Lovis Corinth painting, Walchensee, Johannisnacht (The Walchensee on Saint John's Eve) was returned to the heirs of Gustav and Clara Stein Kirstein in a ceremony which took place in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Thekla (Stein) Nordwind, niece of the Kirstein's, is the representative of the rightful heirs to whom the art was returned. Both Thekla (Stein) Nordwind and her husband, Willy Nordwind, were in Berlin for the ceremony.  As a result of this event, Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman of the World Jewish Congress' Commission for Art Recovery, stated, ``After one year of negotiations, we hope this first step will correct some past injustices and that all works of art belonging to families of Holocaust victims will be returned. We will never forget the millions of lives that were broken or lost. We honor that memory by contributing to closing one of the darkest chapters in 20th-century cultural history.''  Thekla (Stein) Nordwind said she accepted the painting, ``Not only on behalf of the heirs of her aunt and uncle, but on behalf of so many others who want and need some acknowledgement and recognition of the devastation suffered by their families. Although no one can restore what was truly lost to so many families, the return of this painting is a symbol of the wish of the German Government to atone for the sins of the past.''  I commend Willy and Thelka (Stein) Nordwind for their pursuit of justice and their perseverance, and I wish them all the best in the future.                          ____________________
