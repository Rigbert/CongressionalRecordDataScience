Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday and Tuesday, no votes are expected in the House.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act, sponsored by Representative Jackie Walorski. This package of bills will reduce unnecessary burdens on employers by restoring the 40-hour full-time workweek, providing relief from the employer mandate, delaying the Cadillac tax until 2023, and saving small businesses time and money in compliance costs.  Mr. Speaker, the House also plans to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House, including WRDA, which represents a critical investment in America's infrastructure. As soon as items are added to our schedule, I will be sure to inform all Members.
