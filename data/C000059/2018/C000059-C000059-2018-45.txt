 Before I go into details about the bill, I would like to commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for his leadership and support throughout this process.  As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2019 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $35.252 billion, which is equal to the FY18 enacted level.
