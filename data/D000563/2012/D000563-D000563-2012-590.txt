I will try to fill that time with something interesting. The United States has the best markets in the world. Because of strong regulation and oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies, our markets are transparent and investors get accurate detailed information. One hundred million Americans depend on the strong regulated markets when they are making their savings for retirement or college. This is a creation that began back after the Great Depression, when Franklin Roosevelt said we needed to establish the appropriate regulatory agencies to set the economy on the right track and keep it there.  Strong oversight has helped pension fund managers who count on safety and transparency so they can provide pension benefits to millions of American retirees, and investors from around the world bring their money here because of our investor protections. Yet the Senate is considering a House-passed capital formation bill that rolls back the very protections that make our markets the best in the world.  Supporters of this bill claim investors will jump at the opportunity to invest in a company as soon as we reduce disclosure, auditing, and accounting standards. They say this is a perfect way to create jobs. But why should investors choose to invest in companies under conditions that do less to protect their money? Why should investors who were burned during the dot-com crash put more capital in companies that are exempt from the same rules we put in place to ensure it would never happen again? Why would investors who were left with nothing after the financial crisis because of risky behavior by executives with golden parachutes find companies exempt from compensation standards more attractive?  The answer is they will not. The ones who do will be more exposed to deceit and fraud. The result will not be more jobs, it will be less transparency, less accountability. Professor John Coats of Harvard Law School agrees. Here is what he said: ``[T]he proposals could not only generate front-page scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being promoted to increase: job growth.''  Listen to what SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner said:       The proposed legislation is a dangerous and risky      experiment with US capital markets. . . . I do not believe it      will add jobs but may certainly result in investor losses.  The House-passed bill, as written, will not create jobs, but let me tell you what it will do. It will exempt firms with more than $1 billion in revenue--that is 90 percent of the newly public companies--more than $1 billion of annual revenue exempted from the standards that help ensure audits based on facts, not on who is managing the auditor's contract. These are the same internal controls we just adopted after Enron, after we were burned there, after investors lost their money, after pension funds lost their investment, after people lost their jobs. We set up standards and said: Let it never happen again.  In this euphoria, we are going to repeal the Enron standards for these companies. This bill would allow companies to use billboards and cold calls to lure unsophisticated investors with the promise of making a quick buck investing in new companies.  According to the New York Times, it will allow anyone with an idea to post that idea online and raise $1 million without ever providing financial statements. This is a scam. How many times have we picked up our cell phones to see there is a Nigerian opportunity out there? Be prepared after this bill passes. They will not be from Nigeria; they may be from next door. We are giving them the opportunity to ask people all across America for their hard-earned savings on investments that are not backed with financial statements.  Last Friday, SEC Commissioner Aguilar joined the Chairman of the SEC Mary Schapiro in raising concerns about this House-passed bill. Is thatnot fair warning that we ought to least have a hearing on this bill before it passes?  I ask unanimous consent to have Commissioner Aguilar's statement printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   [From the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mar. 16, 2012]        Investor Protection Is Needed for True Capital Formation                   (By Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar)       Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606,      the ``Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.'' It is clear to      me that H.R. 3606 in its current form weakens or eliminates      many regulations designed to safeguard investors. I must      voice my concerns because as an SEC Commissioner, I cannot      sit idly by when I see potential legislation that could harm      investors. This bill seems to impose tremendous costs and      potential harm on investors with little to no corresponding      benefit.       H.R. 3606 concerns me for two important reasons. First, the      bill would seriously hurt investors by reducing transparency      and investor protection and, in turn, make securities law      enforcement more difficult. That is bad for ordinary      Americans and bad for the American economy. Investors are the      source of capital needed to create jobs and expand      businesses. True capital formation and economic growth      require investors to have both confidence in the capital      markets and access to the information needed to make good      investment decisions.       Second, I share the concerns expressed by many others that      the bill rests on faulty premises. Supporters claim that the      bill would improve capital formation in the United States by      reducing the regulatory burden on capital raising. However,      there is significant research to support the conclusion that      disclosure requirements and other capital markets regulations      enhance, rather than impede, capital formation, and that      regulatory compliance costs are not a principal cause of the      decline in IPO activity over the past decade. Moreover,      nothing in the bill requires or even incentivizes issuers to      use any capital that may be raised to expand their businesses      or create jobs in the U.S.       Professor John Coates of Harvard Law School has testified      that proposals of the type incorporated into H.R. 3606 could      actually hurt job growth:       ``While [the proposals] have been characterized as      promoting jobs and economic growth by reducing regulatory      burdens and costs, it is better to understand them as      changing . . . the balance that existing securities laws and      regulations have struck between the transaction costs of      raising capital, on the one hand, and the combined costs of      fraud risk and asymmetric and unverifiable information, on      the other hand. Importantly, fraud and asymmetric information      not only have effects on fraud victims, but also on the cost      of capital itself. Investors rationally increase the price      they charge for capital if they anticipate fraud risk or do      not have or cannot verify relevant information. Anti-fraud      laws and disclosure and compliance obligations coupled with      enforcement mechanisms reduce the cost of capital.       ``. . . Whether the proposals will in fact increase job      growth depends on how intensively they will lower offer      costs, how extensively new offerings will take advantage of      the new means of raising capital, how much more often fraud      can be expected to occur as a result of the changes, how      serious the fraud will be, and how much the reduction in      information verifiability will be as a result of the changes.       ``Thus, the proposals could not only generate front-page      scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being promoted      to increase: job growth.''       Similarly, Professor Jay Ritter of the University of      Florida has testified before the Senate banking committee      that such proposals could in fact reduce capital formation:       ``In thinking about the bills, one should keep in mind that      the law of unintended consequences will never be repealed. It      is possible that, by making it easier to raise money      privately, creating some liquidity without being public,      restricting the information that stockholders have access to,      restricting the ability of public market shareholders to      constrain managers after investors contribute capital, and      driving out independent research, the net effects of these      bills might be to reduce capital formation and/or the number      of small [emerging growth company] IPOs.''       As drafted, H.R. 3606 would have significant detrimental      impacts on the U.S. securities regulatory regime, including      the following:       First, the bill will reduce publicly available information      by exempting ``emerging growth companies'' from certain      disclosure and other requirements currently required under      the Federal securities laws. The bill's definition of      ``emerging growth company'' would include every issuer with      less than $1 billion in annual revenues (other than large      accelerated filers and companies that have issued over $1      billion in debt over a three year period) for five years      after the company's first registered public offering. It is      estimated that this threshold would pick up 98% of IPOs and a      large majority of U.S. public companies for that five year      period.       An emerging growth company would only have to provide two      years (rather than three years) of audited financial      statements, and would not have to provide selected financial      data for any period prior to the earliest audited period      presented in connection with its initial public offering. It      would also be exempt from the requirements for ``Say-on-Pay''      voting and certain compensation-related disclosure. Such      reduced financial disclosure may make it harder for investors      to evaluate companies in this category by obscuring the      issuer's track record and material trends.       ``Emerging growth companies'' would also be exempt from      complying with any new or revised financial accounting      standards (other than accounting standards that apply equally      to private companies), and from some new standards that may      be adopted by the PCAOB. Such wholesale exemptions may result      in inconsistent accounting rules that could damage financial      transparency, making it difficult for investors to compare      emerging companies with other companies in their industry.      This could harm investors and, arguably, impede access to      capital for emerging companies, as capital providers may not      be confident that they have access to all the information      they need to make good investment decisions about such      companies.       Second, the bill would greatly increase the number of      record holders a company may have, before it is required to      publish annual and quarterly reports. Currently, companies      with more than 500 shareholders of record are required to      register with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(g) of the      Securities Exchange Act and provide investors with regular      financial reports. H.R. 3606 would expand that threshold to      2000 record holders (provided that, in the case of any issuer      other than a community bank, the threshold would also be      triggered by 500 non-accredited investors). Moreover, the      bill would exclude from such counts any shareholders that      acquire securities through crowdfunding initiatives and those      that acquire securities as eligible employee compensation.      Thus, a company could have a virtually unlimited number of      record stockholders, without being subject to the disclosure      rules applicable to public companies. This effect is      magnified by the fact that the reporting threshold only      counts records holders, excluding the potentially unlimited      number of beneficial owners who hold their shares in ``street      name'' with banks and brokerage companies, and thus are not      considered record holders.       This provision of the bill raises concerns because it could      significantly reduce the number of companies required to file      financial and other information. Such information is critical      to investors in determining how to value securities in our      markets. Regular financial reporting enhances the allocation      of capital to productive companies in our economy.       Third, the bill would exempt ``emerging growth companies''      from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires      the independent audit of a company's internal financial      controls. Section 404(b) currently applies only to companies      with a market capitalization above $75 million; companies      below that threshold have never been subject to the internal      controls audit requirement and were exempted from such      requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act. The internal controls      audit was established following the accounting scandals at      Enron, WorldCom and other companies, and is intended to make      financial reporting more reliable. Indeed, a report last year      by Audit Analytics noted that the larger public companies,      known as accelerated filers, that are subject to Section      404(b), experienced a 5.1% decline in financial statement      restatements from 2009 to 2010; while non-accelerated filers,      that are not subject to Section 404(b), experienced a 13.8%      increase in such restatements. A study by the SEC's Office of      the Chief Accountant recommended that existing investor      protections within Section 404(b) be retained for issuers      with a market capitalization above $75 million. With the      passage of H.R. 3606, an important mechanism for enhancing      the reliability of financial statements would be lost for      most public companies, during the first five years of public      trading.       Fourth, the bill would benefit Wall Street, at the expense      of Main Street, by overriding protections that currently      require a separation between research analysts and investment      bankers who work in the same firm and impose a quiet period      on analyst reports by the underwriters of an IPO. These rules      are designed to protect investors from potential conflicts of      interests. The research scandals of the dot-com era and the      collapse of the dot-com bubble buried the IPO market for      years. Investors won't return to the IPO market, if they      don't believe they can trust it.       Fifth, H.R. 3606 would fundamentally change U.S. securities      law, by permitting unlimited offers and sales of securities      under Rule 506 of Regulation D (which exempts certain non-     public offerings from registration under the Securities Act),      provided only that all purchasers are ``accredited      investors''. The bill would specifically permit general      solicitation and general advertising in connection with such      offerings, obliterating the distinction between public and      private offerings.       This provision may be unnecessary. A recent report by the      SEC's Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation      confirms that Regulation D has been effective in     meeting the capital formation needs of small businesses, with      a median offering size of $1,000,000 and at least 37,000      unique offerings since 2009. Regulation D offerings surpassed      $900 billion in 2010. The data does not indicate that users      of Regulation D have been seriously hampered by the      prohibition on general solicitation and advertising.       I share the concerns expressed by many that this provision      of H.R. 3606 would be a boon to boiler room operators, Ponzi      schemers, bucket shops, and garden variety fraudsters, by      enabling them to cast a wider net, and making securities law      enforcement much more difficult. Currently, the SEC and other      regulators may be put on notice of potential frauds by      advertisements and Internet sites promoting ``investment      opportunities.'' H.R. 3606 would put an end to that tool.      Moreover, since it is easier to establish a violation of the      registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities      Act than it is to prove fraud, such scams can often be shut      down relatively quickly. H.R. 3606 would make it almost      impossible to do so before the damage has been done and the      money lost.       In addition others have noted that the current definition      of ``accredited investor'' may not be adequate and that the      requirement that purchasers be accredited investors would      provide limited protection. For example, an ``accredited      investor'' retiree with $1 million in savings, who depends on      that money for income in retirement, may easily fall prey for      a ``hot'' offering that is continually hyped via the internet      or late night commercials.       These are just a few observations regarding H.R. 3606. It      also includes other provisions that require substantial      further analysis and review, including among other things the      so-called crowdfunding provisions.       The removal of investor protections in this bill are among      the factors that have prompted serious concerns from the      Council of Institutional Investors, AARP, the North American      Securities Administrators Association, the Consumer      Federation of America, and Americans for Financial Reform,      among others.                        Questions Re: H.R. 3606       As H.R. 3606 is considered, the following is a non-     exhaustive list of questions that should be addressed:       1. The bill would define ``emerging growth company'' as any      company, within 5 years of its IPO, with less than $1 billion      in annual revenue, other than a large accelerated filer or a      company that has issued $1 billion in debt over a three-year      period.       What is the basis for the $1 billion revenue trigger?       Why is revenue the right test? Why is $1 billion the right      level?       It has been estimated that this definition would include      98% of all IPOs, and a large majority of all public companies      within the 5-year window. Was such a broad scope intended?       2. As provided in the bill, financial accounting standards,      auditing and reporting standards, disclosure requirements,      and the period for which historical financial statements is      required, could all differ as between ``emerging growth      companies'' and all other public companies--including all      companies that went public before December 8, 2011.       How will these differences affect the comparability of      financial reporting for these two classes of issuers?       Will reduced transparency, or lack of comparability, affect      the liquidity of emerging growth companies?       Will reduced transparency or reduced liquidity affect the      cost of capital for emerging growth companies? Will investors      demand a ``discounted price'' to offset any perceived higher      risk resulting from reduced disclosures and protections?       Will emerging growth companies be required to include risk      factors or other disclosure in their registration statements      and other filings, regarding transparency, comparability and      any potential effects thereof?       3. The bill would expand the threshold for the number of      shareholders an issuer may have, before it is required to      file annual and other reports under Section 12(g) of the      Exchange Act, from 500 to 2000 (of which no more than 500 may      be non-accredited investors, for issuers other than community      banks), and would exclude from such counts shareholders that      acquire securities through crowdfunding initiatives and those      that acquire securities as eligible employee compensation.       How was the new threshold of 2000 holders determined?       Is that the right threshold for determining whether the      public interest in such securities justifies regulatory      oversight?       How many companies would be exempted from registration and      reporting by the bill?       When shares are held in ``street name'' the number of      beneficial owners may greatly exceed the number of record      holders. How will the new threshold of 2000 record holders be      applied in such cases?       How would the exclusion of employees and crowdfunding      purchasers be applied, if such holders transfer their shares      to other investors? How would this be tracked?       4. To the extent the bill results in reduced transparency      and/or reduced liquidity for emerging growth companies, or      for companies exempted from Exchange Act reporting by the new      thresholds under Section 12(g), such results may impact      investment decisions by institutional investors.       How would mutual fund managers, pension fund      administrators, and other investors with fiduciary duties      address such reduced transparency or lack of liquidity in      making investment decisions?       Could reduced transparency or reduced liquidity impact the      ability of fund managers to meet applicable diversification      requirements?       Could such effects cause managers to increase concentration      into fewer US reporting companies? How would such      concentration affect market risk? Would the bill result in      investor funds being redirected to companies overseas?       5. The bill is being promoted as a jobs measure, on the      grounds that reducing regulation will improve access to      capital for small and emerging businesses, allowing them to      grow and add employees.       What is the evidence that regulatory oversight unduly      impedes access to capital?       What is the evidence that companies that are otherwise      prepared to grow (that is, they have the appropriate business      model, management team, and aspirations) are prevented from      growing by an inherent lack of access to potential sources of      capital?       I understand that the costs of complying with regulatory      requirements are a factor underpinning H.R. 3606. How do such      costs compare to other costs of raising capital, such as      investment banking fees? How do such costs compare to other      administrative costs? If reduced transparency, lack of      comparability, and other consequences of the bill result in a      higher cost of capital for emerging growth companies, will      the money saved on compliance be worth it?       6. Evidence shows that the public companies that are      currently exempt from internal controls audit requirements      have a higher incidence of financial reporting restatements,      and that companies that have restated their financial results      produce substantially lower returns for investors.       How do any perceived benefits from H.R. 3606's exemption of      emerging growth companies from the audit of internal controls      compare to the likelihood of increased restatements? Would an      increase in restatements hamper capital formation?       Will the lack of an internal controls audit result in      greater financial and accounting fraud?       7. The bill requires the Commission to revise its rules to      provide that the prohibition against general solicitation or      general advertising contained in Regulation D shall not apply      to offers and sales of securities pursuant to Rule 506,      provided that all purchasers are accredited investors.       Given the success of Regulation D as a capital raising      mechanism, including its successful use by small and emerging      companies, is there any evidence that general solicitation      and general advertising are necessary for capital formation?       Given the current definition of ``accredited investor'', is      that the right test for determining who issuers may target,      in offers made by general solicitation or advertising?                               Conclusion       H.R. 3606 would have a significant impact on the capital      markets and raises many questions that have yet to be      satisfactorily resolved. I have yet to see credible evidence      that justifies the extensive costs and potential harm to      investors this bill may impose.       I urge Congress to undertake the review necessary to      resolve these questions, and to ensure that investors, as the      providers of the capital that companies need to grow and      create jobs, have the protections they need and deserve.
