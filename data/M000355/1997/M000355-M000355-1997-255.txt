 President, let me commend the Senator from Wyoming for his efforts to fully disclose all the resources the Administration has allocated to the climate change issue. To my knowledge nobody has been able to determine how much or from what offices funds been spent on global climate change.  It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of the resources being expended from all federal agencies and offices for the purposes of education, lobbying and research.
