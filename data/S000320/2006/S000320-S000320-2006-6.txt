 President, today I honor Mr. Jimmy Williamson, who will become the first Alabamian to serve as chairman of the board for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  This is a tremendous honor, both for Jimmy and for Alabama. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants serves as the national professional association for more than 350,000 certified public accountants. Jimmy's education, experience, and passion for finance make him the best choice to take the helm of the organization.  Jimmy, a past president of the Alabama Society of CPAs, is a senior partner and stockholder in the MDA Professional Group accounting firm where he specializes in profit sharing plans, fringe benefits, nonqualified deferred compensation plans, estate and personal financial planning, business acquisitions, and investment review and analysis. I am also proud to say that Jimmy and I share an interest in fraud prevention and detection, one of the most important financial issues we face today. His professional work and leadership on committees, that are too plentiful to name, make him uniquely qualified and prepared for this position. I am proud to recognize his professional achievements and congratulate him on this important post.                          ____________________[Page S10453]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JIMMY WILLIAMSON
