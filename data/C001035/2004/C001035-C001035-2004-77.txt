President, I thank Senator Leahy for working with Senator Lieberman and me on his amendment. It requires two reports related to watch lists: one on the criteria for listing a name on the Terrorist Screening Center's consolidated watch list, and another on the effect of the ``automatic selectee'' and ``no-fly'' lists on privacy and civil liberties.  We worked with him to incorporate some modifications that make the amendment acceptable to the two managers and incorporate some recommendations from the administration.  I am well aware of some of the problems with the watch list. A constituent of mine from Camden, ME, a retired physician, has the misfortune to have a name that is identical to a name that is on the watch list. Every time he flies, he encounters great difficulties. I believe the Senator's amendment will help to address that.  It is important to ensure we are safe and that those who want to do us harm do not have access to aircraft. But at the same time we want to make sure that law-abiding travelers are not impeded from conducting their travels simply because they have the misfortune to share a name with someone on the watch list.  The process required by the Senator, I think, will be helpful. I urge adoption of the amendment.
