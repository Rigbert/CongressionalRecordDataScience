Speaker, I rise today to pay tribune to a dedicated and devoted friend of Southwest Michigan, Mr. Anthony Belski. This month he is retiring after thirty-six years of service to St. Joseph Public Schools. For twenty-nine of those years, Mr. Belski presided over Lincoln Elementary School as its principal.  During his tenure, Mr. Belski has seen a lot of change but through it all, one thing remains the same--his enduring dedication to the kids. Principals are in a unique position to touch so many lives and to help mold so many futures. As an educator, Mr. Belski is in a unique position to have his hard work live on in each of his students--clearly southwest Michigan is a better place thanks to his efforts.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mr. Anthony Belski for all of his work and wishing him a long, productive, and happy retirement.                          ____________________
