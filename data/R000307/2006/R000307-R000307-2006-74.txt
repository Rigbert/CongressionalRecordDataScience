President, I tell my friend from Illinois that I will be very brief.  I understand all of the discussion has been about cloture. It has been about the process of the Senate. It has been about denying Members--in this particular case, on our side--the ability to offer amendments. Let me say that we are about to go on a 2-week recess without doing anything about trying to secure our borders. We are doing some things, but we are not doing the things we need to do.
