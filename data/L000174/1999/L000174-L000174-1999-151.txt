President, I think Mark Twain once referred to how nice it is to hear your eulogy while you are still alive. I do appreciate hearing from my friends, my distinguished colleaguefrom South Dakota, the closest friend I have ever had, the distinguished Democratic leader, and the kind words he had to say; my good friend from Mississippi, the distinguished majority leader; and, of course, my colleague who I have known for longer than anybody in this body, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords.  These comments mean a great deal. That Vice President Gore, presided at the time of the vote meant a lot to me. I will note that the Vice President said earlier today: Boy, that guy Leahy must be awfully old.  I point out the Vice President and I have the same birthday, March 31--about 8 years apart.  I have served here with so many. I see my dear friend and aisle mate, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who has cast the most votes in history--over 15,000 votes, and my good friend, the President pro tempore, the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, who has the second most votes ever cast in this body.  I think of the people with whom I have served during the 25 years I have served, people such as Scoop Jackson and Mike Mansfield, Jacob Javits, John Stennis, Hubert Humphrey, and Bob Dole. The two closest friends I had in my class were a Republican and a Democrat: Paul Laxalt and John Glenn; and so many others who I served with including two colleagues from Vermont, Bob Stafford and Jim Jeffords.  How fortunate I am to serve with the men and women of this body; every one of whom is a close friend--those such as the distinguished Senator from Utah with whom I work on the Judiciary Committee; those with whom I work on the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of our subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the committee--he and Senator Byrd have taught me so much as I have served on that committee--those with whom I serve on Agriculture, my good friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Dick Lugar, and others. There are so many of you.  When I came here the country was very much at risk and the Senate was in good bipartisan shape. Today the country is doing very well, and we sometimes break down too much along partisan lines. I think this is unfortunate. Those of us who have served here a long time know it does not have to be that way. We know the country is better when we work together. I think of traveling with my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran, when we went to our home States. We find, even though we are of different philosophies, there are so many things in common, so we can work together.  I hope we can do more and more of that. If I may say to all my friends, nothing I can ever do in life will give me greater pleasure or humble me more than serving in this body. There are only 100 of us who might be here at any given time to represent a great nation of a quarter of a billion people. Think of the responsibility that is for all of us. These are the finest men and women, in both parties, I have ever known.  When Marcelle and I came to this city, we didn't knew how long we were going to be here. I was the junior-most Member of this body, the junior-most Member--No. 99 in then a 99-Member Senate, because of a tie vote in New Hampshire. I sat way over in that corner.  I looked at Senators, people such as Ted Kennedy or Frank Church or Barry Goldwater, who would walk in here--people I knew from Time magazine covers or from the news--and suddenly realized, I am here. I remember that day in January when I stood up to cast my first vote and then quickly sat down. I also remember what Senator Mansfield, our leader, told me: Always keep your word, he said, and don't worry if you think you cast a vote wrong; the issue will come back. It does. I have found that is true after 10,000 votes.  So I think now I have been here long enough that this week I will finally do something I have been putting off for 25 years. I will carve my name in my desk.  I yield the floor.  (Applause, Senators rising.)                          ____________________
