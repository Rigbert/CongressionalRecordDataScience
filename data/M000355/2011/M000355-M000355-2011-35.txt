 President, I stand today to pay tribute to a fine and blessed couple, Mr. and Mrs. Earl and Opal Williams of Laurel County, KY.  Earl Williams and Opal Morgan grew up less than 20 miles apart Earl attended Bush High School located east of London, KY, and Opal attended Hazel Green High School west of London--yet their paths never crossed at the time.  However, when Earl was 24 years old he set out for Kinzua, OR, some 2,500 miles away where he began working for the Kinzua Pine Mills Company. ``In those days you could not get any work locally, you had to leave home and usually go a long ways to find work,'' Earl recalls.  As fate would have it, a short time later Earl and Opal met after Opal traveled to Kinzua to visit her father, who was also employed by the Kinzua Pine Mills Company. Eventually, Opal took a job in a local factory and decided to stay in Kinzua. ``Our courtship was about normal,'' Opal says. ``We dated for about a year and got married December 22, 1949, in Goldendale, Washington.''  In December of 1954, Earl and Opal returned home to Laurel County, KY, after spending 2 years in Indianapolis, IN. Earl began a career with WaterSoftener Rental, a company Earl bought into and then later purchased outright from his partners, while Opal stayed busy making a wonderful home in the house the couple built on the ``Old Williams' Farm,'' a house Earl is especially proud of. ``This farm belonged to the Williams family during the Civil War,'' he boasts.  Earl and Opal were married for 7 years before they were blessed with four children, sons David, Joe, and Phillip, and daughter Amber. The couple is not shy about explaining that their children have been the highlight of their lives. ``We enjoyed our boys,'' the couple says, ``but we were ready for a girl when Amber came along.''  These days Earl and Opal stay busy tending to their three grandchildren and one great-grandson several days a week, and Earl still drops by the office daily to ``check on'' his sons. The couple, who have been married for over 61 years, claim that their faith and dedication to their church, Lick Fork Community Missionary Baptist, has played a major role in the success of their lives and marriage over the years--the two have been members of the church for over 50 years. ``It has been a good life,'' Opal says. ``We got married 61 years ago to stay married. We never thought of divorce like young couples do today.''  Mr. President, Earl and Opal Williams have shared an incredible journey together, and their faith in each other, their family, and their church has given them a wonderful story to share. Earl and Opal's life together serves as an inspiration to the people of Kentucky, and I wish them many years of further happiness. The Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo recently published an article to share the Williams' story with the rest of our great Commonwealth. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Winter 2011]                    Finding Love in a Far Off Place                            (By Sue Minton)       Earl and Opal were not high-school sweethearts. They did      not know each other as teenagers. Both grew up in Laurel      County, on opposite ends of the county and attended rival      high schools.       Earl Williams grew up east of London and attended Bush High      School. Opal Morgan grew up west of London and attended Hazel      Green High School.       Less than 20 miles separated the two. They may have seen      each other at box suppers, the movies or social gatherings,      but did not take notice.       ``In those days you could not get any work locally, you had      to leave home and usually go a long ways to find work,'' Earl      said.       For 24-year-old Earl this was Kinzua, Oregon.       And it was in this lumber company-built town, 2,500 miles      from home, that Earl did take notice of Opal.       The couple met in Kinzua where Earl was working for the      Kinzua Pine Mills Company.       ``Kinzua, Oregon, was built by and for the Kinzua Pine      Mills Company,'' Earl said. ``It was a company town,      everything was owned by the company, all the stores, even the      houses we lived in.''       Opal went to visit her father, who also worked for the      company, and stayed on after meeting Earl, getting a job in a      local factory.       ``Our courtship was about normal,'' Opal said. ``We dated      for about a year and got married Dec. 22, 1949, in      Goldendale, Washington.''       ``About all there was to do in this little town was go to      the movies,'' she said. ``They showed the same movie all      week. So we went once a week.''       Opal recalls the company having a community building called      ``The Pass Time.''       ``On Saturday nights they had dances and on Sunday mornings      the building was cleared out for church,'' she said. ``We      didn't care much about dancing; it was just being together in      each other's company.''       The couple returned to Laurel County in December 1954 after      leaving Kinzua and spending about two years in Indianapolis,      Indiana.       After returning home Earl went to work with Water Softener      Rental. ``I bought into the company in 1957 and later      purchased the company from my partners,'' he said.       While Earl was building a successful business, Opal was      making a home for the couple in the house they built on part      of the Old Williams' Farm.       ``This farm belonged to the Williams family during the      Civil War,'' Earl said proudly.       Although their marriage and life was good, the couple      wished for a baby.       ``We were married seven years before this happened,'' Opal      said.       ``We were beginning to think we were not going to have any      children.''       When asked `what was an important milestone or event in      their lives?' they answered simultaneously, ``the boys.''       ``That was probably the highlight of our marriage,'' Earl      said, ``when the boys, David, Joe and Phillip, were born.''       ``Everyone said we changed completely when David was      born,'' Opal said. ``I don't know how we changed or how much,      but Earl's mother said we did.''       With only two years between the births of Joe and Phillip,      Opal referred to this almost like raising twins.       ``It would have been nice to have had a girl,'' Opal said.      ``But little boys are nice too, and I enjoyed my boys.''       ``But, we were ready for a girl when Amber came along,''      Earl said.       ``We have three grandchildren, Amber, James and Matthew,      and a great-grandson, Will,'' Opal added.       Earl and Opal said their marriage had not been different      from most couples who have been married for many years. They      don't have a magic formula to explain the success of their      marriage. They just took their wedding vows seriously.       ``We never thought of divorce like young couples do      today,'' Opal said. ``We got married 61-years ago to stay      married. You have your differences but you work through      them.''       ``They should try to work their problems out,'' Earl added.       ``Couples should not be so quick to get a divorce. If      everything does not fall into place for them, they'd get      divorced,'' she added. ``But there are some situations when a      divorce is the only way.''       Opal feels it is important for young wives to develop their      own lives and interests. ``Married couples should be able to      work together, but women need their independence.''       Their faith and dedication to their church, Lick Fork      Community Missionary Baptist, where they have been members      for more than 50 years, has contributed to and played a major      role in the success of their lives and marriage.       Although both are in good health, Earl has slowed down some      since retiring, but still goes into the office daily `to      check on the boys.'       ``It is nice having him home,'' Opal said. ``Before he was      always working at the business or the farm.''       Opal spends three days a week enjoying and caring for      great-grandson Will, the latest boy in the Williams' family.       When Will's mother, Amber, was asked to comment on her      grandparents she said, ``Eric and I were like them (referring      to her grandparents), we were married seven years before Will      came along. I think it is amazing to have been married for so      many years and raised three sons that have been very      successful. They were taught good work ethics (which) they      are passing on to their children.''       ``It has been a good life,'' Opal said.       ``We have had a good married life. It does not seem like 61      years; it has went by fast,'' Earl added.                          ____________________
