Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the second Scott amendment amends the bill so that no person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government would be covered by the Two Strikes and You're Out provision contained in this bill.  What the amendment does is, it creates a safe haven for child sex offenders on Indian land. I do not think we want to do that. A convicted child molester in Wisconsin would know the only way to avoid life imprisonment if he is caught would be to prey upon children in Indian lands. I think the Congress has an obligation to protect children on Indian lands just as much as we have an obligation to protect children on other Federal lands, as well.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
