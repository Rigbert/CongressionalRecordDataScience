President, yesterday marked the passing of a giant in American law. Justice John Paul Stevens passed away at the age of 99. I just bought his most recent book. The subtitle of it is ``My First 94 Years.''  Justice Stevens was a favorite, born and raised in the city of Chicago. He was a lifelong Cubs fan. He was in the crowd of Wrigley Field as a very young man in 1932, on October 1, during a World Series game, when Babe Ruth made the famous called shot--hitting a home run over the fence.  He attended the University of Chicago and Northwestern School of Law. Naturally, he graduated at the top of his class. In between, he served as lieutenant commander of the U.S. Navy during World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star.  After law school and a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge, John Paul Stevens became an accomplished attorney in Chicago, leading to his nomination to the Seventh Circuit in 1970. In 1975, he was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Gerald Ford and confirmed by the Senate 98 to 0. Judge Stevens served on the Supreme Court for nearly 35 years, bringing to the Court his midwestern blend of brilliance, courtesy, and humility.  He leaves behind an enormous legacy. He was committed to safeguarding the rights and liberties protected by the Constitution, and he cherished the importance of the Judiciary as an ``impartial guardian of the rule of law.'' Those were his words in his famous Bush v. Gore dissent, where he said that judging of the Court as an ``impartial guardian of the rule of law'' was at stake in that majority opinion.  He was respectful at all times and respected by his colleagues at all times, and by litigants, and by the American people.  When he retired in 2010, at the age of 90, he was the third longest tenured Justice in the history of the Supreme Court. He was the last living Justice to have served in World War II.  I want to extend my sympathy to Justice Stevens' family, including his surviving daughters, Elizabeth and Susan, his 9 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.  Today we bid farewell to a giant, and we thank Justice Stevens for his decades of service to this country and for his profound contribution to American law.                            Opioid Epidemic  Mr. President, years ago, there was a Senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire. He used to come to the floor every month and give what he called his ``Golden Fleece Award'' for the worst example of Federal Government waste. Earlier this year, I launched a new series dedicated to that tradition with floor speeches that built off the Proxmire work, with a focus on the most extreme cases of the pharmaceutical industry's greed. It is known as the Pharma Fleece Award.  I have highlighted price-gouging for lifesaving insulin, the patent abuses that extend monopoly control over pricing of drugs, and the billions of dollars' worth of medications that are thrown away each year deliberately due to the production of oversized, unnecessary drug vials.  This month, I want to focus on the pharmaceutical industry's role in another national disgrace--the opioid epidemic. We are in the midst of the Nation's worst drug overdose epidemic in our history. There is no town too small, no suburb too wealthy to be spared the suffering and the deaths that have been wrought by this problem.  Last year, 2,062 people in my home State of Illinois died from opioid overdose. There is culpability with nearly all the stakeholders, including the U.S. Government. There is no denying how this epidemic was ignited. For years, the pharmaceutical industry wildly mischaracterized the risk of opioids, falsely claiming they were less addictive and less harmful; that these painkillers should be prescribed for common aches and pains, even when the industry itself had information proving the dangers of such long-term use.  In 2007, the manufacturer of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misbranding the drug by misrepresenting OxyContin's risks. This resulted in a modest fine as the company continued to flood the Nation with their deadly painkillers.  New reporting this morning from the Washington Post found that Big Pharma saturated the country with 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pills between 2006 and 2012. During a 6-year period, 76 billion pills were produced by pharma. One subsidiary company, Mallinckrodt, put 28 billion opioid pills on the market during this time.  Downstate in Illinois is a small rural county, Hardin County. It has fewer than 10 doctors who can prescribe controlled substances. The total population of the county is 4,300 people. It is one of the smallest, least populated counties in my State. In the year 2010, approximately 6 million hydrocodone pills and 1 million oxycodone pills were shipped to Hardin County and its surrounding communities. For 4,300 people, they shipped 7 million pills. All of this data was actually captured and reported to a Federal agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration. They will come up again in my presentation. That means drug manufacturers knew about this obscene volume of pills being produced and sold; that drug distributors knew exactly where and how this was being transported, and law enforcement had its eyes on it all along.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the top opioid distributors and manufacturers from 2006 to 2012.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                TOP PILL MANUFACTURERS, 2006 THROUGH 2012------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Percent of            Manufacturer                 Number of Pills        Market------------------------------------------------------------------------SpecGx (Mallinckrodt)..............  29 billion............        37.70Actavis Pharma.....................  26 billion............        34.50Par Pharmaceutical (Endo)..........  12 billion............        15.70Purdue Pharma......................  2.5 billion...........         3.30Amneal Pharmaceuticals.............  2.3 billion...........         2.90Teva Pharmaceuticals USA...........  690 million...........         0.90KVK Tech...........................  580 million...........         0.80West-Ward Pharmaceuticals (Hikma)..  380 million...........         0.50Kaiser Foundation Hospitals........  370 million...........         0.50Endo Pharmaceuticals...............  300 million...........         0.40Ethex Corporation..................  290 million...........         0.40AbbVie Inc.........................  250 million...........         0.30Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.  240 million...........         0.30UCB, Inc...........................  180 million...........         0.20Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.........  140 million...........         0.20Cardinal Health....................  120 million...........         0.20Dispensing Solutions Inc...........  95 million............         0.10Golden State Medical Supply, Inc...  85 million............         0.10Aphena Pharma Solutions--Tennessee,  74 million............         0.10 LLC.McKesson Corp......................  65 million............         0.10Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc......  55 million............         0.1OForest Laboratories, Inc...........  47 million............         0.10Bryant Ranch Prepack...............  37 million............         0.1OPfizer Laboratories Div Pfizer Inc.  31 million............         0.00A-S Medication Solutions...........  28 million............         0.00------------------------------------------------------------------------                TOP PILL DISTRIBUTORS, 2006 THROUGH 2012------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Percent of            Distributor                  Number of Pills        Market------------------------------------------------------------------------McKesson Corp......................  14 billion............        18.40Walgreens..........................  13 billion............        16.50Cardinal Health....................  11 billion............        14.00AmerisourceBergen..................  9.0 billion...........        11.70CVS................................  5.9 billion...........         7.70Walmart............................  5.3 billion...........         6.90Smith Drug Co......................  1.3 billion...........         1.80Rite Aid...........................  1.3 billion...........         1.70Kroger.............................  1.2 billion...........         1.60H.
