 President, technology is changing our world. It affects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the way our children learn in school. Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that has really opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for our students to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they have to learn how to use technology. But all too often today, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their instruction without being given the training to do so.  A recent study by the Office of Technology Assessment shows that a majority of teachers feel they need additional training in order to adequately use a personal computer. In fact, school districts across the country spend less than 15 percent of their technology budgets on teacher training. Hardware, software, access to the Internet are only helpful to the educational process if teachers are equipped with the knowledge to use that technology.  That is why I am introducing today the Teacher Technology Training Act of 1997, which will add technology to the areas of professional development and teacher training on the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act of 1994. My legislation will require States to incorporate technology requirements in teacher training content and performance standards. School districts and local educational agencies that receive Federal funding for professional development have to include technology classes in their programs. In addition, institutions of higher education will be strongly encouraged to include technology in their education programs.  There are two parts to providing students access to technology: putting computers into the schools, and training teachers in how to use them. Last year, I authored and we passed two amendments that would allow surplus computers from Government agencies to be made available to educational institutions across this country. In addition, Congress provided the E-rate in the telecommunications legislation we passed last year that will provide Internet connections to schools at discounted rates. I also fought for a fivefold increase in appropriations for new technology and classrooms.  These are steps toward ensuring that all schools have computer technology. Now I want work to make sure that teachers are properly trained to use these computers.  Recently, the Department of Education reported that only one in five of our Nation's teachers currently use computers in our classrooms--one out of five. Since technology training today focuses primarily on the mechanics of operating equipment, not on integrating technology into the curriculum, this is not surprising.  Washington State, my home State, has become a State synonymous with Microsoft, Boeing, and thousands of other leading high-technology companies. The Information Technology Association of America reports that these information technology companies are short 190,000 employees today. These are employees dependent upon a technology curriculum and trained teachers in our schools.  When I toured my State of Washington last week, I was astounded by the advances made within our classrooms. At Seattle's Nathan Hale High School, I saw a science class that utilized computers to track weather patterns and charts the effects on their region. They have created their own web pages and are able to hourly tap into the National Weather Service. Their final grade was then based on their ability to produce an accurate 5-day weather forecast.  I also saw physically challenged students openly communicate with their teacher through enhanced computer technology. In the city of Bellingham, I spoke with a student-teacher who was concerned that when she and others went out into the field, there would be teachers who did not know how to use the technology. She felt that many of the students are far ahead of the teachers in their ability to use technology. In Grays Harbor County, I toured a facility supported by a public-private partnership. This lifelong learning center takes surplus computers and teaches student how to repair them and maintain their technology. The possibilities for learning are limitless.  Having technology available for instructors does not directly change teaching or learning. What matters is how successfully teachers can incorporate technology into their classrooms.  We know that technology is only one tool the teachers need to be effective in their jobs. My bill seeks to promote technology training. I have received support for this legislation from the National Education Association, the Washington Software and Digital Alliance, University Presidents and Deans, Washington School Principals, and many corporate and educational institutions.  Mr. President, as a former preschool teacher, a parent education instructor, a former school board member, and as a parent, I know the needs of students and teachers have changed dramatically in recent years. My own children have benefit from the use of technology in their classrooms. But a school full of computers is useless if teachers don't have the necessary training to show students how to use them.  As a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I intend to fight for this legislation in Congress. I urge my colleagues' support for this bill so that we can provide teachers with the tools necessary to teach in today's changing classrooms and tomorrow's work force.                                 ______                                       By
