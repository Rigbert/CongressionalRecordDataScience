Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, here is the problem before us. The administration and this Congress have been starving the Forest Service, while giving them ever more and more expensive obligations, many of which have tremendous merit. If we look at the backlogs to meet the environmental guidelines of the President's forest plan in my region, it would sop up virtually the entire budget of the United States Forest Service.  We are simply not funding many meritorious activities. The gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Furse) was going to offer an amendment yesterday, with which I disagreed, but I agreed with the program she wanted to augment. If we look at her augmenting those programs, it would take them up to 30 and 40 percent of the annual objective; again, programs that benefit the environment, that reinvest in our forests.  We have been treating our forests like cash cows for much too long, and now people are unwilling to reinvest in the resource. That is pointed out by this issue of the K-V Funds. The K-V Funds are spent for meritorious purposes, reforestation and related environmentally beneficial activities consequent to timber sales. Everybody agrees that those are activities that should be carried out.  But the problem here is that since we are starving the Forest Service in many other budgets, they are attributing an, I think, unusually high overhead to this program so that they can move their funds around. And they are very, very messy and unaccountable accounting practices which we have held hearings on.
