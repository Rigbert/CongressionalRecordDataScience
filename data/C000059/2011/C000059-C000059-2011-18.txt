Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the United States Armed Forces and Intelligence Services on the occasion of the successful completion of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Nine years ago our country embarked on a military campaign to end the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein, bring the Iraqi people freedom and make the world a safer place. The road has not been an easy one to travel but through it all our U.S. service members have persevered. From the insurgency in the al Anbar Province to the violence in Baghdad, to the ultimate success of the surge, our troops did not lose sight of the goal. As the enemychanged their tactics, our military, with the help of our intelligence community, adapted and overcame. While there have been many that have questioned America's ability to commit to a long war, a decade later proves our determination as well as assures our Iraqi friends that they have a lasting ally in the United States.  While we commemorate the successful completion of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the challenges remain for Iraq just as it would for any nascent democracy. Today, let us recommit ourselves diplomatically to Iraq and ensure that as the country experiences the growing pains of a new democratic state, they can turn to the U.S. for guidance and help.  Today also serves as the successful completion of Operation Iraqi Freedom which will be remembered in history, along with the almost 4,500 service members that were killed in action in Iraq. Today we also reaffirm a solemn promise that we will always remember their sacrifice and that they gave up the most precious of all things--life. We acknowledge that the death and eternal absence of a soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman or Marine does not exist in a vacuum--it is a wound that will never truly heal in the hearts of all those who loved them. We honor them as individuals--they are people who cannot be replaced but whose memory lives on whenever their story is told. So as we close this chapter, let us promise to honor our war dead every day, tell their stories and remember their sacrifice. In honor of all those who died in service to our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, I would like to read the names of those killed from my congressional district.
