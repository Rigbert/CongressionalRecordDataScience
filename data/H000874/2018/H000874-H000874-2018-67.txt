I will tell you, you are correct in saying that I did not support the omni, but I did support the proposition.  Mr. McCARTHY. In saying that, you just recently said you supported CHIP, but you voted against it because you voted against the omni. Also, is it not true, when CHIP was by itself on the floor, you voted against CHIP there? Because we brought CHIP to the floor three times.  But if I could move on, that was the case. So you voted against CHIP even when it wasn't in the omni, so there are other reasons to vote against CHIP.  You had a question about a bill.
