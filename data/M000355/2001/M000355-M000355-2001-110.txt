TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATESec. 301. Effective date.            TITLE I--SMALL BUSINESS LAWSUIT ABUSE PROTECTION     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient,      unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in      the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;       (2) the defects in the United States civil justice system      have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce      by decreasing the availability of goods and services in      commerce;       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and      fairness to the legal system;       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude      and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and      noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at      least the past 30 years;       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized      that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the      award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate      interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence      of unlawful conduct;       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly      excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some      circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the      doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that      party did not cause;       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities      including small businesses are often brought into litigation      despite the fact that their conduct may have little or      nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to      the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust      costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and      disproportionate damage awards;       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small      businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses      often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge      unwarranted lawsuits;       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation      costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing      insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their      activities;       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the      free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate      commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an      appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses      3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of      the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution      of the United States.

SEC. 106. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.

(b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This      title does not apply to any action in a State court against a      small business in which all parties are citizens of the      State, if the State enacts a statute--       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title      does not apply as of a date certain to such actions in the      State; and       (3) containing no other provision.                TITLE II--PRODUCT SELLER FAIR TREATMENT     SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions may      encourage the production of safer products, they may also      have a direct effect on interstate commerce and consumers of      the United States by increasing the cost of, and decreasing      the availability of, products;       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability      actions are inconsistent within and among the States,      resulting in differences in State laws that may be      inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants and may      impose burdens on interstate commerce;       (3) product liability awards may jeopardize the financial      well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the      small businesses of the United States;       (4) because the product liability laws of a State may have      adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many other      States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to enact      national, uniform product liability laws that preempt State      laws; and       (5) under clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United      States Constitution, it is the constitutional role of the      Federal Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title, based on the      powers of the United States under clause 3 of section 8 of      article I of the United States Constitution, are to promote      the free flow of goods and services and lessen the burdens on      interstate commerce, by--       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of      product liability that provide a fair balance among the      interests of all parties in the chain of production,      distribution, and use of products; and       (2) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product      liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harms      both plaintiffs and defendants.

(a) General Rule.--       (1) In general.--In any product liability action covered      under this title, a product seller other than a manufacturer      shall be liable to a claimant only if the claimant      establishes that--       (A)(i) the product that allegedly caused the harm that is      the subject of the complaint was sold, rented, or leased by      the product seller;       (ii) the product seller failed to exercise reasonable care      with respect to the product; and       (iii) the failure to exercise reasonable care was a      proximate cause of the harm to the claimant;       (B)(i) the product seller made an express warranty      applicable to the product that allegedly caused the harm that      is the subject of the complaint, independent of any express      warranty made by a manufacturer as to the same product;       (ii) the product failed to conform to the warranty; and       (iii) the failure of the product to conform to the warranty      caused the harm to the claimant; or       (C)(i) the product seller engaged in intentional      wrongdoing, as determined under applicable State law; and       (ii) the intentional wrongdoing caused the harm that is the      subject of the complaint.

(b) Special Rule.--       (1) In general.--A product seller shall be deemed to be      liable as a manufacturer of a product for harm caused by the      product, if--       (A) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process      under the laws of any State in which the action may be      brought; or       (B) the court determines that the claimant is or would be      unable to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer.       (2) Statute of limitations.--For purposes of this      subsection only, the statute of limitations applicable to      claims asserting liability of a product seller as a      manufacturer shall be tolled from the date of the filing of a      complaint against the manufacturer to the date that judgment      is entered against the manufacturer.
