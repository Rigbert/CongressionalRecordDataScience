Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Chair, by the way, Mr. McHenry is my friend. He and I have a good working relationship, and I appreciate that friendship. I regret that he is opposing this bill. I know there was an attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement.  In candor, I think everybody on this floor needs to know there were outside business concerns about that agreement, so it was not simply a partisan act. It was that those who see this as a job creator thought that some of the provisions that were put in the so-called compromise would be harmful to job creation and to the sale of exports across the sea.  But the reason I really rose--and I thank Madam Chairwoman for yielding--is to say, yes, the President said he was going to veto this; yes, the majority leader in the Senate said he is not going to bring things up. That is unfortunate, but the statement I made is accurate.  The President of the United States says he is for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. That is a change in his position during the course of his campaign in 2016. It is a change because he was convinced that the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is good for America, good for jobs, good for business, good for working men and women in this country. And so he has repaired, also, to partisanship.  There are no poison pills in here. There may be some things you wanted that are not in this bill; there may be some things in this bill that I would have liked that are not in this bill. But the central point of this is this reauthorizes the Bank.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
