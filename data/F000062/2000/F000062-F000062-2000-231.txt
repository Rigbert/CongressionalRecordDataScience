 President. I rise to introduce legislation to give farm workers what so many of us take for granted--a safe commute to work.  Today, many farm workers are still being transported to fields in crowded vans lacking basic safety equipment. There are reports of vans originally designed for 10 people, transporting up to 20 passengers with no access to seat belts. People should not have to put their lives at risk to travel to a job site.  According to the latest United States Department of Labor statistics, farm occupations have the second highest work-related fatalities, and 45 percent of these fatalities are vehicular related.  Nationally, 533 farm workers were killed in transportation incidents between 1994 and 1998. And farm workers are 4 times more likely to be killed in on-the-job highway traffic accidents than a typical worker.  The following are just a few of the recent accidents involving farm workers traveling in vehicles without seatbelts.  Just two weeks ago, on February 10, 14 people were injured when a car ran a stop sign and crashed into a van carrying farm workers in Tulare County, California. Authorities cited the driver of the van three months ago for illegally transporting workers--but at the time of the accident, he still had not received certification to transport workers.  On September 10, 1999, 13 people were injured south of Fresno when an unlicensed van driver failed to stop for a posted stop sign and collided with another car. The van had seven seats--all with seatbelts--but four passengers were seated on the floor.  On August 9, 1999, thirteen tomato field workers were killed when the van transporting them home slammed into a tractor-trailer truck in rural southwest Fresno County, California. Most of the victims in this horrific crash rode on three bare benches in the back of the van.  On July 23, 1999, one man was killed and more than 40 people injured when a big-rig crashed into a Greyhound bus and a farm worker van on Highway 99 in Tulare County, California. The victim rode in the farm-labor van, packed with 19 other passengers.  This is a national problem which calls for Federal action. Farm workers live all over the country, and have work that frequently carries them across state lines.  Unfortunately, existing Federal laws leave farm workers inadequately protected.  Regulations issued under the Migrant and Season Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) prohibit transport of migrant workers unless the vehicles have adequate service brakes, parking brakes, steering mechanisms, windshield wipers, tires, and review mirrors. But, believe it or not, the law does not mandate seating positions or an operational seatbelt for each passenger.  The Farm Worker Safety Transportation Act of 2000 will make it illegal to transport farm workers unless each passenger has a designated seat with an operational seatbelt. This applies no matter how the vans are purchased or modified.  Federal law now requires vans manufactured with up to 10 passenger seats to have operational seatbelts for each seat. However, after a new van is sold to its first owner, the owner can legally remove the rear seats and install bare benches. Similarly, Federal law permits an individual to purchase a van with an empty cargo hold and install benches without seatbelts.  The legislation will direct the Department of Transportation to develop interim seat and seatbelt standards for vans or trucks without seats that are converted for the transport of farm workers.  After a seven-year transition period, the commercial vehicles that transport farm workers will have to meet the same seat and seatbelt standards as a new vehicles.  A farm worker should have access to a safe commute whether he or she is traveling to a field in Arizona, California, Washington, or Florida.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this sensible, practical legislation that will save lives.                                 ______                                       By
