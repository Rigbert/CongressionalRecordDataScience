 President, I want to pay tribute to Katherine M. Liddle who died in Reston, VA, on December 1, 1994. Mrs. Liddle was a long-time resident of Pineville, KY, and will be remembered and missed by many.  Mrs. Liddle was born in Oaks, KY. She was a graduate of Pineville High School and Union College in Barbourville, KY. Mrs. Liddle began teaching within the county system in a one-room school with six grades. In 1973 she began teaching the sixth grade at the Pineville Independent School where she finished her teaching career 20 years later.  Mrs. Liddle was the wife of the late James J. Liddle. She had one son, Jack, who now resides in Reston, VA. She was a long-time member of the First Baptist Church in Pineville, KY.  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in sending the Chamber's sincere condolences to the family of Katherine M. Liddle. I am confident that her strength of character will remain a standard of excellence for generations to come.                          ____________________
