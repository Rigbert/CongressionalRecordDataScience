 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to honor the late Julian Dixon, an esteemed Member of the House of Representatives from California for more than 20 years.  Julian Dixon lived a full life; highlighted by almost thirty years of public service. He served in the Army from 1957 to 1960 and in the California Assembly from 1972 until 1978. Julian was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1978.  As the representative for the Thirty-Second District of California, Julian consistently fought to maintain our Nation's commitment to civil rights and to increase the economic upward mobility of his constituents. Julian was also chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and worked tirelessly to establish a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. here in our Nation's capital.  Julian's legislative work covered myriad issues from intelligence to defense to congressional ethics. He was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the committee that determines defense appropriations. He used his position on the appropriations committee to provide Federal aid for communities that were devastated by base closings and other defense cuts. He also helped secure emergency funding for damaged businesses after the Northridge earthquake and the Los Angeles riots.  Julian was not only a great legislator, but also a great human being. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word who was willing to work across partisan lines to improve the lives of his constituents and so many Americans. I was privileged as a member of the Senate Appropriations committee to work with Mr. Dixon. In this role, Julian always put California's needs first.  Julian served with passion and distinction. He was a man of the highest integrity and credibility. I am sure his constituents will be proud to have a Post Office named in his honor.  Julian Dixon was a man of principle and fairness whose grace and humility will be sorely missed. I am pleased to honor his memory by introducing a bill to designate the Post Office at 5472 Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles as the ``Congressman Julian C. Dixon Post Office Building.''                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):  S. 1382. A bill to amend title 11, District of Columbia Code, to redesignate the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia as the Family Court of the Superior Court, to recruit and retain trained and experienced judges to serve in the Family Court, to promote consistency and efficiency in the assignment of judges to the Family Court and in the consideration of actions and proceedings in the Family Court, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with my friends and colleagues Senator Landrieu and Senator Levin, that will have a vital impact on children and families in the District of Columbia. Our bill, the ``District of Columbia Family Court Act of 2001'' is aimed at guiding the District, as the Superior Court strives to reform its role in the child welfare system through its creation of a Family Court.  This legislation takes a very important step forward in helping to ensure that the best interest of children in contact with the DC child welfare system are always paramount. In makingsure that is the case, judges in the system play a key role. I learned this first-hand nearly thirty years ago when I was serving as an assistant county prosecutor in Greene County, OH. One of my duties was to represent the Greene County Children Services in cases where children were going to be removed from their parents' custody.  I witnessed then that too many of these cases drag on endlessly, leaving children trapped in temporary foster care placements, which often entail multiple moves from foster home to foster home to foster home, for years and years and years. Such multiple placements and lack of permanency for these kids is abuse in it's own right.  Since being appointed to the District of Columbia Appropriations Committee, I have made it my personal mission to find financial solutions for the problems facing DC's foster children. In March, Representative DeLay and I laid the groundwork for a DC Family Court Bill that would be bipartisan and effective. In drafting this bill, we have held numerous hearings, met with child welfare advocates from across the District, and had countless meetings with the DC Superior Court Judges.  In particular, I want to thank Chief Judge Rufus King for making himself available to members of Congress and their staffs and for appearing before the DC Subcommittee on Appropriations. Judge King has made reforming the Family Division of the DC Court his number one priority, and I look forward to working with him in the future to implement the reforms established by our DC Family Court Bill.  Our legislation includes a number of important reforms that would ensure that the judicial system protects the children of the District. First, it would increase the length of judicial terms for judges from one year for judges already presiding over the Superior Court to three years. New judges appointed to the Superior Court and then assigned to the Family Court would have five-year terms. This change would enable judges to develop an expertise in Family Law.  Second, the bill would create magistrates so that the current backlog of 4500 permanency cases can be properly and adequately addressed. These magistrates would be distributed among the judges according to a transition plan, which must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of passage of this bill. We want to make sure the court has the flexibility to deal with these important child welfare issues.  Third, the bill provides the resources for an Integrated Judicial Information System, IJIS. This would enable the court to track and properly monitor family cases and would allow all judges and magistrates to have access to the information necessary to make the best decisions about placement and child safety.  Fourth, a reform in the bill that I find extremely important is the One-Judge/One Family provision. This policy would ensure that the same judge, a judge who knows the history of a family and the child, would be making the important permanency decisions. This provision is essential for those hard cases involving abuse and neglect. It ensures consistency. It ensures safety. And, it just makes sense.  Ultimately, our bill would provide consistency through the One-Judge/One-Family provision, it would provide safety and security, and it would provide stability for the children of the District. We need to give the children in the District's welfare system all of these things. It is the right thing to do.  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill. We must never, ever lose sight of our responsibility to the children involved. Their needs and their best interests must always come first. And today, I believe we are putting children first and taking a step forward on their behalf.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1382       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
