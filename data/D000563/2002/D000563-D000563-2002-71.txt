 The Senator is correct. The tools of war, the incidence of war, the timing of war has changed. But it has changed throughout our history. The principles, the rules of value, the norms and conduct which we apply today were applied starting in a much different era, and applied again and again as we saw ourselves move into an era of airplanes, into an era of intercontinental missiles. The same standards, principles, norms, conduct, and value remain.  I do not believe the war on terrorism is easy. But I also believe the United States has established an international reputation behind the rule of law--a reputation which I am afraid is going to be changed dramatically by this resolution. No longer will we wait for that imminent threat if this amendment is defeated. It is enough for us to assert that a country is a threat to the United States and begin a land invasion. And that, to me, is a dramatic change from where the United States has always been throughout its history.  I hope we will think twice about that. I have no illusions about the result of this vote. But to think we are going to make this wholesale change in foreign policy without the deliberations and hearings and without a direct debate, to me, is just wrong.  I think the Foreign Affairs Committee and others should have taken the President's new foreign policy suggestions directly and seriously and gone forward with them. Instead, through Saddam Hussein and the debate on Iraq, we are about to make a historic change in foreign policy which I hope we do not do.  In the interest of moving this to a vote, I not only yield the floor, but I yield the remainder of my time.
