 President, before I turn to my colleague for his opening remarks, I would offer an amendment to the bill to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to collect damages.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) The clerk will report.  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an      amendment numbered 2791.  The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To strike a provision of the bill and insert authority for                     the Secretary of Transportation)       On page 129, strike section 218 and insert the following:       ``Sec. 218. The Secretary of Transportation may receive and      expend cash, or receive and utilize spare parts and similar      items, from non-United States Government sources to repair      damages to or replace United States Government owned      automated track inspection cars as a result of third party      liability for such damages.''
