We understand that. But I think the gentleman is correct, it would not resolve it any more than the vote on the rules in January resolved the changing of the rules and the feeling that they were not appropriate to provide the context in which we could proceed.  I know that the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) very honestly and sincerely, as I do, wants to see this matter resolved and see the committee move forward so it could become a matter of history and not a matter of current debate so we can focus on the important issues confronting this country.  I appreciate the gentleman's comments.                          ____________________
