President, I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the Kirk-Reed-Baldwin-Brown amendment.  Essentially, in this legislation--and I commend the chairman and the ranking member for all the work they have done--they have established lofty goals, but without adequate resources, all of our students cannot succeed. This amendment encourages the States to develop and report on measures of access to critical education resources; identify disparities in districts' access to those resources; develop plans with school districts to address these disparities; and include the Opportunity Dashboard of Core Resources on the State report card.  Again, it is a very simple concept. Lofty goals without adequate resources will not give opportunities to American students. We hope this will help provide equitable access to critical resources.
