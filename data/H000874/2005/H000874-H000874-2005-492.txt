Speaker, reports indicate that there has now been some agreement as it relates to the ability of the national intelligence director to move personnel. That obviously was a problem we had. The gentleman from California (Chairman Hunter) did not feel that was appropriate. Apparently, there has been some discussion and that matter has been resolved. Would it be the gentleman's expectation there will be an amendment to the bill because that provision is still in the bill; or do you expect to have a provision in the rule itself which would be self-executing to remove the constraint from the intelligence authorization bill?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I think that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman), the gentleman from Michigan (Chairman Hoekstra), and the gentleman from California (Chairman Hunter), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), will be all in sync on that particular issue. They have been working together and working well to come to a solution to that. I would imagine it would be in a manager's amendment, whatever solution they come to.
