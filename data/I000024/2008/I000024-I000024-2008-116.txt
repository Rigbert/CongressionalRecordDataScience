We have been debating this for years. I know the Senator from Rhode Island wasn't yet elected when we had the McCain-Lieberman bill on the floor and I remember that so well because I was down here for 6 solid days doing nothing but debating this.  One thing I wish to ask you to do is--we made the request when we first started--this is not a discussion on science. We are now talking about a bill. We want to talk about the bill. I am convinced that people coming down and talking about science are doing that because they don't want to talk about the bill, they don't want to talk about the tax ramifications of this bill.  Now, for the purpose of this discussion from now on, let's assume the science is there, that we don't have to worry about science. Let's talk about the bill.  I yield the rebuttal time to the fine Senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker.
