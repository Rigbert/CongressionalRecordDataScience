Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 901, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. For too many years a war has been waged on western lands with private property rights, States' rights and western values being trampled on in the process. Even though Congress is constitutionally entrusted with the power of the management and use of lands belonging to the United States, the United Nations' land designations currently take place without the approval of Congress.  I have heard from many of my constituents in California's 43d Congressional District who are angry because they believe the United Nations has been given the rights to Federal land. They are upset about this issue and wonder how the United States could have let this happen. I am sure many of my colleagues have received similar calls. We in Congress who have been elected to represent them have only one way to help them: Pass this legislation.  H.R. 901 would correct this injustice and require that the Congress approve international land designations in the United States. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
