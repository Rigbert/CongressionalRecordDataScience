I rise in strong support of the Franks amendment.  I am closer to Korea than anybody in this room, and they are launching a missile on July 4. We have a missile defense site in Alaska that has missiles there now that can shoot that down. We just want to finish it, and this money would finish it.  It sends a wrong message to our enemies if we retreat from the missile defense we have today, and some people say, including Mr. Gates, it doesn't work. Well, I bet your dollar it does work, and it will work. But I don't like sitting in Alaska looking at that missile that can reach us and reach Hawaii, and we don't have the defense to shoot it down. Maybe today we might shoot one down, but we need to finish this Fort Greely missile defense site, and this money would do it. It's shovel ready.  This is a good bill, this just makes it a little better. It's the right thing to do for America. It's the right thing to do for Alaska. It's the right thing to do for freedom of all of the world.
