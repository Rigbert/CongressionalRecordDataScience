 There is another bill which I understand is pretty controversial but which is being worked on. I do not know whether the leader might inform us as to when we might expect to see this bill, and that is the forest management bill. Could you give us some information on where that bill stands at this point in time?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, the healthy forest bill that we anticipated to be on this floor next week, and we are still working hard to do that, ran into a little problem of jurisdiction. The Committee on the Judiciary has yet to mark that bill up, or their portion of the bill up. They hope to do that next week. If everyone would cooperate, we could mark it up and get it to the floor by the end of next week. If not, then we have every intention of scheduling that bill in the following week.
