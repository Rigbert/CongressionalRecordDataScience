 BENNETT. I recall in Friday's debate when the Senator from Arizona laid down the three fundamental purposes of McCain-Feingold, and the second of those three was to lessen the amount of money in politics. So I think the question of the Senator from Kentucky is a legitimate one: How much do the sponsors of McCain-Feingold want to lessen the amount of money in politics?  According to the Senator from Arizona, that is one of the three fundamental pillars of this, and I hope the two Senators will continue the colloquy until we get an answer to that question: How much do the sponsors of McCain-Feingold want to lessen the amount of money in politics?  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Utah. Let me just read the formula that is in the McCain-Feingold bill. I say to my friend from Utah, that might be helpful in giving my colleague from Wisconsin an opportunity to answer the question, How much is too much?  The formula, as I understand it, in the original bill is $400,000 plus 30 cents times voting age population less than or equal to 4 million plus 25 cents times the voting age population greater than 4 million.  So in the case, I say to my friends from Utah and Wisconsin--but there is one State that is different. In the case of New Jersey, where they have only one VHF station, the formula is different. It is 80 cents and 70 cents instead of 30 cents and 25 cents. Moreover, the minimum general election limit is $950,000, maximum being $5,500,000. That is for any State, no matter how big. And then the primary is 67 percent of the general limit, and the runoff limit is 20 percent of the general.  I am a little confused here. I gather that means that you can spend more per voter in New Jersey than you can in Utah; is that right?
