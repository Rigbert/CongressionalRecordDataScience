 President, I am pleased to join Senators Hatch, Bayh, Kerry, Murray, Kyl, and Specter in introducing comprehensive anti-gang legislation--the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2009.  This bill has changed significantly since Senator Hatch and I began introducing gang legislation over 10 years ago.
