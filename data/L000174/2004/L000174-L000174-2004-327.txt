President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the remarkable career of Frances Preston. When Ms. Preston began working for Broadcast Music Incorporated in Nashville in 1958, she had only one assistant and her office was her parents' garage. She soon saw the company grow to more than 400 employees in that city alone. In 1985, she became Senior Vice President, Performing Rights, and in 1986 she was named President and CEO of BMI.  Since 1958 when she joined BMI, Ms. Preston has been an invaluable resource to the entire music industry. Her steady and visionary leadership has spanned unprecedented industry growth and several revolutions in technology and popular culture. Over that time, she has overseen the development of BMI's nearly 4.5 million musical works and has delivered a royalty system that meets the needs of this massive repertoire. Fortune magazine has rightly called her ``one of the true powerhouses of the pop music business.''  And for more than two decades she has proven herself an equally invaluable resource for those of us in Washington who appreciate the unique importance of the community of songwriters, composers and publishers. She has testified frequently and has vigilantly defended the rights of these individuals. She has also been a key player in the debates regarding music in the digital age. Her dedication to the many participants in the music world, and her unfailing willingness to assist us in Congress in understating their concerns and issues, made her an incomparable asset as we tried to make sound policy and good law in the areas that matter most to music.  Along with her many professional accomplishments, she has devoted herself to a multitude of charitable efforts. Her charitable work ranges from serving as president of the T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research, to her work for Goodwill of Nashville. She has received numerous humanitarian awards, including a ``Woman of Achievement'' Award from the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research, the first Distinguished Service Award from New York's Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center, and the Lester Sill Humanitarian Award presented at the Retinitis Pigmentosa International Awards.  Ms. Preston's skill and passion will be greatly missed. It is a comfort to know that she will be staying on at BMI in the role of President Emeritus. I thank her for her efforts and wish her well in all her future endeavors.                          ____________________
