Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. DeLay], the distinguished whip.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Chairman, I really thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith] for all his hard work in these areas. There is no greater champion for the unborn than the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith].  Mr. Chairman, as the world's last remaining superpower, the United States plays a very important role in international affairs. Everything it does is scrutinized and interpreted, and in many cases, our country is looked up to as a role model. Therefore, we have to take everything very seriously, and the decisions that we make we have to take seriously, especially those decisions about the kinds of policies we want to pursue in other countries.  In this particular case, the debate is about the kinds of family planning organizations we want to assist with funding. According to the State of World Population, 1997, compiled by the U.N. Population Fund, the United States is the largest donor to international family planning programs, contributing about 47 percent of all the external population control moneys worldwide.                              {time}  1530  So, therefore, it is even more important that we in the United States pursue international family planning principles that are consistent with the kinds of values we want to represent and promote.  Now, President Clinton has already made very clear the kinds of values he would like to promote abroad. In 1993, the Clinton administration abandoned long-standing pro-life policies because of his belief that legal abortion is, and I quote, ``a fundamental right of all women and part of the overall approach to population control.''  Mr. Chairman, I disagree with those values. I do not believe population should be controlled by abortion, and that is why I stand in strong support of the Smith amendment and strong opposition to the Pelosi amendment.  The Pelosi amendment, and we all know what it is, it is a killer amendment and we have to defeat it. It provides, in my opinion, a lesson in ambiguity, as its prohibition on funds going to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family planning is open to all kinds of interpretations, particularly from this pro-abortion White House.  The Smith amendment is very clear. No mistake about it. No United States funds will go to organizations that provide or lobby for abortions at any time for any reason. Now, that is not vague. There is no vague issue regarding the intention of an organization's participation in abortion or the reasons for providing it.  Other than in cases of protecting the life of the mother or forcible rape or incest, the intentions are irrelevant. Intentions are irrelevant. What is relevant is the position the United States is going to take as the largest provider of funds to the international population control programs.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that the United States should stand for life. And as the Reagan-Bush years proved, there are hundreds of organizations that are willing to agree to the conditions that they neither perform nor actively promote abortion in order to receive America's taxpayers' dollars.  These organizations are perfectly capable of providing the family planning services called for by the proponents of the Pelosi amendment that are so valuable to the poor throughout the developing world, and these are the ones that we should be supporting.  So I just urge my colleagues to separate the issues and look very strongly at what the two amendments do. One is the Pelosi amendment, an amendment of ambiguity. And there is no mistaking what the Smith amendment does. So I urge my colleagues to support the Smith amendment and oppose the Pelosi amendment.
