President, obviously the Senator from New Hampshire does not want to explain his amendment. I will. This is a medical malpractice amendment on a farm bill. This amendment picks a class of Americans who will be denied their day in court and restricted in what they can recover if they are victims of medical malpractice.  The people who will be denied their day in court, a class, women, women living in towns of 20,000 of population or less, and their children, those are the only people who will be denied the right to go to court.  If you think this is wise policy for America, to say to victims of medical malpractice who live in small towns they cannot go before the court and jury for fair compensation for their injuries, then I assume you will support this amendment.  But if you believe the medical malpractice does not belong in the farm bill, should not specify one class of Americans to be discriminated against and that we should give those victims a chance for their day in court, please vote no.
