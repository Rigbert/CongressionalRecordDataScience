Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding before he begins his formal remarks, because it is a little unclear to me and to many of the Members regarding the proceedings that are about to ensue.  May I ask the gentleman a couple of questions to clarify how this rule that we will be debating differs from the rule under which we were operating last evening.
