Speaker, it is with sadness that I ask for Unanimous Consent to address the House for the purpose of a one-minute speech to honor the life of former Ohio Representative Steve LaTourette--who we lost too soon earlier this year.  Steve LaTourette served this body well for 18 years and was known around the People's House as someone who worked hard, knew the rules of this institution, and always had a hand reaching across the aisle because he was dedicated to governing, and getting things done. Steve was also well-renowned for his quick wit. But most of all, Steve was a humble public servant, dedicated to the craft of governing. He loved the nitty gritty of getting common-sense legislation through the pipeline and into law.  Now, most folks know that I am a passionate Michigan Wolverine fan, and even though Steve hailed from Ohio, he was a pretty smart guy evidenced by his degree from the University of Michigan. Steve and I were buddies and caught many games together through the years in Ann Arbor. In fact, Steve was one of my very dear friends. When Steve first got elected in 1994, we sensed a kindred spirit in one another and quickly teamed up on a host of issues important to our Midwest communities.  His passionate work on behalf of the Great Lakes and environmental issues was particularly impressive.  And the Republican Main Street Partnership was better for his tireless leadership and advocacy.  He knew his neck of the woods in Ohio better than anyone, and worked hard as a fearless advocate for their needs. And with Steve, you always knew where you stood. He was a straight shooter, and no matter how difficult the topic, he was always honest.  This body lost a great man when he retired. His wife Jennifer, and his six children, lost a great man with his untimely passing.  Today, we stand together in remembering Steve LaTourette. We remember his passion, his grace, his humor, and his mantra of bipartisanship that--now more than ever--should be part of the fabric of this great institution.                          ____________________
