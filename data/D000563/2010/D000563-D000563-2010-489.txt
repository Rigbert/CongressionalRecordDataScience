President, one of the greatest assets in my part of the world would be Lake Michigan. If you ask the people of Chicago: What do you think is the greatest thing about the city of Chicago, in a recent survey they overwhelmingly responded it is Lake Michigan because it is so beautiful, and we are fortunate to be near it and take advantage of it, using beaches and being out on boats, and mainly looking out the window at this magnificent lake, which I get a chance to do when I go up to the city.  So when the issue of the future of Lake Michigan and the question about whether it is going to be the victim of invasive species comes up, we take it seriously. I do not know how many years ago some people decided a very wise thing to do would be to import into the United States a fish called the Asian carp. So they brought in this Asian carp--and I believe it was in the State of Arkansas, though I do not want to pick on them; I think this is true--and they were going to raise these carp for some reason, and there was some flooding and the carp ended up in the Mississippi River. Now they are all over the Mississippi River and those tributaries leading to it.  Well, if we follow the Mississippi River north from Arkansas and make a right-hand turn north of St. Louis and head up the Illinois River, we are on our way up Lake Michigan. That is the route the Asian carp have been following.  Well, they are all over the Illinois River on their way up to Lake Michigan.
