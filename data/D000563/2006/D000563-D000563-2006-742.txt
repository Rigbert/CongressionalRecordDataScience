President, later this week as part of the debate on the Defense authorization bill, we will talk about Iraq. That a timely issue. As of last week, there have been 2,500 soldiers' lives lost in Iraq since the beginning of this conflict. What was promised to the American people to be a rather uncomplicated effort by America to rid Iraq of a dictator has turned out to be a war that has gone on for 3 years with no end in sight.  This week the Senate will have a chance to say to the Iraqi people that as of the middle of next year, this becomes your responsibility. We will give you 12 months and more American lives and more American dollars and then, Iraq, you have to stand up and defend yourself. If you believe in the future of your Nation, it has to go beyond an election, go beyond political debate. It has to reach the point where Iraqi citizens are prepared to stand, defend, and die, if necessary, for their own country.  There are 130,000 American lives on the line today and every day. We have to serve notice on the Iraqis that their future has to be in their hands.
