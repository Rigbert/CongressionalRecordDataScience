 President, I will start by acknowledging the majority leader's candor yesterday in outlining his party's agenda for the rest of the year--in admitting he actually asked his party's ``political arm,'' the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to come up with it. Maybe he didn't intend to admit that his party's so-called agenda is actually a political gambit or that it basically has one intent--to bail out imperiled Democrats, Democrats desperate to distract from how ObamaCare is devastating the middle class--but it slipped out anyway.  But that wasn't the only Freudian slip we heard at yesterday's press conference. Here is a quote from one of the majority leader's top lieutenants:       When we play the political games that we're playing here,      [middle-class families] feel that we are detached from their      priorities.  Boy, I couldn't agree more with that. Maybe that is why even the press isn't taking this ``agenda'' seriously.
