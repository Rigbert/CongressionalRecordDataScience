President, I rise today to speak on a bill that Senator Cantwell and I introduced yesterday that will make it easier for States and localities to secure meaningful work for dislocated workers. Senator Cantwell is a true advocate for unemployed workers and for economic development, and it has been a pleasure to work with her on this and other initiatives designed to strengthen our workers and our communities.  This is designed to increase the ability of States and local workforce investment boards, under the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, to match trained workers with productive jobs and also to create systematic change in a targeted industry or occupation. Our bill creates a three-step process for States and local workforce boards to accomplish this goal:  The first step involves a study. Using the latest labor market and economic information, States or local workforce boards will prepare detailed assessments of local areas that identify the gaps between the expected and demand and supply of labor in industry sectors. The second step involves plan. Local workforce boards will join with partners from industry, labor, and the economic development and training sectors to develop comprehensive plans for implementing the assessments, in order to fill the gap between supply and demand. The third and final step involves grants. The local boards will make seed grants for training individuals to meet the demand for workers in certain industries.  In my home State of Maine, I have worked with local workforce boards, regional technical colleges and high schools, businesses, workers and community leaders to develop training programs that focus on particular market sectors within a particular region. I secured federal appropriations for programs to train workers in the metal trades in northern and western Maine. Today, dislocated workers in Aroostook County and Rumford, Maine are being trained as metal workers.  I also secured funding for a training pilot project in the Central Maine area that will introduce a photonics curriculum in the regional technical high school to train students for careers in the growing field of photonics. This year I am hopeful that a request to fund a program targeted at training in the health care area in Southern Maine will be granted.  This bill takes an innovative approach and provides tools to states, localities and regions to implement the provisions of the Workforce Investment Act more effectively. By retraining dislocated workers, we give them access to productive and well-paying work. We also make our workforce stronger to face the challenges of the global marketplace.                          ____________________
