Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lifetime of contributions that Edward Bela Ujvagi made to his family, community and to our world before his passing on Monday, October 4, 1999. A resident of the city for over forty years, Mr. Ujvagi was an erudite gentleman of the first order. Popular and well loved, he embodied the ideals of a virtuous and loving generation. He will be missed by all who knew him. On behalf of Ohio's lawmakers and citizens, I wish to pay tribute to this outstanding individual.  Born in Budapest, Hungary, on March 11, 1916 Mr. Ujvagi was an avid outdoorsman, taking part in activities such as ski jumping, glider flying, boxing and more. He became a precision machinist and master tool and die maker, founding a small company that specialized in producing precision analytical balances. His company, however, was eventually nationalized by the communist regime. When the people of Hungary revolted against this government in 1956, Mr. Ujvagi, at the age of 40, fled to the United States with his wife and four children. A fifth would be born in America. They spent six months in an Austrian refugee camp along the way. Despite arriving in our country with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family refused to give up. Mr. Ujvagi founded the Toledo Scientific Instrument Co. in his own basement with only a milling machine and lathe. A very capable man, he was able to use his skills to develop and expand this business into E & C Manufacturing Co. Inc., which has operated for more than four decades. In America, he was able to piece together again the precious shards of a dream deferred.  Edward Ujvagi was truly representative of the ethnically diverse, blue-collar individuals who make up the city of Toledo. Having endured internment in a Russian labor camp following World War II, he was someone who understood freedom: he knew what it meant to have it taken away. He was not just a man who discovered a new life in another country; he was a man who embraced newfound opportunities and possibilities. He took an active role in his community, belonging to the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, St. Stephen's Catholic Church, the Hungarian Club of Toledo, Hungarian Communion of Friends and many more groups. Though fiercely proud of his heritage, he also worked hard to become an American citizen, accomplishing that in April 1965. Mr. Ujvagi was also a great believer in education and urged all of his children to expand their own horizons and pursue their own dreams.  Christopher Morely once wrote, ``There is only one success--to be able to spend your life in your own way.'' Based on this, I honestly believe that Edward Ujvagi was successful in life. He lived his life to the fullest and will be remembered as a man of love, faith, integrity and accomplishment. On behalf of the people of the Ninth District, I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Ujvagi's family, his wife Magda, daughters Magdalene, and Bernadette Ujvagi; sons Charles Edward J. and Toledo City Council President Peter Ujvagi; brother Istvan Ujvagi; and 17 grandchildren. May our thoughts and prayers strengthen them in this time of reflection and profound loss and may a lifetime of memories of this rare individual sustain them today and always.                          ____________________
