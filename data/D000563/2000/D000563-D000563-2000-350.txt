I thank the Senator again.                              S.J. Res. 46       Whereas on June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress,      representing the citizens of 13 American colonies, authorized      the establishment of the Continental Army;       Whereas the collective expression of the pursuit of      personal freedom that caused the authorization and      organization of the United States Army led to our Nation's      Declaration of Independence and the codification of our basic      principles and values in the Constitution of the United      States;       Whereas for the past 225 years, our Army's central purpose      has been to fight and win wars that were typically fought and      won on distant, foreign battlefields, while at home, the Army      provided for the Nation's security;       Whereas whatever the mission, the Nation turns to its Army      for decisive victory, regardless of whether those are      measured in the defeat of foreign Army forces or the timely      delivery of humanitarian assistance at home or abroad;       Whereas the 172 battle streamers carried on the Army's flag      are testament to the valor, commitment, and sacrifice of      those who have served and fought under its banner;       Whereas Valley Forge, New Orleans, Mexico City, Gettysburg,      Verdun, Bataan, Normandy, Pusan, Ia Drang Valley, Grenada,      Panama, and Kuwait are but a few of the places where American      soldiers have won extraordinary distinction and respect for      our Nation and our Army;       Whereas ``Duty, Honor, Country'' are more than mere words,      they are the creed by which the American soldier lives and      serves;       Whereas while no one can predict the cause, location, or      magnitude of future battles, there is one certainty --      American soldiers of character, selflessly serving the      Nation, will continue to be the credentials of our Army;       Whereas the Army is prepared to answer the Nation's call,      and such calls have been increasing in number and disparity      in recent years;       Whereas the threats are less distinct and less predictable      than the past, but more complex and just as real and      dangerous;       Whereas our Army, the world's most capable and respected      ground force, is in the midst of an unparalleled      transformation as it prepares for the new challenges of the      next century and a different world;       Whereas future forces will be prepared to conduct quick,      decisive, highly sophisticated operations anywhere, anytime;      and       Whereas our Army will be ready to fight and win our      Nation's call to service at home and abroad: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That      Congress--       (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that      American soldiers have made throughout the history of the      Nation;       (2) commends the United States Army and American soldiers      for 225 years of selfless service; and       (3) calls upon the President to issue a proclamation      recognizing the 225th birthday of the United States Army and      calling upon the people of the United States to observe that      anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.                                 ______                                       By
