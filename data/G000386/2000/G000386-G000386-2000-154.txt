 President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code. My bill will facilitate phased retirement programs. In April I held a hearing in the Special Committee on Aging. The subject of the hearing was employment of older workers. Several experts told us what could be done to encourage older individuals to remain in the labor market. In today's tight labor markets, older workers are in great demand. Employers have numerous strategies to attract and retain them--one of those is phased retirement.  At our hearing, several witnesses testified that statutory changes to permit phased retirement programs would be helpful. One of those witnesses was Ms. September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric Cooperative in Estherville, Iowa. Ms. Dau noted that the average age of the workforce at her Rural Electric Cooperative is high. Skilled workers are hard to come by and Iowa Lakes has implemented a phased retirement program in order to retain older workers. But they would like the comfort of knowing that their program is sanctioned.  Phased retirement allows a worker to wind down his or her career, by working part-time and retiring part-time. It helps many people maintain their income level rather than quitting work all at once. Financially, it can allow an individual to postpone the time when he or she has to draw down retirement savings. A study performed by Watson Wyatt Worldwide concluded that 16 percent of larger companies already offer phased retirement in some form and another 28 percent show a moderate to high level of interest in offering it in the next two years. But plan sponsors have worries about running afoul of the ``in-service distribution'' rules. Tax rules bar employees from receiving pension distributions before they reach a pension's normal retirement age, which is usually pegged to Social Security. That rule makes it difficult for those who wish to retire gradually and use reduced pension payments to augment reduced pay. It also helps circumvent the ``do-it-yourself'' phased retirement that some workers are forced into where they retire one day from their long-term employer and go to work the next day for someone else. This bill is designed to overcome those problems. At the same time, this provision is completely voluntary and so will not burden plan sponsors.  As I said, we heard from witnesses who supported phased retirement programs. I mentioned September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric Cooperative. But another one was our friend and colleague, Congressman Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota. Congressman Pomeroy told the Committee that phased retirement programs should be allowed as a way of increasing the attractiveness of defined benefit pension plans. Phased retirement programs could also make defined benefit plans more adaptable to the human resource needs of plan sponsors. This is important to Congressman Pomeroy because he is introducing a phased retirement bill that is identical to mine.  Defined benefit plans provide a stream of payments to retirees. They can go a long way to supplementing Social Security. But defined benefit plans are on the decline, especially among small businesses, whose employees are the least likely group to be covered by any form of retirement plan. We know that life expectancy is increasing. We also know that Americans are not saving enough to maintain their standard of living in retirement. By making defined benefit plans more attractive to employers and workers--such as by facilitating phased retirement--we are helping to improve the lives of everyday American people.  I hope that this bill is one step in that direction.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2853       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
