. 4560) to eliminate the deadlines for spectrum auctions of spectrum previously allocated to television broadcasting, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4560       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Auction Reform Act of      2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have      changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the      700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in      1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original      deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are      consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum      management principles.       (2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating      additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other      advanced communications services. The Federal Communications      Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies      in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.       (3) The study being conducted by the National      Telecommunications and Information Administration in      consultation with the Department of Defense to determine      whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish      additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other      advanced communications services will not be completed until      after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz      band, and long after the applications must be filed to      participate in the auction, thereby creating further      uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700      megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for      the benefit of consumers.       (4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the      process of determining how to resolve the interference      problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for      public safety. One option being considered for the 800      megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The      Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before      the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a      tenable plan has been conceived.       (5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by      television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to      digital television is completed. This situation creates a      tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum      will be available and reduces the value placed on the      spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700      megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the      auction would be likely to produce and the probability that      the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued      the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most      productive use.       (6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms      for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations--       (A) produced no certainty that the band would be available      for advanced mobile communications services, public safety      operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the      existing statutory framework provides; and       (B) should advance the transition of digital television and      must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent      licensee.     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF DEADLINES FOR SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.       (a) Communications Act of 1934.--Section 309(j)(14)(C)(ii)      of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.      309(j)(14)(C)(ii)) is amended by striking the second      sentence.       (b) Balanced Budget Act of 1997.--Section 3007 of the      Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (111 Stat. 269) is amended by      adding at the end the following new sentence: ``This section      shall not apply to the band of frequencies between 698 and      806 megahertz, inclusive.''.       (c) Consolidated Appropriations Act.--Paragraphs (2) and      (3) of section 213(a) of H.R. 3425 of the 106th Congress, as      enacted into law by section 1000(a)(5) of an Act making      consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending      September 30, 2000, and for other purposes (Public Law 106-     113; 113 Stat. 1501A-295), are repealed.     SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF SCHEDULED AUCTIONS.       (a) Termination.--The Federal Communications Commission      shall not commence or conduct auctions 31 and 44 on June 19,      2002, as specified in the public notices of March 19, 2002,      and March 20, 2002 (DA 02-659 and DA 02-563).       (b) Report.--Within one year after the date of enactment of      this Act, the Commission shall submit a report to the      Congress--       (1) specifying when the Commission intends to reschedule      auctions 31 and 44; and       (2) describing the progress made by the Commission in the      digital television transition and in the assignment and      allocation of additional spectrum for advanced mobile      communications services that warrants the scheduling of such      auctions.     SEC. 5. COMPLIANCE WITH AUCTION AUTHORITY.       The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct      rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the      auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)).     SEC. 6. PRESERVATION OF BROADCASTER OBLIGATIONS.       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to relieve      television broadcast station licensees of the obligation to      complete the digital television service conversion as      required by section 309(j)(14) of the Communications Act of      1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(14)).
