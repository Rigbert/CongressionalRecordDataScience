President, A question has been raised about statistics. I would point out that during President Bush's last year, with the Democrats in the control of the Senate, by August we had confirmed 53 of the 65 nominees sent to us by the Republican President, notwithstanding the ``Thurmond rule'' which calls for a slowdown in confirmations during a Presidential year--53 out of 65.  In this the first year of President Clinton's second term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 9 out of 61 judicial nominees sent by the President to the Senate by August. So the relevant statistical comparison is 53 out of 65 when Democrats were helping Republicans, but when Republicans are in control and there is a Democratic President, only 9 out of 61.  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished senior Senator from California.
