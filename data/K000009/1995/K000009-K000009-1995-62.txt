Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Sadly, I rise in opposition to this bill, which we have worked so very hard on.  Let me say for the record that I voted for almost every balanced budget amendment that passed this House and maintain a voting record that proves that.  This bill is truly too severe. It cuts housing in our country by over 23 percent. It means seniors living in buildings across this country will be paying $1,000 more a year even though they make $8,000 a year. It means our mayors will have to choose between homeless, where funds are being cut by half, and drug elimination programs, and I think that EPA's cut of 33 percent, when we have got dumps and leaking dumps all over this country and toxic waste that we have to clean up is really wrong.  I think the President had a 2-percent cut in this budget. I think that was reasonable. This budget is too extreme, too sever, and in addition to that, if you read the provisions in the report, it even tries to undermine EPA's ability to enforce environmental standards along our border as a result of NAFTA.  It is even undermining environmental enforcement. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure.  Mr. Chairman, sadly, I rise in opposition to this bill. It is too extreme, at the same time too severe. I want to commend the distinguished chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], for his cordial handling of this very complicated bill and to express my sincere appreciation for his efforts in restoring $10 million of funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs' Health Professional Scholarship Program by transferring funds from other accounts. I also want to acknowledge the diligence an wise counsel of the ranking minority member, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Stokes], on this bill.  Let me point out, I voted for the budget amendments that passed this House and maintain a voting record that proves it. But this bill is not even-handed--it cuts environmental protection by one-third; it cuts housing and senior housing by 25 percent, and it cuts medical care by $250 million at times when our World War II veterans are using the system in greater numbers.                              Introduction  The programs under our committee's jurisdiction provide assistance and benefits that help millions of Americans achieve a better life. Included are programs for medical care and benefits for our Nation's veterans, affordable and decent housing for families and individuals of all incomes and circumstances, a safe and clean environment, and investments in technology and science.  Rather than cutting these budgets by a reasonable amount--say 2 to 5 percent--it axes support for key national commitments. The overall effect of the bill before this body is to seriously erode our efforts for veterans, housing, and the environment. This bill provides inadequate support for our Nation's veterans, and it will impair our ability to provide them quality medical care. It also makes deep cuts in the funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development--25 percent--and the Environmental Protection Agency--32 percent. In addition, this bill continues to fund one very big-ticket item, the space station, at the expense of other programs under the committee's jurisdiction, including ones designed to assist the poorest, the neediest, and the most vulnerable among us. I disagree with the severity of the reductions. And what makes it more egregious is that all the savings will not be used to balance the budget. Rather, the money is being controlled to give tax breaks to the Fortune 500 ``big daddies'' later this year. This is simply wrong.                Health Professional Scholarship Program  Let me say, I am grateful to the chairman for his willingness to work with me to fund the Health Professional Scholarship Program. This educational and training program assists in assuring an adequate supply of trained health professionals, not only for the VA but also the Nation. To date, these scholarship awards have provided more than 4,000 scholarships to students in nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and nurse anesthesia. I thank the chairman for his strong willingness to cooperate and provide leadership on this health scholarship program which helps advance professionals during a time when tuition costs are skyrocketing.  Upon graduation, students are required to complete 2 years of service in the VA health system, and the retention rate of the scholarship recipients in VA medical centers is greater than 50 percent.  The flexibility to provide scholarships for the education of a variety of health professionals has made this program particularly useful as changes have occurred in the delivery of health care services. As the program has identified shortages in particular categories of health professionals, the numbers and types of scholarship awards have been shifted accordingly. For example, in fiscal year 1994, more awards were made for advanced practice nurses, in contrast to entry-level nurses, and for physical therapists and occupational therapists. These are the health professionals currently in shortest supply in the VA, and they are anticipated to be needed nationwide in the future. This academic year, the program will be adding physician assistant awards to meet the needs of a health care system that is increasingly focusing on primary care.  The funding of this program is vital to the recruitment and retention of scarce health professionals in the VA, and it is necessary to be responsive to the health care needs of veterans who have courageously defended this Nation. I thank the chairman for his strong leadership on this program.                       eap/nafta report language  I also oppose this bill because it contains too much free rein with legislation on an appropriation bill.  In addition, the report to this bill contains language which undermines our ability to enforce NAFTA. The report to the bill questions EPA's use of subpoenas to collect United States-Mexico border environmental data it infers EPA's issuing subpoenas to American companies with subsidiaries located in the vicinity of the New River and Imperial Valley in southern California, has somehow contravened NAFTA. This language is just one more example of the influence of big business lobbyists, and the extent to which the majority has subordinated the health and safety of our continent to pure greed.  Everyone knows that the EPA is well within its authority in issuing these subpoenas. They were issued to U.S. companies, which are required to comply with existing U.S. standards. The NAFTA contains provisions that protect our rights to determine and apply our own levels of environmental protection, and the Toxic Substances Control Act specifically authorizes the EPA to issue subpoenas as it did in this case. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be better served by listening to the Member of their own party who represents the district in question rather than the special interests and big business lobbyists who would use report language such as this in an attempt to intimidate the EPA into backing off of an investigation which would have major health implications for our citizens.                               conclusion  As I outlined earlier during the debate on the rule, I also oppose this bill because it zeroes out the effective drug elimination program. That has stemmed the drug tide across this Nation. Because of its elimination as well as the reductions in other vital programs that help veterans, the elderly, and children, I must oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. The bill is not balanced, and its savings will not help reduce deficit, but rather be transferred to billions in tax breaks to the privileged few. How sad.
