I hope it does not come to that. But, make no mistake: the reason there is momentum toward considering a change in our rules is this kind of pettifoggery, delay for the sake of delay,and treating this President differently from past Presidents.  If the Republican caucus continues to abuse the filibuster rules and obstruct these fine nominees without justification, then I believe this body must consider anew whether a rules change should be in order. As I stated above, that is not a change that I want to see happen but if Republican Senators are going to hold nominations hostage without consideration of their individual merit, drastic measures may be warranted.  Earlier this year, nearly every single Senate Democrat pushed the Majority Leader for a rules change in the face of Republican obstruction. I was one of the few members of the majority who voiced concern about changing the Senate rules. I believe that if Republicans filibuster yet another well-qualified nominee to this court tonight, it will be a tipping point. Senate Republicans have blocked three well-qualified women in a row from receiving a confirmation vote and now they are on the brink of filibustering the next nominee, Judge Robert Wilkins. I fear that after tonight the talk about changing the cloture rules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will be action. We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to continue without undermining the Senate's role provided in the Constitution and without harming our independent Federal judiciary.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
