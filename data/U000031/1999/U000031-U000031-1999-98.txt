Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's support. I know that it has been there from the very onset, and we worked in a very strong bipartisan basis to make sure this was done, and as I live along the Great Lakes in St. Joseph, Michigan, and I think about all the harbors all the way up to Mackinaw and Lake Superior, these are needed, they are very precious, and this amendment, I think, will really help to preserve those in the future.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. Upton was allowed to proceed for 1 additional minute.)
