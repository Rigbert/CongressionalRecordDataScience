Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1296) to provide for the administration of certain Presidio properties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer, with a Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and agree to the conference asked by the Senate.
