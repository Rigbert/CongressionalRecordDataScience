 President, with your permission, rather than immediately comment on the same subject matter, I ask, as we used to say in the Senate, a point of personal privilege. I would like to comment on a story that was published in my hometown newspaper that is the antithesis of problems relating to juvenile delinquency. It is a story about a family I am very close to.  I should say at the outset I am prejudiced in this regard. I have a very close relationship and high regard for the father and mother of this family, and three of the four children in this family have worked with me and are friends of my children. One of them is in this Chamber today at my request as an employee of one of our colleagues from Florida.  Mr. President, I want to tell this story because we rarely get a chance to share with our colleagues the kind of story I am about to share and, I might add, that in my almost 25 years in the Senate I have only done this on one other occasion, but I think it is just remarkable.  The story is about a family named Kimmel, the Kimmel family. Going way back, I didn't practice law with but practiced law in adjoining suites to Mort Kimmel and knew his wife Marsha. We go back now about 30 years.  Mr. President, it is the kind of story which I rarely share but my reluctance to discuss this in a public forum was increased initially because the individuals involved were such close personal friends, Mort and Marsha Kimmel and their family. I have known Mort and Marsha, as I said, for 30 years and the children have worked with me on my campaigns and have been friends with my children as well. They are among the most giving and caring people I know.  A story appeared on the front page of our largest statewide newspaper entitled ``Triumph of the Heart.'' I will ask at the appropriate time it be printed in the Record. It is a picture of my buddy, Mort Kimmel, and his wife and his four children. I will explain that in a minute. It is focused on a young man named Larry Spiller who is, in fact, the nephew of Mort and Marsha Kimmel.  It is really a story about Larry Spiller and his aunt and uncle and his cousins who welcomed Larry into their home and into their hearts after a severe family tragedy. I think it holds some lessons for what we all say we value but few of us practice. It is a story of selflessness, of sacrifice, and, most of all, of what being family, in my opinion, is all about.  On New Year's Eve, in 1987, the Spiller family got on an airplane--mother, father, and three children--to head to a ski trip in Vermont. Larry's father had a commercial pilot's license. He was instrument-rated but got caught while flying the family up to Vermont, after one stop and then taking off again, in a wind shear 90 feet before the runway as they were landing and the plane crashed. Larry's mother and father both died in the crash, and Larry's two brothers were mortally injured. This young man, Larry Spiller, was then 8 years old. He was the only survivor. And because he happened to have switched seats with his mom just before they attempted to land--he had been riding in the copilot seat, and his mom wanted to get up front to help his dad because of the weather--and he was seated in a seat where his back was to the pilot, I expect and most people think that is the reason why he survived.  Well, what happened was, on that awful day, there was a meeting shortlythereafter that took place in another family, and that is in the family of the brother-in-law, the family of the partner, because Larry's father and my friend, Mort Kimmel, were law partners. But Larry's father happened to have a mother who was the sister of my friend, Mort Kimmel. And so Mort and Marcia Kimmel and their three young children--Wayne, who is now 27, Michelle, who works here in Washington, who is now 24, and Karen, 18--held a family meeting and they made a very fateful decision. They made a decision to bring Larry into their home as another son, another sibling--no holds barred, absolute, total, equal.  Karen, who is now 18 years old, on her own volition gave up her bedroom for her cousin. That was her idea. And many other personal, what appeared to be sacrifices were made through the selfless acts of the three children and the mother and father. It is the kind of selfless family decision that is so often talked about, that we see in the movies and we see glorified, but so seldom do we know of it occurring. Because we all have a tendency to rationalize when that kind of thing happens, even though it is your sister's child who survived. I can picture thousands of good people rationalizing, ``Well, wait, we only have so much. If we bring in Larry, then what about our three children? And maybe it is best for * * *'' and so on and so forth. As the Presiding Officer knows, the ability of the human mind to rationalize is mind-boggling. But they made no rationalization. They, in a genuine family decision involving all three of their children, decided that there was only one course of action.  There were adjustments and sacrifices for everyone involved. But for the Kimmels, that is all part of being a family. You hear a lot of talk these days about family values, but the Kimmels and Larry Spiller, that young 9-year-old boy at the time, have lived out what in reality is an old-fashioned notion, that families are there for one another.  We have an expression in my family. After my wife and daughter were killed, I came home from the hospital, my two sons were in the hospital, and my sister had already moved into my house. She didn't ask anything--my younger sister and her husband. We have an expression in our family: If you have to ask, it's too late. Well, they didn't have to ask; they just decided and they acted.  Whether it involves taking in an orphaned child or bringing in an elderly parent or grandparent in your home, providing a sibling or an aunt or an uncle a place to get back on their feet on solid ground after a period of rough going or ill health, these sacrifices are all examples of what we mean by family. Make no mistake about it: These decisions are not easy. But family values, real, practice-what-you-preach family values, don't always make it easy for us to make decisions. And they are not always convenient.  Family is, rather, about commitment. And the Kimmel family is a living testament to that commitment.  Let me tell you what the article was about. I will not go on much longer. The article is focused on how this young man, Larry Spiller, who is now graduating from one of the finest high schools in Delaware, about how well he has done in this family. He has excelled both academically and athletically. This young man made all State in both baseball and basketball, did incredibly well in school, and will be attending Cornell University. Like so many other great schools, it is very difficult to get into, and his family has every right to be proud of this young man.  It would have been easy for a 9-year-old child, I can tell you from experience, having been tragically robbed, in this case of his entire immediate family, to let that tragedy define his life. No one would have begrudged him that. That happens to a lot of people whose lives have been scarred by tragedy. And it would have been equally understandable had Mort and Marcia Kimmel and their children allowed Larry to slip into that kind of thinking or allowed Larry to slip through their fingers and allowed the tragedy to be the focal point of their lives. But that did not happen. They all grieved, of course, and still do. But they have been able to move on, to live their lives as a dynamic family, each of them involved in school and sports and civic activities. They proved that while bad things do happen to good people, good things happen, too, especially when you make up your mind not to let the bad experiences define and dominate your life.  Last summer, young Larry turned 18 and received the bulk of his parents' estate. It was a substantial sum of money for a young man just beginning to make his way in the world. It could make Larry's life a lot easier in the coming years. But, instead, Larry Spiller and the Kimmels have used the money to establish the Kimmel-Spiller Charitable Foundation to help sick children and those facing injuries and disabilities.  In the newspaper interview that I will submit for the Record, he, young Larry, who was graduating, as I said, was asked what he had to say about this. He said, ``There is really no need for me to have all that. I want to work for my own money as a lawyer, which I will probably do, and my parents''--he refers to Mort and Marcia as his parents--``will support me through college. It could help other people.''  How many young kids, with that kind of a capability, that kind of money, would say, ``You know, there is really no need for me to have it; I'll work for my own money; I'll be able to do it''?  Larry goes on to say in that article, ``I'm lucky to be here. I'm lucky I could just move into another family and be so stable. I was always happy to have a second chance.''  Larry Spiller and Wayne and Michelle and Karen Kimmel, the other children, and their parents, Mort and Marcia Kimmel, are a very special family, and in their story lie some valuable lessons for all of us. It is not easy to be a family. The decisions aren't always painless decisions. Sacrifice almost always goes with love. But when love is there, anything can be overcome.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wilmington News Journal about Larry Spiller and his family be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the News Journal, June 11, 1997]                          Triumph of the HeartORPHANED AT 9 AND TAKEN IN BY HIS UNCLE AND FAMILY, LARRY SPILLER IS A             STORY OF ACADEMIC, ATHLETIC AND PERSONAL SUCCESS                          (By Kevin Tresolini)       Your heart wants to ache for Larry Siller, but he will not      let it.       He is a young man who could have withdrawn, cursing the      fates--and the wind shear--that orphaned him almost 10 years      ago.       Instead, he radiates happiness.       ``I consider myself lucky,'' Spiller said. ``It's not as if      nothing has happened, but I'm very comfortable with who I      am.''       Now 18, he is poised to move into the next phase of life      with his graduation tonight from Tower Hill School. He has      excelled academically--earning admission to Cornell      University beginning this fall--as well as athletically,      making All-State in basketball and baseball.       Spiller almost didn't live to see this day.       He was 9 years old, traveling with his parents and two      brothers on Dec. 31, 1987, when the six-seat Piper Lance      airplane carrying the family crashed 10 feet short of the      runway at Burlington (Vt.) International Airport.       Spiller's father, Paul, a 39-year-old Wilmington attorney      who was piloting the plane he co-owned, and mother, Judith,      35, were killed instantly. His brothers, Harvey, 14, and      David, 5, suffered severe spine and head injuries and died      within two weeks.       A National Transportation Safety Board investigation      concluded that wind shear--a sudden, violent, vertical burst      of wind--brought the plane down.       Spiller, who suffered a broken leg and concussion,      survived. And he has become an inspiration to others around      him.       ``What he's done is unbelievable,'' said David Glazier, a      Brandywine High School senior who is a close friend. ``He's      the opposite of what you think might happen. I've never seen      him upset.''       ``He is an absolutely outstanding individual,'' said Steve      Hyde, his baseball coach at Tower Hill, ``in every sense of      the word.''                 the plane crash that changed his life       Paul Spiller was an experienced pilot with a commercial      pilot's license, a flight instructor's certificate and 734      hours of flying time when the Piper Lance left Greater      Wilmington Airport at 1:30 p.m. bound for Rutland, Vt.       The Spillers were going to meet friends for a quick      vacation at the Killington ski resort.       According to federal transportation officials, the plane      landed in Binghamton, N.Y., at 2:47 p.m. to wait out bad      weather. At 4:01, the plane left Binghamton.       About an hour later, the Spillers' plane was cleared for      approach to Rutland. But the plane began to accumulate ice,      and Paul     Spiller asked to be diverted to clearer weather. He was      informed that Burlington, the picturesque college town      straddling Lake Champlain 67 miles to the north, had radar      contact and 15 miles visibility. He headed there.       At 5:20 p.m., when he couldn't maintain 5,500 feet altitude      because of ice, Spiller declared an emergency. He was given      permission to descend to 2,000 feet, where ice began coming      off the windshield. Then it iced up again, and the Burlington      control tower turned the runway lights up.       ``I was in the front seat with my dad when he called an      emergency,'' Larry Spiller remembered. ``My mom said, `Switch      seats with me. I want to be up front to help your father.' ''       Larry moved to the second row of seats, which pointed      backward. His brothers were facing him. Behind them was the      luggage compartment.       At 5:40 p.m., the pilot radioed again. ``The runway is      clear now. I can see it clearly. Thank you.''       All seemed fine. One minute later, Paul Spiller radioed      again and was cut off midword.       ``I just experienced what I think to be wind sh--''       The plane plummeted 200 feet to the ground and slid another      100 feet. It briefly caught fire, but emergency workers--     stationed nearby because of the emergency call--quickly      extinguished the flames.       Workers found Larry, conscious, with the luggage. They took      him and his unconscious brothers to the Medical Center      Hospital of Vermont.       Spiller could not recall the crash when he woke up in the      hospital and saw his mother's brother, Morton Kimmel.       ``When I told him, [about the accident] he didn't believe      it,'' Kimmel said. ``I said, `It's true.' ''       Larry visited his brothers, who never regained      consciousness.       ``I think about [my family] pretty much every day, even if      it's just for a second,'' Larry said. ``They're * * *.                       Spiller gets a new family       With the crash, Morton Kimmel lost his sister, two nephews      and a brother-in-law who was his law partner.       But he gained a son, when he took Spiller into his family.       Kimmel and wife, Marcia, eventually became Spiller's legal      guardian. His cousins--Wayne, now 27, Michell, 24, and Karen,      also 18--became his new siblings.       ``They took me in and I was just part of their family,''      Spiller said. ``Ever since then, I've been calling them my      parents and my brothers and sister.       ``It's really a very normal life. I didn't change schools.      I didn't change sports.       ``My first father coached me in every sport. My present      father now coaches everything, too. Few things changed except      the people I was living with.''       Larry's grandparents, Benjamin and Bebe Spiller, now living      in Pompano Beach, Fla., lost their son, daughter-in-law and      two grandsons. Larry gave them a lifeline, Benjamin Spiller      said.       ``We survived because of him.''                         `can I call you mom?'       On his first night with his new family, 9-year-old Larry      Spiller, a boy with his whole life ahead of him but the lives      of his immediate family members behind him, tentatively asked      his aunt, Marcia, ``Can I call you mom?''       Feeling it was too soon, and not wanting Larry to forget      his real parents, she responded, ``Let's just wait.''       The following New Year's Eve, one year to the day after the      crash, he asked again.       ``I was tucking him into bed,'' she said, ``and he said,      `It's been a year', and asked again. We have family meetings      every week. I said, `This would be a big change,' but I knew      it would be all right. We talked about it at our next family      meeting and said, `We'd love to do this.' ''       Stripped of the security of his immediate family, Larry had      every reason to feel alone. He never did.       ``Our families were so close,'' said Spiller, who was a      Tower Hill third-grader at the time of the crash. ``We were      together all the time anyway before the crash. I never felt      alone at all, there were so many people around me.''       One of the most important was Karen, a cousin eight months      younger than Larry.       ``Everybody was walking on eggshells,'' Mort Kimmel said of      Larry's first fragile days with his ``new'' family. ``Except      Karen. Karen gave him her room. Karen brought him back into      reality.''       At Tower Hill, classmates marveled at Spiller's strength.       ``I remember when he came back to school,'' said longtime      pal Chip Goodman. ``His leg was in a cast and part of his      head was shaved. But that was all there was to tell you what      had happened.''       As Spiller developed into an athlete, his new family      cheered him on. He would up scoring more than 1,100 points as      a Tower Hill basketball player, the third-highest total in      school history.       A pitcher and infielder in baseball, he batted .375 as a      junior and .351 this spring, securing All-State recognition      both years. He'll play in Saturday's annual Blue-Gold Senior      All-Star Game, and made the Delaware South roster for this      month's Phillies-sponsored Carpenter Cup tri-state tournament      at Veterans Stadium. This summer, he's again playing for the      defending state champion R.C. du Pont American Legion      baseball team.                      giving away his inheritance       On Aug. 5 last summer, Larry's 18th birthday, his      biological parents' financial holdings and life insurance      benefits, which had been held in trust, became Spiller's. The      amount, he said, ``is substantial.''       He's giving it away. Along with his present parents, Larry      has set up the Kimmel Spiller Charitable Foundation. The      first grant will likely be worth $30,000 Mort Kimmel said.       ``It's a fund for sick kids or people injured or with      disabilities,'' Spiller said. ``There's really no need for me      to have it. I want to work for my own money as a lawyer,      which I'll probably do, and my parents will support me      through college. It could help other people.       ``I definitely consider myself lucky,'' Spiller said again.      ``Just switching seats with my mom. If I hadn't done that,      there's no way I would have had a chance to survive.       ``I'm lucky to be here. I'm lucky I could just move into      another family and be so stable. I was always happy to have a      second chance.''
