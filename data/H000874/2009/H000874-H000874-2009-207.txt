 As the gentleman knows--he and I discussed this issue--it's my understanding that Mr. Boehner and the Speaker are having ongoing discussions with respect to that. I know the Speaker is having ongoing discussions with the committee as well. Hopefully, whatever happens between Mr. Boehner and the Speaker will be disclosed to you as well as to me.
