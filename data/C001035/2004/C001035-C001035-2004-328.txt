President, I will quote Acting CIA Director John McLaughlin from our September 8 hearing on this very issue. He said:       If there is a separate appropriation for the foreign      intelligence program, the national intelligence program, as      distinct from the current arrangement where that      appropriation is buried in the larger Defense Department      bill, I think it would make some sense to declassify the      overall number for the foreign intelligence program.  That was typical of our witnesses.  I also note that the top line has been made public on occasion in the past. It was made public in 1997 and 1998 by the DCI.  At this point there are numerous Senators who are asking what the plan is for today and who are trying to catch planes. I ask for the regular order with respect to Lautenberg amendment No. 3802, and I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes on each side prior to a motion to table the amendment. I further ask for the yeas and nays.
