President I will speak briefly. One of the things I am going to do today is join the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Salazar--in fact, I should note that this is the first time I have seen the distinguished Presiding Officer in the chair. He looks as though he was born to preside here, and he does it well. I am going to join him in introducing a bill to include Cesar Chavez among the names of the great civil rights leaders we honored in the title of last year's Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.  When we were considering this legislation in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Salazar made a compelling argument why that name, an American hero's name, should be added to the bill: because he devoted and sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable in America, as did Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King.  Cesar Chavez's name should be added to the law as an important recognition of the broad landscape of political inclusion made possible by the Voting Rights Act. This bill would not alter the act's vital remedies to address continuing discrimination in voting, but rather it is overdue recognition of the importance of the Voting Rights Act to Hispanic-Americans.  I offered Senator Salazar's amendment in the Judiciary Committee. The moral weight of what he wanted to do was so compelling that in a committee often fractured, it passed unanimously. It was included. It was not included in the final bill because as we were nearing the ending time, we did not want to have to have the bill go back and forth to the other body again because we wanted to get it on the President's desk in time. I committed to the distinguished Senator from Colorado that I would join him again this year, and I say with virtual certainty that the Senate Judiciary Committee will move very rapidly with that issue this year. I have the commitment of the new chairman backing that up, as does he have mine. And so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this measure as we convene the new Congress and commit ourselves once again to ensuring that the great promises of the 14th and 15th Amendments are kept for all Americans.                    Comprehensive Immigration Reform  Mr. President, as this new Congress begins, we have a tremendous opportunity before us to enact fair, comprehensive immigration reform. It is time for bipartisan action. So I join with Senators from both sides of the aisle to call for comprehensive immigration reform, and I will work to enact it. We have to put aside the mean-spiritedness and shortsighted policies driven by fear and recognize the dignity of those whose work contributes to reinvigorating America. Consistent with our heritage as a nation of immigrants, we need to bring people out of the shadows. My maternal grandparents were immigrants to this country. My wife's parents came as immigrants to this country. We are a nation of immigrants. And those of us who are here now should not think that somehow we got here differently, and that we should close the doors to the rest. That is not the American way.  Through comprehensive immigration reform, we can increase the opportunities for American businesses to obtain the workers they need while ensuring that priority is given to willing workers already in this country, from dairy farms in Vermont to multinational corporations. We have been told of the plight of the American farmers from New York to California. We have seen the pictures of the piles of rotting fruit that have gone unharvested. We hear American technology companies lamenting lost opportunities and the loss of skilled innovators to other countries. Dairy farmers are yearning for more available legal workers in my own State of Vermont. But worse yet, others have watched families in their employ be torn apart through piecemeal, inconsistent, sometimes heavyhanded enforcement efforts. I have met some of those families. I have talked to people who were fifth, sixth, seventh generation Vermonters who say how unfair it is to see these good families torn apart by seemingly arbitrary immigration enforcement efforts. No American farmer, no business, should be put in the position of having to choose between obeying the law or losing their livelihood.  Where American workers can fill available jobs, of course they should be given priority. But where these jobs are available but unclaimed by American citizens, it makes no sense to deny willing foreign workers the opportunity to work. We can strike a balance if we work together.  We must streamline and reform our visa system for low-skilled workers so we can help reduce the crippling backlogs that affect American businesses. And we must increase the number of low-skilled work visas issued each year to keep up with the needs of our economy. We should enact stronger, consistent employer verification procedures. We should impose penalties for those employers who flout the law and exploit those who have no voice. We can do this by working together and enacting comprehensive reform.  Through comprehensive and smart reforms we can increase our security. Let us work to focus enforcement efforts and protect our citizens from those who seek to do us harm. Let us put an end to the enforcement conditions that end in too many needless deaths in the deserts of the Southwest, families--spouses and children--who die needlessly trying to seek the promise of America. We also have to take a smart approach in dealing with the millions of people already here, one that does not divide families and make instant criminals out of millions of people but rather honors our Nation's best traditions. When we enact reforms to bring the millions of undocumented people of this country out of the shadows, greater accountability will follow. When we provide incentives for undocumented people to enter a path to citizenship, we will encourage them to live up to our traditions of citizenship and civic responsibility. When we endow those who seek to better their lives andthe lives of their families with the tools to do so legally, we help instill in them a sense of belonging, of patriotism, of opportunity. Those who decry this aspect of immigration reform must carefully consider the alternative path. By driving more people underground, we foster a culture of lawlessness and mistrust.  We can't wall ourselves off from the world. A 700-mile fence on a 2,000-mile border is not the answer. Last fall, the Republican Congress rushed through a bill to build 700 miles of fencing and did so against the advice of the Department of Homeland Security. That fence bill was neither fair nor comprehensive. I share the disappointment of tens of millions of Americans who had hoped President Bush would have exercised his constitutional authority to veto that costly, cobbled-together and mean-spirited law. Instead, the President seemed to have abandoned his principles in signing the Secure Fence Act: legislation that will cost between $2 billion and $9 billion and fail to perform as advertised to seal our southern border. Scarring our southwestern landscape with a symbol of fear, pandering, and intolerance offends the great heritage of our Nation by sending the wrong message to our neighbors and to the world about American values. It was a pricey bumper sticker law passed to curry favor in certain quarters before the elections. Instead, by focusing on technology, innovation, and personnel rather than partisan politics and divisive walls, we can do a better job of securing our border.  The President has said many times that in order for the United States to achieve real security, we must have comprehensive immigration reform which must include a realistic solution to bring out of the shadows the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country and at the same time meet the pressing needs of employers who are looking for willing workers. In numerous statements, including a speech in Mission, TX, in August 2006, he recognized that without all components of comprehensive reform working together, immigration reform will not work.  So I will continue working to enact legislation to secure our borders and strengthen our economy and bring about a realistic solution for the millions of people who want to work and live legally in our country. I will continue to support fair and comprehensive immigration reform that will respect the dignity of those who seek to join mainstream American society and better their lives in the United States. Let's hope that common sense and bipartisanship will prevail and that the promises of America, those promises of America that encouraged my grandparents to come to this country and my wife's parents to come to this country, are still there. Let us not enact laws that are beneath the dignity of a great and noble and welcoming Nation. Let us pass legislation that reflects what is the best of America and reflects the America that is a diverse country made up of people of diverse backgrounds. We will be stronger and better for it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
