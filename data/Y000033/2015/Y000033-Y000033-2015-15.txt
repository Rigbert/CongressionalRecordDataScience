Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Native American Energy Act.  Having an all-of-the-above energy policy means all people in all communities. Each community across the country should have the opportunity to unleash the natural resources closest to them to help meet their energy needs. For those of us in the Pacific Northwest, it means encouraging biomass.  We have just had a devastating wildfire season, and the issue of forest health continues to be on the forefront. Fallen trees, overgrowth, and general mismanagement have led to worsening fire seasons.  By encouraging forest products for biomass, we would add and have a benefit of reducing forest fire risk by keeping our lands healthier, in addition to creating a stable energy source.  This legislation allows a pilot project to encourage greater biomass production on tribal forestland. In my district in eastern Washington, it would help the confederated tribes of the Colville Reservation, who already play a very active role in forest management, get new tools at their disposal to maintain the health of the adjacent forest to the reservation. It would help them develop energy and, most importantly, help them protect their homeland.  I am proud to support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.
