 President, I am offering today legislation to assist Mrs. Ruth Hairston, of Carson, California. Identical legislation has passed the House without objection under the sponsorship of Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald. I am pleased to support this effort in the Senate.  Mrs. Hairston requires this extreme step in order to be able to pursue a federal court appeal of the Merit Systems Protection Board (# CSF 2221413), which denied Mrs. Hairston's eligibility for an annuity following the retirement and untimely death of her former husband. The legislation does not require the annuity, but will only permit the filing of an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. As a result, Mrs. Hairston will be permitted to challenge the denial on the merits, rather than accept the denial due to the failure to file an appeal within thirty days.  I would briefly like to describe the facts that warrant this legislation.  Mr. Paul Hairston retired in 1980, electing a survivor annuity for Mrs. Hairston to receive one-half the retirement benefit under the settlement terms. Mr. and Mrs. Hairston began receiving benefits in 1988.  The Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews Civil Service retirement claims, concluded Mr. Hairston had failed to register Mrs. Hairston for survivors benefits following passage of 1985 law, renewing the survivor annuity previously selected in 1985. As a result the spousal survivor benefits for Mrs. Hairston were canceled. Following Mr. Hairston's death in 1995, Mrs. Hairston's benefits, her portion of his retirement benefit under the divorce settlement, ceased. Mrs. Hairston was denied eligibility as a surviving spouse, but did not challenge or appeal the denial of eligibility, due to hospitalization and poor health.  I am pleased to introduce this private legislation to assist my constituent Mrs. Ruth Hairston. While this legislation represents an extraordinary measure, the step is necessary in order to permit her to appeal the denial of eligibility by the Merit Systems Protection Board in federal court. As I have previously stated, this legislation does not require any specific outcome. The federal court will review the appeal with all the rigor the case deserves. However, Mrs. Hairston will receive her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board to deny her eligibility.  I understand Mrs. Hairston is under considerable financial pressure and could face foreclosure on her home. I am pleased to try to assist Mrs. Hairston in her appeal. Mr. President, I hope you and the subcommittee will support this bill so that Mrs. Hairston may begin to rebuild her life.                                 ______                                       By
