President, it's time to bring competition back into our Nation's gasoline markets. Across America, gasoline prices have recently soared to the highest levels ever. Right now, gasoline costs 12 cents more than it did at this time last year. In my home State of Oregon, folks are paying a whopping 32 cents more per gallon than in October of last year.  Proven price manipulation is siphoning competition out of the gasoline markets and stealing money from Americans' wallets. It's time that government regulators opened their eyes to reality of rampant price manipulation by gas companies and protected American consumers from getting pummeled at the pump. That's why today I am introducing the Gasoline Free Market Competition Act.  Every extra penny Americans spend on the artificially inflated price of gasoline is a penny they aren't spending on other things--like clothes, groceries, or other consumer items.
