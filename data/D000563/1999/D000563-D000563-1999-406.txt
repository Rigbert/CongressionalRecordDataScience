President, I thank the Senator from Florida, and also Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings, Senator Harkin, and others who have been party to the establishment of this colloquy. I think the Record is eminently clear that the Department of Justice has the authority to move forward on tobacco litigation without any limitation whatsoever from this legislation.  I am glad we achieved that and did it in a bipartisan fashion. I thank Senator Graham for his leadership. I was happy to join him on the amendment and to be part of this colloquy.  I yield the floor.
