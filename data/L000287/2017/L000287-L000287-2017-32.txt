Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Brenda B. Wood, a premier broadcast journalist, one of the best in our region, who has been a newsmaker and news breaker in the Atlanta metro area since 1988. She decided to retire this year after dedicating over 40 years to her career, but I understand she will be returning to the small screen to work on special creative projects. We want to pay tribute to her as she moves into this next phase of her contribution to metropolitan Atlanta.  Ms. Wood was born in Washington, DC, graduated from Takoma Park Academy and got her degree in mass media from Loma Linda University in Southern California in 1977. She reported for several stations in Alabama and Tennessee following her graduation from college but was hired as the evening news anchor and reporter in the Atlanta market first by WAGA-TV, where she hosted an Emmy award-winning news magazine show called Minute by Minute. In 1997, she joined WXlA-TV as its 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. weekday news anchor and spent the next 20 years of her career at the station. Ms. Wood became a trusted voice on the air. We could depend on her to get to the heart of the issues and keep the metro area informed with all the news we needed to know to participate effectively in a democratic society. Her coverage was incisive, balanced, and comprehensive.  During her tenure, Ms. Wood interviewed top newsmakers like President Jimmy Carter, Egypt's former First Lady Jehan Sadat, Ambassador Andrew Young, Cher, the rapper T.I. and many others. She produced several award-winning prime time specials, including Remembering the 1996 Olympics, the year Atlanta hosted the games, A Conversation Across America, 50 Years of Change, Mission of Hope. Ms. Wood developed several special broadcast series like, Journeys with Brenda Wood, a news magazine show, The Last Word commentaries, and The Daily 11 at 7 with Brenda Wood, another award-winning primetime show.  She has taken home 20 Emmy awards and garnered many different honors. Most notably, Ms. Wood was named Georgia Woman of the Year in 2013, was granted the Legacy Award of the Atlanta Business League, the NAACP's Phoenix Award for Best News Anchor, and inducted into the Atlanta Press Club Hall of Fame in 2014, among a host of other honors.  Our community has loved to watch her tell the stories that gave meaning to our lives in the South and described our world so accurately. Ms. Wood never ceased to inform us, inspire us, and will always be a shining light for our city. We all will miss seeing her on the air, but know that Brenda Wood will continue to serve our community as a leader who can bring people and good ideas together.                          ____________________
