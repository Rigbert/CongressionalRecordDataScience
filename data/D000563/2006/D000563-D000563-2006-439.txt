I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his patience.  We have struggled long and hard over the last several months to ask the Republican leadership in the Senate to bring up the issues, the bills, the laws that people care about: reducing the cost of gasoline for working families and businesses and farmers in Nevada, Illinois, Texas, and Nebraska; working on doing something about the 46 million uninsured Americans; dealing with the issues that we face when people cannot afford to send their kids to college; dealing with the real security of America so we live up to the 9/11 Commission recommendations to make America safe.  I will ask the Senator from Nevada, in closing, as we have asked time and time and time again, to bring up the real issues that count, such as an increase in the minimum wage, is it not a fact that, instead, the Republican leadership has pushed aside the real issues, such as money for our troops, pushed aside the energy program which we need for America, and said, instead: We are going to have a parade of constitutional amendments that are extreme--many of them--and then we have to always come back to repealing the estate tax? It is a higher priority to them than anything I have mentioned.
