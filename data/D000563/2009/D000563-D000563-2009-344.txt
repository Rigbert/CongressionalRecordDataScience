President, we gather on the floor today at a time that is historic. It is hard to imagine, to put it in the appropriate context, but this debate over health care reform is remarkably similar to the national debate over the creation of Social Security, or the creation of Medicare. It is that historic. It affects that many Americans and their futures. That is why it is important that all of us come forward to understand what this debate is about, the important issues that are before us.
