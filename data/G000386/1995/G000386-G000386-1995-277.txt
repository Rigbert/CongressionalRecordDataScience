 President, I yield myself 10 minutes.  Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the committee's actions regarding AmeriCorps. I particularly want to commend Senator Bond for his work in this area. But I also have had an opportunity to hear Senators Kyl, Ashcroft, Santorum and Faircloth speak very eloquently on the very same subject. I compliment them for their fine remarks.  I know that Senator Bond has been closely reviewing the AmeriCorps Program and has found, as I have, that there are many unanswered questions concerning AmeriCorps, and further increases at this time do not seem to be advisable.  I have been looking closely at AmeriCorps since last July when I began a series of letters requesting information and data about AmeriCorps. Unfortunately, I did not receive answers to many of the questions that I asked, or the information I received was either misleading or incomplete.  Recently, AmeriCorps has promised me access to much of the data that I requested, and I hope this reflects a genuine change of attitude and a willingness to cooperate.   [[Page S5060]] However, even from the information that I have been provided, there are many reasons to question the merits of this program. Let me first focus on the cost of the program, because in reviewing the actual AmeriCorps grant awards, we have found program after program where costs are $30,000 to $40,000 per AmeriCorps worker.  For example, the organization ACORN recently received a grant of over $1 million from AmeriCorps. ACORN also receives funds from Fannie Mae as well. This program is for 42 AmeriCorps workers, and the cost per worker of over $41,000.  In comparison we could help 20 young people go to college through the use of Pell grants with that same amount of money. Let me add that the costs of the ACORN program do not include the significant Federal overhead, nor the fact that many AmeriCorps workers drop out of the program. Thus, the cost per successful worker, which ought to be the true cost measurement of this program, would be significantly higher than $41,000.  As I mentioned, the cost of $41,000 per worker is by no means out of the ordinary for AmeriCorps. Legal Services Corporation received almost $1 million from AmeriCorps with the cost per AmeriCorps worker of over $48,000. Recently, AmeriCorps finally admitted that in one grant to a Los Angeles school district the taxpayers were paying a consultant $50 an hour--that is an hour, Mr. President.  We are being told that AmeriCorps is beneficial. I do not know what benefit the taxpayers are getting by having somebody on an hourly wage earning the equivalent of over $100,000 per year. This is outrageous and, of course, it gives other boondoggles a bad name.  Mr. President, let me compare AmeriCorps workers with the Boy Scouts, for instance--a well-known group of people who are out doing good every day. They do not receive any money from AmeriCorps. In fact, they were turned down for funding by AmeriCorps so that funding could be provided to such traditional volunteer groups as the EPA and the Department of Agriculture.  The Boy Scouts have over 5.3 million young people and adults performing volunteer work and helping in their communities. According to the Boy Scouts' 1993 annual report, for the National Capital Area Council, their total expenses were $4.8 million, for over 50,000 Scouts, that is $95 per Scout per year.  Well, that sounds about right, does it not? The Federal Government pays someone $50 an hour for 750 hours of work for a total of $37,500 to consult about volunteering. And the private sector can give you almost 400 actual volunteers with the same amount of money without a dime of cost to the taxpayers. Let me say that these Scouts are doing just great work. For example, last November, 40,000 Scouts in the DC area distributed 1 million bags to doorsteps of homes in their communities to help a food collection effort. The next week the Scouts returned to collect the filled bags and to bring them to a central distribution center, which was distributing the bags then to the needy during the holiday season.  I want to now clarify a few points regarding AmeriCorps. First, AmeriCorps workers are spending a significant amount of their time doing work other than helping their communities. For example, under AmeriCorps' own regulations published in the Federal Register, AmeriCorps workers can spend taxpayers' money studying for the GED. I do think that it is fine and good that young people are taking time to study for the GED. However, it is questionable whether our taxpayers' money should pay some young people to study for the GED, when hundreds of thousands study for it without receiving a single dollar from the taxpayers.  The second point I want to make, in summary, is that AmeriCorps was presented to Congress as a way to help young people pay for college. Yet, according to AmeriCorps' own admission, at least a fifth of the workers have not attended college and probably will not attend college. They are not receiving an educational award. They are instead getting cash awards, as was revealed by NBC news very recently. For many, this is just another Government jobs program.  Mr. President, AmeriCorps is a program with costs that are far exceeding the estimates provided by the administration. It is a program that may not be managing the taxpayers' money properly. In many respects, it is a questionable use of taxpayer funds. Since we could certainly stretch these dollars a lot further in programs such as Pell grants.  Finally, AmeriCorps is a proposal that is duplicating, at enormous expense, services that are being provided by the private sector. I, like Senator Bond and so many others, am a skeptic of this program. I am holding off final judgment until I receive the information promised me by AmeriCorps and by the results of the General Accounting Office report that is reviewing the cost of the AmeriCorps Program. Once the data is in, the program may need reinvention. Certainly, we can accomplish the goals of this program without awarding grants with costs of $40,000-plus per worker.  To increase funding for AmeriCorps at this time, with so little known and with so many problems that are known, is not in the best interest of the taxpayers. We need to proceed cautiously with this program until all of the data is in.  So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against any efforts to increase funding for this program.  I yield the floor and yield back any of my unused time.
