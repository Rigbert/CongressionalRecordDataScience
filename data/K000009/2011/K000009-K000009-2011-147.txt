. House of Representatives.  Let our prayers and comfort flow to the victims, to the healers, to those who must carry forward with full memory and understanding of what has transpired and why. Let us strive to do and to be so much better as a people. Our collective feeling of brotherly and sisterly love and the unity that flows from it holds the power to heal.  We all feel that desire. Our constituents feel that desire. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, our beloved colleague, is fighting to show us the way forward. We pray for her and her family. We pray for all victims and their families. We pray for all those who are taking this difficult journey with them.  What a remarkable young woman Gabby is. She represents the highest aspirations of America. She is kind, talented, highly motivated, effervescent and so in love with her husband, Mark. We know Gabby is a fighter and so very enjoyable to be with.  We embrace her, her family, her staff with the same affection as would she. And if Gabby were able at this moment, we know she would be embracing the victims of the fallen and their loved ones.  This is a moment for America to take stock of itself. No one should have to endure what these citizens have had to endure. Frankly, no one should have had to endure the mean-spirited and inciteful political campaigns Gabby did.  In the sweep of history, this attack was an attack on liberty. It desecrates our worth as a people. We must all search our souls. How could such a heinous act transpire?
