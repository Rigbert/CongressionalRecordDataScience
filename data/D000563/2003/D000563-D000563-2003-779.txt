He showed us abeautiful photograph--which I am sure he is going to refer to again--of this little girl who had survived and conquered all of these challenges.  I ask the Senator from California, we all know these stories and we admire the courage of the parents and of the children who make it, but doesn't the Senator from California believe, as I do, that we should have adopted the Murray-Reid amendment yesterday which would have guaranteed health insurance coverage for uninsured mothers with these children who are struggling with all of these medical problems? Doesn't the Senator believe that if we are truly committed to these families and these children that Senator Murray and Senator Reid have the best approach in terms of family planning information so that they have wanted pregnancies and that they have health insurance for these children?  Does the Senator believe, as I do, that if one is committed to these children, these mothers, and these families, they should also be committed to health insurance coverage so they can have the care they need to survive and prosper?
