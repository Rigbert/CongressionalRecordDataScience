 President, with regard to the reconciliation bill, we have reached agreement with the minority which I will now propound.  I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, May 13, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the Senate reconciliation bill, if properly reported, and that there then be 14 hours remaining equally divided under the statutory limit.
