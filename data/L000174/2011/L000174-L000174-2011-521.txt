He has worked very hard to help us get to the floor. Considering the enormous amount of time that has been spent by both sides of the aisle on this bill, the amount of time that has been spent working out problems, I wish we could complete it. I understand there are a couple Senators who may have amendments. I am not sure where they are, but I am sure they will show up at some point. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
