 President, I wish to speak about Regina McCarthy's nomination but not about the nominee or her qualifications. Rather, I will highlight a few concerns I have with the EPA and the burdens being placed on those in rural areas and agriculture because of EPA actions.  A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of joining President Obama for lunch. While the purpose of the lunch was to discuss health care reform, I took the opportunity to bring up a few concerns I have with EPA and agriculture. In particular, I raised four issues where EPA policies are causing tremendous concern and are burdening family farmers.
