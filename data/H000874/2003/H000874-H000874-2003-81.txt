Speaker, reclaiming my time, I am not sure how that is going to happen, Mr. Leader. I hope it happens. I hope the gentleman's representation is carried out, but it is hard to see in the next 72 hours how that can be effected, not counting the balance of today.  In any event, can the gentleman tell me if the gentleman expects the conference report to include the Clear Skies initiative? Does the gentleman have knowledge?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman asking me if the Clear Skies initiative is going to be in the energy conference report?
