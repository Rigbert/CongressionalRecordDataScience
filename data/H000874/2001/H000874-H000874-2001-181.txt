The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes), my friend, is helping me with my jacket, who is a graduate of Duke. All the Dukes are pretty gracious tonight. They were not very gracious last Saturday night I noticed.  Mr. Speaker, I humbly rise to deliver an ode to the Duke Blue Devils, college basketball 2001 national champions.  Only one team during the course of the season beat Duke by more than 10 points, the mighty Maryland Terrapins. Unfortunately, it was not Saturday night.  The Duke Blue Devils are champions worthy of the name. They proved it again and again in game after game. But before they could play for the title last night, the Dukies had to get through a Saturday night fright.  The Maryland Terrapins, new to the Final Four, came out of the blocks like they wanted much more. Determined not to fall short to the Blue Devils again, my Terps were as ferocious as a lion guarding her den.  Duke was down 22 points and flat on their backs, 11 at the half, but lo and behold, a comeback was hatched. As the game wore on, the Blue Devils would not quit, and for Maryland's Cinderella season, the slipper no longer fit. But the Blue Devils were not finished; they had not cleared the field.
