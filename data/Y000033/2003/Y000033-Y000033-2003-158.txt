Mr. Speaker, I am again introducing a bill to expand the Alaska Native contracting of Federal land management functions and activities and to promote hiring of Alaska Natives by the Federal government within the State of Alaska.  Many rural Alaska native communities are located within close proximity of refuges that play an important role in the culture of Alaska natives and other residents in rural Alaska. Congress, through Sections 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish programs whereby Native lands were given preference for siting of conservation service unit facilities and for native hiring. These provisions also recognized that the Natives whose front and back yards were now part of the federal parks and preserves systems should be involved in the administering of the lands because of their special knowledge and expertise concerning the natural or cultural resources of such areas.  P.L. 106-488 authorized two pilot projects in the Bering Straits and NANA Region in northwest Alaska. These include the following preserves: Bering Land Bridge National Preserve; Cape Krusentern National Monument; Kobuk Valley National Park; and Noatak National Preserve. Neither of these projects have been implemented.  Twenty-three years have passed since the 1980 ANILCA amendments were enacted, and the contracting and native hire provisions remain unfulfilled by the Department of the Interior. My bill would remedy this by directing the Department of the Interior to implement sections 1307 and 1308 of the 1980 ANILCA amendments and enter into demonstration projects.                          ____________________
