I own a small tree farm in Vermont. In fact, I live on it. We harvest mixed types of trees, mostly hard wood, some soft woods, doing probably 25 to 35 acres a year. The man who does the harvesting was named a couple years in a row as the best forester in Vermont.  He did not get that way by taking unnecessary risks. He has a very good logging business, hires a number of people, logs primarily in the wintertime when the ground is frozen, and moves things out.  Frankly, I would trust him to make some of these judgments, some of the things the Senator is describing. They make no sense in our State, either.  I remember one day walking down the road last winter. It was between 30 and 35 degrees below zero. He was standing with his truck. He really loved it because the roads were frozen and he could move. And he had the roads to himself. But I can see him trying to walk with the type of boots the Senator is talking about. I can see him just breathing into any kind of face mask the Senator is talking about, where it is 30 to 35 degrees below zero. You are going to have nothing but sheer ice on the inside of that face mask. I wonder what kind of safety factor that is going to be.  So, Madam President, I would ask the distinguished senior Senator from Montana, one who has paid more attention to these issues than just about anybody I know in this body, if he would share with me the response to his letter because I think he raises a valid point.
