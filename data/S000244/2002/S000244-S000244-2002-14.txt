Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4757) to improve the national instant criminal background check system, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4757       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Our Lady of Peace Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Since 1994, more than 689,000 individuals have been      denied a gun for failing a background check.       (2) States that fail to computerize their criminal and      mental illness records are the primary cause of delays for      background checks. Helping States automate their records will      reduce delays for law-abiding gun owners.       (3) 25 States have automated less than 60 percent of their      felony criminal conviction records.       (4) 33 States do not automate or share disqualifying mental      health records.       (5) In 13 States, domestic violence restraining orders are      not automated or accessible by the national instant criminal      background check system.       (6) In 15 States, no domestic violence misdemeanor records      are automated or accessible by the national instant criminal      background check system.                    TITLE I--TRANSMITTAL OF RECORDS     SEC. 101. ENHANCEMENT OF REQUIREMENT THAT FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS                    AND AGENCIES PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION TO                    THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK                    SYSTEM.       (a) In General.--Section 103(e)(1) of the Brady Handgun      Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note) is amended--       (1) by inserting ``electronically'' before ``furnish''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following: ``The head of each      department or agency shall ascertain whether the department      or agency has any records relating to any person described in      subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United      States Code and on being made aware that the department or      agency has such a record, shall make the record available to      the Attorney General for inclusion in the system to the      extent the Attorney General deems appropriate. The head of      each department or agency, on being made aware that the basis      under which a record was made available under this section      does not apply or no longer applies, shall transmit a      certification identifying the record (and any name or other      relevant identifying information) to the Attorney General for      removal from the system. The Attorney General shall notify      the Congress on an annual basis as to whether the Attorney      General has obtained from each such department or agency the      information requested by the Attorney General under this      subsection.''.       (b) Immigration Records.--The Commissioner of the      Immigration and Naturalization Service shall cooperate in      providing information regarding all relevant records of      persons disqualified from acquiring a firearm under Federal      law, including but not limited to, illegal aliens, visitors      to the United States on student visas, and visitors to the      United States on tourist visas, to the Attorney General for      inclusion in the national instant criminal background check      system.
