President, today I introduce the Zero Tolerance for Veteran Homelessness Act. This bill enhances and expands the assistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to homeless veterans and veterans at risk of becoming homeless.  It is one of our Nation's great tragedies that on any given night, according to estimates by the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 67,000 veterans are homeless. The Department further estimates that about 145,000 veterans experience homelessness each year and that nearly 1/5th of all homeless people in the United States are veterans. These numbers are expected to climb as our service members who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan return home to face tough economic conditions.  Indeed, some veterans return from deployments to discover that the skills they have honed in their military service can be difficult to transfer to jobs in the private sector. Others struggle with physical or mental wounds of war. Still others return to communities that lack safe, affordable housing.  Our veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country, and it is especially important to honor our commitment to them. The Department of Veterans Affairs is certainly a part of that commitment, providing benefits, medical care, support, and a sense of community to homeless veterans. However, a number of other federal agencies provide service to veterans, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and this legislation builds on that existing infrastructure.  Many programs through HUD and the VA are already helping homeless veterans with transitional housing, health care and rehabilitation services, and employment assistance. However, a more comprehensive and coordinated approach would strengthen these programs and help prevent more at-risk veterans from becoming homeless.  First, this legislation would make it easier for non-profits to apply for capital grants through the VA's grants and per diem program to build transitional housing and other facilities for veterans. This would streamline the process for non-profit organizations to be able to use financing from other sources to break ground on new housing construction. This is particularly important in the current economy, when non-profits are stretched and have to be more creative than ever to fund new capital projects.  Second, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act would create a Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD. The Special Assistant would ensure that veterans have access to HUD's existing programs and work to remove any barriers. The Special Assistant would also serve as a liaison between HUD and the VA, helping to connect and coordinate the services the two departments provide.  Additionally, this legislation recognizes the need to measure progress of efforts to combat homelessness. The bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to analyze existing programs and develop a comprehensive plan with recommendations on how to end homelessness among veterans. Establishing a plan with appropriate benchmarks will enable the VA to more easily track progress towards this important goal.  Only by working together, across the federal government and in partnership with non-profits and local housing authorities, will we be able to comprehensively help homeless veterans and reach those in danger of becoming homeless. We owe it to our veterans to ensure that they and their families have safe, affordable places to live and to provide the services and benefits they have earned. The nation's brave veterans deserve nothing less.  I am pleased that provisions from this bill, which follows on legislation I introduced last Congress, have been included in comprehensive legislation that is moving through the VeteransAffairs Committee. I hope my colleagues will join in supporting these important efforts.                          ____________________
