I have recently become aware of the large costs associated with this proposal--more than $40 million in up-front moving costs and an expensive lease rate--and I think the Congress should give this issue a much more careful review before it proceeds any further. As I understand it, the proposal calls for the FCC to nearly double the amount of space it occupies at the very time Congress is considering legislation to reduce the size of the agency. Am I correct, Mr. Chairman, that by specifically deleting the language allowing the GSA Administrator to pay for the relocation of the FCC, that is intended that the GSA Administrator specifically not be authorized to provide any funding for the proposed FCC relocation?
