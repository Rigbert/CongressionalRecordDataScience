I urge everyone who votes for the Enzi-Durbin-Alexander amendment to oppose the Ayotte amendment because she includes a provision in that amendment which absolutely destroys the whole effort here. She requires physical nexus.  As Senator Heitkamp has said, that is what this debate is all about--whether one has to be physically present in order to have an obligation to pay sales tax.  So I urge all of my colleagues who support the Marketplace Fairness Act to oppose the Ayotte amendment. I hope she will explain why she wants--I think we understand from the arguments why she takes that position.  May I say one or two things about what has been said? To my friend from Oregon, Senator Wyden, who talked about the impossibility of collecting sales tax from foreign entities, that is just not true.
