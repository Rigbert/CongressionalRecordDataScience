 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Agnes Scully Fister, who died January 9, 2002, at the age of 85.  Agnes made it easy for people to remember her, leaving behind a legacy as a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. She was a unique individual who cherished life, enjoyed going to church, and loved meeting and talking to people. She married Louis A. Fister and was blessed with a wonderful family that included four sons and two daughters. Agnes will be remembered for many different reasons, not the least of which is her dedication to her family and friends.  A native of Kentucky, Agnes was born in Lexington to Ed and Sarah Scully. She graduated high school from St. Catherine's Academy and later went on to work as a children's clothing buyer for retail stores such as Purcell's, Embry's, Wolfe Wiles, McAlpins, and Tots 'n Teens.  Agnes was a devoted Catholic and a long-time member of St. Paul Catholic Church. St. Paul played a significant role in Agnes' life and is where she was baptized, received first Holy Communion, was confirmed, and married. Upon her passing away, St. Paul is also where her family and friends gathered to say their goodbyes and to celebrate her life.  I am certain the legacy left behind by Agnes Fister will live on. I offer my deepest condolences to her family, especially her children, 20 grandchildren, and 26 great grandchildren. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Agnes Scully Fister. She was an outstanding Kentuckian and will be missed.                          ____________________
