Chairman, let me say to my friend, the farmer from Flatbush, that he really should get out into the real world of agricultural competition. I know he stays close at home in Brooklyn and in New York. But had he joined me in a visit to Asia, he might have found that many countries such as France are outspending the United States 3-to-1 to win market share in Korea, in Japan, in China and in so many other places.  We have reformed this program dramatically. We have pushed for companies that are new to export, we have pushed for small companies, and the gentleman may make light of some of these companies, but frankly, by themselves they would never have a chance in the world market.  When we consider the fact that our ag exports are so important when it comes to our trade balance, and when we consider the fact that our consumer food products that we are exporting have increased so dramatically over the last several years, what the gentleman from New York, my big-time agronomist from the Big Apple, fails to realize is that to eliminate this Market Access Program would literally eliminate jobs and opportunities in the United States. I hope he will reconsider this ill-considered amendment, and I hope that the grower from Gotham next year will not be offering this amendment as he has in previous years.
