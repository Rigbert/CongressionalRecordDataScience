Speaker, to make a serious point, I have commended every time I have stood on this floor the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, for his leadership. The gentleman, I think, on our side of the aisle is perceived to be one of the fairest, kindest, most responsible Members of this House. I share that view in great measure; and I think the serious point here is, as we will hopefully pass this CR, is that we really ought to get away from first innings, second innings, and third innings; and we ought to start, and that is my real point, Mr. Speaker, sitting down together, as we are now.  The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) and I sat down on the Treasury-Postal bill. I think we have agreement on where we ought to be. I think we need to start that process earlier and be real earlier and stop making political points as to who is saving money or who is not saving money when we know the inevitable result will be we will attempt to fund appropriation bills at levels that are consistent with what we think our responsibilities are.  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), because I think the chairman's leadership has been for that proposition, and I admired him for that. He has not always prevailed.  And I think what Mr. Gingrich was really trying to say and I said it somewhat facetiously tried to do it lightly, but it was a serious point that we can on each side posture and say, well, we want it our way. But if we all go forward saying we want it our way, we end up as we are today and, that is, having at the last minute to try to come to agreement.  I want to congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from Florida, because I think that is what he has tried to do, wants to do and is leading in a direction of doing right now; and I thank him for yielding.
