 President, today I wish to recognize the Honorable Judge David A. Tapp, an exemplary Kentuckian and recent recipient of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, NADCP, prestigious ``All Rise Leadership Award.'' Judge Tapp currently serves as a circuit court judge for Lincoln, Pulaski, and Rockcastle Counties in my home State of Kentucky.  Judge Tapp was honored at the NADCP Annual Training Conference that was held in July in Washington, DC. The annual conference is considered the world's largest on substance abuse and the criminal justice system. Chris Deutsch, director of communications for the NADCP, praised Judge Tapp for being an outstanding ambassador for drug courts both in Kentucky and around the world saying, ``It is an honor for the NADCP to present Judge Tapp with this award.'' Judge Tapp was recognized alongside actors Martin Sheen, Matthew Perry, and Harry Lennix during the closing ceremony of the event.  Let me add here that I had the pleasure of seeing Judge Tapp here in Washington this past July when he attended the NADCP conference. I was honored to be presented with the NADCP's ``All Rise Leadership Award,'' and one of those presenters was Judge Tapp himself. I am a longtime supporter of Kentucky's drug courts and was pleased to meet with Judge Tapp and his fellow Kentucky drug court judges on this important issue. He is truly an impressive fellow.  In addition to his regular duties as a circuit judge, Judge Tapp volunteers his time in presiding over the drug court for the three counties and has been doing so since 2005. The drug court is similar to some 2,700 others nationwide and serves seriously drug-addicted individuals through intense treatment and supervision, says Judge Tapp.  ``I do drug court for the small moments,'' said Tapp. ``At some point during the process you look at them and you see a new confidence. You see a gleam in their eye that wasn't there before, and you know that they get it. I take great pride in these efforts and applaud the hard work and dedication of all drug court staff members. These people volunteer their time and effort to do good deeds for thousands of people within the Commonwealth annually and they get almost no recognition for these efforts. They deserve a great amount of credit.''  I would ask all of my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating the Honorable Judge David A. Tapp in receiving such a distinguished award for his efforts in rehabilitating drug offenders. Judge Tapp's work in drug court is commendable and he has served as a model for others in Kentucky and around the country. The Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal published an article in September highlighting Judge Tapp's accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     [From the Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal, Sept. 30, 2011]                  Tapp Wins Prestigious Judicial Award       A local judge received a prestigious award earlier this      summer for his efforts as part of a national program that      aims to rehabilitate drug offenders.       Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge David A. Tapp was      awarded with the National Association of Drug Court      Professionals ``All Rise'' award during a star-studded      conference in Washington, DC.       ``Judge Tapp is an outstanding ambassador for Drug Courts      both in Kentucky and around the world,'' said National      Association of Drug Court Professionals Director of      Communications Chris Deutsch in a press release. ``His work      in Drug Court has affected countless lives and his interview      with Congressman Rogers will be critical to helping Drug      Courts maintain funding in the coming budget cycle.       ``It is an honor for NADCP to present Judge Tapp with this      award,'' Deutsch continued.       The NADCP Annual Training Conference is considered the      world's largest on substance abuse and the criminal justice      system, according to a press release provided by the NADCP.      This year's event took place from July 17 to July 20 and      brought nearly 4,000 state and federal justice leaders,      celebrities, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys,      clinicians, police and probation officers, military veterans,      business owners, Drug Court graduates and their family      members to the nation's capital. Tapp was recognized along      with actors Martin Sheen, Matthew Perry and Harry Lennix      during the closing ceremony of the conference on July 20.       Tapp was honored for his role in securing and conducting an      interview with Congressman Hal Rogers (R-KY), Chairman of      Appropriations in the U.S. House of Representatives, last      December for NADCP's All Rise Magazine.       ``The interview was so successful that it was featured as      the cover story of the quarterly,'' stated the press release.       During the interview, Tapp asked Rogers if he felt it was      important to further expand Drug Courts to reach more      individuals.       According to the press release, Rogers responded, ``Yes,      I'd like to see Drug Courts available everywhere. I've seen      how effective they are. We did not have Drug Courts in my      district and now that we have them, I've seen the difference      that they can bring.''       Tapp's remarks ``brought nearly 3,700 attendees to their      feet,'' stated the press release.       ``I do Drug Court for the small moments,'' said Tapp upon      receiving the award. ``When you look at an offender who has      struggled . . . and at some point during the process that      small moment comes where you look at them and you see a new      confidence.       ``You see a gleam in their eye that wasn't there before,      and you know that they get it. That's why I do Drug Court.''       Tapp, who serves Pulaski, Lincoln and Rockcastle counties,      has presided over Drug Court since 2005. Circuit Court Judge      Jeffrey T. Burdette also serves as a Drug Court judge for      Pulaski, Lincoln and Rockcastle counties.       The judges volunteer their time to preside over Drug Court.       ``This Drug Court, like the nearly 2,700 in existence      nationwide, serve seriously drug-addicted individuals through      intense treatment and supervision,'' the press release      stated.       Nationally, Drug Courts have been proven to significantly      reduce drug abuse crime and recidivism while saving money,      according to the press release.       ``Drug Courts are one example of successful efforts made by      criminal justice professionals to rehabilitate high-risk      offenders,'' Tapp stated through the press release. ``I take      great pride in these efforts and applaud the hard work and      dedication of all Drug Court staff members.''       ``These people volunteer their time and effort to do good      deeds for thousands of people within the commonwealth      annually, and they get almost no recognition for these      efforts,'' Tapp continued. ``They deserve a great amount of      credit.''                          ____________________
