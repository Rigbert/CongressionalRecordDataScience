Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a friend of mine, Joseph ``Joey'' Alioto who passed away peacefully at his home on March 21, 2011 after a brave battle with cancer. He will be deeply missed.  I knew Joey through one of his many passions, Alioto's Restaurant which started as a fresh fish stall on San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf in 1925. He was often found greeting guests at the door with a big smile. He had a quick wit and a generous nature that was always welcoming.  Joey has joined his parents, Antoinette and Nunzio, and his sister, Michelle, and is survived by his wife of 36 years, Judy Alioto, and their four children Nunzio, Marc, Alexa, and Joey; his two siblings, my friend Francesca, Rose Marie Violante and her husband Cosmo; his mother-in-law, Ada Barone, his sister-in-law, Sister Claire ``Bonnie'' Barone, his brother-in-law, Joseph Barone and his wife Maricela. Uncle Joey was blessed with the love and support of his five nieces and nephews--Rochelle and her husband Kenneth Simurdiak, Matthew Violante, Gina and her husband Eric von Esmarch, Alessandro and Giancarlo Barone, and his five great grand nieces and nephews.  Joey generously contributed his time and resources to many local civic events and causes including Fisherman's Wharf Merchant Association, Fisherman's Wharf Community Benefit District, JIGs (Just Italian Guys), Kevin Collins Foundation, The Olympic Club, One Child at a Time, Ronald McDonald House, Salesian Boys' & Girls' Club, St. Ignatius Booster's Club, St. Ignatius Alumni, St. Ignatius Fathers' Club, Special Olympics, Toys for Tots Foundation, and numerous local school fundraisers. He served as President of the Port Tenants Association and the Fisherman's Wharf Merchant Association. In April of 2009, he wasgiven the esteemed honor of being named the ``Man of the Year'' for the Salesian Boys'' & Girls' Club. He was a person of great humility who constantly showered those around him with the abounding generosity of his heart. He will always be remembered for his passion for life, his love of music--especially opera, his sense of humor, and his generosity of heart.  Yesterday a memorial service celebrating Joey's extraordinary life was held at Saints Peter and Paul Church in San Francisco. Joey will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, love of family, and sense of humor. His dedication to his family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Joey's family and friends; although Joey may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
