Speaker, it is with great honor and esteem that I congratulate Esther Kristoff on her retirement from the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council after 32 years of service as the executive director. Esther has dedicated her career to providing the guidance that our children need, a service that is far too rare in today's society. She will be honored at a retirement celebration to be held on April 30, 2001.  Esther Kristoff has enjoyed an outstanding career with the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council. When she became the executive director in 1969, she had already devoted over 16 years to the organization. She has held a myriad of positions, from troop leader and troop organizer to member of the Board of Directors. Esther has given innumerable hours of service to the Girl Scouts, but it is the quality of her work that is most impressive. She has received every one of the local Girl Scout Council awards that were available to her, including the Appreciation and Honor Pins and Thanks Badges I and II for outstanding service to both the Council and the surrounding community. In 1998, she received the Girl Scout service pin for 45 years of devoted service.  A graduate of Purdue University Calumet in Hammond, Indiana, Esther has undergone extensive training in the field of management. She has trained at such highly regarded institutions as Columbia University and Harvard University. She has also learned tremendously from her instruction experiences at Case Western Reserve University and the GSUSA Training Center in New York. The knowledge she gained from these programs has enabled her to become a true leader within the Council and the community.  Esther's history of volunteerism is impressive and praiseworthy. She has held a variety of positions and enjoys sharing her experiences with others. She served as president of the Hammond Woodmar Kiwanis from 1993-1995 and was recognized for her outstanding work and loyal service. She is an active member and secretary of the executive committee at the Lake Area United Way. Esther has also volunteered her time to work with local political leaders for the improvement of her community. She has worked with the Hammond mayor's office on several committees, the latest being the Hammond Marketing Committee. While on this committee she helped to organize the Keep Hammond Beautiful program and the Hammond Pride Week celebration. Esther has also served as a guest speaker for the Hammond Historical Society and as a volunteer speaker for the Lake Area United Way speaker's bureau.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Esther Kristoff as she celebrates her retirement from the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council after 48 years of service and 32 years of service as the executive director. Her commitment to the youth of Northwest Indiana should be recognized and must be commended. She has dedicated her life and her career to helping others, and her efforts will surely be missed.                          ____________________
