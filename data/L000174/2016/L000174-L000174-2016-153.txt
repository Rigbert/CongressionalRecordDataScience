President, one of the formative parts of my life was being a student at Saint Michael's College in Vermont. It was especially so because of the people I met there. One of my most memorable classmates is Dr. Frederick Burkle.  Skip Burkle was one who cared greatly about what he was learning and showed moral leadership even then. As students, we both lived in dorms that resembled World War II-era barracks. Fortunately, the living conditions for students at Saint Michael's have improved since then.  Last month, now-Dr. Burkle, spoke at Saint Michael's College giving the commencement address. Everyone who was there actually listened to a man who spoke of his own background. He spoke also to the moral compass he has developed both in school and since in the military and in his scientific work.  So much could be said about his career. I agree when he said, ``My humanitarian work was the most meaningful I've ever done.'' That makes so much sense because few people I have ever known have begun to approach his life as a humanitarian.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that his speech to the graduating class be printed in the Record because I want those beyond Saint Michael's College to read what an outstanding person has said.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Saint Michael's College Commencement Address                   Colchester, Vermont: May 15, 2016                   frederick m. burkle, jr., md, mph                    physician, scholar, humanitarian       Greetings to you all!       There are many reasons to celebrate this day. This      graduation is a milestone for you and your entire family.       Saint Michael's also needs to be celebrated and commended.      As an academic, I do not know of any other college or      university this year, or in recent memory, that has shown      both the insight and courage to declare ``Service to Others''      as the theme of graduation. Only at Saint Mikes! . . . I'm      not surprised!       The implications of this decision are many and must be      applauded . . . Most importantly it brings great hope and      wisdom for the future of this generation and those that      follow . . . .       I have been asked to speak to you on what in my life and      college experiences influenced my humanitarian career. My      first concern when asked was: How does someone who graduated      in 1961, 55 years ago, tell his story to the class of 2016? .      . . .       Let's give it a try       In truth, if you knew me in high school you would have      voted me the ``least likely graduate to ever give a      commencement address.'' . . .       I attended an all male Catholic High School in Southern      Connecticut. I was painfully shy, occasionally stuttered, was      easily embarrassed, struggled to be an average student, and      was hopelessly burdened by what is known today as severe      dyslexia. I only began to read in the 5th grade.       My Father, emphatically and loudly said ``No'' to the idea      of college. He had labeled me a ``lazy dreamer'' . . . so to      him college was a waste of good money. You would agree . . .      I was certainly not a prize academic prospect!       So here I am . . . and now I've got to explain to you how I      got onto this stage as a Commencement speaker.       I would not be here today without the help of some very      unselfish people . . . I call them my own personal      humanitarians . . . we all have them.       Not going to college was a serious blow I could not live      with. For years I had held on to an otherwise quite      impossible and secret dream of being a physician. A dream      which simply arose many years before from viewing very early      Life Magazine photos of doctors treating starving children in      an African jungle hospital.       Having been born 2 years before WWII, all my life was one      war after another with equally dire photos of both World War      II and Korean War casualties. And soon after, during high      school, emerged my generation's war . . . in a strange and      unheard of country named Viet Nam . . . a war which actually      began to build up as early as 1954.       My story, in great part, is a love story. I met an equally      shy girl when she was 13 and I was the older man of 14. We      went steady during high school and secretly dreamed of our      future together. With College off the table the military      draft seemed inevitable. She urged me to plead my case to the      High School Academic Dean, a stern gray haired Brother of      Holy Cross, to both loan me the application fee and forward a      decent recommendation. I was shaking in my boots. He silently      pondered the circumstances yet nodded his head and agreed to      accept the personal risk despite the potential anger of my      Father . . .       The very next day there was a check waiting for me!       There were others . . . while working as an orderly in a      local hospital I met two very caring physicians. They      embodied everything I wanted to be. They introduced me to a      small French Catholic Liberal Arts College named St. Michaels      in rural Vermont that I never heard of. Both were WWII      veterans who attended St. Mike's and then medical school on      the GI Bill. Despite their busy schedules they took time to      counsel and encourage, spoke highly of the quality of the      education but also cautioned that the academic experience      would demand much more.       St. Mike's was the only place I applied. With luck, I was      accepted. My girl friend's parents, not my own, took me to      campus . . . There was no turning back!       Falling in love with St. Mike's was a little slower and not      nearly as romantic! Matriculation at St. Mike's was a shock .      . . and at first a disappointment. Maybe my Father was right      . . . Will I fail and embarrass myself once again?       From the outset, the St. Mike's academic faculty made it      clear that everyone on campus was required to take 4 years of      liberal arts. This included a long list of the world's      literature, history, arts and philosophy from the beginning      of written time. This included a comparative study of all      religions, and a compelling semester of logic that forced us      to deliberate the philosophical ``how'' and ``why'' problems      that stressed the minds of every adolescent, like me, whose      brain had not yet matured . . .       It took me 3 trips to the bookstore to carry all the      required reading back to the small shared room in a former      WWII poorly heated wooden barracks that once stood where we      are today.       We desperately asked why such torture was necessary. I'm to      be a scientist. Why did I have to study the liberal arts? I      pleaded . . . something must be wrong! With my reading      disability, my anxiety level was palpable to everyone.       The science faculty made it quite clear that to pass the      rigorous requirements for recommendation to graduate school      required excellent marks in both the sciences and the liberal      arts. They offered us multiple examples of notable Statesmen      and Nobel Laureates alike who, empowered by incorporating     the lessons learned from the liberal arts, made major      breakthroughs for mankind . . . such as human rights, freedom      of speech, the splitting of the atom, penicillin, the Magna      Carta, the Geneva Conventions, and the U.S. Constitution      itself . . .       Slowly, St. Mike's, without my knowledge, began to hone,      tame and humble me by introducing new ways of thinking and      reasoning.       I, like all my classmates, had to give up that concrete      black and white thinking of youth to meet the demands of the      outside world.       Most students incorporated those new concepts to one degree      or another over the next 4 years. Confidence was built      through testy debates on what our increasingly complex world      demanded of us. The process re-introduced me to the academic      world I thought was unfriendly . . . and gave me a new love      for books which were once the enemy of every dyslexic      child.       Less than a month into my freshman year a profound      geopolitical event occurred that no one had anticipated or      was ready for. On October 4, 1957 we huddled around the one      radio available in the barracks to listen to the faint      battery powered beeps of the Russian satellite Sputnik. The      following day the faculty held an `all student assembly' to      discuss the impact of the satellite launch on mankind and      openly asked if any students would consider changing their      major to the sciences. The Space war had begun in earnest.      Everyone's sense of security suddenly changed and with it      many Cold War humanitarian crises sprang up around the world      . . . many of which, in a short decade, I became mired in      myself.       Every generation has their own Sputnik moments. Your      generation already has more than your share.       The liberal arts and the comparative religion courses      prepared me for my life as a humanitarian more than I ever      realized at the time.       Yes, we all read the Bible and debated its meaning . . .      but we also found a certain solace in understanding that      similar beliefs were universal among many other religions and      the cultures they were tied to.       All religions that have survived over the centuries      collectively teach ``social justice'' . . . a language all      its own that defines the fair and just relationship between      the individual and society. It is that shared social justice      that I have in common with my humanitarian and volunteer      colleagues on every continent . . .  might they be Muslims,      Hindus, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, agnostics or atheists      and whether they live in the Middle East or rural Vermont.       All the major wars and multiple conflicts that I became      engulfed in over my lifetime were all fought over ``whose god      was the true god!'' Unfortunately, these wars continue today.       Admittedly, and probably somewhat selfishly, I fell in love      with the challenges of global health and humanitarian      assistance.       And yes, that shy girl friend who supported my application      to St. Mike's and I were married my first year of medical      school and we had 3 children by the time I finished my      residency at the Yale University Medical Center.       Service to one's country was mandatory then . . . and the      government obliged by drafting me into the military. In 1968      I was rapidly trained and rushed, within 20 days, into the      madness of the Viet Nam war as a Combat physician with the      Marines.       Subsequently I was recalled to active duty as a combat      physician in 5 major wars, and over the years moved up the      invisible ladder of leadership in managing conflicts in over      40 countries. I've worked for and with the World Health      Organization, the International Red Cross and multiple global      humanitarian organizations. I found myself negotiating with      numerous African warlords and despots including Saddam      Hussein in Iraq.       I set up refugee camps, treated horrific war wounds, severe      malnutrition, scurvy, the death throes of starvation, and      cholera, malaria and blackwater fever, to name but a few . .      . When I was only a few years older than you, I had to manage      the largest Bubonic Plague epidemic of the last century.       Eventually, in 2003 I served the State Department as the      Senior Health Diplomat and first Interim Minister of Health      in Iraq where I was the target of 3 assassination attempts by      the same Sunni military that now, more than a decade later,      make up today's ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. Yes, it is      madness.       Obviously, my work was often quite dangerous. Making      uncomfortable but real decisions over who survives and who      doesn't, simply because there are scant resources, is always      a nightmare. Over 1,000 fellow humanitarian aid workers have      been killed during my time . . . many, many more than any      United Nations Peacekeepers.       I have seen more senseless death and suffering than anyone      my age should be allowed to witness. The same ``how and why''      issues that I first struggled with in Logic class at St.      Mike's were now re-framed in very basic daily struggles of      both ethics and morality.       As such, I moved more and more to care for the most      vulnerable . . . the children, women, the elderly and      disabled who make up 90% or more of those who flee or become      ill, injured or die in every war. This became my calling.       While some of this may impress the budding healthcare      professionals in the audience, everything I experienced in      war was preventable . . . it need not have happened. War is      not the answer.       But, my humanitarian work was the most meaningful I have      ever done. I have no regrets. The saving of lives when the      victims themselves have given up . . . and working with some      of the most self-less people in the world, is addictive . . .      and for a physician the adrenaline rush, intensity of the      work and the diagnostic challenges are comparable to nothing      else.       As Medical Director of the last Orphan Lift out of Saigon      in 1975, I was secretly slipped into a refugee crowded,      already surrounded and hostile Saigon during its last days to      find abandoned and ill infants . . . many alone and starving      in dank and dirty orphanages. We airlifted out 310 nameless      infants in file boxes . . . 20 years later, by chance, I met      an attractive and ebullient Asian woman, now a graduate      student who had been the valedictorian of her college class.      She was one of the infants I rescued . . . Life comes full      circle . . . it was a really good day.       The scientific research that defines my academic career has      me closely working with like-minded colleagues in Iran,      Israel, Iraq, China, the European Union and many others. And      Yes, another example of life taking full circle . . . the      Nobel Laureates, once touted in 1957 as examples for us to      emulate by the St. Mike's science Professors, selected a 2013      research study I co-authored to be presented and debated at      their World Summit in Spain last year. Good people are      listening and reading your work. So for the future academics      and scientists in the audience. . . . Never give up!       Hopefully, my now fading career allows me to reflect and      offer some parting Grand-Fatherly advice:       The essence of volunteerism is found in understanding the      culture of the people we engage with, even within our own      communities. In my experience, we did not understand the      culture of Viet Nam or Iraq, and when General Petraeus was      asked at the 10 year mark in Afghanistan what he would have      done differently he said ``I would have learned more about      the culture!'' . . .       Graduation marks your movement from the protective culture      of the campus to a culture that is more complex, unforgiving      at times, but also very exciting and worthwhile.       Most young volunteers are understandably burdened by the      non-action they have reluctantly inherited from my      generation. . . . . Burdens that shamelessly stem from      worldwide political neglect of both the health and science of      the planet.       You should be disappointed but also challenged. . . .      However, a very hopeful characteristic of your generation is      that you more often than not see yourselves less as      nationalists . . . and more as global citizens. This marks a      significant shift from my generation and a hopeful game-     changer in the global landscape.       As your volunteerism matures, use whatever bully pulpit you      have to expose and change those inequities that you see in      the world. The risk is worth it.       I spoke up in Iraq over blatant human rights violations of      the Geneva Convention and was called a ``traitor'' in the      political Press. I am most proud I made that choice.       Remember, those who do have the political power to make      change frequently do not know what they don't know.      Instinctively, all volunteers are also educators and      advocates. . . . It comes with the title.       The MOVE program, run by the Campus Ministry, and the Fire      & Rescue Squad represent realistic ``real world models'' that      one can neither assume nor get from the classroom alone. I      wish I had experienced them myself. These inspiring volunteer      initiatives have changed the culture of the College and more      broadly and accurately re-defined ``American      exceptionalism.''       Harvard, where I teach today, has recently taken a page      from the St. Mike's playbook by placing more emphasis on      accepting students to College who value caring for the      community over individual extracurricular achievements. They      claim that ``community service'' and the ethical concern for      the greater public good!'' is a more sensitive and true      measure of an applicant.       I agree! St. Mike's, emphasizing ``service to others'' has      owned and promoted this belief for many decades.       Aid to the oppressed has never stood still. Volunteerism,      in general, is increasingly moving toward prevention,      recovery and rehabilitation. . . . . Your role models must be      those distinguished recipients of the honorary degrees today.      I applaud their self-less commitments to others.       St. Mike's was an unselfish gift to me. My class of 1961      was unique in producing many leaders in science, education,      government, law, the military, industry, the social sciences,      and medicine and dentistry to name but a few. They are all      great citizens who still argue incessantly over politics . .      . some things never change. . . . nor should they!       Please promise me that you will see your classmates often .      . . call them, email them and return to the reunions . . .      it's a great time to brag and see that everyone is equally      aging and putting on weight. I do miss many of my friends and      colleagues and also the professors who I tried to model      myself on who passed away before I could thank them.       And yes, . . . as a bonus, there is another Harvard study      this year that shows that both volunteers and their      recipients increase social connections, reduce stress . . .      and live longer lives!       I must close now. . . . As a 31 year Navy and Marine Corp      veteran I wish to leave you with a saying that we, in the      service of our country, always thought was strictly a      nautical blessing. . . . In point of fact, it is a universal      phrase of good luck as one departs on a voyage in life. . . .      It reads: ``Let me square the yards . . . while we may . . .      and make a fair wind of it homeward''. I wish you all in this      audience ``Fair Winds and Following Seas''. . . . God speed      to you and St. Mikes . . . and thank you for listening . . .                          ____________________
