Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my heartfelt support and congratulations to the Bordentown Little League All-Stars who on Wednesday, won the New Jersey State Championship tournament and the right to now advance to the regional championship. Powered by some big bats--that turned in 17 hits and 4 home runs--the Bordentown Little League's 11/12 year old team easily defeated Pequannock 14 to 3 to win the State Championship. By winning the New Jersey title, the team now moves onto Bristol, Connecticut, to participate in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Tournament where they will take on Haverstraw, the New York State Champions. The A. Bartlett Giamatti Little League Leadership Training Center in Bristol, Connecticut, is hosting the Mid-Atlantic and New England tournaments.  I especially want to recognize Manager Pat Welsh and Coach Dave Revay for their outstanding efforts developing this championship team. And of course, congratulations go out to the guys on the field who hustled throughout the season to win the New Jersey State Championship--Tommy ``T-Walt'' Walters, Zachary ``Zack'' Gakeler, Ryan ``Shinny'' Shinn, Patrick ``Otrick'' Welsh, Cole ``ColeTrain'' Clauser, Tyler ``Ty'' Revay, Clarke ``Clarkey'' Laba, Nick ``Hammer'' Callahan, Edward ``Eddie'' Holmes, and the teams three Austin's--Austin ``Goke'' Goeke, Austin ``Char-zar'' Chaszar, and Austin ``Big Pappi'' Papp.  Gratitude also has to be given to the Bordentown community for their spirit and the continuing support they offered which helped make fielding this outstanding team possible. Community leaders--Mayor George A. Chidley, Deputy Mayor Bruce Hill, Committeeman William J. Morelli, Committeeman Robert Delaney, and Committeeman Mark Roselli from Bordentown Township; and Mayor John William Collom III, Deputy Mayor James Lynch, and Commissioner John Wehrman from the city of Bordentown have to be recognized and thanked for making this State Championship possible.  As the Bordentown Little League All-Stars now move onto the Regional Championship, we join with family and friends in the entire Bordentown and Burlington County communities to wish them good luck.                          ____________________
