Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith  Bill Number: H.R. 2638  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army Account  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Intelligence & Information Warfare Directorate, CERDEC  Address of Requesting Entity: Lakehurst Naval Engineering Station  Description of Request: Funding will be utilized to implement a CERDEC RDT & E test capability for airborne and ground antenna design to develop and prove new concept antennae that operate at higher frequencies offering significantly higher capacities and are less prone to interference and jamming. The test capability will provide testing of aircraft mounted antennae at varying altitude under a variety of conditions and on specific aircraft including fixed, rotary wing and unmanned air systems.  The system will be used to provide the design of new antennae which develop more reliable, expanded bandwidth information links which enable the flow of tactical information to the deployed warfighter. The capability will also expand the ability of communicating with the variety of unmanned systems, both airborne and ground based, for increased intelligence gathering and control.              Detailed Finance Plan: Program Cost Summary.  L Band development on UH-60M where a required future aviation waveform, WidebandNetwork Waveform (WNW), operates. It is expected that most of the wideband operation will occur in this band vs. the full WNW band of 30-2000MHz.  The C and Ku Band on UH-60M test-bed will also address other bands of interest to US Army Aviation including C-band where Full Motion Video (FMV) systems are being operated on selected helicopters, and Ku band, where UAS control and TCDL links are being implemented on selected helicopters.  An antenna development for a more sophisticated single (directional or higher gain lower bandwidth omnidirectional) will be needed to increase system data throughput for the UH-60M. As the test data is analyzed, specifications for antenna systems will emerge and it is envisioned that higher gain antenna will be needed to support future required data rates.
