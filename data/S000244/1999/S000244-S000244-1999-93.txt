Speaker, I have discussed with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), and unless there is an amendment that we do not know about, we will probably not have votes on the next bill that is coming up. I cannot give a complete assurance that there will be no rollcall votes, but my guess is that all of the amendments and the bill will be disposed of by voice vote and the Members can take that into account when making their plans.                          ____________________
