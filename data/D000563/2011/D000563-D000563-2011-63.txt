President, a little earlier today the junior Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, came to the floor to discuss the balanced budget amendment. Under the budget agreement agreed to in Congress in August, both the House and Senate were required to vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget before the end of this calendar year. The House has already taken the vote. The measure failed. The Senate still has a responsibility to take it up, which we will do in the closing hours of the session this calendar year.  There are at least two proposals before us for a constitutional amendment, and my subcommittee, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary, held a hearing last week asking questions about these approaches to the Constitution.  The leading approach on the Republican side comes from both Senators Hatch and McConnell. I am not certain which they will offer or whether the language might change at the last minute, but it would enshrine in our Constitution a disciplinary mechanism to reduce the budget deficit. This has been brought before the Senate and the House before many times. This particular proposed constitutional amendment would:  Require that in each fiscal year Federal outlays shall not exceed receipts unless two-thirds of each House votes to waive.  It caps outlays at 18 percent of gross domestic product each year unless two-thirds of each House votes to waive.  It requires a two-thirds vote in each House for any tax or revenue-raising measure.  It requires a three-fifths vote in each House for raising the debt limit.  It allows for waiver of the amendment in times of declared war or serious military conflict.  It prohibits courts from ordering any increase in revenue to enforce the amendment.  It directs Congress to enforce the amendment through appropriate legislation.  It takes effect 5 years after ratification.  This is far more extreme than the clean House balanced budget amendment, which failed to pass in that Chamber on November 18.  The testimony before our subcommittee from experts in the field said that this amendment, proposed by Senators Hatch and McConnell, will require Draconian cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, our military retirement system, and many programs important to working families.  It will make Republican fiscal policies the constitutional law of the land, giving protection to those in higher income categories from any tax increase forever, without an extraordinary vote in either House.  It would delegate the task of resolving budget disputes to our court system.  It would make recessions worse by requiring cuts in countercyclical safety-net programs such as food stamps and unemployment just at the time when those expenditures are most needed.  It would increase the likelihood of debt limit standoffs each year.  It would lead to increased burdens on our States.  During the course of the hearings, several people came forward to testify. I recommend to my colleagues that they carefully read these testimonies, which are available on the Senate Judiciary Committee website.  The first was Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mr. Greenstein, who is well recognized and respected on Capitol Hill, spoke about the countercyclical aspect and said that if you cut spending in the midst of a recession, you will not have the resources you need to provide unemployment benefits, food stamps, and the things that save families when they are out of work or making very little money.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Greenstein's statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Testimony of Robert Greenstein, Before the Subcommittee on the    Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Hearing Entitled, ``A Balanced Budget Amendment: The Perils of Constitutionalizing the Budget                       Debate,'' November 30, 2011       Thank you for the invitation to testify today. I am Robert      Greenstein, president of     the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy      institute that focuses both on fiscal policy and on policies      affecting low- and moderate-income Americans. We, like most      others who analyze fiscal policy developments and trends,      believe that the nation's fiscal policy is on an      unsustainable course. As part of our work, we have been      analyzing proposed changes in budget procedures for more than      20 years. We have conducted extensive analyses of proposals      to write a balanced-budget requirement into the Constitution,      among other proposals.       The purpose of changing our fiscal policy course is to      strengthen our economy over the long term and to prevent the      serious economic damage that would likely occur if the debt      explodes in future decades as a share of the economy. But we      need to choose our fiscal policy instruments carefully. We      want to avoid ``destroying the village in order to save it.''       The goal of a constitutional balanced budget amendment is      to address our long-term fiscal imbalance. Unfortunately, a      constitutional balanced budget amendment would be a highly      ill-advised way to try to do that and likely would cause      serious economic damage. It would require a balanced budget      every year regardless of the state of the economy, unless a      supermajority of both houses overrode that requirement. This      is an unwise stricture that large numbers of mainstream      economists have long counseled against, because it would      require the largest budget cuts or tax increases precisely      when the economy is weakest. It holds substantial risk of      tipping faltering economies into recessions and making      recessions longer and deeper. The additional job losses would      likely be very large.       When the economy weakens, revenue growth drops and revenues      may even contract. And as unemployment rises, expenditures      for programs like unemployment insurance--and to a lesser      degree, food stamps and Medicaid--increase. These revenue      declines and expenditure increases are temporary; they      largely disappear as the economy recovers. But they are      critical for helping to keep struggling economies from      falling into a recession and for moderating the depth and      length of recessions that do occur.       When the economy weakens, consumers and businesses spend      less, which in turn causes further job loss. The drop in tax      collections and increases in unemployment and other benefits      that now occur automatically when the economy weakens      cushions the blow, by keeping purchases of goods and services      from falling more. That is why economists use the term      ``automatic stabilizers'' to describe the automatic declines      in revenues and automatic increases in UI and other benefits      that occur when the economy turns down; these actions help      stabilize the economy.       A constitutional balanced budget amendment, however,      effectively suspends the automatic stabilizers. It requires      that federal expenditures be cut or taxes increased to offset      the effects of the automatic stabilizers and prevent a      deficit from occurring--the opposite course from what sound      economic policy calls for.       Over the years, leading economists have warned of the      adverse effects of a constitutional balanced budget      amendment. In Congressional testimony in 1992, Robert      Reischauer--then director of the Congressional Budget Office      and one of the nation's most respected experts on fiscal      policy--explained: ``[I]f it worked [a constitutional      balanced budget amendment] would undermine the stabilizing      role of the federal government.'' Reischauer noted that the      automatic stabilizing that occurs when the economy is weak      ``temporarily lowers revenues and increases spending on      unemployment insurance and welfare programs. This automatic      stabilizing occurs quickly and is self-limiting--it goes away      as the economy revives--but it temporarily increases the      deficit. It is an important factor that dampens the amplitude      of our economic cycles.'' Under the constitutional amendment,      he explained, these stabilizers would no longer operate      automatically.       Similarly, when a constitutional balanced budget amendment      was under consideration in 1997, more than 1,000 economists      including 11 Nobel laureates issued a joint statement that      said, ``We condemn the proposed `balanced-budget' amendment      to the federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.      The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face      of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and      some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-     called `built-in stabilizers' limit declines of after-tax      income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced      every year would aggravate recessions.'' This summer, five      Nobel laureates in economics issued a new statement opposing      a constitutional balanced budget amendment for this reason.       Earlier this year, the current CBO director, Douglas      Elmendorf, sounded a similar warning when asked about a      constitutional balanced budget amendment at a Senate Budget      Committee hearing. Elmendorf observed:       ``Amending the Constitution to require this sort of balance      raises risks . . . [t]he fact that taxes fall when the      economy weakens and spending and benefit programs increase      when the economy weakens, in an automatic way, under existing      law, is an important stabilizing force for the aggregate      economy. The fact that state governments need to work . . .      against these effects in their own budgets--need to take      action to raise taxes or cut spending in recessions--undoes      the automatic stabilizers, essentially, at the state level.      Taking those away at the federal level risks making the      economy less stable, risks exacerbating the swings in      business cycles.''       Finally, a month ago, Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) analyzed      the economic impacts of a constitutional balanced budget      amendment. One of the nation's preeminent private economic      forecasting firms, Macroeconomic Advisers provides analysis      to major corporations and government entities, such as the      President's Council of Economic Advisors under Presidents of      both parties, including Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush.       MA concluded that if a constitutional balanced budget      amendment had already been ratified and were now being      enforced for fiscal year 2012, ``the effect on the economy      would be catastrophic.'' If the 2012 budget were balanced      through spending cuts, MA found, those cuts would total about      $1.5 trillion in 2012 alone--and would throw about 15 million      more people out of work, double the unemployment rate from 9      percent to approximately 18 percent, and cause the economy to      shrink by about 17 percent instead of growing by an expected      2 percent.       Even if a BBA were implemented when the budget was already      in balance, MA concluded, it would still put ``new and      powerful uncertainties in play. The economy's `automatic      stabilizers' would be eviscerated [and] discretionary      counter-cyclical fiscal policy would be unconstitutional . .      . . Recessions would be deeper and longer.''       MA also warned that ``The pall of uncertainty cast over the      economy if it appeared a BBA could be ratified and enforced      in the middle of recession or when the deficit was still      large would have a chilling effect on near-term economic      growth.'' MA concluded that a BBA would have detrimental      effects on economic growth in both good times and bad.       Proponents of a constitutional amendment often respond to      these admonitions by noting that the proposed constitutional      amendment would allow the balanced-budget requirement to be      waived by a vote of three-fifths of the House and the Senate,      so the BBA would be set to the side in recessions. But this      response is too facile, and the three-fifths waiver provision      does not solve the problem. It is difficult to secure three-     fifths votes for anything; consider the paralysis that marks      much of the work of the Senate. Moreover, it may take months      after a downturn begins before sufficient data are available      to convince three-fifths of the members of both houses of      Congress that a recession is underway. Furthermore, it is all      too likely that even after the evidence for a downturn is      clear, a minority in the House or Senate would hold a wavier      vote hostage to demands for concessions on other matters      (such as new, permanent tax cuts). By the time that a      recession were recognized to be underway and three-fifths      votes were secured in both chambers, if such support could be      obtained at all, extensive economic damage could have been      done and hundreds of thousands or millions of additional jobs      unnecessarily lost.       The bottom line is that the automatic stabilizers need to      continue to be able to work automatically to protect American      businesses and workers. The balanced budget amendment      precludes that.       Nor is a recession the only concern. Consider the savings      and loan crisis of the 1980s, or the financial meltdown of      the fall of 2008. A constitutional balanced budget amendment      would have hindered swift federal action to rescue the      savings and loan industry or to rapidly put the Troubled      Assets Relief Program in place. In both cases, history      indicates that federal action helped save the economy from      what otherwise likely would have been far more dire      problems.       Moreover, the federal government provides deposit insurance      for accounts of up to $250,000; this insurance--and the      confidence it engenders among depositors--is critical to the      sound functioning of our financial system so that we avoid      panics involving a run on financial institutions, as occurred      in the early 1930s. A constitutional prohibition of any      deficit spending (unless and until a supermajority of both      houses of Congress voted to authorize it) could seriously      weaken the guarantee that federal deposit insurance provides.      That is a risk we should not take.       These are illustrations of why fiscal policy should not be      written into the Constitution.       A parallel problem is that the proposed constitutional      amendment would make it even harder than it already is to      raise the debt limit, by requiring a three-fifths vote of      both the House and Senate to raise the limit. This is playing      with fire. It would heighten the risk of a federal government      default. A default would raise our interest costs and could      damage the U.S. economy for years to come.               Mistaken Analogies to States and Families       Proponents of a constitutional amendment sometimes argue      that states and families must balance their budgets every      year and the federal government should do so, too. But      statements that the constitutional amendment would align      federal budgeting practices with those of states and families      are mistaken.       While states must balance their operating budgets, they can      borrow to finance their capital budgets--to finance roads,      schools, and other projects. Most states do so. States also      can build reserves during good times     and draw on them in bad times without counting the drawdown      from reserves as new spending that unbalances a budget.       Families follow similar practices. They borrow--they take      out mortgages to buy a home or student loans to send a child      to college. They also draw down savings when times are tight,      with the result that their expenditures in those periods      exceed their current incomes.       But the proposed constitutional amendment would bar such      practices at the federal level. The total federal budget--     including capital investments--would have to be balanced      every year, with no borrowing allowed for infrastructure or      other investments that can boost future economic growth. And      if the federal government ran a surplus one year, it could      not draw it down the next year to help balance the budget.       I would also note that the fact that states must balance      their operating budgets even in recessions makes it all the      more important from the standpoint of economic policy that      the federal government not be subject to the same stricture.      American Enterprise Institute analyst Norman Ornstein      addressed this matter in an article earlier this year, where      he wrote: ``Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and      more destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment.      Here is why: Nearly all our states have balanced budget      requirements. That means when the economy slows, states are      forced to raise taxes or slash spending at just the wrong      time, providing a fiscal drag when what is needed is      countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In fact, the      fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010 was barely countered      by the federal stimulus plan. That meant the federal stimulus      provided was nowhere near what was needed but far better than      doing nothing. Now imagine that scenario with a federal drag      instead.''         S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 Raise Additional Issues       The foregoing concerns apply to all versions of the      balanced budget amendment that have been introduced. Some      versions of the balanced budget amendment, such as S.J. Res.      10 and S.J. Res. 23, which are identical, raise additional      concerns, because they would write into the Constitution new      barriers to raising any revenues--including closing wasteful      tax loopholes--to help balance the budget and also would      prohibit federal expenditures in any year from exceeding a      figure such as 18 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in      the previous calendar year. These constitutional requirements      could be overridden only by supermajority votes in both the      House and the Senate.       This requirement for a supermajority to raise taxes would      be extremely unwise. It would protect what President Reagan's      former chief economic advisor, Harvard economist Martin      Feldstein, has called the biggest area of wasteful government      spending in the federal budget--what economists call ``tax      expenditures'' and Alan Greenspan has called ``tax      entitlements.''       In 2010, tax expenditures amounted to $1.1 trillion, more      than the cost of Medicare and Medicaid combined (which was      $719 billion), Social Security ($701 billion), defense ($689      billion, including expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan), or      non-defense discretionary spending ($658 billion, including      expenditures from the Recovery Act). Many of these tax      expenditures are fully the equivalent of government spending.      Let me use child care as an example.       If you are low- or moderate-income, you may get a federal      subsidy to help cover your child care costs, and the subsidy      is provided through a spending program. If you are higher on      the income scale, you still get a government subsidy that      reduces your child care costs, but it is delivered through      the tax code, as a tax credit. (Moreover, if you are a low-      or moderate-income parent with child care costs, you likely      will miss out because the spending programs that provide      child care subsidies are not open ended and can only serve as      many people as their capped funding allows. By contrast, if      you are a higher income household--and there is no limit on      how high your income can be--your child care subsidy is      guaranteed, because the tax subsidy that you get operates as      an open-ended entitlement.) It is difficult to justify making      the tax-code subsidy sacrosanct and the program subsidy a      deficit-reduction target merely because one is delivered      through a ``spending'' program and the other is delivered      through the code.       And as the child care example illustrates, sharply      distinguishing between subsidies delivered through the tax      code and those delivered through programs on the spending      side of the budget also has a ``reverse Robin Hood'' aspect.      Low- and moderate-income households receive most of their      government assistance through spending programs; affluent      households receive most of their federal subsidies through      tax expenditures. Effectively barring reductions in tax      expenditures from contributing to deficit reduction is a      prescription for placing the greatest burden of deficit      reduction on those who can least afford to bear it.       The problems do not stop there. If it requires a      supermajority to raise any revenue, another likely outcome is      a proliferation of tax loopholes. New loopholes--including      loopholes that Congress did not intend but that high-priced      tax lawyers and accountants have found ways to create--could      become untouchable once they appeared, because it would      require a supermajority of the House and Senate to raise any      revenue. It would become more difficult to close tax      loopholes that opened up, since (under S.J. Res. 10 and S.J.      Res. 23) special-interest lobbyists could block such action      simply by securing the votes of one-third plus one member in      one chamber.       Finally, as noted, S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 would bar      federal spending from exceeding 18 percent of GDP in the      prior calendar year, which translates into a limit of about      16.6 percent of the current fiscal year's GDP. To hit that      level would require cuts of a truly draconian nature.      Consider the austere budget that the House of Representatives      passed on April 15, sometimes referred to as the Ryan budget.      Under that budget, Medicare would be converted to a voucher      system under which, the Congressional Budget Office has said,      beneficiaries' out-of-pocket health-care costs would nearly      triple by 2030 (relative to what those costs would be that      year under the current Medicare program). CBO also has      written that under the Ryan budget, federal Medicaid funding      in 2030 would be 49 percent lower than it would be if the      Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion were repealed but      Medicaid otherwise was unchanged. And funding for non-     security discretionary programs would be cut more than one-     third below its real 2010 level. Yet CBO says that under this      budget, total federal spending would be 20\3/4\ percent of      GDP in 2030, so it would breach the allowable limit under      S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 by four percentage points of      GDP. This illustrates the draconian nature of the proposed      16.6 percent-of-current-GDP requirement.       Another way to look at this stricture is to examine federal      expenditures under Ronald Reagan. Under President Reagan, who      secured deep budget cuts at the start of his term, federal      expenditures averaged 22 percent of GDP. And that was at a      time before any members of the baby boom generation had      retired and when health care expenditures throughout the U.S.      health care system (including the private sector) were one-     third lower as a share of GDP than they are today. It also      was before the September 11 terrorist attacks led      policymakers to create a new category of homeland security      spending, and before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to      increases in veterans' health-care costs that will endure for      a number of decades.Estimating the Effects of Spending Cap in S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23       To provide a more precise and detailed analysis of the      impact that the spending cap in S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23      would have, we recently conducted an analysis of its effects,      using the latest Congressional Budget Office ten-year budget      projections. We considered the impact if the balanced budget      requirement would take effect in fiscal year 2018, as would      occur if Congress approved it now and the requisite number of      states ratified it by September 30, 2013. Here are the      results.       --Congress would have to cut all programs (except interest      on the debt) by an average of 24.9 percent in 2018. It would      have to cut programs by $1.1 trillion in 2018 alone, and by      $6.1 trillion through 2021.       --If all programs were cut by the same percentage, Social      Security would be cut $265 billion in 2018 alone and $1.7      trillion through 2021; Medicare would be cut $168 billion in      2018 and $1.1 trillion through 2021; and Medicaid and the      Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be cut $115      billion in 2018 and $724 billion through 2021.       --Veterans disability payments, compensation, and other      such benefits would be cut $19 billion in 2018 and $122      billion through 2021.       --Defense spending would be cut $141 billion in 2018 and      $879 billion through 2021, on top of the reductions made to      comply with the discretionary spending caps that the Budget      Control Act establishes and the reductions made under the      sequestration order that is expected to be issued in January      2013, pursuant to that act.       Congress would not, of course, have to cut all programs by      the same percentage and likely would not do so. But if      Congress chose to spare certain programs, others would have      to be cut even more deeply. For example, if Social Security      were spared, the average cut to all other programs would rise      by more than one third, from 24.9 percent in 2018 to 34.2      percent. Similarly, if the defense budget were increased by      placing it at 4 percent of GDP (exclusive of war costs) and      maintaining it at that level, as presidential candidate Mitt      Romney has proposed, then all other programs--including      Social Security--would have to be cut an average of 38.2      percent in 2018 under S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23.       Even if the so-called ``plain vanilla'' version of the BBA      is pursued, rather than S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23, the      required level of budget cuts would be massive, assuming      taxes are not raised to help balance the budget. Congress      would have to cut everything an average of 17.3 percent in      2018, an average of 23.8 percent if Social Security were      protected, and an average of 29.4 percent if the defense      budget were set at 4 percent of GDP and Social Security were      not protected.                               Conclusion       Policymakers need to begin to change our fiscal trajectory.      As various recent commissions have indicated, we need to      stabilize the debt as a share of GDP in the coming decade and      to keep it stable after that (allowing for some fluctuation      over the business cycle). But establishing a balanced budget      amendment in the Constitution would be exceedingly unwise. It      would likely exact a heavy toll on the economy and on      American businesses and workers in the years and decades     ahead. It is not the course that the nation should follow.
