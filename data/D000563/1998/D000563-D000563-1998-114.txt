We had the lowest percentage of eligible voters in American history in 72 years cast a vote in the Presidential election between President Clinton and Senator Dole.  That is an indication to me that the American people understand what the Senator from South Dakota is saying. They think there is something fundamentally flawed with this system and negative advertising, the money chase that the Senator from South Dakota addresses. If we do nothing else before we leave this year, I hope this Senate will address this important issue.  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership.
