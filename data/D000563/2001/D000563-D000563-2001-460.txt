President, the annual celebration of Greek Independence Day that took place on Sunday, March 25 commemorated the independence of Greece after 400 years of oppression under the Ottoman Empire. The pages of our history books are filled with contributions that the Greeks have made to society. Our system of government, our literature, philosophy, religion, and mathematics all have their roots in Greek tradition. With the founding of the Olympic Games, the Greek people taught us that there is more to be gained through peaceful competition than armed conflict.  Perhaps the greatest contribution that the Greek people have made is a simple yet powerful idea that first conceived over 2,000 years ago. It is the idea that citizens possessed the power to determine the course of a nation. The Athenian republic was the world's first democratic state, a fact respected by all free states today.  The bonds that join the United States and Greece extend back to the founding of our country. When drafting our Constitution, our forefathers recognized the idealism and spirit of ancient Greece. Inspired by our own struggle for independence, Greece followed forty-five years later with its own struggle for independence. By celebrating this day, we pay tribute to those Greek men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the common cause of freedom. The United States has been able to proudly call Greece an ally in every major international conflict of the last century.  Those Americans that claim Greek heritage can be proud of the contributions made by their ancestors. The many Greek sons and daughters who have come to the United States have served honorably in all walks of American life. Greek culture continues to flourish in American cities, thus contributing to the rich ethnic diversity of our country. It is with great honor that I commemorate the celebration of Greek independence. I look forward to the continuing cooperation and lasting friendship between the United States and Greece.                          ____________________
