President, I realize we have not gone in the regular order with the manager of the nomination speaking first. We are having a hearing right now with the Attorney General. So I ask unanimous consent, when the distinguished Senator finishes hisspeech, whatever length it is, and all time will have then been used up so there would not be any time reserved for the manager of this nomination, to speak for 2 minutes at the conclusion of Senator Grassley's remarks.
