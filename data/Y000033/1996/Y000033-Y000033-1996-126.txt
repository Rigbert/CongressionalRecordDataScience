Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3546, the Walhalla National Fish Hatchery Conveyance Act, introduced by our colleague from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham.  This noncontroversial bill is nearly identical to measures the House of Representatives has approved to transfer certain Federal fish hatcheries to non-Federal control.  This hatchery, which consists of about 78 acres, is currently being operated by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources under a long-term agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  This hatchery was 1 of 11 identified by the Clinton administration for transfer to the States in fiscal year 1996 because it is no longer an essential component of the Fish and Wildlife Service's nationwide stocking program.  Based on testimony the subcommittee received, however, it is clear that Walhalla is extremely important to the State of South Carolina because it is the only public source for brown trout, there is no reasonable alternative for stocking the State's waters, and, without these fish, there is no viable sport fishing for trout. There are 45,800 trout anglers in the State of South Carolina and this activity produces an annual economic impact of over $12 million.  This bill contains language that stipulates the property will be returned to the Federal Government if it is used for something other than the authorized purposes.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation and compliment Lindsey Graham for his outstanding leadership in this matter.
