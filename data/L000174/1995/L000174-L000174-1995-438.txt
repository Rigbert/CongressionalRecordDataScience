President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a small program that has a large impact in my home State of Vermont. Federal economic growth centers are designated by Vermont's Agency of Transportation as areas that receive Federal funds with a reduced local matching requirement.  This program allows various small communities in Vermont to upgrade roads, sidewalks, and bridges that would otherwise be unaffordable. Most transportation projects are funded with an 80-percent Federal share, and a 20-percent State and local share. Economic growth centers are funded with a 95-percent Federal share, a 3-percent State share, and a 2-percent local share. This low local contribution allows communities such as Barre, VT, to undertake the North Main Street project, which upgrade roads, improve pedestrian facilities, handicapped accessibility, and enhance traffic signals.  Today there are 18 other similar projects across my State that are either receiving EGC funding or are scheduled to. From Burlington to Rutland, this program benefits Vermont.  However, if the National Highway System bill is approved in its current form, then many of these Vermont projects will revert to the less generous Federal funding formula. This would be disastrous for projects like the one in Barre. That is why I am offering an amendment with Senator Jeffords that maintains the current funding status. I urge its adoption.
