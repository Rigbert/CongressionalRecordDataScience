 Hatch):  S. 1269. A bill to provide that the Federal Government and States shall be subject to the same procedures and substantive laws that would apply to persons on whose behalf certain civil actions may be brought, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                        litigation fairness act  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Litigation Fairness Act of 1999. This common sense legislation says that whenever the government sues private-sector companies to recover costs, the government plaintiff gets no more rights than the ordinary plaintiff. If the law is good enough for the average citizen, then it's good enough for the government.  This legislation to codify rules of fair play for government-sponsored lawsuits is necessary for three reasons:  First, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent an avalanche of lawsuits against law-abiding companies. Let me say at the outset: this legislation is not about tobacco. Tobacco was just the beginning--the Model Act for hungry and enterprising trial lawyers.  After tobacco, there was speculation that the government would sue the men and women who manufacture and sell guns in America. The speculation was right. And now that we've got government-sponsored lawsuits against gun companies, the speculation turns to other legal industries, such as automobile manufacturers, paint manufacturers, and--yes, even the fast food industry.  Before some of you begin to shake your head about this widespread speculation, let me share some recent theories I've heard that verify that the theater of the absurd continues to move ever closer to legal reality. As reported recently by the Associated Press, a Yale professor is espousing a theory that, ``There is no difference between Ronald McDonald and Joe Camel.'' Both market products that are--and I quote this Professor from a recent seminar--``luring our children into killer habits'' ultimately increasing healthcare costs for the public--so the theory goes. And I promise that I'm not making this up. This Ivy League professor was in Washington just yesterday discussing this emerging theory.  Second, this legislation ensures basic fairness for individual citizens. Under established principles of tort law, private plaintiffs are often barred from recovering damages based on a failure to prove direct causation. For example, if a person is injured in an automobile accident, but cannot prove that his or her injuries were caused by a defect of theautomobile then that person cannot recover from the manufacturer. This legislation simply says that if the injured party couldn't recover from the auto manufacturer, then the government should not be able to sue the manufacturer to recover the health care expenses incurred by the government on behalf of the injured person.  In short: Government plaintiffs should not have rights superior to those rights of private plaintiffs.  Third, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent taxation through litigation. The power to tax is a legislative function and those who raise taxes should be directly accountable to the voters. Fortunately, it is getting more and more difficult to raise taxes in the Congress and the State legislatures--so money-hungry trial lawyers and big-government public officials are bypassing legislatures to engage in taxation and regulation through litigation. The Litigation Fairness Act will discourage lawyer-driven tax increases being dressed up and passed off as government lawsuits.  In closing, I want to point out some things that the Litigation Fairness Act does not do: it does not prohibit government lawsuits; it does not close the courthouse door to injured parties; it does not place caps on recoveries or limits on lawyer fees. Further, the Litigation Fairness Act cannot be construed to create or authorize any cause of action for any governmental entity.  In fact, the Litigation Fairness Act does not even prohibit the unholy marriage between plaintiffs' lawyers and government officials--although it admittedly makes such a marriage of money and convenience a bit less desirable. My legislation will simply ensure that the government plays by the same rules as its citizens.  This bill has broad support. I ask unanimous consent that the Record include statements in support of the bill from the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Tort Reform Association, and Citizens for a Sound Economy.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce News, June 23, 1999]     U.S. Chamber Endorses McConnell Bill to Stop Governments From                   Undermining Business Legal Defenses       Washington, D.C.--The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today      endorsed legislation that would stop the growing trend of      governments stripping legitimate industries of their legal      defenses and rights and then suing them to raise revenue      outside the constraints of the political process.       The ``Litigation Fairness Act,'' sponsored by Senator Mitch      McConnell (R-KY), would prevent governments at any level from      changing laws to retroactively strip businesses of their      traditional legal rights and defenses in order to sue them.       ``The U.S. Chamber is greatly concerned this dangerous      trend of governments changing the laws to facilitate their      revenue-grabbing lawsuits,'' said Chamber Executive Vice      President Bruce Josten. ``This practice began in the state      lawsuits against the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid      funds and, just as the Chamber predicted, has now spread to      other industries. President Clinton's plan to use the Justice      Department to sue the tobacco industry is a prime example of      this problem.       ``Unfortunately, these lawsuits are becoming all too      common,'' Josten added. ``If this trend continues, economic      and social decisions affecting all Americans will be made not      by the democratically elected legislatures, but instead by      trial lawyers.       ``McConnell's legislation would help curtail this abusive      situation,'' Josten said, noting that the legislation does      not affect any individual's rights or ability to sue a      company that has caused them harm.       The bill simply says that a government entity filing suite      to directly recover funds expended by that government on      behalf of a third-party (such as a Medicare or Medicaid      patient) would only be entitled to the same rights as an      individual suing that defendant. In addition, such a      government plaintiff would be subject to the same substantive      and procedural rules and defenses as any other individual      plaintiff. The legislation recognizes that an indirectly      injured party should not have any greater rights than a      directly injured person.       ``This legislation will stop the erosion of the two hundred      years of tort law, while fairly protecting the rights of      American industries from the litigious trial lawyers      collaborating with federal, state and local governments,''      Josten concluded.       Josten's comments followed a day-long conference, ``The New      Business of Government Sponsored Litigation: State Attorneys      General and Big City Lawsuits,'' sponsored by the Institute      for Legal Reform, the Chamber's legal policy arm, The      Federalist Society and The Manhattan Institute. The      conference featured Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, Alabama Gov.      Don Siegelman, attorneys general from New York, Alabama,      Delaware and Texas, and noted plaintiff's lawyers such as      Richard Scruggs and John Coale. The event can still be viewed      on the Chamber's website, at www.uschamber.org.                                  ____      [From the Citizens for a Sound Economy News, June 23, 1999] Senator McConnell's Litigation Fairness Act Would Help End `Taxation                           Through Litigation'       Washington.--J.V. Schwan, Deputy Director and Counsel for      Civil Justice Reform at Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE),      made the following statement in support of Senator Mitch      McConnell's bill, The Litigation Fairness Act.       ``Taxation through litigation is the latest scheme in      Washington. When the Administration can't accomplish their      goals through legislation, they sue. This is not what our      Founding Fathers intended. `The Litigation Fairness Act'      would help stop their `taxation through litigation scheme.'       ``Specifically, the bill would assure that when governments      file lawsuits for economic losses allegedly incurred as a      result of harm to citizens, the government's legal rights      will not be greater than those injured citizens. The bill      would preserve and in some instances restore that equitable      rule of law.       ``McConnell's bill does not bar suits by governments      against private defendants, place a cap on the recoveries      that may be obtained, or limit attorney fees. It simply      codifies a traditional tort law rule that has existed for      over 200 years.''                                  ____              [From the American Tort Reform Association]                Government Litigation Against Industries       Robert Reich recently wrote in USA Today that ``The era of      big government may be over, but the era of regulation through      litigation has just begun.'' He advocated that courts should      be the regulators of society, deciding whether certain      products or services should be available and at what price.       Mr. Reich is referring to the new phenomenon of governments      entering into partnerships with private contingency fee      attorneys to bring lawsuits against entire industries.      Manufacturers of tobacco products and firearms have already      been targets of litigation at the State and local levels. At      the federal level, President Clinton announced in his 1999      State of the Union address that he has directed the      Department of Justice to prepare a litigation plan to sue      tobacco companies to recover federal funds allegedly paid out      under Medicare.       Future targets of federal and/or state or local cost      recovery, or ``recoupment,'' litigations could include      producers of beer and wine and other adult beverages, and      manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and automobiles.      Even Internet providers, the gaming industry, the      entertainment industry, and fast food restaurants could be      targeted.                  The Changes to Black-Letter Tort Law       Under traditional tort law rules, third party payors (e.g.,      employers, insurers, and governments) have long enjoyed      subrogation rights to recover costs for healthcare and other      expenses that they are obligated to pay on behalf of      individuals.       For example, if a worker is injured in the workplace as a      result of a defective machine tool, tort law permits the      worker's employer to recover the cost of worker compensation      and other medical expenses paid on behalf of the employee.      Through the process of subrogation, the employer can join in      the employee's tort claim against the manufacturer of the      machine tool or put a lien on the employee's recovery, but      the employer cannot bring a direct action on its own.       Governmental cost recovery actions seek to radically change      the traditional subrogation rule. In the State tobacco cases,      the attorneys general argued that the States could bring an      ``independent'' cause of action against the tobacco      companies. Furthermore, the attorneys general argued, because      the States' claims were ``independent'' of the claims of      individual smokers, the States were not subject to the      defenses that could be raised against individual plaintiffs,      especially with respect to assumption of risk.       Despite the current unpopularity of the tobacco companies,      most courts have followed basic principles of law and      dismissed cost recovery claims against the tobacco companies.      One federal district court, however, bent the rules and      partially sustained a healthcare reimbursement suit in Texas      based on a unique expansion of the ``quasi-sovereign''      doctrine. Before the Texas federal court's decision, the      quasi-sovereign doctrine had been limited to suits for      injunctive relief; it did not extend to suits seeking      monetary damages. Even the ``pro-plaintiff'' Minnesota      Supreme Court recognized this fact in a tobacco case. The      Texas decision produced an avalanche of claims that were      ultimately settled out of court.                      The Role of Outside Counsel       Another characteristic of the new ``era of regulation      through litigation'' is the partnering of governmental      entities and private contingency fee attorneys. This new      partnership raises a number of serious ethical and ``good      government'' issues:       Contingent fee retainers were designed to give less-     affluent persons (who could generally ill-afford hourly rates      and up-front retainers) access to the courthouse.      Governmental entities have their own in-house legal staff;      taxpayers should not have to pay     excessive fees for legal work that could be done by the      government itself.       In the State tobacco litigation, it seemed that many of the      cases were awarded to private attorneys who had been former      law partners or campaign supporters of the elected official.      Furthermore, there appears to have been a lack of competitive      bidding in the attorney selection process. As a result,      experts estimate that some plaintiffs' attorneys were paid in      excess of $100,000 per hour.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Professor Lester Brickman, ``Want To Be a Billionaire?

United States, an attorney for the state, `is the      representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but      of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as      compelling as its obligation to govern at all'.'' \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ Robert A. Levy. ``The Great Tobacco Robbery. Hired Guns      Corral Contingent Fee Bonanza'' Legal Times, Week of February      1, 1999, 27.---------------------------------------------------------------------------             All Industries Could Be Targets of Litigation       To date, recoupment lawsuits have been filed against      politically disfavored industries because plaintiff attorneys      know that if courts bend the rules for controversial      products, those precedents will apply equally to other      industries.       In fact, some contingency fee lawyers have already publicly      stated that tobacco and firearms are just the first of many      industries likely to be sued in the new era of regulation by      litigation. As stated, future targets of litigation could      include producers of beer and wine and other adult beverages,      manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and automobiles,      Internet providers, the gaming industry, the entertainment      industry, and fast food restaurants.                     Separation of Powers Violated       Legislating public policy in the courtroom violates the      ``separation of powers doctrine''--the fundamental rule upon      which this country's entire system of government is based.      The job of legislatures is to legislate; the job of courts is      to interpret the law. This bedrock principle of government      should not be eroded for the sake of political expediency and      political theater.                                  ____    Statement by Victor E. Schwartz, Counsel, American Tort Reform                        Association, June 23, 1999the principle of equal justice under law is preserved by the litigation                               fairness act       The Litigation Fairness Act helps assure equal justice      under law; that is why the American Tort Reform Association      supports it. Liability law should be neutral. Its principles      should apply in the same way to all defendants. A basic      principle of system of justice is equal justice under law.       Unfortunately, legal principles developed in a few tobacco      cases did not apply neutral principles. They gave power to      state governments under a fiction called the ``quasi-     sovereign doctrine,'' greater power in the law than was      possessed by an injured individual. New cases filed by cities      against gun manufacturers also may create new principles of      law that give those cities greater rights than injured      persons. There is little doubt that an engine behind these      new principles is the unpopularity of those defendants.       These principles may be limited to so-called ``outlaw      defendants''--people who make guns, tobacco, liquor, or other      products that significant segments of our society do not      like. On the other hand, the principles may apply equally to      others. If that is true, those principles can apply against      people who make fast foods, automobiles that can go over 100      mph, motorcycles, hunting knives, and even the entertainment      industry.       The Litigation Fairness Act preserves the principle that an      injured person's right to sue is paramount over government      rights, where the government has suffered some indirect      economic loss because of that person's harm. It restores      equal justice under law and neutrality within our tort      system.       For those reasons, the Americans Tort Reform Association      supports the Litigation Fairness Act.                                 ______                                       By
