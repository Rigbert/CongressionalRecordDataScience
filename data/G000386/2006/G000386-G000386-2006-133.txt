 President, yes, the provision is intended to get at fair share type payments, but note that agencies and creditors cannot get around the provision merely by re-labeling fair share payments as something else. This is the intent of this provision. I am also aware of a specific issue affecting a few States and their existing State law, and the provision before us today specifically includes a transition period in part to allow the reconciliation of various State statutes with the new federal provision. I will work with interested Senators during this period on their concerns regarding existing organizations. I thank Mr. Coleman and Mr. Sessions for helping to clarify its intent.                 Modifications to Sections 801 and 803
