Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I do not disagree with almost anything I heard this afternoon. All I will say is that the commitment was made and it will be kept. The only question is one of timing. I take the President at his word that at the appropriate time the request will be made for the additional money for New York, and I will move that supplemental request just as quickly as I possibly can.                             Point of Order
