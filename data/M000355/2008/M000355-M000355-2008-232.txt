 President, I rise today to honor a well-respected Kentuckian, Mr. Clarence L. Miller. Throughout his life, Mr. Miller has contributed immensely to our Commonwealth and Nation.  Recently the Sentinel-News in Shelbyville, Kentucky, published a story about Mr. Miller. The story summarizes the extraordinary life he led, while paying tribute to him as a remarkable Kentuckian. Throughout his career as a public servant, Mr. Miller has worked hard to give back to the State and Nation that he loves so dearly.  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Clarence L. Miller as a true patriot and Kentuckian whose legacy will forever be remembered, and I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel-News, April 30, 2008]     Clarence L. Miller: Farmer, Administrator, Diplomat, Raconteur                        (By BG Ron Van Stockum)       I called on Clarence Miller recently to add my appreciation      to that of his many other friends for his generosity in      donating his farm to Shelbyville. In our informal      conversation it became apparent that his story needed to be      recorded and reported.       Accordingly, a few days later, my son Reggie invited him to      Allen Dale where he taped as oral history an extended audio/     visual interview. My column today will constitute an      abbreviated story of Clarence Miller's life, providing      information additional to that contained in Gayle Deaton's      excellent article in an issue of last year's Sentinel-News.       Clarence Miller was born in Louisville in 1912. His father,      Pleasant Green Miller, always called ``P. Green'' (1871-     1968), born in Estill County, was employed as a federal      whisky inspector or ``whiskey gauger.'' His responsibilities,      within the Department of the Treasury, included the recording      of whiskey production and assuring that the distillers paid      the proper federal tax on alcohol. With the onset of World      War I, distillation was dramatically curtailed in order to      preserve grain. His job disestablished, he took his family to      Florida where he set out a citrus grove.              eighteenth amendment: prohibition (1920-33)       Before the production of whisky could be fully restored,      National Prohibition was established by means of the      Eighteenth Amendment, with Kentucky being the third state to      ratify it. Ratification was certified on 29 January 1919 and      on 28 October the Volstead Act was passed, defining      ``intoxicating     beverage'' as one containing greater than one-half of one      percent alcohol. This act went into effect on 29 January      1920, along with the Eighteenth Amendment. President Hoover      called Prohibition a ``noble experiment,'' but others used      stronger words. Clarence described the effect of Prohibition      on the distilleries as ``confiscatory.'' They held millions      of gallons of whiskey in storage, but, except for a      controlled trickle for ``medicinal'' purposes, were not      allowed to sell it.       Even moderate imbibers needed to adjust. While I do not      recall alcohol being served by my parents in Seattle,      Washington, I do remember my mother sending me out on the      lawn to pick dandelions for wine. The process she used is      unknown, but it is possible today to learn all that is      necessary by ``googling'' ``dandelion wine.''       P. Green Miller and many other federal agents, were called      back to the Treasury Department to enforce the new law. In      view of its unpopularity, affecting so many special interests      and tastes, this was a formidable task. In 1923, he became      Division Chief for Enforcement of Prohibition for the states      of Kentucky and Tennessee, with offices in Louisville and      Memphis. Later, he spent a good deal of time on the east      coast, in New York, Baltimore and Boston, trying to      eliminate, or at least minimize, the illegal smuggling by      high-speed cutters, called ``rum runners,'' which picked up      whisky from vessels lying beyond the territorial limits. He      also was involved in the attempt to break up the illegal      activities of the most powerful and infamous of all      bootleggers, Al Capone, who operated out of Chicago.          repeal of prohibition--twenty-first amendment (1933)       On 23 March 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, after      signing into law an amendment to the Volstead Act, allowing      the manufacture and sale of ``3.2 beer'' and light wines, is      reported to have remarked ``Now let's all have a beer.'' The      Eighteenth Amendment, itself, was repealed later with      ratification of the Twenty-first amendment on 5 December      1933. P. Green Miller returned to farming.                        young clarence l. miller       Meanwhile, on 1 January 1925, when Clarence was 12 years      old, the Miller family purchased Red Orchard Farm and      established residence there, although Clarence's father was      still spending most of his time elsewhere discharging his      enforcement responsibilities. The farm, originally 119 acres,      now constitutes 130 acres. Clarence helped his mother with      the farm, entering Shelbyville High School where he graduated      with the class of 1932. A schoolmate of his was Ben McMakin,      the subject of one of last year's columns, who died as a      Marine prisoner of war in 1945. ``Ben was president of our      class one year, and I the next.'' He then spent two years at      University of Kentucky with the intent of studying law, but      instead returned to Shelbyville.                        moving up in agriculture       Here, he was employed with the Agriculture Adjustment      Administration (AAA), later called the Commodity      Stabilization Service (CSS). He started literally from the      ground up, measuring tobacco plantings to assure compliance      with the regulations. In 1947 he married his high school      sweetheart, Katherine Barrickman, always called ``Toddy.''      The daughter of a prominent Shelbyville lawyer and County      Attorney, she was an accomplished competitive golfer, being      local women's champion for 13 straight years. In 1953      Clarence became chairman of the state CSS and a year later      went to Washington DC as national Director of the Tobacco      Division of the same agency. In 1956, he became Associate      Administrator of the national CSS. In 1959 and 1960, the      final two years of the Eisenhower administration, he served      as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and      Foreign Agriculture, working directly under Secretary Ezra      Taft Benson, Agricultural Attache in Madrid.       From 1961 to 1969 he was back in Shelbyville, operating his      farm and occupying a position in public relations with the      Kentucky Farm Bureau. In 1970 he was appointed under the      Nixon administration as Agricultural Attache in Spain,      serving until 1976, initially under his good friend,      Ambassador Robert C. Hill. It was during this period that      several of his friends from Shelbyville were his guests at      the Embassy in Madrid. I remember my fellow tennis player,      the late Guy Lea, one of his guests, remarking about      Clarence's hospitality when he and his wife visited Spain.                             world traveler       Despite undergoing double artery by-pass surgery and      replacement of the aortic valve in 1998, the following year      he took a trip to Singapore. There are few countries he has      not visited. He has traveled around the world, rounded both      Africa and South America by ship, and visited Greenland and      Antarctica. Nevertheless, he has never lost touch with his      home town and his lifetime of public service to his community      and to his country has culminated in the most altruistic act      of all: the gift to his home town of Red Orchard Farm.       Note: It is encouraging to report that Clarence Miller      continues to be hale and hearty, strong of voice, forceful in      expression and vitally concerned about public affairs. He      looks back upon his long life with a feeling of      accomplishment: ``It has been my good fortune to have been in      the right place at the right time with the right      credentials.''                          ____________________
