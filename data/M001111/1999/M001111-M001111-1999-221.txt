 President, I am extremely concerned, as I am sure my colleague from Connecticut is as well, that an objection was heard and we were not able to just add this language directly to the underlying amendment on clinical trials, because what the Senator from Maine has now done is forced us into a vote where we would be voting against clinical trials in order for women not to have drive-through mastectomies. That is not a choice Senators ought to be having.  In addition, what it says to women across this country is you have a choice, a mastectomy or a clinical trial. That is not a choice we should be offering.  I really hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider their objection to this and we can work this out. The people of this country are watching this debate, asking whether or not we are going to move forward and give patients the ability to have the best care possible. If we can work out this amendment and add it to the clinical trials, we will have done the people of this country a service.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield.
