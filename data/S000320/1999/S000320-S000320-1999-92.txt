 President, I have a few observations. My friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, makes a lot of sense a lot of times. I agree with him most of the time. I especially agree with him on this. We certainly don't want the Government running the airlines. We want the airlines to be as responsive as they can be to the public, which is their customer. That is all of us. We have benefited.  As the Senator from Louisiana said in her remarks, we have benefited immensely from the deregulation of the airlines. We want to keep it that way. I want to deregulate just about everything I can think of, or see, or feel, because I think there is a benefit.  The Senator from Texas is absolutely right. There is something in private enterprise and a contract, and we should respect that. We have to respect that. But I hope the airlines are getting the message that we are getting from the public that there is a lot of unrest out there. Maybe it is lack of communication with the public. But if I buy a ticket and if it is a special ticket, I know it is a special ticket. That is a contract. I know that if I don't use it, I guess I will lose it. I certainly can't skip around on it. Maybe that is a communications problem with whoever is purchasing it. But whatever we do, let's not ever have the Government running any business, especially the airlines.
