This is an important milestone in the lives of both the graduates and their parents.  However, while many of these graduates will be looking forward to college, tens of thousands of these students will never get to attend college and realize their dreams. Why? Because these children are undocumented. Most of these children were brought to the United States at a very young age by their parents and did not have the ability to make an independent decision about where they would live. They had no choice in matter. Thus, they grew up here. They went to school here. And like other children, they too had thoughts of realizing the American dream. These dreams are quickly dashed when these students realize that, unlike their classmates, college is not on their horizon because of their immigration status.  Although Congress and the United States Supreme Court rightfully require State and local education agencies to permit undocumented children to attend elementary and secondary school, there are very few mechanisms under current law for these children to legalize their immigration status or go on to college once they have completed their high school education. They are effectively denied the opportunity to go to college and are constantly under the threat of deportation. Their lives are filled with uncertainty and lost opportunity.  That is why I, along with Senators Kennedy, Reid, Dodd, Wellstone, Corzine, and Feingold, am introducing the Children's Adjustment, Relief, and Education Act, CARE Act. Representatives Cannon, Berman, and Roybal-Allard introduced a companion bill in the House on May 21, 2001.  The CARE Act would provide immigration relief to undocumented children who are in the United States, have lived a significant portion of their lives in this country, are of good moral character, and are interested in remaining in the country and continuing their education. The CARE Act would help lift these vulnerable children from the shadows of society and free them to go to college, regularize their status, and fully contribute to our country, now their country.  The CARE Act includes three major provisions.  As to restoration of the State option to determine residency for purposes of higher education benefits, first, the Act would repeal Section 505 of the 1996 immigration law, under which any State that provides in-state tuition or other higher education benefits to undocumented immigrants must provide the same tuition break or benefit to out-of-state residents. In other words, under Section 505, a State must charge the same tuition to out-of-state U.S. citizens as it charges to resident undocumented aliens. Repeal of Section 505 would restore to the States the authority to determine their own residency rules.  As to immigration relief for long-term resident students, second, the Act would permit students in America's junior high schools and high schools who have good moral character, reside in the United States, and have lived in the United States for at least five years to obtain special immigration relief, known as cancellation of removal, so that they can go to college and eventually become United States citizens. The act also applies to high school graduates who are under 21 years of age and are either enrolled in or are seriously pursuing admission to college.  As to higher education benefits for Student Adjustment Act applicants, finally, the Act would ensure that students who are applying for immigration relief under the Act may obtain federal student assistance on the same basis as other students while their application is being processed.  This legislation would help children like Luis Miguel in my home State of Illinois. Luis was born to a single mother in Guadalajara, Mexico. His mother was having a very difficult time living in Mexico so she decided to take her children and migrate to the United States. Luis was eight years old. He didn't have a say in the matter.  Luis was enrolled in a grammar school and after school he worked in a supermarket carrying groceries for people. Because Luis' mother was unable to make ends meet, she sent Luis to live in Chicago with his aunt and uncle when he was nine. He has lived there ever since.  Luis is currently 17 years old and just finished up his junior year at Kelly High School in Chicago. He is an above average student, and hopes to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago someday and become a computer engineer. He says he loves being involved in all types of activities because it makes him feel good about himself, and motivates him to do better. He is very active in and out of school. He is part of his school band, where he plays percussion, and he plays soccer in the Davis Square Park League. In the past he has participated in his church's choir, marimba band and folkloric ballet dancegroup. Luis also volunteers as a teacher for catechism classes at Holy Cross Church.  Luis has so much promise. But without this legislation, he is barred from fulfilling his potential.  The same is true for a young musical prodigy who recently completed her senior year of high school in the City of Chicago. Because of her exceptional musical talent, she was offered a scholarship to Juilliard. It is only in filling out the application that she learned of her undocumented status. Her only recourse: go to Korea, where she has never been, and live her life there. I believe our Nation can do better than this.  These stories are not unique to Illinois. Tens of thousands of high school students across our Nation, some of them valedictorians, are similarly situated and face uncertain futures. They cannot continue their lives or education once they graduate from high school. Instead, they face deportation.  Not only do these children suffer but our Nation suffers because we are deprived of future contributors and leaders, increased tax revenues, economic growth and social richness. We suffer because children who might have been scientists, nurses, teachers or engineers are forced, instead, to settle for the limited employment options available to those without a college degree.  Moreover, the damage to our communities starts long before high school graduation. Guidance counselors report that many promising students drop out of school at an early age once they realize that they will, as a practical matter, be barred from going to college.  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senators Kennedy, Reid, Dodd, Wellstone, Corzine, and Feingold in supporting this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1265       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
