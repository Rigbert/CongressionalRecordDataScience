 President, on November 17, 1995, Richard Steele of Richland, WA, was presented with an Environmental Hero Award by the Washington Environmental Council for spearheading the effort to save the Hanford Reach, the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River. I prepared the following statement for the event and ask that it be printed in the Record.       Rich Steele is a man with a mission.       In fact, Rich Steele is something of a missionary in the      crusade to protect the Hanford Reach--the last free-flowing      stretch of the Columbia River and a sanctuary for one of the      strongest salmon runs left in the Northwest.       Rich has labored for 30 years to protect the Reach. But he      is not your average environmentalist. Rich was brought up the      hard way in the Tri-Cities; worked construction and other      jobs until joining the workforce at the Hanford Nuclear      Reservation, where he became one of the site's top      technicians. As an avid hunter and fisher, Rich came to love      the River and became its chief advocate.       His call to this mission came in the mid-sixties, when the      Reach was threatened by the Ben Franklin Dam proposal. Rich      organized the Columbia River Conservation League in 1967,      coordinating successful local opposition to the dam and its      powerful backers. He revived the CRCL in the 1980s to block a      dredging proposal for the Reach. All the while, Rich has      preached the virtues of the Reach--its clear waters and      fabulously productive spawning areas, its rich human history,      its abundant wildlife, its majestic White Bluffs and soul-     restoring solitude.       On his own time and at considerable personal expense, Rich      has led hundreds of pilgrimages down the Reach, making      converts among local citizens, the national media, and      elected officials. After touring the Reach with Rich last      summer, I am among those who believe it deserves the highest      level of permanent protection we can give it.       Working closely with other long-time advocates like Jack de      Yonge, a dedicated group of local conservationists, and the      Nature Conservancy, Rich has helped to popularize the Reach      to the point that Wild and Scenic River designation enjoys      strong support in the Tri-Cities. Despite opposition from      some local politicians, we are developing legislation to      protect the Reach that I believe will have a good chance of      enactment--perhaps even in this Congress.       None of this would be possible without Rich Steele's      inspired leadership, passionate activism, and three decades      of hard work. Rich has devoted his life to saving the Reach,      and it is fitting that he be honored as an environmental      hero.                           ____________________
