 But it is a good step.  It is my intention to vote against this bill at this time because of the two additions I cited earlier. If the Gorton and Ashcroft amendments come out in conference and the appropriate tax incentives to save for education remain, I will vote for this bill and I will vote to override a Presidential veto.
