 David Hawpe, the editor, a twice-a-week columnist, agrees with my senior colleague that the LEAF Act is the way to go, but the editorial page in the same paper, looking at the same issue, comes to the opposite conclusion.  Just reading in part from the Louisville Courier-journal of May 20:       [T]he LEAF Act would be in trouble in any event. This,      after all, is a Congress that passed the Freedom to Farm Act,      which ended price support programs for such noncontroversial      crops as wheat, corn and soybeans. Why would lawmakers,      especially now, make an exception for tobacco, which is      blamed for 400,000 deaths a year?       Of course, some anti-smoking groups have formed an alliance      with tobacco farm organizations who support the Tobacco      Program on the grounds that cheaper tobacco would lead to      more smoking. But the cost of tobacco is a tiny fraction of a      pack of cigarettes, and it will get smaller as Congress piles      on new taxes.       The grim fact is, the tobacco growers have a stake in      people continuing to smoke, while the government, with broad      public support, is determined to discourage smoking.       Sooner or later, a way of life in Kentucky [according to      the Courier] is going to end, and it is going to be painful.      Senator McConnell would get it over quickly. Senator Ford      will stretch it out. Neither can save a rural economy based      on burley.  That is from the Louisville Courier-Journal on May 20 of this year.  There have been numerous letters to the editors of various papers. I will not read them all, but I think one is interesting in particular. It appeared June 11, 1998, in the Courier-Journal, from H.H. Barlow III, Cave City, KY.       I am a 47-year-old lifelong tobacco farmer in Barren      County, the largest tobacco-producing county in tobacco. The      media, Senator Wendell Ford and Representative Scotty Baesler      [according to this grower] are not telling the whole truth on      tobacco.  That is he--the writer of the letter--not I, I say to my senior colleague from Kentucky.       Senator Mitch McConnell has taken a bold step to protect      the tobacco farmers of Kentucky by proposing an $8-per-pound      buyout that would allow farmers to continue to grow tobacco      in the free market. For me and my neighbors who are older and      have spent our life raising tobacco, McConnell's proposal      gives us a retirement plan and compensation for the loss of      income. Most important is that under the McConnell plan,      tobacco farmers would receive payments over a 3-year period      as opposed to 10 years as Ford has proposed. Payments over 3      years would be significant enough to enable farmers to reduce      debt and to invest in retirement or to develop other      agricultural enterprises on the farm.       There are seven tobacco states fighting 43 non-tobacco      states, and tobacco votes in Congress get closer every year.      Ford proposes to establish another government-run program      that can be voted out by tobacco opponents at any time,      leaving tobacco farmers to bleed a slow death with nothing to      show for our quotas. McConnell has risked a lot to be honest      about the true future of the tobacco program. You be the      judge, but for me and my neighbors, having the buyout money      for our quota is like having a bird in hand instead of two in      the bush, as Ford and Baesler want.  Another letter appeared in that same edition of The Courier-Journal. This letter was by Ms. Megan Cobb of Henderson, Kentucky. Here are some of the thoughts offered by Ms. Cobb:       As a young, non-smoking Kentuckian, I have been reading the      information and misinformation surrounding the tobacco price      support issues. Being apolitical, I have no interest in the      politics of the issue, but I am concerned that our political      candidates . . . are using the issue for their own benefit      and really have no concern for the issue itself or the people      who are affected.       I will say it takes great courage for our Senator Mitch      McConnell to stand up and tell the cold truth. That is, the      price support system for most farm products is over for all      intents and purposes. And that tobacco, and its production,      is going through radical changes not caused by the political      process but, rather, by the social process that causes      societies to change dramatically.       It is unfortunate that some of our farmers are looking for      a scapegoat rather than solutions. It is unfortunate that our      Senate candidates are pandering to the issues rather than      boldly charting new courses like McConnell. And to say      McConnell's position is anti-farm is not only distortion but      irresponsible.  So these are just a few of the thoughtful Kentuckians in the heart of tobacco country who have surveyed the landscape and agree with me on this difficult issue.  I also ask unanimous consent a letter to the editor in the Lexington Herald-Leader from Alben B. Mills in London be printed in the Record, and another letter in the Courier-Journal from a Larry Bond be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               McConnell Right About Tobacco Buyout Plan                      (By Alben B. Mills, London)       As a tobacco farmer, I want to thank Sen. Mitch McConnell,      R-Ky., for his courageous stance for a tobacco base buyout.      While it may not be the most politically popular position      McConnell could have taken, it was the most realistic and      responsible solution to the uncertainty that Kentucky burley      growers have faced since President Clinton declared war on      tobacco. Like McConnell, I will be saddened to see the      program go, but I have known for several years that tobacco's      days in the federal government were numbered. At least,      McConnell's plan will allow my colleagues and me to receive a      secured payment for our quotas. I have not enjoyed security      in my tobacco farming for a long time, thanks to Clinton and      Vice President Al Gore.       Those who say that the program can survive the ever      increasing anti-tobacco sentiment in Congress are taking a      huge gamble, and they are wagering irresponsibility with the      farmer's future. McConnell has made the tough call. He has      told us the painful truth that the program is unsalvageable      and that we should cut our losses while we still have the      chance for fair compensation for our tobacco bases. His      opinions have the ring of statesmanship, and the tobacco      farming community will be forever indebted to him for his      candor. I am grateful to McConnell for placing our interests      before his own.                                  ____                         Backs McConnell's Plan                    (By Larry O. Bond, Sanders, Ky.)       I am very displeased with the attacks made on Sen. Mitch      McConnell by the Democrats regrading his stand on the tobacco      buyout.       I am a farm owner and have raised tobacco for 21 years.      When we went to the no-net program in 1982, we were doomed.      Sen. Wendell Ford helped pass that law. By 1985, the tobacco      companies had forced so much tobacco into our pool that they      broke us. Ford helped negotiate a tobacco company buyout of      the pool stocks. Farmers took a cut in an allotment and a cut      in price. My tobacco income was reduced by 50 percent. I grew      tired of being abused by the tobacco companies, and 1989 was      my last crop.       It seems to me that when Ford does the negotiating, the      companies get the ``gold,'' and the farmers get the      ``shaft.''       The provisions of Ford's LEAF Act have changed several      times over the last six months. The language is so complex      that it appears to have been written to deliberately confuse      the reader. Our experience since 1982 indicates that no      tobacco agreement can last unchanged for 10 years.       I believe that when people want to change society it is      only fair that they should pay for the change. If Sen.      Richard Lugar and McConnell's buyout takes place, I will be      satisfied that has happened. Farmers' lives will be radically      changed, but at least they won't be completely dispossessed.       I would like to mention a critical point to my city      cousins: The Lugar-McConnell buyout pays the farmer $8 a      pound for his government allotment, and it goes out of      existence. Ford's LEAF Act will pay those who choose to sell      $8 per pound for the government allotment; however, those      pounds will not cease to exist but will be redistributed to      farmers who choose not to sell. Ford will spend America's      money and give no benefit to American society. The Ford LEAF      Act will not solve any of the problems that face tobacco      farmers or society at large.       The three-year Lugar-McConnell plan is easy to understand,      will solve the tobacco program problem once and for all, and      relieves the government from being responsible for the      tobacco farmer. It reimburses the farmer for property that      society wants done away with. The farmer can pay down his      debts and move on with his life.       McConnell has taken a bold and courageous stand on this      issue, and I back him 100 percent. Nothing can shake me from      that position.  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, let me just, in conclusion, sum up what the point is here.  What is proposed before the Senate is a bill designed to destroy the tobacco industry. As a matter of fact, one CEO of one of the companies said this bill in this form would put them into bankruptcy. There is no immunity provided for the companies. There is a Draconian look-back provision of certain unconstitutionality, various and assorted advertising restrictions also of dubious constitutionality, and a $1.10 cigarette tax increase over 3 years designed to net for the government some $500 to$800 billion in revenue, depending on whose estimates you listen to. The net effect of all that is a government designed to destroy this industry.  It is in that context that I believe the appropriate thing for the government to do is to throw a lifeline to the 60,000 hard-working Kentucky tobacco growers who make their living off of this legal crop.  Now, Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and frame this issue from a larger perspective and walk through how our farmers found themselves in the current predicament.  One of President Clinton's signature political maneuvers occurred early in his administration when he and Vice President Gore declared war on tobacco--portraying Kentucky's leading agricultural commodity as a modern-day plague. The anti-tobacco zealots and an army of greedy plaintiffs' lawyers eager to prey on the tobacco industry created the most serious threat ever arrayed against tobacco farmers. Disaster has loomed for Kentucky's tobacco farmers since Clinton took office and is now manifested in the form of this half-trillion dollar McCain bill which sailed out of the Senate Commerce Committee 19-1, with Senator Wendell Ford's support. Thus was the death knell sounded for tobacco.  With our tobacco farmers now caught in the crossfire of this war, we are being asked to make a monumental decision. That decision is simply this: despite all we know about tobacco's desperately weakened state--  (1) do we ignore the warning signs and commit ourselves to a path that leads to uncertainty and a diminished standard of living for our farmers, or  (2) do we recognize that change is coming to the farm and there is a better way to prepare for it than by blindly pursuing the policies of the past?  Mr. President, after months of thought, countless conversations with my colleagues, and a continual dialogue with Kentucky growers, I believe there is only one road for us to travel if we decide to pass this monstrous McCain bill. Let me explain why.  The politics of tobacco have changed. Throughout most of American history, we have paid tribute to tobacco and tobacco farmers. Nowhere is this national tribute more evident than right here in our nation's capitol. As I sat in my office this morning, I glanced at the small columns on my fireplace and took note of the tobacco leaves which adorn those columns.  And, then as I left my office and walked to the Senate floor, I passed various pillars here in the Capitol and looked upward to see, once again, the sculpted tobacco leaves bursting forth at the top of these pillars.  No longer do we pay tribute to the golden leaf or the farmer whose sweat and toil produces that leaf. The leaf is now seen as dark and brown and dirty. And, it is targeted for extinction and eradication by virtually every governmental and private-sector force in America.  Although tobacco leaves still adorn the halls of Congress, the leaf is no longer sacred. What was once seen as sacred, is now looked upon with contempt and outright hostility.  When I came to the Senate in 1985, there were only 7 tobacco-related votes. But, the times have changed--dramatically--and for the worse, where our tobacco farmers are concerned.  In the 105th Congress alone, there have been 29 tobacco-related votes--notwithstanding all the votes on the woefully misguided bill currently before the Senate. Twenty-nine votes--even prior to the McCain bill--that is three times more votes than there were when I arrived here in 1985. In fact, we've had more votes on tobacco in the 105th Congress alone than we had in all the years between 1985 and 1996. And each of these votes has the effect of putting a bull's eye on the tobacco farmer's back.  No vote points up tobacco's weakened position more vividly than a vote last summer (Durbin, July 23) to end crop insurance for farmers. Can you imagine? The amendment's sponsor was saying, in effect, ``if you grow corn, wheat, soybeans, etc., you are entitled to insurance. But not if you grow tobacco. Even though you have never sold your product to a minor, or committed any of the transgressions we accuse tobacco companies of, you do not deserve basic protection from natural catastrophe.''  On an issue that blatantly unfair, the vote, shockingly, was 53-47. That's three votes shy of elimination.  Tobacco interests have been under a constant, daily barrage of scorn and derision. Tobacco has become the enemy of choice among politicians. It is the darling of the attack set. Politicians across the political spectrum believe that attacking anything ``tobacco'' pays political dividends. And attack they do.  But these are not precision strikes. These are broadsides against the entire tobacco industry that wreak devastating collateral damage on tobacco farmers.  Let me tell you what Senator Ford's colleagues on the left are saying about the tobacco program and the tobacco farmer.  Here's Senator Durbin: ``Tobacco growers have to know the party's over.'' And again: ``Uncle Sam ought to get out of the tobacco business. We have no business subsidizing the growth, production, and processing of a product which kills hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.''  And, if the views of the left still aren't clear to you, Mr. President, let me share with you yet another quote from Senator Durbin: ``There is only one agricultural product in America that has a body count, and it is tobacco. That is why it is different, and that is why it is treated differently.''  And what about Senator Lautenberg? He summed the anti-tobacco views of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the Congressional left by offering this advice to tobacco growers: ``Grow soybeans.''  Now we have gotten to the point where, in the name of stopping teen smoking, we have created a half-trillion-plus dollar bill--more than twice the size of the Pentagon's budget--designed to stop what researchers have told us is 2 percent of all smokers.  And is addressing teen smoking really the goal? The American people don't think so. An April Wall Street Journal poll found that only 20 percent believed this tobacco bill is about stopping teen smoking. A resounding 70 percent say this effort is merely a back door way to go after tobacco and take in more money for the government to spend.  In this mad dash for cash, 124,000 tobacco farm families are caught in the crossfire of political ambition and partisan competition--60,000 of them from Kentucky. They did not start this war. And they should not be casualties. But casualties they will be if we do not act.  Senator Ford--whose work on behalf of all tobacco farmers is well known and rightly applauded--and I agree that these growers should be compensated. After all, they have done nothing wrong. Tobacco is a legal commodity. Whatever the larger arguments may be about Joe Camel, tobacco farmers are not a party to that debate.  So Senator Ford and I agree that they need to be taken care of, we disagree as to how. That disagreement arises from a fundamentally different interpretation of the political and economic terrain in which tobacco grows.  Senator Ford has surveyed the scene and concluded that the federal tobacco program is healthy and will enjoy another 25 years of support from the United States Congress. In his estimation, the best thing to do is continue the program and compensate farmers for the drop in demand that this bill is specifically designed to produce.  Let me repeat. The single greatest danger to Kentucky tobacco farmers is the passage of the McCain bill. You cannot suck more than a half-trillion dollars out of the tobacco industry without also ruining the tobacco farmer in the process.  As for me, I look at the same landscape as Senator Ford and come to the same conclusion that the farmers in my state have reached. In a statewide poll taken by the Lexington Herald-Leader in March, 70 percent of those who expressed an opinion said the program would be dead in less than five years. Let me restate that: 70 percent of farmers think the tobacco program is on its deathbed. Seventy percent of farmers think they will be forced to earn a living doing something else in just five years!  Like me, they look at the constant assault and realize a simple fact. Elected representatives in our country fundamentally reflect the prevailing view of their constituents.  Let me remind us all that the vast majority of Americans polled are against smoking tobacco. A near majority of U.S. Senators think that tobacco farmers don't even deserve our support for basic crop insurance. In the heart of tobacco country, the growers themselves are predicting the program's demise. And, finally, influential members of Congress have publicly declared that the tobacco program must die.  Mr. President, under the McCain bill or any other bill like it, the tobacco program is mortally wounded. It's struggling through the underbrush, hemorrhaging and slowing with every step. The question is not whether the tobacco program will end, it's when it will end if the McCain bill becomes law?  In the face of the deep, widespread unpopularity of tobacco, does anyone seriously think that the government that is trying to kill tobacco TODAY in this very bill will then turn around and support a taxpayer-funded program for a product widely-presumed to be carcinogenic?  Mr. President, it is clear that the vast majority view in this Congress, in tobacco country, and in America generally is that, if the McCain bill passes, the tobacco program will not survive. Knowing these facts, the challenge before us is to make sure tobacco farmers do.  Senator Lugar's buy-out plan is tobacco growers' best hope to transition to a new farm existence with the resources necessary to make it, or to retire with sufficient funds if they so choose.  Under Chairman Lugar's approach, quota owners will receive $8 per pound for their tobacco spread out over three years. The average grower in my state farms a little over 4 acres, yielding roughly 10,000 pounds of tobacco annually. That means that the average Kentucky quota owner will receive $80,000 over the next three years in buy-out payments.  In contrast, under the LEAF Act, the average farmer who wants to adapt to the changing world and take a buy-out, will only receive $24,000 pre-tax after three years.  The Lugar plan also invests $1 billion in rural economic assistance over 5 years for those communities hit hardest by the loss of tobacco income. This money will help invest in education, retraining, diversification, and give assistance to tobacco warehouse owners and operators.  Most importantly, under the Lugar plan tobacco growers may continue to grow and sell their product.  Let me repeat, under the Lugar plan every grower may continue to grow if they choose.  That is not the case under the LEAF Act. The LEAF Act specifically forbids Kentucky burley growers from growing tobacco for 25 years. Since the average age of a tobacco grower in my state is 60, that is effectively a lifetime ban on growing tobacco.  But that's not all. Under the LEAF Act, if you are a North Carolina flue-cured quota owner, you get a buy-out and then you get to keep on growing tobacco. That is simply unfair, and on that basis alone I cannot support a system that treats Kentucky growers worse than North Carolina growers.  As we move through this debate, there are other concerns related to the LEAF Act's buy-out funding that I will address, but for now, let me close by saying that I believe the Lugar approach is the best for our people in tobacco country. It provides a generous flow of money over a short time period that allows our growers to invest, retire, diversify, get into a new line of work, or keep on farming tobacco. It provides community investment dollars to help hard hit rural areas. And, it is the best deal I believe we can get for tobacco growers if the McCain bill becomes law.  Let me conclude by summing up the decision before us. The Titanic has come into the harbor for the moment. We have two choices. One, we can send her back into the Atlantic with more lifeboats strapped to her side--but not enough boats to save everyone aboard. Or, we can unload all passengers while she's in safe harbor. I think the choice is clear.  Mr. President, I look forward to this important debate over the best course to follow for our tobacco farmers.  I conclude by saying I sincerely hope that the Senate will find a way to put this bill out of its misery.  I want to particularly commend the senior Senator from Texas for the outstanding work he has done on this bill over the last 3\1/2\ weeks. He has been tenacious and effective in pointing out the flaws in this bill conceptually. The whole concept, I say to my friend from Texas, is fatally flawed and no one has pointed that out better than he has. I want to thank him on behalf of the 60,000 farm families in my State that, but for the leadership and tenacity of the senior Senator from Texas, would be destroyed because the ultimate threat to my people is this bill. This is what is designed to destroy their livelihood.  I think until the Senator from Texas decided to put the bit in his teeth and come over here and fight this thing, there was widespread feeling that it was just going to happen. I am hoping we may have reached a point in the Senate where it isn't going to happen. If we can find a way to put this horrible proposal out of its misery, I will always thank the Senator from Texas for his extraordinary leadership and good work in pointing out the fundamental flaws in this proposal.  I yield the floor.
