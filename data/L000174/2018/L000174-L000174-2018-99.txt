President, I appreciate what the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois just said. I will speak about the same amendment. We will be offering this amendment. It does provide $250 million for State election security grants. It provides it to protect our upcoming elections from attacks by Russia especially but from many other hostile foreign powers.  We don't do this as an exercise. We know the attacks have been there in the past, and they are coming in the future. Look at what our intelligence community said. They unanimously said that Russia interfered in our 2016 election.  After the intelligence community unanimously said they interfered, Congress came together, and we appropriated $380 million for State election security grants in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus.  Since that time, all 55 eligible States and territories have requested funding. One hundred percent of these funds have been committed to the States. As of yesterday, 90 percent of the funds have been disbursed to the States. This is pretty remarkable considering that the fiscal year 2018 omnibus was signed into law just 4 months ago.  I have asked what the funding was used for. I am told it has assisted States in improving election cyber security. They have replaced outdated election equipment. They have undertaken other anti-cyber efforts.  That is an important first step. I know all of us do not want our democracy attacked by foreign aggression. More is needed. It is certainly needed before the November 2018 elections--I might say even afterward.  States need postelection audit systems. They have to be able to verify the accuracy of the final vote tally. They have to be able to upgrade election-related computer systems if our Department of Homeland Security identifies vulnerabilities. I believe the State and local election officials should undergo cyber security training. They should start using established cyber security best practices. These efforts are all essential to the security of our elections, and my amendment would enable them to go forward. In fact, yesterday, 21 State attorneys general signed a letter. They urged Congress to appropriate more funding for the States to help them meet their security needs.  Let me quote from their letter. They said:       Additional funding for voter infrastructure will not only      allow states to upgrade the election systems, but will also      allow for a comprehensive security risk assessment.      Unfortunately, past practice has shown that the existing      Election Assistance Commission grants are simply insufficient      to provide for the upgraded technology needed. More funding      is essential to adequately equip states for the financial      resources we need to safeguard our democracy and protect the      data of voting members in our states.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the conclusion of my remarks, a letter, dated July 23, 2018, signed by 21 State attorneys general.  Mr. President, it is clear that Congress--this involves everybody in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike--must serve as a bulwark against Russian aggression. I say this because our President has, time and again, proven he is either unable or unwilling to do so. Standing on the world stage with Vladimir Putin, with everybody watching, President Trump repeatedly refused to condemn Russia's attacks on our democracy. He almost groveled to the authoritarian Putin. He praised and defended Putin's ``strong denial'' of Russian interference. Then, to make it worse, President Trump attacked our own law enforcement institutions while standing feet away from the very foe our institutions work so hard to protect us from.  All of our intelligence communities and law enforcement have the swornduty to protect all Americans from foes like Russia. The President stands next to the President of Russia and attacks the same law enforcement institutions that protect us.  This brought about, not unexpectedly, bipartisan outrage over the Helsinki fiasco. The next day, the President tried to walk back his comments. But in typical fashion, he tried to have it both ways. He repeated the baseless claim that the attack ``could be other people also.'' Then, the very next day, when asked whether Russia is still targeting the United States, the President inexplicably said, ``No.'' That was roughly 48 hours after his own Director of National Intelligence issued a statement reaffirming that Russia is engaged in ``ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.'' Without going into any of the classified material--just go by what our intelligence agencies have said publicly. Russia is engaged in ``ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.'' And when the President is asked whether they are targeting the United States, the answer isn't no, it is yes.  Some have argued that this is an issue for the States to deal with entirely on their own, that the Federal Government should not involve itself in States' electoral systems. But our States were attacked in 2016 by a foreign adversary, and their election systems were hacked by Russia's foreign military intelligence service.  If any one of our States was attacked by a foreign government, would we stand by and say: Well, that is the State's problem. No. We wouldn't say: Well, it is not my State, it is not my problem. You are on your own. Of course not. An attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us. We are the United States of America. We would come together to protect that State. We would provide the Federal resources to help them out. That is what we Americans do. The same standard applies here in helping States strengthen and protect their election infrastructure.  We Senators from both parties have a choice: We either heed the fact-based warnings of our dedicated law enforcement and national security professionals or we do as President Trump has done and say: Well, we will take Vladimir Putin at his word. I don't. We either choose to act as a coequal branch of government to defend our democracy or leave that responsibility to a President who doesn't see the threat. In fact, he embraces the threat even when it is standing right beside him.  I say to my fellow Senators, if you believe that Russia is fully intent on destabilizing our democracy yet again in November, which is something every one of our national security and law enforcement officials believes--the people who read all the classified matters every single day, the people who know our intelligence backward and forward believe Russia is fully intent on destabilizing our democracy--let's stand up for our country. Let's stand up for our intelligence services and have this amendment as a chance to take action--more than anything else, to stand up for America, stand up for our democracy.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              State of New Mexico,                               Office of the Attorney General,                                      Santa Fe, NM, July 23, 2018.     Chairman Michael McCaul,     House Homeland Security Committee,     Washington, DC.     Chairman Roy Blunt,     Senate Rules and Administration Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Honorable Committee Members: The undersigned Attorneys      General write to express our grave concern over the threat to      the integrity of the American election system. As the latest      investigations and indictments make clear, during the 2016      election, hackers within Russia's military intelligence      service not only targeted state and local election boards,      but also successfully invaded a state election website to      steal the sensitive information of approximately 500,000      American voters and infiltrated a company that supplies      voting software across the United States.       The allegations in these indictments are extremely      troubling. They evidence technologically vulnerable election      infrastructures and the existence of a malicious foreign      actor eager to exploit these vulnerabilities. Moreover, it      has never been more important to maintain confidence in our      democratic voting process. It is imperative that we protect      the integrity of our elections. We must ensure that the      upcoming 2018 midterm elections are secure and untainted.      Accordingly, we ask for your assistance in shoring up our      systems so that we may protect our elections from foreign      attacks and interference by:       Prioritizing and acting on election-security legislation.      We understand that the Secure Elections Act (S.2261) is      before the Senate at this time and may address some of our      concerns.       Increasing funding for the Election Assistance Commission      to support election security improvements at the state level      and to protect the personal data of the voters of our states.      We are concerned that many states lack the resources and      tools they need to protect the polls. Additional funding for      voting infrastructure will not only allow states to upgrade      election systems, but will also allow for a comprehensive      security risk assessment. Unfortunately, past practice has      shown that the existing Election Assistance Commission grants      are simply insufficient to provide for the upgraded      technology needed. More funding is essential to adequately      equip states with the financial resources we need to      safeguard our democracy and protect the data of voting      members in our states.       Supporting the development of cybersecurity standards for      voting systems to prevent potential future foreign attacks.      It is critical that there be a combined effort between      governments and security experts to protect against the      increased cyber threats posed by foreign entities seeking to      weaken our institutions.       These changes are essential in order to strengthen public      trust in our electoral system. The integrity of the nation's      voting infrastructure is a bipartisan issue, and one that      affects not only the national political landscape, but      elections at the state, county, municipal, and local levels.      It is our hope that you agree, and will take swift action to      protect our national legacy of fair and free elections.           Respectfully,         Hector Balderas, Attorney General of New Mexico; George            Jepsen, Attorney General of Connecticut; Karl Racine,            Attorney General for the District of Columbia; Lisa            Madigan, Attorney General of Illinois; Janet Mills,            Attorney General of Maine; Maura Healy, Attorney            General of Massachusetts; Lori Swanson, Attorney            General of Minnesota; Gurbir Grewal, Attorney General            of New Jersey; Josh Stein, Attorney General of North            Carolina; Peter F.
