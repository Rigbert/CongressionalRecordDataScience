Some would say that George's just flat is the heart of downtown Peoria.  Located across the street from the Peoria County Courthouse and kitty-corner from the world headquarters of the Caterpillar Incorporated, George's shoe shine parlor brings together people from all walks of life.  Among his customers are the judges, lawyers, police, politicians and other courthouse regulars; business leaders; celebrities; and other folks who appreciate the importance of caring for leather and looking your best.  They come in, sit down in one of George's nine shoe shine chairs with their shoes scuffed and dirty and five or six minutes later, they stand up with their shoes polished to a mirror finish, looking like new money. It's like the old 1950 song by Harry Stone and Jack Stapp, Chattanooga Shoe Shine Boy:     He makes the oldest kinda' leather look like new     You feel as though you want to dance when he gets through.  And it only costs $3 a shine--the same price George has been charging for over 15 years.  George Manias is a master of an almost lost art. He is a shoeshine professional. He wears a white dress shirt and a bow tie every day.  A lot of shoeshine men nowadays apply the polish with a cloth. Not George. He's old school. He massages the polish into your shoes with his bare hands. He explains: The polish gets into the leather better that way. Then he buffs and shines and the next thing you know, your shoes look better than when you bought them.  Let me tell George's story. It is a great American story. George Manias was born in Peoria 75 years ago, the son of proud Greek immigrants, and he speaks with the accent of his parents' homeland. That's because, when he was 3 or 4 years old, his parents took the family back to Crete, to see George's grandfather, who was very ill.  While the family was in Crete, the Nazis invaded and George's father was taken prisoner.  In 1945, when the war ended, the Manias family was finally able to return to Peoria. They were practically penniless. Everyone had to work to support the family. George had to learn to speak English.  At 14, he started shining shoes at the old Paris Shoe Shine Parlor on Main Street, next to the Palace Theater. He charged 20 cents a shine.  Within a year, he had saved enough money to buy his own chair. He became an entrepreneur, working out of Ed and Roy Gibbs' Barber Shop.  In 1956, he opened his own 12-seat shoe shine parlor in the Old Niagara Building.  Over the years, George has had four different shops. The last three were all torn down to make way for bigger, taller buildings. He moved to his current location almost 20 years ago.  Today, a professional shoeshine might seem like a minor indulgence. But back when George started, a mandidn't feel properly dressed without a hat and a shoe shine.  It was a time, as Arthur Miller's legendary Willie Loman said in Death of a Salesman, when we were all salesmen, getting along with a shoe shine and a smile. For many men, the shine was a weekly ritual.  Back in the day, you could walk into George's and all nine chairs would be occupied with customers--wingtips, next to oxfords, next to loafers--and George would be polishing all nine pair at once. It was like an assembly line, but there was nothing automated about it.  At one point, he had four men working for him and he still worked 14- and 16-hour days, seven days a week.  He didn't take a vacation for 29 years, until 1975, when he went back to Greece for two weeks with his mother, brother and sister. After that, he didn't take another vacation for 25 years.  He's been to Greece twice in the last three years to visit relatives. He says he might take a vacation again someday--but only with family.  Work and family. Those are the things that matter to George Manias: His sister Angie owns a small candy-and-nuts shop in Peoria, and his brother Manny is a private detective who used to be the deputy sheriff in Peoria County.  In 1996, his widowed mother suffered a serious stroke that left her paralyzed. The siblings cared for her at home for the last 4 years of her life.  Customers come to George's for more than just the spit-polish shines. They come to chat and to learn what's happening in town.  Mike McCuskey, a federal judge, has been a loyal customer for years. He calls George's shoe shine parlor pure Americana and vintage Peoria.  You never know who you'll see there. One day, McCusky said, he looked over at the man in the chair next to him and blurted out, You're Gayle Sayers, aren't you? That was when the Hall of Famer was still playing for the Chicago Bears.  Over the years, George's Shoe Shine and Hattery--its official name--has grown from a small business to a legend. It has been featured in local newspapers, radio and TV; in the Washington Times and the Associated Press; on the Today Show; and on the front page of USA Today--twice.  The walls are covered with news clippings and photographs of famous people who have dropped in for a shine: President Gerald Ford, during the 1976 presidential campaign; President Ronald Reagan in 1982; Everett Dirksen, the Minority Leader of the U.S. Senate when LBJ was President; Former House Minority Leader Bob Michel; Congressman Ray LaHood; Former Illinois governors Bob Edgar and Richard Ogilvie; Peoria Mayor Jim Ardis and a string of his predecessors; Barack Obama. Even my photograph is there. Democrats and Republicans. In 2004, Congressman LaHood brought in then-CIA director George Tenet, a Greek-American, who was in Peoria to give a speech. The two Georges chatted in Greek. There are photos of movie stars and singers. And judges--lots of judges.  But you don't have to be famous to feel welcome. George makes everyone in Peoria feel special. It doesn't matter if you're a well-known politician or if the $3 you spend on that shoe shine is the only $3 you have, George makes you feel special.  Another reason people go to George's is because he listens to everything, and he knows everything that's going on in the local Republican and Democratic parties, and in the Peoria business community.  Says Judge McCuskey: It's like that Merrill Lynch commercial. When George speaks, you want to listen. And sometimes when you speak, George looks up at you with the slightest smile, and you never know if he's smiling because he knows something you don't know--or because you've just given him another piece of a puzzle he didn't have. He's the keeper of the secrets.  On Judge McCuskey's desk in the federal courthouse in Urbana sits a small scale of justice, a symbol that traces its origins to ancient Greece. It's a treasured gift that George Manias brought back from a trip to Greece.  Across Peoria and far beyond, countless other people have been blessed with gifts from George, not the least of which is a perfect shine and the dignity of being treated with respect no matter who you are.  George Manias is a quintessential American in a quintessentially American city, and I am proud to join the city of Peoria in honoring him on his 60 years as a successful entrepreneur.                          ____________________[Pages S11311-S11312]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE MANIAS
