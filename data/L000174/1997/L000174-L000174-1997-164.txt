President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997. This bill would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and remove a significant hurdle in the Government's ability to bring criminal charges in certain cases of willful copyright infringement. By insuring better protection of the creative works available online, this bill will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and our national information infrastructure.  This bill reflects the recommendations and hard work of the Department of Justice, which worked with me to introduce a version of this legislation in the 104th Congress. I want to commend the Department for recognizing the need for action on this important problem. This bill was noted with approval in the September, 1995 ``Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights,'' chaired by Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and has been cited by the Business Software Alliance as one of its major legislative priorities.  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law a defendant's willful copyright infringement must be ``for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.'' Not-for-profit or noncommercial copyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no matter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. This bill would close this loophole.  United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that case, an MIT student set up computer bulletin board systems on the Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 million over a 6-week period. Since the student apparently did not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. The district court described the student's conduct ``at best * * * as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.''  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because it viewed copyright law as the exclusive remedy for protecting intellectual property rights. The Court expressly invited Congress to revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach      to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software      even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer.      One can envision ways that the copyright law could be      modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the      legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and      ordain its punishment.''  This bill would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful copyright infringements in the following ways: First, serious acts of willful copyright infringement that result in multiple copies over a limited time period and cause significant loss to the copyright holders, would be subject to criminal prosecution.  The bill would add a new offense prohibiting willful copyright infringement by reproduction or distributing, including by electronic means, during a 180-day period of 10 or more copies of 1 or more copyrighted works when the total retail value of the copyrighted work or the total retail value of the copies of such work is $5,000 or more. The bill makes clear that to meet the monetary threshold either the infringing copies or the copyrighted works must have a total retail value of $5,000 or more. The penalty would be a misdemeanor if the total retail value of the infringed or infringing works is between $5,000 and $10,000, and up to 3 years' imprisonment if the total retail value is $10,000 or more.  By contrast, the penalties proposed for for-profit infringement are much stiffer. Specifically, under the existing 17 U.S.C. section 506(a)(1), for-profit infringements in which the retail value of the infringing works is less than $2,500, would constitute a misdemeanor; and, if the retail value of the infringing works is $2,500 or more, the penalty is up to 5 years' imprisonment. As discussed below, this bill would change the monetary threshold amount for felony liability under section 506(a)(1) from $2,500 to $5,000.  The monetary, time period and number of copies thresholds for the new offense, under 17 U.S.C. section 506(a)(2), for not-for-profit infringements, combined with the scienter requirement, would insure that criminal charges would only apply to willful infringements, not merely casual or careless conduct, that result in a significant level of harm to the copyright holder's rights. De minimis, not-for-profit violations, including making a single pirated copy or distributing pirated copies of works worth less than a total of $5,000, would not be subject to criminal prosecution.  This bill would require that at least 10 or more copies of the infringed work be made, which is a quantity requirement that was not present for the new not-for-profit infringement offense in the version of the bill introduced in the 104th Congress. Thus, it would not be a crime under the bill to make a single copy of a copyrighted work, even if that work were very valuable and worth over $10,000. Such valuable intellectual property, whether or not copyrighted, that is stolen could be protected under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, if it is a trade secret, or under the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, which Senator Kyl and I sponsored, if the means used to complete the theft involved unauthorized computer access.  Second, the bill would increase the monetary threshold for the existing criminal copyright offense, which makes it a misdemeanor to commit any willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain, and a felony if 10 or more copies of works with a retail value of over $2,500 are made during a 180-day period. The bill would increase the monetary threshold in this offense from $2,500 to $5,000 for felony liability.  Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony criminal copyright offense. Under existing law, repeat offenders who commit a second or subsequent offense of copyright infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain are subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years. The bill would also double the term of imprisonment from 3 years to 6 years for a repeat offense for noncommercial copyright infringement. Such a calibration of penalties takes an important step in ensuring adequate deterrence of repeated willful copyright infringements.  Fourth, the bill would extend the statute of limitations for criminal copyright infringement actions from 3 to 5 years, which is the norm for violations of criminal laws under title 18, including those protecting intellectual property.  Finally, the bill would strengthen victims' rights by giving victimized copyright holders the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement to the sentencing court. In addition, the bill would direct the Sentencing Commission to set sufficiently stringent sentencing guideline ranges for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses to deter these crimes.  Technological developments and the emergence of the national information infrastructure in this country and the global information infrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise and present significant challenges for protecting creative works. Increasing accessibility and affordability of information and entertainment services are important goals that oftentimes require prudent balancing of public and private interests. In the area of creative rights, that balance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while encouraging its public availability.  The Copyright Act is grounded in the copyright clause of the Constitution and assures that ``contributors to the store of knowledge [receive] a fair return for their labors.'' Harper & Row ``The Nation Enterprises'', 471 U.S. 539, 546 (1985). I am mindful, however, that when we exercise our power to make criminal certain forms of copyright infringement, we should act with ``exceeding caution'' to protect the public's first amendment interest in the dissemination of ideas. Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 221 (1985). I look forward to continuing to work with interested parties to make any necessary refinements to this bill to insure that we have struck the appropriate balance.  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be placed in the Record together with the bill and a sectional summary.  There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1044       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(g) Directive to Sentencing Commission.--       (1) In general.--Under the authority of the Sentencing      Reform Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-473; 98 Stat. 1987) and      section 21 of the Sentencing Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-182;      101 Stat. 1271; 18 U.S.C. 994 note) (including the authority      to amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements),      the United States Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the      applicable guideline range for a defendant convicted of a      crime against intellectual property (including offenses set      forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and      sections 2319, 2319A and 2320 of title 18, United States      Code)--       (A) is sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime;       (B) adequately reflects the additional considerations set      forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and       (C) takes into account more than minimal planning and other      aggravating factors.       (2) Implementation.--In implementing paragraph (1), the      Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the guidelines      provide for consideration of the retail value of the      legitimate items that are infringed upon and the quantity of      items so infringed.                                  ____          Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997--Summary       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``Criminal      Copyright Improvement Act of 1997.''       Sec. 2. Criminal Infringement of Copyrights. As outlined      below, the bill adds a new definition for ``financial gain''      to 17 U.S.C. Sec.  101, and amends the criminal copyright      infringement provisions in titles 17 and 18. The bill also      ensures that victims of criminal copyright infringement have      an opportunity to provide victim impact statements to the      court about the impact of the offense. Finally, the bill      directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that guideline      ranges are sufficiently stringent to deter criminal      infringement of intellectual property rights, and provide for      consideration of the retail value and quantity of the      legitimate, infringed-upon items and other aggravating      factors.       (a) Definition of Financial Gain. Current copyright law      provides criminal penalties when a copyright is willfully      infringed for purposes of ``commercial advantage or private      financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of      ``financial gain'' to the copyright law, 17 U.S.C. Sec.  101,      and clarify that this term means the ``receipt of anything of      value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.''      This definition would make clear that ``financial gain''      includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software.       (b) Criminal Offenses. The requirement in criminal      copyright infringement actions under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)      that the defendant's willful copyright infringement be ``for      purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,''      has allowed serious incidents of copyright infringement to      escape successful criminal prosecution.       For example, in United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp.      535 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendant allegedly solicited users      of a computer bulletin board system on the Internet to submit      copies of copyrighted software programs for posting on the      system, and then encouraged users to download copies of the      illegally copied programs, resulting in an estimated loss of      revenue to the copyright holders of over one million dollars      over a six week period. Absent evidence of ``commercial      advantage or private financial gain,'' the defendant was      charged with conspiracy to violate the wire fraud statute, 18      U.S.C. Sec.  1343. The district court described the      defendant's conduct as ``heedlessly irresponsible, and at      worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any      fundamental sense of values,'' but nevertheless dismissed the      indictment on the grounds that acts of copyright infringement      may not be prosecuted under the wire fraud statute.       The bill would add a new criminal copyright violation to      close this loophole in circumstances where no commercial      advantage or private financial gain may be shown. New section      17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2) would prohibit willfully infringing      a copyright by reproducing or distributing, including by      electronic means, during any 180-day period, 10 or more      copies of 1 or more copyrighted works when the total retail      value of the copyrighted works or of the copies of such works      is $5,000 or more. The penalty would be a misdemeanor if the      total retail value of the infringed or infringing works is      between $5,000 and $10,000, and up to 3 years' imprisonment      if the total retail value is $10,000 or more.       Not-for-profit willful infringement would thus be subject      to similar threshold requirements as for a felony offense of      willful infringement for commercial advantage or private      financial gain under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1), which      requires that 10 or more copies of copyrighted works with a      total retail value of more than $5000 be made during a 180-     day period. The penalties applicable to an offense under 17      U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1) are more stringent than for the new      offense under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2). Specifically, under      17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(1), if the retail value of the      infringing works is less than $5,000, the penalty is a      misdemeanor; and, if the retail value of the infringing works      is $5,000 or more, the penalty is up to 5 years'      imprisonment.       The monetary, timing, and number of copies prerequisites      for the new offense under 17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2), combined      with the scienter requirement, insure that merely casual or      careless conduct resulting in distribution of only a few      infringing copies would not be subject to criminal      prosecution. In other words, criminal charges would only      apply to not-for-profit willful infringements of 10 or more      copies during a limited time period resulting in a      significant level of harm of over $5,000 to the copyright      holder's rights. De minimis violations would not be subject      to criminal prosecution.       The offenses under Sec.  506(a)(1) and (a)(2) would      overlap. For example, someone selling 10 or more copies of a      copyrighted work during a 180-day period may violate both      provisions if the value of those copyrighted works is $5,000      or more. The key, however, is that the new provision in Sec.       506(a)(2) requires that the infringement involve, at a      minimum, harm in the amount of $5,000. By contrast, any      offense, regardless of value, involving private financial      gain or commercial advantage constitutes at least a      misdemeanor, and the crime reaches felony level under the      bill once the retail value of the copyrighted or infringing      material exceeds $5,000.       The new crime would also require that at least 10 or      more copies of the infringed work be made. It would not be      a crime under the bill to make a single copy of a      copyrighted work, even if it were very valuable and worth      over $10,000. Such valuable intellectual property, whether      or not copyrighted,     that is stolen could be protected under the Economic      Espionage Act of 1996 (if it is a trade secret), or under      the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of      1996, if the means used to complete the theft involved      unauthorized computer access.       (c) Limitation on Criminal Procedures. The bill would amend      17 U.S.C. Sec.  507(a) to extend the statute of limitations      for criminal copyright infringement actions from three to      five years. A five year statute of limitations is the norm      for violations of criminal laws under Title 18, including      those that relate to protecting intellectual property. See,      e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2319A (Unauthorized fixation of and      Trafficking in sound recordings) and Sec.  2320 (Trafficking      in counterfeit goods or services).       (d) Criminal Infringement of a Copyright. The bill would      amend the penalty provisions in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2319 to      comport with the proposed amendments to 17 U.S.C. Sec.       506(a), and would also add a new subsection providing for a      victim impact statement.       First, under current law, willful copyright infringement      for commercial advantage or private financial gain is a      felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment only when      the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution      during a 180-day period of ten or more copies with a retail      value of over $2500. Willful infringements for commercial      advantage, which do not satisfy the monetary threshold or      quantity requirement during the statutory time period, are      misdemeanor offenses. The bill would modify the felony      penalty provision for willful copyright infringement for      commercial advantage or private financial gain to cover      reproductions or distributions ``including by electronic      means''. The bill would also change the monetary threshold      from $2,500 to $5,000.       Second, the bill would provide a new penalty in 18 U.S.C.      Sec.  2319(c) for the new offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec.       506(a)(2) of willfully infringing a copyright by reproduction      or distribution, including by electronic means, during a 180-     day period of 10 or more copies of copyright works when the      total retail value of the copyrighted work or of the copies      of such work is $5,000 or more. Violations would be      punishable by up to 1 year imprisonment and fine if the total      retail value of the infringed or infringing works is between      $5,000 and $10,000, and by up to 3 years' imprisonment and a      fine if the total retail value is $10,000 or more.       The penalty structure under the bill is as follows:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Infringed work values--            Under $5,000           $5,000 to $10,000             Over $10,000----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Willful infringement for            Misdemeanor..........  FELONY (up to 5 years), if  FELONY (up to 5 years), commercial advantage/private                               10 or more copies within    if 10 or more copies financial gain [17 U.S.C. Sec.                             180-day period.             within 180-day period. 506(a)(1)].Willful infringement by             No criminal liability  Misdemeanor, if 10 or more  FELONY (up to 3 years), reproduction or distribution of                            copies within 180-day       if 10 or more copies works with value over $10,000 for                          period.                     within 180-day period. any reason [17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(2)].----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly      recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony offense      under new 18 U.S.C. 2319(c), which refers to new 17 U.S.C.      Sec.  506(a)(2). Under existing law, 18 U.S.C. 2319(b)(2),      recidivists are subject to up to ten years' imprisonment and      a fine for a second felony offense for willful copyright      infringement for commercial advantage or private financial      gain. The bill would double the penalty to up to six years'      imprisonment and a fine for a second felony offense under new      17 U.S.C. Sec.  506(a)(2) for not-for-profit willful      copyright infringement.       Finally, the bill would add new subsection Sec.  2319(d),      requiring that victims of the offense, including producers      and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services,      holders of intellectual property rights and their legal      representatives, be given the opportunity to provide a victim      impact statement to the probation officer preparing the      presentence report. The bill directs that the statement      identify the victim of the offense and the extent and scope      of the injury and loss suffered, including the estimated      economic impact of the offense on that victim.       (e) Unauthorized Fixation and Trafficking of Live Musical      Performances. The bill would add new subsection 18 U.S.C.      Sec.  2319A(d) requiring that victims of the offense,      including producers and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon      goods or services, holders of intellectual property rights      and their legal representatives, be given the opportunity to      provide a victim impact statement to the probation officer      preparing the presentence report. The bill directs that the      statement identify the victim of the offense and the extent      and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the      estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.       (f) Trafficking in Counterfeit Goods or Services. The bill      would add new subsection 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2320(e) requiring      that victims of the offense, including producers and sellers      of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services, holders of      intellectual property rights and their legal representatives,      be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement      to the probation officer preparing the presentence report.      The bill directs that the statement identify the victim of      the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss      suffered, including the estimated economic impact of the      offense on that victim.       (g) Directive to Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing      Commission currently takes the view that criminal copyright      infringement and trademark counterfeiting are analogous to      fraud-related offenses, and that appropriate sentences are to      be calculated according to the retail value of the infringing      items, rather than of the legitimate copyrighted items which      are infringed. This may understate the harm. The bill would      direct the Sentencing Commission to ensure that applicable      guideline ranges for criminal copyright infringement and      violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2319, 2319A and 2320 are      sufficiently stringent to deter such crimes, provide for      consideration of the retail value and quantity of the      legitimate, infringed-upon items, and take into account more      than minimal planning and other aggravating factors.                                 ______                                       By
