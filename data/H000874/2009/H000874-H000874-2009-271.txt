 I have discussed this matter with the chairmen of both committees. Certainly they will have the opportunity. Whether they will avail themselves of that opportunity I can't say at this point in time. What I mean by that is that there are clearly concerns that both committees have and have been expressed. But whether or not they're going to actually go to a markup of the bill or try to perfect it in other ways on the floor or in working with the Energy and Commerce Committee I don't think has been decided by either committee at this point in time.
