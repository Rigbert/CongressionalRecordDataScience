Carl Fisher, longtime superintendent of the Portage Parks Department. After serving the people of Portage, IN, in this capacity for the past 24 years, Carl announced his retirement from this position. In honor of Carl, a retirement party will be held by friends and members of his staff on Friday, March 14, 2008, at Sycamore Hall of Woodland Park in Portage, IN.  Following his graduation in 1964 from Grace College in Winona Lake, IN, Carl, an avid nature enthusiast, eventually went on to pursue his master's degree in recreation park administration at Indiana University. After completing his master's degree in 1975, he was hired as the district recreation supervisor for the Montgomery County Recreation and Parks Department. Carl held this position until 1977, at which time he took over as the park supervisor for the Goshen Park and Recreation Department. Carl remained in this capacity until 1983 before relocating to Northwest Indiana, where he took over as superintendent of the Portage Parks Department, a position he would faithfully serve for the next 24 years.  Since taking over at the Portage Parks Department, Carl's contributions to Northwest Indiana have stretched far beyond his everyday responsibilities as superintendent. It was in large part through his efforts that the Portage Township Community Historical Society was created. This led to the acquisition and development of Countryside Park as a historical attraction for the City of Portage.  In addition, Carl's vision and constant efforts to improving outdoor recreation, and more specifically, trail development, in Northwest Indiana have been unparalleled. Carl was a catalyst in the formation of the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission's Regional Bikeways Committee, which would later become the Ped and Pedal Committee. Under his vision and leadership, which includes the establishment of the Portage Parks and Recreation Foundation, Northwest Indiana has seen a vast increase in acreage and funding obtained for the development of its parks and trails. Astonishingly, during Carl's tenure as superintendent, Portage has seen the establishment of 11 parks and 2 city-wide trails.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Carl Fisher for his lifetime of leadership, service, and dedication to the residents of Portage, IN. He has touched the lives of many residents and visitors in Northwest Indiana. While we will all miss Carl's true service and uncompromising dedication, I ask that you join me in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
