 President, I rise to speak on behalf of a fallen soldier. On October 23, 2007, SGT Edward O. Philpot of Manchester, KY, was on patrol with U.S. soldiers and members of the Afghan National Army in Kandahar, Afghanistan, conducting tactical convoy operations in hostile territory. Sergeant Philpot was killed in a tragic humvee rollover accident. He was 38 years old.  Sergeant Philpot handled a number of jobs in his unit, from gunner to driver to humvee commander. He was proud to wear the uniform and proud to serve his country.  ``Ed had found his calling with the military,'' says Renee Crockett, his sister. ``He loved being a soldier and felt he was finally doing exactly what he was supposed to do.''  For his bravery in uniform, Sergeant Philpot received numerous medals and awards, including the Bronze Star Medal.  Military service ran in Ed's family, as his Uncle Willard Philpot of Manchester served in Vietnam and, sadly, perished in Thailand. Family members saw a lot of similarities between Ed and his uncle, who died before Ed was born. ``Both were quiet, warm, and caring individuals, and both gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country,'' says Renee.  Raised by his parents, Ottas and Willa Philpot, Ed grew up a student of history. He soon amassed a personal library of books on many historical figures. He was also a fan of mystery books, and enjoyed a sharp political debate.  Ed was born in Farmington, MI, and grew up in that State. As a child, he spent all his holidays and most of his summers in Kentucky, in Manchester, with his paternal grandparents Walter and Lillie Philpot, and would travel back and forth often between Kentucky and Michigan.  When Ed was only 8 or 9 years old, he began to learn how to play the saxophone. One day he took out his horn to practice and found a perfect audience in Sandy, the family dog, sitting on the patio. Young Ed began playing with all the charisma and passion he could muster, but it wasn't good enough for Sandy, who ran all the way to the backyard and buried her head beneath her paws. Thus ended Ed's musical career.  Ed graduated from Garden City High School in Garden City, MI, in 1987 and Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SC, in 1992. After college, Ed returned to Manchester, where he spent some of the happiest times of his youth.  Ed went into law enforcement, becoming the director of a home incarceration program. In 1995, he married Stephanie, and they raised three beautiful daughters, Hollen, Lily, and Ella Grace. Eventually, Ed and his family settled in South Carolina.  Ed's family was the most important thing to him. ``He would take his daughters out to the coffee shop for cookies on Saturday mornings,'' his sister Renee said. Ed loved to take walks with them and ride them on his shoulders. He would also take them for daddy-daughter dates to celebrate their accomplishments.  Sergeant Philpot's family ``was clearly his life and his motivation,'' says MAJ Bill Connor, who served with him in Afghanistan. ``He spent his little bit of off-duty time going to the nearest bazaar to buy trinkets for his daughters and his family.''  Ed enlisted in 2001 and served with the South Carolina Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 263rd Armor Regiment in Afghanistan, where he was promoted to sergeant. He enjoyed the simple pleasure of giving candy to Afghan children.  ``He was one of the most dedicated men you would ever see,'' said SGT Kenneth Page, who served alongside Sergeant Philpot. ``He always liked to hang around at the armory, even when it wasn't drill weekend. He just liked to be there.''  The Philpot family is in my prayers today as I recount Ed's story. We are thinking of his wife Stephanie; his daughters Hollen, Lily, and Ella Grace; his father Ottas; his mother Willa; his sister Renee Crockett; his nephew Trevor Crockett; his niece Taylor Crockett; and many other beloved family members and friends.  Ed was predeceased by his grandparents Walter and Lillie Philpot and Tom and Viola Hollen, all of Manchester.  His funeral service was held October 30 last year in Manchester at the Horse Creek Baptist Church. After the service, the funeral procession stopped for a moment of silence in front of Hacker Elementary School, where the entire student body and staff assembled outside. Ed's parents had both attended Hacker Elementary as children.  Thirty-eight young students each held a red, white, or blue balloon, one for each year of Ed's life. At the same moment, they released the balloons up into the air. The rest of the students held up American flags, in honor of the soldier who had given his life for that same flag.  ``Ed was always quick with a smile and a positive attitude that was remembered by all,'' says his sister Renee. ``He is definitely a hero.''  I want the Philpot family to know that this Senate agrees, and today we honor SGT Edward O. Philpot's life of honor and of service. His immense sacrifice made on behalf of his Nation, State, and family allows us all to live in freedom.                 Important Mile Marker in War on Terror  Mr. President, an important mile marker in the war on terror was passed late Tuesday night. A terrorist by the name of Imad Mugniyah, one of the world's most wanted murderers and a top commander of Hezbollah, was killed in Damascus. With his death, long-delayed justice has finally been served.  News reports are still coming in, and so far no one has claimed responsibility for his death. But we know one thing for certain: As Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the State Department put it, ``The world is a better place without this man in it.''  Let me describe for my colleagues just a few of this murderer's many heinous crimes. American officials accuse him of plotting the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine compound in Beirut, killing 241 troops.  He is accused of masterminding a car bomb which exploded at an American embassy in Beirut, also in 1983, killing 63 people.  American prosecutors charged him in the hijacking of a TWA jetliner in 1985. He is also accused of shipping arms to violent, radical terrorist groups.  And then there is one brutal act that struck deep in the heart of my hometown of Louisville, KY. Imad Mugniyah was behind the brutal kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Marine COL William Richard Higgins.  Colonel Higgins was a Kentuckian, born in Danville. He graduated from Southern High School in Louisville, participated in ROTC at Miami University in Ohio, and served multiple tours in Vietnam.  Over a 20-year military career, he received numerous medals and awards, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with combat ``V'' and the Purple Heart.  On February 17, 1988, Colonel Higgins was captured by armed terrorists in Lebanon while serving on a U.N. peacekeeping mission. He was held, interrogated and tortured.  A year and a half after his capture, terrorists released a grisly videotape of Colonel Higgins's lifeless body, hung by the neck, which played on television sets around the world.  In Louisville, we built a memorial to Colonel Higgins on the grounds of his alma mater, Southern High School.  We were outraged then and we are still outraged now to see what happened to this good and brave man at the hands of thugs.  Now, at long last, we know justice has been brought to his murderers.  In an essay titled ``My Credo,'' Colonel Higgins once wrote: ``As an officer of Marines, I believe it is my charge to set the example.''  Well, Colonel, the high-school students in Louisville who pass by your memorial every day will always remember the example you set. You served your country with pride, and now may rest in peace.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
