 President, I rise today to recognize the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group.  Founded by David Packard in 1978, the Leadership Group has worked tirelessly to improve the economic health and quality of life in Silicon Valley. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group--and its Chief Executive Officer Carl Guardino--on many issues important to the San Francisco Bay Area.  For instance, the Leadership Group has been an indispensable partner in efforts to restore the San Francisco Bay and its critical wetlands. Just last year, they helped secure $500 million for those restoration efforts. The Leadership Group was integral in establishing a permanent U.S. Patent and Trademark office in San Jose. That office now supports the creativity and innovation that made Silicon Valley the global leader of the digital revolution. Most recently, the Leadership Group was a driving force in developing transportation improvements in Silicon Valley--including the electrification of the Caltrain system that will cut travel times and improve air quality for countless Californians.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to recognize the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and its contributions to Silicon Valley, the state of California and our national economy.  Thank you.                          ____________________
