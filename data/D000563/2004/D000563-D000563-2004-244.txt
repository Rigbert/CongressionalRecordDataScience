 I recall during the course of that debate--and I will ask the Senator if my recollection is correct--that the Senator said, when we were asked to vote for this amendment, we were really trying to establish the same type of standard we used in every war when some individuals and some companies exploited the situation in a war to make an illegal profit. We do not want that to occur. It is not the fair to the taxpayers, it is not fair to the soldiers, it is not fair to America, and they should be held criminally accountable.  I ask the Senator from Vermont, if this amendment passed so overwhelmingly before, why is there any hesitation today to take this Harry Truman precedent and say those who misuse a war, where American lives are at stake, and profiteer should be held criminally liable for their misconduct?
