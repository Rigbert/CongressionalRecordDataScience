Speaker, this motion unlocks the Canadian tar sands and allows that crude oil to come down to the U.S. I spoke to the Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. just a couple of hours ago. They are producing a million and a half barrels a day of this, and they're going to 4 million barrels a day. They're going to do this with us or without us. Wouldn't you rather have this crude come to the U.S. rather than go to China?  This will actually reduce greenhouse gases because you won't have to transport it to China.  This is a good amendment.
