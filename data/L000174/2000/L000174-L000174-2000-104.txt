President, the House of Representatives has, again, thwarted the will of a bipartisan majority of the Congress.  After strong votes in both the House and Senate to lift sanctions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, the Republican conferees on the Agriculture appropriations bill have added a provision to prohibit public financing which makes it virtually certain that few, if any, sales will actually occur.  It is bad for America's farmers, bad for the people of Cuba, and bad foreign policy.  Even worse, the conferees would codify the restrictions on travel to Cuba, a position which is at odds with the fundamental right of every American to travel freely.  Senator Dodd and I introduced legislation earlier this year that would lift the ban on travel to Cuba. It is ironic--or I should say it is outrageous--that Americans can travel to North Korea, or Syria, or Vietnam, but not Cuba. What a hypocritical, self-defeating, anachronistic policy.  Senator Dodd spoke eloquently last Friday about this misguided provision and I want to associate myself with his remarks. I will not take more time today.  But I want to say that this is a terrible decision, a partisan decision, a decision driven by politics, and one of the many, many reasons why the election on November 7 is so important. It is far past time that we inject some intelligence and bipartisanship into our foreign policy.  This Congress has had its chance. It has fallen short in too many ways to count. This decision on Cuba is just another example of the 106th Congress' failures to do what is right for America, and right for the American people.                          ____________________
