Chairman, our State Water Board is out of control. Our State Water Board is involved in a political operation to remove farming out of the State of California.  This amendment would attempt to put a stop to the reckless State plan and continue the current New Melones operations. This is something we need to act on and act on immediately. We are in crisis.  I am a strong advocate for Mr. Denham's position and, certainly, for his constituents, and I am glad to support this amendment.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, at this time I will make my remarks to close.  This amendment is an attempt to get the Congress involved in undermining a State's rights and its prerogatives.  The Federal Government should be assisting California in ways to restore the State's rivers and recover needed fisheries, instead of trying to interfere with obstruction from Washington. I often hear my colleagues say that Washington should get out of the way. In this case, I totally agree.  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
