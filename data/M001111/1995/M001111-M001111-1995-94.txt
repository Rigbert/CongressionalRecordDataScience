 President, so often we rush through our lives here in the U.S. Senate facing daily issues, debates, constituent concerns and the press of daily business, never pausing to reflect on things outside of Congress; important pieces of the American experience. Every once in a while an event occurs, totally unexpected, which gives you pause to think about truth, meanings, and priorities.  That occurred for me last week when a wonderful family stopped by my office from Washington State: a pair of grandparents, Kenneth and Pat Staley, and their two grandchildren, Jennifer and Ben Knox. They had driven cross-country, 3,000 miles, to visit the Nation's Capitol and for Jennifer, 12, to receive a poetry award.  I asked, as I often do, what they saw here that impressed them most. Jennifer told me that one memorial in particular impressed upon her so deeply that she had written a poem, which she was gracious enough to share with me.  Today I share it with my colleagues because I think it speaks so profoundly as to why we should take the time and money to erect memorials for our Nation's heroes. As you can see from her words, Vietnam veterans, because of their memorial, will never be forgotten. I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The poem follows:                                The Wall       I'll remember the day       I visited the wall       The shiny black wall       Bearing the names       Each name a life, a person, a soul       That died for our country away from home.       The number was staggering, thousands of deaths,       They never came back to the home that they left.       And our tears made a pool so clear and so wide       That proved to the world how much we'd cried.       Time healed the wound but left       A scar, a memory, a reminder.       It is in the hearts of our people.        Forget, we will never.                                 ____________________
