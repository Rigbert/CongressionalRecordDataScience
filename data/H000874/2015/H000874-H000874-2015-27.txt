 Let me just observe to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, that I have great reservations. I want to let the gentleman know that, on this side of the aisle, I think we have great reservations about doing in this short time that we have left any kind of comprehensive tax extender bill, which will adversely impact the possibility of tax reform, which all of us have said we want.  But if we make a major effort on taxes now, particularly making many, many items permanent, some of which I support making permanent, it will have an adverse effect on the ability to do a big tax reform bill, bring corporate rates down, look at preference items, and try to make sure that we have a fiscally responsible piece of legislation.  So I would hope that there is an alternative, obviously, and that is a short-term bill that the Senate has passed and that that would be part of the discussions as a fallback.  I don't know that I am for a larger bill that I have heard about, but I would hope, certainly, that the alternative that the Senate has passed would be an alternative if, in fact, we cannot get agreement on a bigger package so that we will have, at least for last year and the year to come, some certainty with respect to tax consequences of certain actions that private businesses may be taking.  I yield to my friend if he has any comment.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman.  As the gentleman knows, at times, we have philosophical differences. I think the greater certainty we can give to the American public, the more they can keep in their pockets and the stronger the economy is. I do not believe that if we solve tax extenders that that harms us in any way in getting overall tax reform.  But I do look forward to working with you on overall tax reform, and hopefully we can work in the same manner that we were able to on the Visa Waiver Program.
