You are trying to send a message and put the President in a box which has nothing relating to the balanced budget. The question, the fact of the matter is, the balanced budget and bringing to balance within 7 years dealt with a bill that we passed yesterday and that I understand will be coming back from the Senate, the reconciliation bill.                             {time}   0945  That is the bill, as the gentleman must clearly know, on which we will debate this issue as to how to balance the budget, when to balance it, the time frame, and whether Medicare gets cut deeply while tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans are put in place. I do not want to get into partisan debate on those issues at this point in time, but it does not relate to the operations of Government on Monday, this coming week. The gentleman must know that.
