 I want to make certain all vessels transporting oil through the strait of Juan de Fuca or Olympic Coast Marine Sanctuary are properly escorted.  Under my amendment, the Oil Pollution Control Act would be modified to require response plans for such vessels to provide emergency response within at least 6 hours. This would be a vast improvement over the status quo.  However, my State including the Office of Marine Safety, conservation groups, and the Makah Indian nation, would like to see an even shorter response time.  It is my understanding that under this amendment, the State and other parties would have the flexibility to negotiate an arrangement that would ensure a response time of 4 hours or fewer. Specifically, the State would be able to arrange stationing an emergency response tug boat at Neah Bay.  If the State, tribe, and tanker operators agree, the Coast Guard under my amendment, should modify the response plans accordingly.  Does the chairman concur in this interpretation?
