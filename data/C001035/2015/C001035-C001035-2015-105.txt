President, I rise to introduce the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act of 2015. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, in introducing this bipartisan bill.  This bill would change the taxation of awards received by individuals that result from judgments in or settlements of employment discrimination and civil rights cases, and would apply to victims in cases including racial discrimination, sexual discrimination, and whistleblower discrimination. These changes would correct an inequity in current law and are designed to promote the fair and equitable settlement of such claims.  In 2003, I introduced the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act. In 2004, Congress adopted the most important part of that bill, allowing successful plaintiffs in civil rights actions to deduct the portion of their awards covering attorneys' fees from their annual incomes. This provision eliminated the double-taxation of such fees, which are still taxable income to the attorney. Two important provisions from my 2003 bill, which I will describe in a moment, have yet to be addressed, and the bill we introduce today would enact them.  The primary purpose of the bill we are introducing today is to remedy an unintended consequence of a 1996 law, which made damage awards that are not based on ``physical injuries or physical sickness'' part of a plaintiff's taxable income. Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries, this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights.  Our bill would remedy the unfair method of taxation of civil rights victims' settlements and court awards with respect to ``frontpay'' and ``backpay,'' and with respect to the taxation of noneconomic damages. By way of background, I should explain that awards of compensation attributable to the difference between what the employee was paid and the amount he or she should have been paid are known as ``backpay.'' ``Frontpay'' represents the future wages and benefits that would have been paid had the former employee not been terminated or had the employee not been forced to resign.  Our bill contains two important reforms: First, award amounts for frontpay or backpay would continue to be included as taxable income, but would be eligible for income averaging according to the time period covered by the award. This correction would allow individuals to pay taxes at the same marginal rates that would have applied to them had they not suffered discrimination. Income averaging more fairly takes into account the person's financial standing apart from the lump sum of the award.  Second, the bill would also allow plaintiffs to exclude non-economic damages, amounts awarded for pain, suffering or other health effects, from their income, to treat employment and civil rights claims the same as claims that involve a physical injury.  The Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act would encourage the fair settlement of employment discrimination claims. Our legislation would allow both plaintiffs and defendants to settle claims based on the damages suffered, not on the excessive taxes that are now levied--taxation that adds insult to a civil rights victim's injury and serves as a barrier to the just settlement of civil rights claims.  I invite my colleagues to join Senator Cardin and me in support of this bipartisan, common sense legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       National Employment Lawyers                                                  Association,                                               September 16, 2015.     Re: Introduction of the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Employment      Lawyers Association (NELA) we commend and thank you for your      leadership in introducing the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act      of 2015 (CJTFA). Your interest in this bill demonstrates the      kind of vision that is increasingly rare--the vision that it      is possible to find solutions to pressing problems that are      beneficial to both America's workers and employers.       Founded in 1985, NELA is the largest professional      membership organization in the country comprised of lawyers      who represent employees in labor, employment, and civil      rights disputes. NELA advances employee rights and serves      lawyers who advocate for equality and justice in the American      workplace. With 69 circuit, state, and local affiliates, NELA      has a membership of over 4,000 attorneys working on behalf of      those who have faced illegal treatment in the workplace.      There has been unanimity among our members for nearly 20      years that passage of the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act is a      top legislative priority.       The CJTFA has significant ramifications for people who have      been harmed by illegal treatment in their workplace. No one      starts a new job with any thought that they will find      themselves in a subsequent legal dispute with their employer,      yet this is unfortunately a reality for America's workers.      The CJTFA, which has been known as the Civil Rights Tax      Fairness Act and the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act in prior      Congresses, is a ``win-win'' for both employees and business.      Previous versions of the CJTFA garnered widespread support by      a broad-based coalition of business, civil rights, and legal      organizations such as the U.S Chamber of Commerce (USCC), the      Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the Leadership      Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR), and the      American Bar Association (ABA). At present, we have the      support of the ABA and we know that many other organizations      will be joining us in the near future.       The CJTFA will correct current inequities in tax treatment      of settlements and awards received by individuals in      employment and civil rights cases. Under current law, those      who suffer noneconomic damages as a result of unfair      employment practices pay taxes; those who suffer noneconomic      damages as a result of physical injuries (such as from car      accidents) do not. The CJTFA will correct this unfairness by      excluding from gross income non-economic damages received in      civil rights and employment cases.       Similarly, employees who have not lost wages pay taxes at      the rates applicable to the actual wages they earned in each      year. But if they receive back or front pay in a settlement      or award, they must pay taxes on lump sum recoveries that      represent multiple years of such pay--a patently unfair      practice. The CJTFA will correct this unfairness by taxing      lump sum recoveries as if they were received in the year      earned and by providing an exemption from the alternative      minimum tax (AMT) for any resulting tax benefit.       By making settlements less expensive and easier to achieve,      the CJTFA will reduce the number of employment and civil      rights cases that go to trial, freeing up valuable court      resources for other matters. The CJTFA not only benefits the      parties to employment disputes, but also America's taxpayers      who must bear the costs associated with a less efficient      judicial system.       On behalf of our 69 affiliates, 4,000 members, and the      hundreds of thousands of employees they represent, we are      extremely pleased that you are championing this important      bipartisan, bicameral legislation. We look forward to working      closely with you and your staff to gain passage of the CJTFA      in the 114th Congress.           Sincerely,                                                   Terisa E. Chaw,     Executive Director.                          ____________________
