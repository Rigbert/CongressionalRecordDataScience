 President, I choose to do that.  I support the nomination of Samuel Alito. Judge Alito, as we heard in our hearings, and so far in most of the debate on the floor, is a person who is a dedicated public servant, who practices what he preaches: integrity, modesty, judicial restraint, and a devotion to the law and to the Constitution. He understands a judge should not have a personal agenda or be an activist on the bench but should make decisions as they should be decided--do it in an impartial manner, do it with an open mind, and do it with appropriate restraint and, of course, in accordance with the laws and the Constitution.  Listening to a lot of my colleagues on the committee, and last week, I am extremely disappointed that we are looking now at an attempt by Senators--and they are all on the other side of the aisle--to delay and filibuster this nominee. It is too bad Majority Leader Frist had to take the extreme position of filing cloture on this very important nomination. No Supreme Court nomination has ever been defeated by filibuster if a majority of the Senators stood ready to confirm that nominee. Now, that certainly is not the case here because we already know a bipartisan majority of Senators will vote to confirm Judge Alito if we get to that point tomorrow at 11 o'clock. We also know we have had plenty of time to debate this nomination. It is unfortunate that certain Senators will vote against this nominee because they think doing so is a good political issue for them.
