President, of all the amendments we have been talking about, this probably is the broadest tax increase of any of them. This is a tax increase on every business regardless of what business they are in, if their income tax shows $2 million or more. It has nothing to do with polluters. It also has a tax increase of 9.7 percent per barrel in excise oil and somewhere between 50 cents and $10 a ton in feedstocks. Right now we are getting the highest amount of cleanups and yet we have the lowest amount in the fund. It is really not needed now. This is not polluters pay. This is not a tax on polluters. This is a tax on people who do not pollute. The responsible parties are being held liable today.  We had a hearing on it in our Environment and Public Works Committee. They are all being held responsible. They are cleaning up the pollution. I urge a ``no'' vote on this tax increase proposal of Senator Lautenberg.
