Patrick McGuire lost his battle with cancer on March 18, 2007 and passed from this life at the age of 53 years.  A native of Malone, New York, Mr. McGuire was a Toledo, Ohio resident since accepting a teaching position with the University of Toledo in 1987. He continued teaching throughout, but took on the directorship of the university's Urban Affairs Center in 2000. His leadership oversaw an expansion of that institution and a national recognition of his and the center's efforts. His respected research of community sustainability and development, urban sprawl, the creation of a municipal electrical company, and the so called ``brain drain'' of young professionals was nationally known.  Equally important to his academic and community leadership, Pat McGuire was dedicated to his personal life. His family and friends knew him to be a gourmet cook who loved fly fishing. We extend our sympathies to his life partner Linda and children Seamus and Erin, his parents, sister and brother, niece and nephew. We know their loss is profound, and hope comfort is found in the memories they share.  Perhaps the best summation of the life and work of Patrick McGuire was offered by his successor at the Urban Affairs Center: ``Patrick was a person with a lot of heart, he was tenacious and righteous, and he fought absolutely for what he believed in . . .'' A fine legacy indeed.                          ____________________
