During the month of September, Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church will be celebrating their anniversary on three different occasions. The celebration will kick off on September 6 with a balloon release and a barbeque, followed by a banquet on September 12, and a culmination of the anniversary celebration on September 21.  The vision of Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church began on July 23,1979 at the home of Mr. and Mrs. James Ervin, along with Reverend Cato Brooks and many others. In August of 1979, the church was organized as the Tree of Life Mission and worship began with Reverend James Barnett, Jr., and Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church. Then in September of 1979, the Tree of Life Mission became the Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church and incorporated a council of various religious ministers from other local churches. When the doors opened to the new church, 28 parishioners came together in worship service, and shortly after Rev. Brooks was named Pastor.  Tree of Life quickly grew in numbers and began to reach out to the community by constructing an alcohol and drug addiction program through the Alcohol Center at St. Mary's Mercy Hospital. The church and Rev. Brooks were strong initiators for the New Beginning AA program in the community as well as the West 11th Avenue AA program. In June of 1984, Rev. Brooks appointed Rev. Hunter Griffin, III as the church's Jail and Outreach Minister, and he reached out to over 650 inmates through prayer services at the Lake County Jail in Crown Point, Indiana.  On February 5, 1991, the Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church received high commendation from the City of Gary for all of its efforts to serve, educate, and support the local community. In July of 1991, the Southern Baptist State Convention Home Mission Board awarded the Tree of Life with a certificate of outstanding performance in Christian Service.  After years of hard work and commitment to the community and church, Rev. and Mrs. Cato Brooks and the members of Tree of Life started the Tree of Life Community Development Corporation and Care Center. This center is a spiritual approach to healing and helping the residents of Gary and Northwest Indiana, which began through the establishment of their first two programs: the Rehabilitation of Housing under the Homeless Initiative and Transitional Housing. New programs were later added and include the 21st Century Parents Program, the Misguided Youth and First Offenders Program, and the Homeless Initiative Programs.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues, join me in honoring and congratulating Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church on their 24th anniversary. They have given selflessly to the Gary community, as well as all of Northwest Indiana, and will continue to serve and support all members of the community through their gracious dedication and commitment.                          ____________________
