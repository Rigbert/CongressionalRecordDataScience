 President, reserving the right to object, I understand our Democratic friends are going to propound a number of different unanimous consent requests here with regard, I assume, to the judiciary. The core question here is whether President Obama has been treated fairly, and I think it is noteworthy that at this point in President Bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been confirmed. At this point in President Obama's term, the number is 324. That is 21 more judges the current President has gotten at this point than President Bush.  Clearly, President Obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, I object.
