 Although Johnson's impeachment proceedings ostensibly focused on his disregarding the Tenure in Office Act, historians--and not a single southerner does not understand--but historians uniformly agree that the true sources of opposition to President Johnson were policy disagreements and personal animosity.  The conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post-Civil War policies toward the Southern States and the overwhelming Republican majorities in both Chambers. The Republicans feared dilution of their voting strength if the southerners were seated.  Johnson's defenders in the Senate were eventually able to hold on to barely enough votes to prevent his conviction. In Professor Raoul Berger's view, ``Johnson's trial serves as a frightening reminder that in the hands of a passion-driven Congress, the process may bring down the very pillars of our constitutional system.''  Yet, if the cases of Tyler and Johnson substantiate the framers' fears, the Nixon situation vindicates the utility of the impeachment procedures. Notice how different the Nixon proceedings were from Tyler's and Johnson's. As the Nixon impeachment process unfolded, there was broad bipartisan consensus each step of the way. I was there at the time.  While it would have been foolish to believe that Members of Congress did not worry about the partisan political repercussions of their actions, such factional considerations did not dominate decision making.  Political friends and foes of the President agreed that the charges against the President were serious, that they warranted further inquiry and, once there was definitive evidence of serious complicity and wrongdoing, a consensus emerged that impeachment should be invoked. The President resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted out articles of impeachment by a 28-10 vote.  For me, several lessons stand out from our constitutional understanding of the impeachment process and our historical experience with it. Furthermore, I believe that a consensus has developed on several important points.  While the founders included impeachment powers in the Constitution, they were concerned by the potential partisan abuse. We should be no less aware of the dangers of partisanship. As we have seen, the process functions best when there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind moving ahead. The country is never well served when either policy disagreements or personal animosities drive the process.  Many scholars who have studied the Constitution have concluded that it should be reserved for offenses that are abuses of the public trust or abuses that relate to the public nature of the President's duties. Remember, what is impeachable is not necessarily criminal and what is criminal is not necessarily impeachable.  The Senate in particular has wide latitude in determining the outcome of this constitutional process. Just because the House may initiate an impeachment process does not mean that the Senate will conclude that the process with a vote on articles of impeachment was a correct process. It is well within our constitutional responsibilities to consider alternatives to impeachment if we find that circumstances warrant these alternatives.  I don't know that they will and I don't know that we will get there, but again, the debate is being waged as to whether or not it is in our constitutional power to consider alternatives. Remember Senator Henry Clay's ``want of confidence.''  There is no one-size-fits-all definition of impeachable offenses, divorced from such practical considerations. The Senate in particular, has an obligation to consider the full range of consequences of removing the President from Office.  In recent days, some have suggested that because the Starr Report provides a prima facie case and prima facie evidence of what are arguably impeachable offenses, the House and the Senate have a constitutional responsibility to see the impeachment process through to its conclusion.  In my view, the constitutional history that I have sketched here and more shows this position is entirely mistaken. Indeed, if anything, history shows a thoroughly understandable reluctance to have the procedure invoked in the first place.  Stopping short of impeachment would not be reaching a solution ``outside the Constitution.'' It would be entirely compatible and consistent with what the Founders contemplated, if that is what we decide. Again, I am not prejudging what we should decide.  The 28th Congress hardly violated its constitutional duty when the House decided that, all things considered, terminating impeachment proceedings after cooperation between the Congress and the President improved was a better course of action than proceeding with impeachment based on his past actions, even though it apparently did so for reasons no more laudable than those that initiated the process in the first place.  Impeachment was and remains an inherently political process, with all the pitfalls and promises that are thus put into play by politics. Nothing in the document precludes the Congress from seeking means to resolve this or any other putative breach of duty short of removing him from office. In fact, the risky and potentially divisive nature of the impeachment process may counsel in favor of utilizing it only as an absolute last resort where there is no shadow of a doubt that it meets, the criteria of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdeameanors.  Of course, impeachment ought to be used if the breach of duty is serious enough--what the Congress was prepared to do in the case of Richard Nixon was the correct course of action. However, nothing in the constitution precludes the Congress from resolving this conflict in a manner short of impeachment.  The critical question--the question with which the country is currently struggling--is whether the President's breaches of conduct and shameful activity, which are now well known and which have been universally condemned, warrant the ultimate political sanction. Are they serious enough to warrant removal from office?  In answering that, we need to ask ourselves, What is in the best interests of the United States of America? That is something that the founders contemplated us asking ourselves if and when faced with this question.  While I have not decided ultimately what should happen, I do want to suggest that it certainly is constitutionally permissible to consider a middle ground as a resolution of this matter. Such an approach might bring together those of the President's detractors who believe there is a need for some sanction, but are willing to stop short of impeachment, as well as those of the President's supporters who reject impeachment, but are willing to consider that some sanction ought to be implemented.  As a country, Mr. President, we have not often faced decisions as stark and potentially momentous as the impeachment of a President of the United States. On the other hand, we would be wise not to overstate such claims. Surely we have faced some moments as stark and serious as this one. We have survived those moments and we will survive this one no matter how we handle it. As my dad always says, and he is going on 85 years of age, I remember over the last 26 years going home and saying, ``Dad, this is a catastrophe,'' and he would look at me and say, ``Joe, this country is so good, it is so strong, it is so solid, that it can stand 4 or 8 years of anybody or anything.'' And he is right. He is right. So I don't want to exaggerate this.  Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I'm confident that our form of government and the strength of our country present us not with a constitutional crisis but rather with a constitutional framework and flexibility to deal responsibly with the decisions we face in the coming months. My purpose in rising today is to remind all of us of what that constitutional framework and flexibility mean, what they are.  In my closing plea I begin where I started, as a young Senator in April of 1974. This is a time for us to be cautious. This is a time for Members of this body to hold our fire. This is the time to be prepared to exercise our responsibility to be judge and jury after, and only after, all of the facts are presented to us. This is not a constitutional crisis but it is a serious, serious business.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
