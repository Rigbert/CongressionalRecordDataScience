 President, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen son of Iowa,MSgt. Travis Riddick. Master Sergeant Riddick joined the Marine Corps after graduating from high school in Centerville, IA. In doing so, he was following in a laudable family tradition of patriotic service. His father and grandfather were marines, as well as his uncle and cousins. His twin brother recently retired after 21 years in the Navy. Travis Riddick certainly did his family, his State, and his country proud. He was awarded six Air Medals, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, seven Marine Corps Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service Medals, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, the NATO Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal, and the Kuwait Liberation Medal.  My prayers are with his mother, Barbara, his father, John, and his wife, Jennifer, as well as his children and all his family and friends. His father reports that Travis loved his job and his mother said that he was the best marine ever. Our Nation is tremendously fortunate to have individuals like Travis Riddick who have the drive to step forward and serve their country with enthusiasm and honor. To selfless heroes like Travis Riddick, we owe nothing short of our liberty. Unlike at the birth of our country, when every person who aligned with the cause of freedom was putting themselves at great risk, those who enjoy our way of life today rely on a select group of patriotic Americans to preserve everything we hold so dear. We can never repay the debt we owe, but we are obliged to honor and remember them for their sacrifice in the name of liberty.                          ____________________
