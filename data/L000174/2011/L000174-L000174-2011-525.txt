President, it is interesting, I do not want to embarrass the person whom I wanted to speak about at all, but I was interested in listening to my dear friend, Senator Durbin, speak about his time at Georgetown Law School. Both he and I graduated from the Georgetown Law School. He talked about a classmate of his who was in patent law, and he realized this was a complex subject, one that is not the sort of law that he, Senator Durbin, was going to go into, any more than I would have.  But I also think of another graduate of Georgetown Law Center who was an engineer, had a degree in engineering, studied patent law, and became one of the most distinguished patent lawyers, litigators in this country, and is now a member of the Federal circuit court of appeals and that is Judge Richard Linn.  It was interesting hearing the Senator from Illinois, himself one of the finest lawyers in this body. My wife Marcella and I had the honor of being out in Chicago with Judge Linn and his wife Patty for a meeting of the Richard Linn American Inn of Court in Chicago. He serves with great distinction. In fact, a major part of this legislation reflects an opinion he wrote.  But I digress. I ask unanimous consent the Senate resume consideration of the Lee amendment No. 115, with the time until 5:15 equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Lee amendment No. 115; that the Lee amendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold; that upon disposition of the Lee amendment, the Senate resume consideration of the Menendez amendment No. 124; that Senator Menendez be recognized to modify his amendment with the changes at the desk and the amendment, as modified, be agreed to; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and there be no amendments in order to the amendments prior to the vote.
