 President, I would like to make two very brief points.  I do not believe this is a deal killer, No. 1. But No. 2, there are two pieces here. It is illegal to make a bomb. It is illegal to put together poison gas. That is one crime all by itself. The second crime is if you go out and use it. So, if you used a bomb to blow up buildings, a new statute of limitations starts to run.  There is a distinction between what is lacking in this bill across the board, between prevention and apprehension. We not only want to get the bad guys who do the bad things; we want to prevent the bad guys from being able to do the bad things. By allowing the statute of limitations to be like it is for Smokey the Bear impersonation, and everything else in the Federal code--just about--it gives us more time to track down the people who have prepared or are stockpiling this kind of material, whether or not they have used it. That is an important distinction.  I think this is an important amendment. I cannot believe for a moment that this would kill the bill, that you would have 35 people in the House vote against this because we made the statute of limitations for making poison gas the same as for impersonating Smokey the Bear. I find that unfathomable.  I thank my colleague for yielding me an extra minute.
