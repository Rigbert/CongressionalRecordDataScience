President, I rise today to speak about Matt Holt, who has served the Senate with distinction for 25 years. As a benefits and retirement counselor and deputy for employee benefits and financial services in the Senate Disbursing Office, Matt Holt has committed his talents and energy to serving Senators and staff for over two decades.  His career here in the Senate has been exemplary. He is not only hardworking and dedicated but also friendly, helpful, and patient. He always takes the time to fully answer our questions, and he has become a tremendous resource for the Senate Disbursing Office.  Matt is truly an asset to the Senate, and all of us here in the Senate community are grateful for his outstanding dedication and hard work. An avid outdoorsman, Matt is looking forward to spending time fishing, camping, and hiking with his wife Jeanne and his children Jessica and Ben. He leaves with our appreciation and best wishes for a happy and relaxing retirement. He certainly has earned it.                          ____________________
