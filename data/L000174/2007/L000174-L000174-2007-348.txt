I was in Vermont over the weekend, as I am most weekends. I get stopped by people in the grocery store or putting gas in the car--we are a small State, and you tend to know everybody; they are Republicans and they are Democrats--and I get asked the constant question, if the President will not listen to us about getting out, can you people in Congress vote on something? Can you vote? Can you either vote to keep us there or vote to get us out, but stand up? My answer to them is we are prepared to vote on our side of the aisle. Senator Reid and those following him are prepared to vote, but we are stopped from voting.  I am wondering whether the distinguished majority leader, when he goes home to Nevada, whether he doesn't hear similar sentiments about: Let us vote. Let us vote.
