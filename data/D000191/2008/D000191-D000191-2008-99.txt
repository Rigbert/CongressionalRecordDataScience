Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 964) to promote the safe operation of 15 passenger vans, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 964       Whereas an organization that owns or operates a 15-     passenger van should not allow an inexperienced driver of      such a van to drive the van because design and handling      characteristics of a 15-passenger van make it drive      differently than other passenger vehicles;       Whereas the safety records of drivers experienced in      driving a 15-passenger van are significantly better than      drivers not experienced in driving such a van;       Whereas according to the National Highway Traffic Safety      Administration, from 1997 through 2006, there were 1,090      fatalities of van occupants resulting from crashes involving      15-passenger vans of which 534 fatalities resulted from      largely preventable single-vehicle rollover crashes of such      vans;       Whereas according to the Insurance Institute for Highway      Safety, in 2005, 59 percent of the fatalities in 15-passenger      van crashes occurred in single-vehicle rollover crashes,      which is higher than the rollover fatality rates for any      other passenger vehicle type;       Whereas 15-passenger vans require special driving skills      because they are larger, with higher centers of gravity,      which makes them less stable than vehicles such as cars,      especially if the van is heavily loaded;       Whereas adding passengers in a 15-passenger van increases      the center of gravity, causing the van to be increasingly      difficult to handle and less stable;       Whereas the death rate for all occupants was higher for 15-     passenger vans than for other passenger vehicle types      combined;       Whereas during the period 2001 through 2005, the death rate      for occupants of 15-passenger vans was 250 fatalities per      million registered vehicles compared to 151 fatalities per      million of all other registered vehicles;       Whereas impressing upon 15-passenger van drivers the      inherent dangers of operating these vehicles, particularly      when fully loaded, and educating them about proper handling      and control, particularly during emergency situations, can      reduce the risk of rollover, and such training can also help      dispel the expectation that these vans operate like large      passenger cars;       Whereas wearing safety belts dramatically increases the      chances of survival during a rollover crash;       Whereas nearly 80 percent of those who died in 15-passenger      van rollovers nationwide between 1990 and 2003 were not      buckled up;       Whereas in fatal, single-vehicle rollover crashes involving      15-passenger vans over the past decade, 91 percent of      occupants wearing safety belts survived; and       Whereas driver education and training, and general      awareness of the dangers of these vans are effective means of      reducing the death rates of occupants of 15-passenger vans:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, that the House of Representatives recognizes the      need for awareness regarding the increased risks of driving      15-passenger vans and encourages any operator of such a      vehicle or person who provides transportation in such a      vehicle to provide adequate training for drivers and safety      information, including the necessity for wearing safety      belts, to passengers.
