 President, we have had a victory--at least a temporary victory, but a good victory--with the IRS. Fifty-seven of us introduced a bipartisan bill, Senator Dorgan leading for the Democrats, myself for Republicans. The bill was introduced to do for farmers what has been the law since 1981, that if deferred sales contracts were used, farmers were still taxed on the year that the money was received.  The IRS made a ruling that for alternative minimum tax purposes that income would be taxed the year that the sale was made, not the year that themoney was received. Well, obviously this, if it were to go forward, would create a tremendous hardship in the agricultural community because farmers would be taxed on two crops in 1 year, rather than the planning that normally goes on in cash accounting farming.  Common sense and reasonableness have prevailed at the IRS. Last night at about 6:30 I received a telephone call from the IRS stating their decision to delay for 1 year the enactment of their latest rule so that farmers now will be able to do during the current tax filing system what they have been doing for the last 15 years, to just keep on accounting for their income for tax purposes the way that it has legally been done.  Then just within the last hour Commissioner Richardson had delivered to me her letter in response to my letter of December and also the latest recommendations as far as the regulations are concerned implementing her decision.  The fact of life is, Mr. President, that the Internal Revenue Service was aware of 57 Members of this Senate in a bipartisan spirit--and maybe her decision was because she is an appointment of the President and that it then reflects the new attitude at the White House of bipartisanship during this congressional session.  Regardless of what brought this about, I am thankful that common sense and reasonableness have prevailed. I thank each of my 57 colleagues who have been involved in this issue for their timeliness in helping us sponsor this legislation, getting it in. We will now move forward to change an erroneous IRS ruling that has been backed up by an erroneous district court case so that law reflects what Congress has intended since 1981 when deferred sales contracts were made legal and, second, when we passed the alternative minimum tax legislation in 1986.  I ask unanimous consent that the documents I have referred to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Department of the Treasury,                                     Internal Revenue Service,                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: In your December 31, 1996 letter,      you asked me how farmers could comply with the Internal      Revenue Service's position on the treatment of deferred      contract commodity sales for alternative minimum tax (AMT)      purposes on their 1996 federal income tax returns. You also      asked that the Service provide guidance about complying with      its position ``before the traditional farmer tax filing      deadline of March 1, 1997.''       As you and I have discussed, the position of the Service is      that for AMT purposes income from deferred contract commodity      sales must be reported in the year of sale. However, some      taxpayers have been reporting income from such sales for AMT      purposes in the taxable year they received their payments--     not the year of sale.       Earlier today, the IRS issued a Notice, a copy of which is      enclosed, advising those who have not followed the Service's      position how they should report deferred contract commodity      sales for AMT purposes on their returns for 1996. Basically,      for 1996 tax returns, taxpayers should make no changes in how      they have been reporting sales--even if contrary to the      Service's position.       The Notice also provides guidance about how to change the      method of reporting deferred contract commodity sales for AMT      purposes. Taxpayers who follow that guidance will receive      audit protection with regard to the AMT issue for all open      years unless they are currently under audit for this issue.       The way deferred contract commodity sales are reported for      the AMT is a ``method of accounting'' for tax purposes. The      law provides that the method of accounting a taxpayer uses      for tax purposes, even if it is not the correct method,      cannot be changed without the prior consent of the      Commissioner.       The Service will issue automatic consent procedures for      taxpayers to follow to change from the accounting method they      currently use. This change must be made on a taxpayer's      federal income tax return for the 1997 tax year. Thus,      taxpayers do not need to change how they report deferred      contract commodity sales until filing their 1997 returns.       I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me      know if you have any questions.           Sincerely,                                       Margaret Milner Richardson.        Part III--Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous       Notice of intent to issue guidance allowing farmers to      expeditiously change their method of accounting for deferred      payment sales contracts in computing alternative minimum tax.                              Notice 97-13       Summary: The Internal Revenue Service intends to provide      approval for taxpayers engaged in the business of farming to      change their method of accounting for the income from certain      deferred payment sales contracts for purposes of computing      their alternative minimum tax (AMT). Farmers will be allowed      to change to a permissible method of accounting for this      income, effective for taxable years beginning after December      31, 1996, by attaching Form 3115 to their 1997 federal income      tax returns to be filed during 1998. Farmers who change their      method of accounting in accordance with this procedure will      then receive audit protection with respect to the use of an      impermissible method of accounting for all taxable years      prior to the change, in accordance with generally applicable      rules.       Background: The Service has received numerous inquiries on      the proper treatment, for AMT purposes, of income from the      sale of products raised by farmers or other inventory      property sold in the ordinary course of the farming business      under deferred payment sales contracts. A deferred payment      sales contract is one where at least one payment is to be      received after the close of the taxable year in which the      product is sold.       Section 56(a)(6) of the Code provides that, in computing      alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), income from the      disposition of property such as farm products is determined      without regard to the installment method under Sec. 453.      Thus, a farmer using the cash method, who sells farm products      under a deferred payment sales contract and does not elect      out of the installment method of reporting, must include in      AMTI in the year of the sale both the cash received and the      fair market value (or the issue price) of the deferred      payment obligation. Otherwise, the farmer is using an      impermissible method of accounting. If the farmer elects not      to apply the installment method to the sale, and reports the      income in the year of the sale, there is no AMTI adjustment      with respect to the sale.       Section 446(e) generally provides that a taxpayer that      changes its method of accounting must secure the      Commissioner's consent before computing income using the new      method. In general, taxpayers who wish to change their method      of accounting must file Form 3115, Application for Change in      Accounting Method, with the Commissioner within the first 180      days of the taxable year in which the taxpayer desires to      make the change, and must pay a user fee (ranging from $500      to $900). Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(i). In addition,      Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) authorizes the Commissioner to      prescribe administrative procedures setting forth the      limitations, terms and conditions necessary to obtain consent      to change a method of accounting.       Automatic change in method of accounting: The Service will      issue guidance that will allow farmers currently using an      impermissible method of accounting for income from the sale      of farm products under deferred payment sales contracts for      AMT purposes to automatically change to a permissible method      of accounting. Under the forthcoming guidance, farmers will      be allowed to request the method change by attaching Form      3115 to their timely filed 1997 federal income tax return      (due in 1998). No user fee will be required.       The method change will be effective for taxable years      beginning after December 31, 1996. In addition, the method      change will result in audit protection for all prior taxable      years with respect to the impermissible method of accounting      (i.e., the examining agent will not propose that a farmer      change the impermissible method of accounting for any prior      taxable year) in accordance with generally applicable rules.      See Rev. Proc. 92-20, Section 10.12, 1992-1 C.B. 685. Farmers      currently using an impermissible method of accounting for      such sales should continue to use that method in computing      AMT for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1997.       The automatic method change procedure will not be available      to farmers who have received written notification from an      examining agent (e.g., by examination plan, information      document request, notification of proposed adjustments or      income tax examination changes) prior to January 28, 1997,      specifically citing as an issue under consideration the      farmer's method of accounting for income from sales of farm      products under deferred payment sales contracts for AMT      purposes. In addition, the guidance will not apply if the      farmer's method of accounting for such income for AMT      purposes is an issue under consideration by an appeals office      or a federal court.
