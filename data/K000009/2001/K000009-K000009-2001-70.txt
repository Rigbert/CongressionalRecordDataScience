Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman (Mr. Lantos) for yielding me this time.  I rise tonight in strong support of this resolution to grant unprecedented authority to our President for the first time in U.S. history to deploy our Armed Forces against organizations and persons that are not nation states, as well as those that are nation states. We take this step with the certain knowledge that our first duty is to protect and defend our Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Never have we been more united in our cause.  We also take this step understanding the character of U.S. foreign policy for the last century has also yielded levels of hate against our Nation, by omission or commission, that demand deep and immediate reevaluation. We pray for our people who have had thrust upon them such unjust suffering. May God bless America and our allies with wisdom. Our unyielding causes are freedom and justice.
