Speaker, I am afraid we are going to almost finish the rest of that hour.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, we should debate ideas; but if the idea is, ``What is your plan?'' it wasn't my plan that we had to do it alone. If we have to, we have proven we have done that before. He knows it will go on to the Senate.  But if my friend has changed his belief, I don't hold it against him. He might have changed his belief. Or maybe his belief always was that we should have no border security. I don't know.  My friend did acknowledge that there was a great number of people who were trying to get into our country and storming the gates. That is not all the bill. The bill is border security and homeland security.  If the idea is it has to just be a CR or they can't deal with it, do you know what my plan has been all along? It is to work with the gentleman. But I am not hearing that he is even willing to work with us, that I am saying I am willing to.  Compromise. He has already voted for part of border security to be a wall. He doesn't even want to sit down and discuss how much should that be, how much border security should we have.  Is 10 terrorists a day coming across the border okay with the gentleman? Because it is not with me.  Is 2,000 inadmissible people coming across? Is that okay with the gentleman? It is not with me. It takes away from those, like our own relatives, who come here legally.  I was at a naturalization just a few months ago. I sat there inside this service. I watched individuals with such pride raising their hand. And do you know what I told them? George Washington is now their founding father; Abraham Lincoln was their liberator; Martin Luther King spoke of their dreams; and the flag that sits on the Moon is their flag today. And I want them to be safe.                                {time}  1200  And I don't know what those terrorists have planned when they come across the border, or when those people storm the gates. But I do know we have a responsibility--that I can't get everything I want--a responsibility that we find security, and that we protect our own border security at the same time.  I think there is a window that we can do this. I don't want to do it alone. So my plan was to do it with the gentleman. If he is saying to me he can't, then I am going to have to change my plan, just as we had to do when it came to the children's health insurance. We were not going to let that lapse. Just as it happened when you were going to shut the government down over DACA; we weren't going to let that happen.  We believe the government should stay open. So that is my plan. Will you join with us? Will you make sure that we don't shut down? Will you make sure that we make America stronger and safer for the future?  I don't want to leave work for the gentleman to get done. He is excited about his majority. I want him to be successful. I may smile for the challenge that he is going to have with some people I see coming in, and I will be right over here to debate where we disagree; but when we agree, I will be right there with him, and I will find compromise in every part I can.  I think this is a window to show--even to all those new freshmen, even to those who are leaving and these could be some of their last votes--that we did the very best with the moments that we had for the future of this country.
