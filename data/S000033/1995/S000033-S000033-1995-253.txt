 Have you heard that?  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, there were amendments in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure yesterday being presented which favored polluters over public interests which could not be satisfactorily explained by the Republicans offering them on the other side. And at one point I was tempted to say why don't we just bring the lobbyist up to the dais, they can at least explain it, and then we will go forward with the vote.  You know, clean water. I mean, there were things like allowing industries to discharge whatever they wanted into municipal sewers and requiring the local taxpayers to pick up the tab. No more pretreatment requirements for toxics or extraordinarily difficult things that are difficult to deal with.  I am not saying the Clean Water Act is perfect the way it is, but a reading by an impartial person of what went through that committee yesterday will say, whoa, are we going back to 1955 when the Cuyahoga River was flammable? Are we going back to the days in Oregon when the Willamette River was an open sewer?  And the unfunded mandates, we offered an amendment to say that, you know, the bill should identify unfunded mandates because what this does substantially is move burdens from industry to public taxpayers and people who pay sewer bills and people who pay property taxes and bonds for municipal sewer systems.  Of course, the Republicans would not let an unfunded mandate provision through that related to private interests. It is okay that these large corporations who are also contributing to the Republican party can now just dump their stuff in the river and then it is up to the people in the local city to try and clean it up.
