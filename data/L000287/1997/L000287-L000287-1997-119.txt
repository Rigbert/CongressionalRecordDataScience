Mr. Speaker, 55 years ago this month, the first sit-in took place. It was at the Jack Spratt Coffee Shop in Chicago, IL. It was conceived, organized, and led by James Farmer.  Fifty years ago, in 1947, in followup to the 1946 Supreme Court ruling that blacks could not be forced to sit in the back of buses traveling interstate, Farmer led CORE members in a challenge to the practice of segregated seating. On what he called the journey of reconciliation, they traveled through Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia. Some members of that group, including Bayard Rustin, were arrested and served 30 days on a chain gang in North Carolina for having violated local segregation laws.  These are among the little known but critical events on the road to equal rights and equal protection under the law in the United States. Better known are the Freedom Rides. James Farmer orchestrated them, too.  Tireless and committed, Jim Farmer led 13 of us--an interracial group of young men and women whom he had helped train in the Ghandian principles of direct action and nonviolence--on a journey toward freedom, through the deep South. There was violence all around. Our buses were burned. We were beaten. But, we never turned back.  The Freedom Rides catapulted Birmingham police commissioner, Bull Connor, onto the front page of major newspapers around the world. The Freedom Rides opened Bobby Kennedy's eyes to the intransigence of Southern segregationists and the need for the Federal Government to intervene in the struggle for civil rights. And the Freedom Rides brought down the white only and colored signs that had been hung over every bus seat, terminal bench, toilet, and water fountain in the South.  Although he was one of the ``Big Six'' leaders of the civil rights movement, a planner of the 1963 march on Washington and scheduled to speak at the march, Jim Farmer didn't make it to the march. He was in jail in Louisiana at the time; and, while he could have been released, he chose to stay with the 200 others who had marched in Plaquemine earlier in the week protesting the inhumane treatment of black people in that parish.  Almost a month later, the Plaquemine protesters were released. However, the only way Farmer was able to escape Louisiana was in a coffin in the back of a hearse. The State troopers had vowed to find him and kill.  Referred to as a ``young negro aristocrat,'' Farmer was born in Texas, where his father was the first black person to earn a Ph.D. degree. Today, he is 77 years old. He is blind. He has lost the use of both of his legs. He is not in good health.  He is still teaching at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, VA, where is he Distinguished Professor of History and American Studies. He continues to inspire his students and all those who come in contact with him to set goals, direct their actions, lead, be creative, have vision and keep the faith.  I invite my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to James Farmer, one of our Nation's greatest heros, his work, his legacy, and his life.                          ____________________
