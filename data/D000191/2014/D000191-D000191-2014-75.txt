Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may      be used to approve a new foreign air carrier permit under      sections 41301 through 41305 of title 49, United States Code,      or exemption application under section 40109 of that title of      an air carrier already holding an air operators certificate      issued by a country that is party to the U.S.-E.U.-Iceland-     Norway Air Transport Agreement where such approval would      contravene United States law or Article 17 bis of the U.S.-     E.U.-Iceland-Norway Air Transport Agreement.  Mr. DeFAZIO (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that we dispense with the reading of the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR.
