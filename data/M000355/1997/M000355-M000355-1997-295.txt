 President, I have come to the floor today in support of the tuition savings provision included in this bill. I believe the Finance Committee has done a thorough job providing broad incentives to help families save and provide for the education of their children.  I commend Senator Roth and the Finance Committee for their efforts to include many of the provisions in S. 594, the College Savings Act. The Finance Committee has included language to make earnings in qualified tuition savings plans exempt from taxation as well as expanding the definition of qualified education costs to include room and board. Once implemented this legislation will reward all families who plan ahead and save for a child's education.  For the past several years, I have worked hard to make college more affordable by helping families who save. In both the 103d and 104th Congresses, I introduced legislation to make earnings invested in State-sponsored tuition savings plans exempt from Federal taxation. States have also recognized the needs of families and have provided incentives for them to save or prepay their children's education. State savings plans provide families a safe, affordable, and disciplined means of paying for their children's education.  Last year, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. The provisions contained in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 clarified the tax treatment of both the State-sponsored tuition savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these State-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education.  Mr. President, this action is long overdue. We have ignored the needs of middle-class families who have seen their income hold steady, while tuition costs go through the roof. According to the GAO, tuition at a 4-year university rose 234 percent between 1980-94.  During this same period, median household income rose 84 percent and the consumer price index rose a mere 74 percent. The College Board reports that tuition costs for the 1996-97 school year will rise 5 percent while average room and board costs will rise between 4 to 6 percent. While education costs have moderated throughout the 1990's, they continue to outstrip the gains in income. Tuition has now become the greatest barrier to attendance.  Due to the rising cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students accept some amount of financial assistance. In 1995, $50 billion in financial aid was available to students from Federal, State, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase has come in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total Federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burden students and families with additional interest costs. It is important that we not forget that compound interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students must bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition.  State-sponsored tuition savings plans have pioneered efforts to provide families with opportunities to save as a hedge against tuition inflation. States have established affordable tuition investment plans that guarantee parents a minimum level of investment return or guarantee a future education at today's prices. Such guarantees offer middle-class families the piece of mind that their children will be able to meet the tuition obligation and reduce the need to take on thousands of dollars in loans.  States like Michigan, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky were the first programs to be started in order to help families save for college. Today, there are 15 States with programs in operation. An additional 4 States will implement their programs this year. Also, I am informed by the college savings network that every other State, except Georgia, which has implemented the HOPE Scholarship Program, is preparing legislation or is studying a proposal to help their residents save for college. Today, there are 730,000 participants contributing over $3.23 billion to education savings nationwide. By year end, the college savings plan network estimates that they will have 1 million participants. By 2006, they estimate that over $6 billion will be invested in State-sponsored programs.  Kentucky established its plan in 1988 to provide residents with an affordable means of saving for college. Today, 2,602 Kentucky participants have contributed over $5 million toward their children's education. I am confident with passage of this language these programs will grow dramatically.  Many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $49. This proposal rewards those who are serious about their future and are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by exempting all interest earnings from State taxes. It is also important to note that 58 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families.  Mr. President, the Finance Committee has expanded the language to permit private nonprofit colleges to establish their own tuition savings plans as well as establishing education IRA's. This will ensure that all families have an opportunity to save. This legislation also allows individuals who invested in Savings Bonds to roll them over into the qualified State plan. This is a commonsense provision that will give those who are already saving the flexibility to invest in prepaid plans if available.  It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. We need to decide on how we will spend our limited Federal resources to ensure that both access and quality are maintained. It is unrealistic to assume that the Government can afford to provide Federal assistance for everyone. However, at a modest cost, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This reduces the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.  Let me close by saying that I commend the work of Senator Graham and his staff on the issue of tuition savings. His cooperation and hard work have ensured that this issue enjoys bipartisan support. I would also like to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for all his efforts in making education savings the cornerstone of this package.    extending the small blenders ethanol tax credit to farmer-owned                               cooperatives
