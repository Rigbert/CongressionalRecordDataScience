 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and a trusted adviser, Wythe Willey, who lost a 2-year battle with cancer on Saturday. Wythe Willey was a person who left a mark. If you ever met him, you would be hard pressed to forget him. He was an Iowa farm boy through and through. Whether he was living in Des Moines or Cedar Rapids, he valued his friendships and he valued everybody he met along his life's journey.  Wythe had a passion for agriculture, and particularly for the cattle business, but also for politics. He had one of the most astute political minds I have ever come across. To sit and talk politics with Wythe was an invigorating endeavor. His political sense and understanding of the issues at the State and Federal level never failed to bring additional insight to anybody who would listen. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S10807, December 21, 2010, the Record reads: . . . Wyth Willey . . .    The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Wythe Willey . . . ========================= END NOTE =========================   There is a saying among my former and current staff, ``once a Grassley staffer, always a Grassley staffer.'' Wythe was the epitome of that motto. He worked on my Iowa staff from 1981-1987. When he left, he had already left his mark, but he was far from being done helping the people of Iowa. During the time on my staff, and the years since then, Wythe helped me by heading a committee to vet Federal judicial, U.S. attorney, and U.S. marshal nominees.  Even when he was involved in government and politics, Wythe's heart was always with his family farm. No matter where his professional careertook him, he continued to run the century-old farm near Maquoketa. Cattlemen across Iowa and the country knew few supporters who fought for their interests more than Wythe. As president of both the Iowa Cattlemen's Association and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association he was, in that position, tireless in his advocacy to give Iowa beef producers an opportunity to benefit from the market.  I have a lot of good memories of Wythe, including how he stole the tax counsel from my Washington office and ended up marrying her. They did not think I knew much about it, but I remember when Susan started spending more and more time in Iowa. Wythe and Susan were one of the first of several Grassley office romances and set a precedent for years to come.  One last memory I will never forget is when I learned he was supporting my candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 1980. At that time, Wythe worked for the Governor who had backed my opponent in the primary. I can never thank him enough for his trust in me, especially when it was not an easy thing to do because of his closeness to the Governor at that time.  Wythe remained a loyal friend and trusted adviser up to his death, and for that I am forever thankful.                          ____________________
