Speaker, my hometown or Corona, California is blessed with many individuals who work tirelessly to improve the community's economy, educational system, environment and quality of life. When individuals like these form an organization, the benefits are innumerable. These benefits are reaped not only by the entire community, but also by the individuals who participate. Friendships and business relationships are formed and a tradition of cooperation develops within the community. The Corona Rotary Club is one of these exceptional organizations.  This month, the Corona Rotary Club is celebrating its 75th anniversary, marking three-quarters of a century of educational aid and community service in the city of Corona. The Corona Rotary Club is part of a larger organization, Rotary International, which consists of 6,000 clubs worldwide and sponsors several types of programs both regionally and internationally. One of these programs is its PolioPlus Program, which has virtually eradicated polio worldwide. Under sponsorship from the Riverside Rotary Club, the Corona Rotary Club was chartered on January 26, 1923. The club, founded by Herb Gully, initially consisted of 25 members with Charley Scoville serving as the first president. In 1940, a great honor was bestowed upon the organization when Paul Harris, the founder of Rotary International, visited the club. Since 1923, the Corona Rotary Club has grown to include 75 members.  The Corona Rotary Club sponsors an annual golf tournament in order to raise money for several youth organizations, including Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA, and various sports programs. Rotary has also established numerous scholarship funds for students in the Corona area, the most recent being the Gordon Duncan Memorial Scholarship, which pays a student's tuition for four years at a California State University. The Corona Rotary Club also established the RR Root Foundation, an organization which assists children with self-esteem problems related to dental deformities and provides reconstructive surgery for children with these deformities.  On a personal note, I am especially proud of the Corona Rotary Club's 75 years of service to the community because I have been a member for many years and served as itsPresident prior to being elected to Congress. ``Service Above Self'' is the motto of the Corona Rotary Club, and it is a tradition that I would like to see continue for another 75 years. On behalf of all the residents of the 43rd Congressional District, I would like to thank the Corona Rotary Club for its contributions and dedicated service to the community, and wish them great success with their 75th anniversary celebration.                          ____________________
