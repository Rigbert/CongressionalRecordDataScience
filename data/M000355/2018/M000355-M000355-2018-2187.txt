 President, the House of Representatives, the President, and a bipartisan majority of Republican and Democratic Senators all agreed on a compromise bill that would have prevented a shutdown. We can pass this bill today and have it signed into law so we can end this nonsense. There is one way to do all of this, and it is right in front of us--the pending measure.  It would enable Congress to do the commonsense thing: keep negotiating other issues while providing for our troops, our veterans, and millions of vulnerable Americans, but the Democratic leader chose to filibuster that bipartisan bill.  So here we are. Day one, and already funding is in jeopardy for our veterans and our troops. Funding for a 6-year children's health insurance bill is sitting here because the Democratic leader filibustered a bipartisan compromise that a majority of Senators supported and chose instead to shut down the government.  Thanks to the Democratic leader's decision to filibuster an extension of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, low-income families will slip closer to losing healthcare coverage for their kids. In many States, this is already an emergency.  Again, we can do all of this today. We have a way forward. It is right in front of us and ready to go.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate immediately vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur with amendment, which funds CHIP and reopens the government; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate immediately vote on the motion to concur with further amendment.
