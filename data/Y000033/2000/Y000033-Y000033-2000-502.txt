Mr. Chairman, under rule 16 clause 7 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the amendment deals with a different subject matter than the text of the bill. The fundamental purpose of the amendment is unrelated to the bill which is offered. H.R. 3822 addresses issues relative to the U.S. policy regarding foreign assistance to other countries which engage in oil price-fixing of oil produced in other countries and imported to the United States.  The subject of the amendment is very different from that bill. It would take away the authority of the President to determine whether to ban the exported oil produced on public lands within the United States to other countries. Therefore, the amendment is not germane and I ask my point of order be sustained
