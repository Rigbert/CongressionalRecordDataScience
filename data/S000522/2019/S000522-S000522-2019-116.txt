Mr. Chair, Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States today.  If not diagnosed and treated properly, Lyme can lead to disseminated infection that can affect every system in the body, including the central nervous system. Later symptoms of Lyme include neurological problems, memory loss, brain fog, and heart systems such as heart block and inflammation of the heart muscle.  Lyme has been reported in every State in the United States. My State, for example, has a particularly high incidence of new cases and old, about 50,000 new infections each year.  While grossly undercounted for decades, new scientific evidence shows that the number of new cases of Lyme is now estimated to be between 291,000 to 437,000. Remember, these are new cases of Lyme disease.  Since 1998, Mr. Chair, I have introduced comprehensive legislation on tick-borne diseases, including Lyme. At the core of it was the creation of a working group or a blue-ribbon commission to try to figure out what is going on and to have Lyme-literate participants because there has been a culture of denial about Lyme disease, particularly chronic Lyme, for decades.  With the support and strategic help of Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, we succeeded in our goal and added the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group to the 21st Century Cures Act. I am thankful to Fred Upton, as well, for his leadership on this important initiative.  I would point out that that Working Group was dead over in the Senate, and again, it was Kevin McCarthy who said the 21st Century Cures Act doesn't come back unless that is in it. That made it happen.  The Working Group is charged with reviewing current research efforts and identifying the gaps in the study, education, prevention, and access to care for patients with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.  In their inaugural report to Congress, the Working Group said, ``Americans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a lack of attention at the Federal level and by divisions within the field.'' I include the executive summary of the Working Group's report in the Record.      [Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, 2018 Report to Congress]                           Executive Summary       Tick-Borne Diseases have rapidly become a serious and      growing threat to public health in the United States. Despite      many scientific unknowns, experts agree that the incidence      and distribution of tick-borne diseases are increasing. Over      the past 25 years, reports of Lyme disease have increased      steadily with estimated annual cases approximating 300,000      (Hinckley et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2015 ). The number of      U.S. counties now considered to be of high incidence for Lyme      disease has increased by more than 300% in the Northeastern      states and by approximately 250% in the North-Central states.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)      currently recognizes 18 tick-borne pathogens in the United      States. However, researchers and health care practitioners      continue to discover emerging disease agents and new medical      conditions associated with tick bites.       While most Lyme disease patients who are diagnosed and      treated early can fully recover, 10 to 20% of patients suffer      from persistent symptoms, which for some are chronic and      disabling. Studies indicate that Lyme disease costs      approximately $1.3 billion each year in direct medical costs      alone in the United States. A comprehensive understanding of      the full economic and societal cost remains unknown. It is      likely orders of magnitude higher and potentially a $50- to      $100-billion-dollar problem for the United States, although      more research is needed (Vanderhoof & Vanderhoof-Forschner,      1993; Zhang et al., 2006).       Prompt diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases are      crucial to prevent long-term complications. Today, available      diagnostic tests can be inaccurate and complex to interpret,      especially during the earliest stage of infection when      treatment is most effective. Unlike in other infectious      disease settings, tests to directly measure the presence of      the infecting organism, such as cultures or tissue biopsies,      are not available for some tick-borne diseases such as Lyme      disease. This leaves physicians without the tools needed to      diagnose; and without an accurate diagnosis, it is      challenging for physicians to provide early treatment.       Persistent symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease can be      severe, yet their cause(s) remains unknown and debated. There      are currently no uniformly accepted or validated treatment      options for patients with these chronic symptoms. As a      result, uncertainty surrounding appropriate clinical care has      led to polarization within the medical community, and      patients are often left suffering in limbo without a clear      path to illness resolution or even symptom management (Rebman      et al., 2017). The lack of a clear path for treatment of      persistent symptoms in some patients with Lyme disease     and other tick-borne diseases not only amplifies patient      suffering but also significantly increases health care costs.       This report outlines an integrated, multipronged approach      to the growing public health challenges posed by tick-borne      diseases in the United States. It contains nine main      chapters, including Background; Methods; Epidemiology and      Ecology; Prevention; Diagnosis; Treatment; Access to Care,      Patient Outcomes; Looking Forward; and Conclusion. The      Background and Methods chapters explain how the report was      developed. The other chapters present the main challenges,      key issues, and recommendations specific to the broader      topics.       To understand tick-borne diseases, we need to first      understand tick ecology and how ticks transmit diseases. Due      to the lack of a coordinated national surveillance program,      currently there are significant gaps in information on local      distribution of infection-causing ticks, especially in      regions beyond the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nationwide,      standardized approaches for tick, animal, and human      surveillance are needed to understand the geographic      distribution of infectious ticks in order to understand the      spread of disease and predict where people are at risk.      Advanced technologies and systematic studies are also needed      to rapidly identify new disease agents that pose emergent      risks to public health, including to the blood supply. Given      that seven new tick-borne pathogens have been shown to infect      people in the United States since 2004,this is a priority.       Effective prevention relies on multi-pronged strategies. To      reduce exposure to ticks, we need a comprehensive      understanding of the biological drivers behind the continued      spread of tick-borne diseases, so that effective tick- and      infection control methods can be identified and validated.      Need also exists for the transparent development of a safe,      effective human vaccine to prevent Lyme disease, the most      common of these illnesses. In the absence of effective      strategies for controlling ticks and blocking the      transmission of tick-borne pathogens, it is crucial to      educate health care leadership are needed to reverse the      alarming professionals and the public about tick-borne      disease prevention, especially best practices for protection      from tick bites. Outreach efforts to promote prevention and      raise awareness among physicians and the public must be      expanded at both the Federal and state level to ensure      accurate, effective, and consistent messaging.       Clinical research priorities must include the development      of new technologies and approaches to improve diagnosis of      tick-borne diseases and monitor response to treatment. There      is a critical need for sensitive and specific direct-pathogen      detection strategies that are broad enough to cover multiple      potential tickborne pathogens. Understanding the etiology and      pathogenesis of ongoing symptoms after initial treatment      should be a clinical research priority. Investigations are      also needed into the potential roles of immunologic      responses, bacterial persistence, and coinfecting pathogens      in order to design and test new therapies and, ultimately,      improve outcomes and care for patients with ongoing symptoms.       Americans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a      lack of attention at the Federal level and by divisions      within the field. The recommendations in this 2018 report of      the TickBorne Disease Working Group represent a longterm      investment in tackling the rise of tick-borne diseases in      this country. However, immediate changes are also required to      help patients already suffering from tick-borne diseases; to      protect them from discrimination; and to address the      inflexible, inconsistent, and often unaffordable care that      patients frequently encounter in the current health care      system.       Increaseed Federal funding, prioritzation, and leadership      are needed to reverse the alarming trends associated with      tick-borne diseases. Despite several decades of research,      prevention, and educational activities, Federal funding for      tick-borne diseases is less per new surveillance case than      that of other diseases. The U.S. National Institutes of      Health (NIH) and CDC spend $77,355 and $20,293, respectively,      per new surveillance case of HIV/AIDS, and $36,063 and      $11,459 per new case of hepatitis C virus, yet only $768 and      $302 for each new case of Lyme disease. Federal funding for      tick-borne diseases today is orders of magnitude lower,      compared to other public health threats, and it has failed to      increase as the problem has grown.       It is also essential that funding and resources be      allocated to support a comprehensive, interagency program to      address the mounting challenges identified in this report.      All research, prevention, and education initiatives should be      inclusive of special populations such as children, who suffer      disproportionately from tick-borne diseases. Patients whose      lives continue to be disrupted by the lasting effects of      these illnesses are counting on emerging scientific research,      evidence-based policy, and the health care establishment--     including the Federal Government with Congressional and      Executive leadership--to provide solutions. We must act now.'
