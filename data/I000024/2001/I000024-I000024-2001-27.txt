I do want as much as anyone in the Senate an authorization to pass, and pass quickly. I know if we had that motion and overruled the ruling of the Chair, that would open it up and it would be disaster and we would not get a bill. So I would not do that. I am not going to.  I ask you not make that motion, but if you do make the motion, I encourage the Chair to realize and read--this is not the amendment I had before. This is merely directly relating to defense.
