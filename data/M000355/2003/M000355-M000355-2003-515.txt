 President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a message from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 3) to prohibit the procedure commonly known as partial-birth abortion.  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:       Resolved, That the House insist upon its amendment to the      bill (S. 3) entitled ``An Act to prohibit the procedure      commonly known as partial-birth abortion'', and ask a     conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the      two Houses thereon.       Ordered, That the following Members be the managers of the      conference on the part of the House.       From the Committee on the Judiciary for consideration of      the Senate bill and the House amendment, and modifications      committed to conference: Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Hyde, and Mr.      Nadler.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that 2 hours of debate on this proposal are to commence. I ask unanimous consent that those 2 hours begin to run upon the arrival and speaking of the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who I understand is on the way to the floor at this time.
