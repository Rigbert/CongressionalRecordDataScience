Speaker, I raise the point of order that under the rules of the committee, at the request of the committee, we have signed confidentiality agreements. I have not disclosed any information which I have received that was confidential information. The Chairman now says that confidential information is going to be disclosed because the agreements have been signed.  I am not sure I understand that, and whether from a parliamentary standpoint confidential information is appropriate to be disclosed on the floor of this House. We cannot have it both ways, Mr. Speaker.
