  He says:       As you know, the Commodity Exchange Act provides the CFTC      with broad emergency authority to take action, in its      discretion, in order to maintain or restore orderly trading.      In your proposed legislation, you have identified critically      important areas of concern--excessive speculation in energy      commodities, classification of bank holding companies and      limits on their energy trading, hedge fund registration,      classification and trading limits, conflicts of interest by      entities that both trade and advise in the energy arena, and      foreign market access. I wholeheartedly agree with you that      the time to act on these issues is now, and the CFTC should      aggressively utilize all available authorities as      appropriate, including but not limited to emergency authority      as currently defined in the CEA, to address these pressing      issues.  Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his support of this legislation.  On May 28, I wrote to Gary Gensler, the new Chairman of the CFTC, urging him to undertake many of these initiatives. Last week, in my office, I discussed this issue with Mr. Gensler. He indicated that he has instructed his staff to give him a list of all of the options available to the CFTC to respond to these concerns. While I appreciate Mr. Gensler's efforts on this issue, I hope this legislation will spur the CFTC to take immediate action to lower oil prices.  The bottom line is, right now, at a time when unemployment is soaring, when the middle class is struggling to keep its head above water, the prices at the gas pump are soaring, and we worry about what oil prices in the northern parts of our country will be in the wintertime, there is very strong evidence to suggest that what we are talking about is not supply and demand but excessive speculation on the part of Wall Street in terms of pushing up oil futures.  This Congress must act to protect the middle class and working people of this country, the consumers of this country. It is time for us to demand that the CFTC take the action that is necessary.                                 ______                                       By
