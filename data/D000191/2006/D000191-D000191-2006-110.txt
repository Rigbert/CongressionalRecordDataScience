 Well, when we first heard about widespread wiretapping by the administration without legal authority under the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, the President said not to worry, just a handful of individuals, and only when they are communicating with people outside the U.S. Well, maybe not a handful. Maybe a few hundred. No, maybe 10,000 or thousands.  Oops. Now it actually turns out that they are monitoring and have asked for the records of the phone calls of hundreds of millions of Americans. Over a trillion phone call records, we are told. They say they need this to protect America. What are they going to do with this mountain of data? They are going to apply a complicated mathematical algorithm to it and they are going to find some terrorists. Thus far they have raided two takeout services and one call center. That is what they have yielded from this. How about good old-fashioned intelligence with humans and police work?  Let's look at the bungling that led up to 9/11. Actually the new nominee who headed the NSA who has perhaps perjured himself about these billions of monitored records, he had in his hands a communication from al Qaeda on 9/11, actually on 9/10, saying, tomorrow is zero hour. But the NSA didn't bother to translate that until after 9/11.  Then we had the FBI. Now, Agent Samit said he had a communication about Moussaoui from French intelligence in August after he had been arrested by the FBI saying he was very dangerous, indoctrinated in radical Islamic fundamentalism, completely devoted to radical fundamentalism and Osama bin Laden. But his superiors didn't think that was enough to give him a warrant to open Moussaoui's computer and perhaps stop 9/11.  That's why we need to monitor the phone calls of billions of phone calls made by Americans, because of the incompetence of the people running these agencies.  Now, Agent Samit sent a letter to FBI headquarters accusing Moussaoui of plotting international terrorism and air piracy. This is August. August, before 9/11. Then Agent Rowley came forward and also gave us the same information. Agent Samit also asked for help from the FBI's London, Paris and Oklahoma City offices, FBI headquarters, CIA counterterrorism center, Secret Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Federal Aviation Administration, an intelligence agency not identified but presumed to be the National Security Agency headed by General Hayden who failed to translate the warning before 9/11. But we need to monitor the phone calls of law-abiding Americans, billions of them. What a wild goose chase. They want to cover up the extraordinary incompetence that allowed these stumblebums to launch a devastating attack on America by saying they are doing something now by monitoring billions of phone calls. This is absolutely outrageous.  Let's go back a little further. There were two other guys involved, Nawafal Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar. Now, they were tracked to the planning meeting, pretty good work, by the CIA over in Southeast Asia. That's good. Unfortunately, they didn't have listening devices, they didn't have agents go through them, they didn't know what they were planning, but they knew they were bad guys planning something. Then they lost track of them. Where did they go? Well, they traveled legally to the United States of America with visas issued by the Bush State Department, they lived openly in San Diego with listed phone numbers, but they were never visited or monitored by the FBI or anybody else, even though the CIA knew these were bad guys.  But what are we going to do in response to this incompetence? Well, we'll give the people involved gold medals and great retirements. Mr. Tenet, who was heading the CIA, he got a gold medal for freedom from the President. No one has ever taken the fall for this incompetence. Now, instead, they are trying to divert us and say, what we're going to do is monitor all the telephone conversations of all Americans and apply a mathematical algorithm. So the next time we have a terrorist in hand, we won't open his computer, either, because we'll be watching the algorithms and the phone calls of law-abiding Americans.  What unbelievable incompetence on the part of this administration, in addition to law-breaking. The American people are not well served by this. We need to clean up this mess and truly protect America.                          ____________________[Pages H2599-H2600]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      NSA'S PHONE RECORDS PROGRAM  Mr. DeFAZIO.
