President, I tell the Senator that my only concern--and I am perfectly willing to make sure he is protected, however the time works. I think by mistake somebody on the other side of the aisle yielded some of my time without my permission.  I ask unanimous consent that I be restored to a full 30 minutes, without in any way interfering with the time of the Senator.
