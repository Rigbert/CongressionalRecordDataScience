We are raising this issue on a bill which has real relevance to the question of our national security and law enforcement in keeping America safe.  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut--we think of the tragedy that occurred in your State with those 20 beautiful children who were killed in their classroom at Sandy Hook. We think of what happened in San Bernardino and what has happened across America and now most recently in Orlando. But the point I tried to make earlier was that those are mass murders--more than four people killed in each instance--but for many of us, the urban violence that every day, every weekend is claiming even more lives should also be our concern.  I mentioned to the Senator earlier that when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took a look at the crime guns that were confiscated in the worst, deadliest sections of Chicago, 40 percent of them came from gun shows in northern Indiana, where people did not submit themselves to a background check; they just went in and bought guns in volume to come and sell them to gangbangers and thugs on the streets of Chicago.  Our intention is to focus clearly on mass murder but even more so on gun violence in America to protect innocent people who are losing their lives to those who would abuse the use of firearms and those who would turn to these assault weapons, which have no purpose for the legitimate hunter or sportsman. I have said that if you need an AK-47 or AR-15 to hunt a deer, you ought to stick to fishing because that is not the weapon of choice of real sportsmen in my State or those whom I know.  I ask the Senator, when it comes to this general issue of gun violence, even though we speak of terrorists as part of this, how will closing the loopholes have value to the overall issue of gun violence?
