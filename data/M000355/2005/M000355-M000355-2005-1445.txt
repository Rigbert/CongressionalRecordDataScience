 President, today we open with a 1-hour period for morning business. At 2 today, we will resume consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. As we announced at the close of last week, Members can expect one or two votes this evening in relation to the appropriations bill. Chairman Cochran will be here when we resume the bill, and we will be consulting with the two managers and the Democratic leader as to exactly what votes we can expect today at approximately 5:30.  On Friday, cloture was filed on the two pending amendments relating to AgJOBS. In addition to these two cloture votes, we have cloture votes scheduled on the Mikulski amendment on visas, as well as the underlying bill. To remind all of our colleagues, the two AgJOBS cloture votes are scheduled for 11:45 a.m. tomorrow. The cloture vote on the Mikulski amendment and the cloture vote on the bill will occur later tomorrow afternoon. I hope we can invoke cloture on the bill tomorrow. That will be the only way to ensure that we finish our work this week on this extremely important funding legislation. Therefore, Senators can expect votes each day this week as we work our way through the issues related to the supplemental appropriations bill.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S3767]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
