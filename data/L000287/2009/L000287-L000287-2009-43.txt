Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we cannot wait another moment to pass health reform. We need health care, and we need it now. The American people cannot wait. Health care delayed is health care denied. It is our moral obligation to lead the way. Every day that we wait, 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance. People losing their health, their homes or their very lives because our health system does not work for them. This is not right. It is not just. It is not fair.  And we can do better. We can do much better. At the March on Washington 46 years ago, I said, ``They tell us to wait. They tell us to be patient.'' We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. I say, today, we want health care reform, and we want it now. We must answer the call of history and pass health care reform, and pass it now.                          ____________________
