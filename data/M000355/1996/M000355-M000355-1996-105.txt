 President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill. Under the agreement reached last night, the Senate will begin 30 minutes of debate on the McCain amendment No. 5017 regarding antiterrorism efforts. Senators can expect a rollcall vote on or in relation to that amendment no later than 10 o'clock this morning, if all debate time is used.  Additional amendments are anticipated. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the session of the Senate today. The majority leader has indicated that he hopes to complete action on this bill today. I might say that I think that is entirely possible. We have a number of amendments that are anticipated to be offered that would be acceptable, and there is really no reason why we should not be able to complete this bill today. The leader then plans to turn to the consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill following final passage of this bill.  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona here. I will yield the floor.
