Opportunity Enterprises also honored and congratulated President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gary Mitchell, who will be retiring this year. In 1986, Gary joined the team at Opportunity Enterprises as the Chief Executive Officer. Opportunity Enterprises has enjoyed unprecedented growth and success under Gary's leadership. In 1986, the organization served 263 individuals with disabilities on a daily basis. Since then, Opportunity Enterprises has constantly expanded and now serves over 1,000 individuals within Porter County and throughout Northwest Indiana. For the past 15 years, Opportunity Enterprises has received accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), a not-for-profit organization that establishes standards of quality for service to people with disabilities. For his efforts over the years on behalf of his community, Gary has received numerous honors, including the Indiana Association of Rehabilitation Facilities (INARF) President's Award in 1992 and the Sagamore of the Wabash in 1993 from then-Governor Evan Bayh. For his selfless and passionate support for helping individuals to re-establish their roles in community life, Mr. Mitchell is to be commended and admired.  Gary's dedication to the people he serves is matched only by his devotion to his family. Gary has been married to his wife, Paula, for an astonishing 44 years. They have three children and seven grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Opportunity Enterprises 2010 Achievement Award winners, as well as Mr. Gary Mitchell, for their outstanding contributions. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for countless individuals in Northwest Indiana is truly inspirational, and they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
