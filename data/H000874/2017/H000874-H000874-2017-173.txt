 Mr. McCARTHY. Let me first answer the number of points you have made because I want history to be written correctly.  First of all, you were shocked. I don't know why you were shocked. I thought you were going to say you were shocked that that exact same week, when you read the paper, 94 counties out of 99 in Iowa would have no healthcare if ObamaCare continued to go forward. I thought that would have shocked you.  Then, when you wanted to put dates down and talk about hearings, we had more than 113 hearings. That is more than the number of hearings you had for ObamaCare.  Our bill is less than 150 pages. That is thousands of pages less than ObamaCare.  You talk of CBO. You know that CBO scored this bill, but those eight pages of amendments you were shocked by. You shouldn't be shocked to know the rules of the House, that you do not move a bill until the CBO score of those eight pages is done. That will be done next week, and we will move it right along.  But let's go on further because I do want history to be written correctly.  We marked up this bill in three separate committees, with over 18 hours of debate in Ways and Means and over 27 hours of debate in Energy and Commerce. We debated countless amendments in committees, from both Republicans and Democrats, even the ones where the Democrats asked that they change the name to have some hashtag. We spent hours on that, but we did that because we believed that was important to you.  Now, our bill eliminates the many taxes and mandates of ObamaCare. It gives patients enhanced tools to take control of their own healthcare decisions, and it expands choice for Americans.  So, yes, I am shocked every day I read the paper that more Americans are going to lose their healthcare if ObamaCare stays where it is or that people will even pay more, because I remember the promise the President made that our premiums would go down or we could keep our own doctor, which so many thousands of Americans found out to be a lie.  So, Mr. Speaker, I understand politics. I understand the phrases and the adjectives people can use, but there is no reason to be shocked that we kept our word of what we would do for the last 6 years. There is no reason to be shocked that the American public put a majority in the House and the Senate and the Presidency which, I would argue for the main purpose, that they want greater choice in their healthcare system.  So, yes, if I go to Iowa, I go to Tennessee, those 16 counties there that will no longer have healthcare--or what about Aetna? You didn't even mention them pulling out of Virginia. You weren't shocked by that either.  But you know what? Eight pages of amendments that stayed out there for everybody to read--not more than 2,000--yes, we will wait until the CBO finishes scoring the amendments and send it to the Senate. Yes, we know what is in those amendments, just as everybody else had the opportunity to read them, just as we went through the Rules Committee.                              {time}  1215  So there are lots of things to be shocked by, but don't ever be shocked by: We go by the rules of the House. Ithink you should be shocked by the number of faces, the number of families that will not have healthcare if we did not act.
