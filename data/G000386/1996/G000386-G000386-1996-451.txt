 President, first, just one sentence to compliment the now Presiding Officer, the Senator from Indiana for his leadership on getting the farm bill passed. I am going to speak tomorrow on the farm bill. This evening, in morning business, I am speaking on the subject of the drug problem.                          ____________________
