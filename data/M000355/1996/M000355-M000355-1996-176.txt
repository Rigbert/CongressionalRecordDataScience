 President, it is my understanding Senator McCain and Senator Coverdell both have amendments to lay down. The McCain amendment is the one we will be able to schedule a vote on at 9:30 in the morning. It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from Arizona would like to proceed first.  Mr. McCAIN. If that is agreeable with the distinguished managers of the bill.                           Amendment No. 5017  (Purpose: To require information on cooperation with United States    anti-terrorism efforts in the annual country reports on terrorism)  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
