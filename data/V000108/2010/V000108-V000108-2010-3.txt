 Had I been present for rollcall 527, on agreeing to H. Res. 1620, providing for the consideration of H.R. 4785, the Rural Energy Savings Program Act, I would have voted ``aye.''  Had I been present for rollcall 528, on a motion to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate Amendments to H.R. 3562, a measure to designate the Federal building under construction at 1220 Echelon Parkway in Jackson, Mississippi, as the Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner Federal Building, I would have voted ``aye.''                          ____________________
