Speaker, I rise today to pay solemn tribute to the 21 police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty during the 64 year history of the Prince George's County Police Force. Their sacrifice is overshadowed only by the tremendous contributions they have made to their communities and the gratitude of their Nation.  We are painfully aware, Mr. Speaker, that it was in protecting others from harm that these men came to harm themselves. We know that our words will never replace what has been taken from their loved ones. For the families, the hurt will never diminish. The pain will never go away. And the memory of what was and the potential of what could have been will live with them always.  I believe the strength of America lies in the responsibilities that ordinary citizens quietly fulfill everyday to their families, their communities, and their country. Law enforcement officers summon a special courage from within to go beyond the call.  These officers do so without fanfare, without public acclaim and without a desire for personal gain. As long as there are courageous and committed men and women willing to walk in harm's way to protect us, our children, our communities and our way of life, then there will be an America.  One of those officers who served bravely and nobly without fanfare was Prince George's County Police Sergeant John J. Novabilski. Sergeant ``Nova'' as he was known was only 31 years of age when he was brutally struck down by a volley of bullets on April 26, 1995--A reprehensible and senseless act. John Novabilski joined the Prince George's County Police Force in 1988 after working as a Baltimore City police officer for three years. He was promoted to the rank of police officer first class in May, 1990 and to Corporal in November, 1991. Officer Novabilski was promoted posthumously to sergeant by acting Prince George's County Police Chief Alphonso Hawkins.  Acting Police Chief Alphonso Hawkins said at Sergeant Novabilski's memorial service, ``To John's family and friends, I know there is nothing I can do or say to fill the void left in your lives, but you have my word that his sacrifice, and yours, will not be forgotten by our police family, the citizens of Prince George's County, or our Nation.'' Indeed, Mr. Speaker, the ultimate betrayal would be to forget.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert here in the Record, the names of those additional 20 police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to all of the citizens of Prince George's County, Maryland. The listing appeared in the May 18, 1995 edition of the Prince George's Journal.                     Officers Slain in Line of Duty       Edward D. Merson; Sept. 1, 1937. Officer Merson, who died      in a single-car accident in Muirkirk, was the first member of      the police force to be killed in the line of duty.       Charles F. Caldwell; June 12, 1948. Officer Caldwell was      fatally shot with his own pistol by the enraged father of a      stabbing suspect. He was the first county officer to be shot      to death in the line of duty.       Alfred W. Steinat; May 2, 1963. Officer Steinat was fatally      shot in the back by Thomas Hadder, who was wanted for      stealing a tire, during a struggle with the suspect.       Joseph K. Brown; Feb. 19, 1966. Sgt. Brown was fatally shot      by Carl Knicely, the 17-year-old son of a man wanted for      indecent exposure, while serving a warrant for the youth's      father at their home in Adelphi.       John W. Leatherbury Jr.; March 21, 1968. Officer      Leatherbury was killed in a helicopter accident while riding      in the craft as an observer during a routine night patrol.      The civilian pilot of the helicopter, William Hanley, also      died in the crash.       Robert E. Yeszerski; Nov. 30, 1968. Officer Yeszerski and a      Seat Pleasant town officer were fatally shot by Willis      Underwood while attempting to impound Underwood's car from a      Seat Pleasant side street. Underwood was convicted of      murdering Yeszerski and officer William R. Clements in the      incident.       William W. Gullett Jr.; Feb. 16, 1969. Officer Gullett was      fatally shot by James F. Jarred while attempting to disarm      the shooter at his Kentland apartment. Both Gullett and      another officer were able to return fire, killing Jarred.       Carroll D. Garrison; Feb. 20, 1973. Officer Garrison was      fatally shot by James Law while investigating a burglary call      at a house in Chillum. Law, the owner of the house, turned      himself in to police a short time after the shooting,      claiming he mistook Garrison for a prowler.       Albert M. Claggett IV/James B. Swart; June 26, 1978.      Officers Claggett and Swart were fatally shot by Terrence      Johnson with Claggett's service revolver inside the      Hyattsville District station. Johnson was convicted of      manslaughter in Claggett's death, and found not guilty by      reason of insanity in the death of Swart, recently was      paroled after serving 16 years of his 25-year sentence.       Antonio M. Kelsey; Feb 2, 1980. Officer Kelsey was working      as a part-time security guard for a Kentland liquor store      when he was fatally shot by Steven Baines, who had approached      the officer with a bag of marijuana and then fled. Baines was      convicted of second-degree murder in the killing. Kelsey was      the first black county officer to be killed in the line of      duty.       Raymond Hubbard; Feb. 8, 1982. Officer Hubbard was killed      by two men while trying to stop a jewelry story robbery at      Iverson Mall. The death of Hubbard, who was off-duty at the      time, is considered an in-the-line-of-duty casualty.       Allan D. Johnson; Dec. 6, 1982. Cpl. Johnson, a motorcycle      patrolman, was giving a citation to a driver on I-95 when he      was struck by a passing vehicle. Johnson died two days later.      The driver of the vehicle that hit him was charged with      manslaughter and driving under the influence of PCP.       Carlton X. Fletcher; June 11, 1983. Officer Fletcher was      working as a part-time security guard in Greenbelt when he      was shot by two men during an armed robbery. Fletcher's      killers were charged with first-degree murder and received      life sentences in the slaying.       Richard J. Beavers; Nov. 29, 1983. Capt. Beavers was      fatally shot during a gunfight with two men who were      attempting to rob him in a Suitland parking lot. Beavers was      sitting in an unmarked car at the time of the incident. His      assailants were arrested and convicted of first-degree      murder.       Harry L. Kinikin Jr.; Jan. 13, 1990. On Oct. 17, 1986, Cpl.      Kinikin was stabbed by a woman in the parking lot of a      Landover 7-Eleven, where he had stopped to make a phone call.      Kinikin survived for three years [[Page E1085]] after the      attack before dying in 1990 of complications from his      injuries.       Mark K. Murphy; Sept. 1, 1988. Officer Murphy, a member of      the department's Emergency Services Team, died when shot      accidentally by two fellow officers while serving a search      warrant at the Riverdale home of a suspected drug offender.       Ryan C. Johnson Jr.; April 22, 1992. Cpl. Johnson was      fatally shot in a gunfire with two teens who tried to rob him      in Capitol Heights. Both youths were convicted of murder in      the killing.       Roger P. Fleming; Oct. 27, 1992. Sgt. Fleming was killed      while attempting to apprehend suspected car thieves in      Cheverly. Fleming was pursuing the men at high speed when he      lost control of his cruiser and struck a tree.       John L. Bagileo; Feb. 28, 1994. Cpl. Bagileo died when he      lost control of his cruiser during a high-speed response and      crashed into a utility pole in Seat Pleasant. Bagileo's name      was inscribed this year on a national memorial to officers      who died in the line of duty.  To the families and friends of those fallen law enforcement officers in Prince Georges County and throughout this great Nation of ours, words cannot express the sorrow for their loss nor the gratitude for their sacrifices. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with my colleagues the policeman's prayer.  ``Oh Almighty God, whose great power and eternal wisdom embraces the universe, watch over all policemen and law enforcement officers. Protect them from harm in the performance of their duty to stop crime, robberies, riots, and violence. We pray help them keep our streets and homes safe day and night. We recommend them to your loving care because their duty is dangerous. Grant them Your unending strength and courage in their daily assignments. Dear God, protect these brave men and women, grant them Your almighty protection, unite them safely with their families after duty has ended. Amen.''                          ____________________
