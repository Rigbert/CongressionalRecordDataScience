 President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a very fine Kentuckian and World War II veteran, Mr. Eldred Musgrove of McCreary County, KY. Eldred, who is now 91, has played an instrumental role in developing many of the basic services that are currently enjoyed by the citizens of McCreary County, KY.  Eldred was raised in Strunk, KY, in a house just behind the old Lum Strunk homeplace. As a teenager, he became familiar with responsibility and hard work. The oldest of six, by the time he was 14, Eldred remembers having to help raise his brothers and sisters after their mother passed away. He recalls carrying his 3-year-old baby brother to his grandmother's each morning and returning each afternoon to pick him up, before walking a mile himself just to get to school each day.  ``When I was 16, I worked my first `real' job,'' Eldred explains. At the time, ex-county sheriff Neil Stephens owned a sawmill that was located up above the Marsh Creek Schoolhouse. ``He paid me 10 cents an hour to roll logs down for him to saw,'' Eldred says. As a result, Eldred developed a resilient worth ethic, which would eventually help pave the way to a long and successful career in community service.  Eldred met Sophie, who is 90 years old and his wife of 64 years, while they attended school together at Pine Knot as kids. ``I didn't pay any attention to her when we were in school!'' he recalls. After he returned home from the military, though, Eldred got a job working at the Ford garage in Stearns and began to see Sophie as he drove home from work each day. They began dating and have been happily married ever since.  Not long after they wed, Eldred began taking a more active role in the community. ``I became a charter member of the Pine Knot Kiwanis Club in 1950,'' he remembers. Eldred and the organization were very active for several years, selling stock, helping to establish the county's first dial-telephone company, and even playing an instrumental role in helping to build the first Pine Knot fire truck. In 1967, Eldred helped form the McCreary County Fire Commission and served as the board chairman for the South McCreary County Fire Department for many years.  Eldred also served as one of three original water commissioners for the McCreary County Water District. Eldred presided over the Pine Knot portion of the district he helped create. In his later years, he became involved with the McCreary County Development Association, and also served as a member of McCreary County's first airport board, where he helped develop a local runway. Additionally, Eldred has also been a member of the McCreary County Industrial Development Association, the first Stearns Museum Board, and the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation for 31 years.  These days, the Musgrove home is decorated with countless photographs, certificates, and awards including a picture of Eldred shaking President Bill Clinton's hand that serve as a reminder of Mr. Musgrove's many successes and achievements throughout the years. However, Eldred admits that he is not yet finished. ``I still have a job to do. My job may be taking care of my wife, writing letters to congressmen, or erecting a monument. All I know is that I still have a job to do.''  Mr. President, Mr. Eldred Musgrove's long life of selflessness and service to McCreary County and his fellow Kentuckians is truly admirable. Mr. Musgrove is a true American patriot and an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth. A local newspaper, the McCreary County Voice, published an article on October 20, 2011, to celebrate Mr. Musgrove's many accomplishments in life. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the McCreary County Voice, Oct. 20, 2011]                          Making a Difference                           (By Eugenia Jones)       You may or may not be personally acquainted with Eldred      Musgrove, but if you are a resident of McCreary County, the      energetic 91-year-old probably touches your life on a daily      basis. Not only did he serve his country in World War II, but      Musgrove, throughout his life, has been instrumental in the      development of many of the basic services currently enjoyed      by citizens of the county.       Growing up in Strunk, Kentucky, in a house just behind the      old Lum Strunk homeplace, Eldred probably did not see himself      becoming such a civic-minded adult. At the age of 14 and as      the oldest of six children, Eldred helped to take care of his      brothers and sisters when his mother died. He recalls walking      more than a mile to school each day because there were no      school buses. On his way to school, Eldred would carry his      three-year-old baby brother to his grandmother's house and      then return on his way back home from school to carry the      toddler home. Eldred grins, ``I've never had a chance to      study, but I still managed to make Cs throughout school. When      I got home, instead of studying, I had to take care of the      stove wood. My dad was rather thrifty, but he managed to take      care of us. Dad worked some in coal, and later, he went      together with his brother and bought a 1933 model Chevrolet      truck to haul stone for building schools through the WPA. Dad      was also good at making moonshine stills and made them for      everybody around. He had customers from as far away as      Lexington and Cincinnati. I wanted to go into the CCC, but      dad wouldn't let me.''       As a teenager, Eldred was not afraid of hard work. When he      was 12 years old, Musgrove sold ``Grit'' newspapers to people      all over the southern end of the county. Musgrove shares his      memories of one special customer. ``I remember one customer      in particular. His name was Andy Galimore. He was a Spanish-     American War veteran. He lived up on a ridge across the      railroad at Pine Knot. He had a vineyard, and he would let me      pick all the grapes that I wanted. Andy Galimore must have      been a secretary or something like that for his unit, because      he had a roster of names that he let me see. The roster      listed the names of men and told different types of      information about them. It told when the men were absent,      when they were promoted, and all of the different things they      did in the service.''       ``When I was 16, I worked my first `real' job. I worked for      Neil Stephens, who was an ex-county sheriff living on Cal      Hill. His sawmill was up above the Marsh Creek Schoolhouse.      He paid me 10 cents an hour to roll logs down for him to saw.      The mill used a steam boiler, and they had to get up steam in      order to saw. I also carried drinking water. I didn't get      money for pay. I got a slip to take to Manuel Creedmoor's      (O.K.'s) store to buy things. I bought school clothes.''       Eldred met the now 90-year-old Sophie, his wife of 64      years, while they attended the Pine Knot School together. He      laughs, ``I didn't pay any attention to her when we were in      school! When I came back home from the military, I got a job      at the Ford garage in Stearns. She walked home from where she      worked, and I drove home from my work in an old pickup truck.      We started meeting. I'd toot the horn and wave at her.      Finally, I asked her to go to the show with me. We went from      there by going out to a show together and ended up where we      are now by being married for 64 years! I don't remember the      name of the show, but I do remember going to pick her up one      time. There was a store sitting up on the corner of the road      going to her house. There was a big long bench outside. The      road to Sophie's house was so bad that I couldn't drive out      it so she would meet me at the store. One time I was sitting      on the bench waiting on her and another fellow was sitting      there talking to me. He said he had a date with a ``Meadows''      girl. I said, `Well, I do too!' It wasn't long before Sophie      showed up with her sister as a date for the other fellow!''       After Eldred and Sophie married, Eldred began taking an      active role in trying to serve his community. He remembers      the influence of the Kiwanis Club during the early      development of the county. ``I became a charter member of the      Pine Knot Kiwanis Club in 1950. The club was very active for      a few years. Pine Knot, at that time, had only 12 telephones      on two party lines. The Kiwanis Club started selling stock      and formed the first dial-telephone company in the county.      The company had 128 customers and was doing well. However, we      couldn't afford a full-time maintenance man. When the      Highland Telephone Company offered 150 percent on our stock,      we ended up selling out to them. We made sure that we sold      under the condition that we would get free service all across      McCreary County and in Scotty County. I remember some of the      board members when the phones were with the Kiwanis. I was on      the board, as well as Leon Hayes, Gorman Strunk, Harold      Hickman, Smith Ross, Autis Ross, and Ralph Chaney.''       The Kiwanis were also instrumental in helping to build the      first Pine Knot fire     truck. Musgrove can remember when Clarence Harmon picked up a      pump and gave it to the Kiwanis to use. ``We kept it up at      the service station, and it froze and burst. I only remember      us putting out one fire with it and that was in a cabin down      at the Shell Grove. Later, when Bob Anderson was county      judge-executive, there was a salesman with two fire trucks      for sale. Bob appointed me and Bon L. Bybee to check on the      trucks. Tweedy Hatfield helped too. In 1967, with the help of      Mr. Wright from the Bank of McCreary County, we ended up      forming the McCreary County Fire Commission and bought a      truck for Pine Knot and one for Whitley City. I was the board      chairman for the South McCreary County Fire Department for      many years. During that time, we built the sub-station at      Holy Hill.''       Musgrove also played a role in the initial development of      the McCreary County Water District. Judge-Executive Prince      Stephens appointed Musgrove, Bill Gilreath, and Alfred Kidd      as water commissioners for the Pine Knot/Revelo area. ``We      brought engineers out of Tennessee to help build a water      district,'' Musgrove recalls. ``They did a study of the      county and recommended that we join together with the Whitley      City Water District. Whitley hadn't done much, so we decided      to eliminate the two districts and form one new McCreary      County Water District. I represented Pine Knot. A.W. Holmes      represented Whitley City, and Dr. Winchester represented      Stearns. We were the first three water commissioners for      McCreary County. The three of us ended up signing a personal      note and buying a farm that was for sale. That's where the      water reservoir was built. There was a problem, though, when      the lake covered five acres of Forest Service land. We had to      get a special permit to take care of that!''       Years later, Musgrove became involved with the McCreary      County Development Association. The Association was formed to      help the water department and McCreary County. Musgrove      remembers when the water department discovered that they      could get grants to run water lines to industrial sites. He      smiles as he explains, ``I remember those people saying that      they hoped we were smart enough to find a site away from      town. I guess we went to the extreme! Industrial sites were      bought in Greenwood and near the state line. We managed to      get a grant that let us lay water lines to those sites on      both ends of the county!''       In addition to busying himself with McCreary County      telephone, water, and fire department concerns over the      years, Musgrove also turned his attention to the development      of a local airport by becoming a member of McCreary County's      first airport board. Musgrove can recall early attempts to      establish an airport. ``We found two pieces of property where      an airport could be built. Both tracts belonged to the Forest      Service. When we chose the Pine Knot site, we had to get a      special use permit from them. They had clear-cut the site and      planted it with pine trees. Burris Smith and I surveyed it      and finally got a dirt runway built. ``Doc'' Jim Anderson had      a small plane, and he became chairman of that board. We had      several people on the board, including Jim Burgess, Harold      Hickman, and Burris Smith. We got Bob Gable on there too,      because he knew people in Frankfort. Later, there was a land      exchange with the Forest Service, and McCreary County was      finally able to get the airport turned over to them.''       After serving on the McCreary County Airport Board for four      years, Musgrove went on to serve on the McCreary County      Industrial Development Association, the first Stearns Museum      Board, and, for 31 years, as a board member of the Kentucky      Highlands Investment Corporation Board. The Kentucky      Highlands Investment Corporation is an organization formed to      help fund businesses so that jobs are created. KHIC began in      the old wholesale building (now the Depot) in downtown      Stearns and has since moved to London, Kentucky, where it      currently serves over 20 counties. Musgrove and Bill      Singleton currently represent McCreary County.       Along with his active participation in the community      throughout the years, Musgrove has supported himself and his      family through self-employment. Musgrove operated a car body      and fender repair shop and was a plumbing and excavation      contractor. He and his wife also operated a mobile-home park.      Always eager to learn, Musgrove attended classes about      business law and small-business management.       Today, the walls of Musgrove's home are adorned with many      photographs, certificates, and awards. Photos of U.S.      presidents, including former President George W. Bush, are      displayed. One photograph, snapped when Musgrove visited a      factory as a KHIC board member, shows Eldred shaking the hand      of President Bill Clinton. Musgrove comments on that photo,      ``I shook his hand. It didn't make much difference to me that      he was the president.''       Eldred's latest project is an attempt to erect a monument      that displays the Ten Commandments and honors veterans. He      comments that he still has a job to accomplish in life. ``I      still have a job to do. I'm just not sure what it is. My job      may be taking care of my wife, writing letters to congressmen      or erecting a monument. All I know is that I still have a job      to do.'' So it is, that Eldred Musgrove, who was not overly      impressed by shaking the hand of the president, still finds      great happiness in ``making a difference'' in the lives of      his fellow McCreary Countians.                          ____________________
