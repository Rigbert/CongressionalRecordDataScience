President, if the majority leader could withhold just another moment, I want it clearly understood from this side that we are in agreement to pass the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. I believe it should be passed. I do not think it is right to be holding that up. We are also willing to pass the back-to-work provision. After all, we agreed to it and worked on drafting it last week.  I would express the same concern I expressed earlier today, that it is very difficult for Federal workers, who do want to go back to work, who are unable to pay their bills as time goes on, who are greatly needed just to have this country run the way it is supposed to, not going back to work, and yet they have seen, frankly, in the other body those who did not want to take this up have the taxpayers pay for their airfare to go back home for Christmas vacation and to pay their salaries of about $500 a day every day they are home for Christmas vacation, and have them say, ``We can't go forth.'' I think that is wrong.
