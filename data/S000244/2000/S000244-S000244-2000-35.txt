Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill extends launch indemnification to the U.S. commercial launch industry through the end of the year 2004, and authorizes funding for the Offices of Advanced Space Transportation and Space Commerce in the Departments of Transportation and Commerce. This is a bipartisan bill jointly sponsored by the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics; the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher); the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon); and the ranking minority member, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon).  The Federal Government first decided to indemnify commercial launch companies against catastrophic losses in 1990 as a means of rebuilding a launch industry which was critical for national security. Congress has traditionally reviewed indemnification in 5-year increments. At no cost to the government, the act successfully created a stable business environment that encouraged private firms to invest in improving U.S. space launch capabilities and maintaining their competitiveness with launchers from Europe, Russia, the Ukraine and China. By extending indemnification through 2004, we will eliminate the uncertainty created by 1-year renewals and restore a business environment that helps U.S. launch firms retain their competitiveness.  The House passed this bill last year by an overwhelming margin on suspension of the rules and should do so again now that the Senate has acted. The Senate has made only minor modifications. I urge all my colleagues to support this important measure.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
