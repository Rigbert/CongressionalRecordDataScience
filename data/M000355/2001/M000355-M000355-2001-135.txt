 President, we will discuss that off the floor because we will be running time on the budget resolution. That will be the main business next week. We certainly are not going to enter into an agreement that interrupts that in any major way. We will discuss that off the floor of the Senate.  We are open for business, and we will be processing amendments throughout the morning.
