Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the Engel-Gilman amendment to link United States contributions to the international fund for Ireland to these very important MacBride principles, principles we passed as part of H.R. 1561 last year.  I want to remind Members that when the President vetoed H.R. 1651 last year he went out of his way in a letter to Brian Atwood, the administrator of AID, to say that he is committed to fair employment principles for Catholics in the north of Ireland. The President went on to say that he vetoed that bill for reasons unrelated to the section dealing with the MacBride principles. So while today, the administration may put out language suggesting they are against this provision, in his August 1996 letter to Brian Atwood, the President himself said he was for the MacBride principles.  This is a very important fair employment piece of legislation.  Astonishingly, job discrimination against Catholics in the north of Ireland is the status quo. Consider these facts. Out of the 87,000 children below the poverty line, 58,000, or 66 percent, are Catholic. In Northern Ireland, over 42 percent of Catholic men are unemployed compared to 25 percent of their Protestant colleagues. According to the most recent Labor Force Survey, 55 percent of the unemployed are Catholics, even though they comprise 38 percent of the population over the age of 16.  United States support to the IFI is intended to help mitigate the social and economic problems that contribute to the civil unrest in Northern Ireland. People cannot come to a lasting peace agreement if they are the subject of ongoing, systematic, disparaging discrimination. The MacBride principles, which would eliminate religious-based discrimination in employment and job training, are modest and will go a long way to foster peace and justice in Northern Ireland. At least 16 States--including my home State of New Jersey--and more than 30 U.S. cities have adopted the MacBride principles. Similarly, the Federal Government should adopt this code and ensure that U.S. taxpayer funds do not go to subsidize discrimination in the work force.  Human rights abuses are far-reaching in the north of Ireland. Juryless Diplock courts, ill-treatment of individuals in detention, lack of access to attorneys, search and seizure abuses, sectarian use of plastic bullets, and religious discrimination are common human rights abuses in Northern Ireland. Linking our financial contributions to the IFI to the MacBride principles is a small step in addressing just one of the many human rights abuses that need to be eliminated in order for a lasting and just peace to be achieved in that region.  I wholeheartedly support the amendment and urge its adoption.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Engel].  The amendment was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments?                   Amendment Offered by Ms. Slaughter
