 President, I am pleased to rise today to congratulate 15 students and their teacher, Ms. Barbara Hudson, from Woodbridge High School in Bridgeville, DE, for their outstanding achievement in qualifying as finalists of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Consitiution'' program.  This program is administered by the Center for Civic Education which provides curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. These materials assist students in obtaining a working knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government.  Next, ``We the People'' conducts a 3-day competition which tests a student's knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. A mock Congressional committee hearing is conducted in which the students testify and then respond to questions on Constitutional issues before a panel of judges.  This demanding competition takes hard work and diligence to reach the national finals, which are being held in Washington, D.C. from May 6 to May 8, 2000. I am pleased to congratulate those students from Woodbridge High School who will be participating in the final stage of this competition: Jennifer Blackwell, Steve Breeding, Jarelle Bruso, John Conner, Rachel Dawson, Shawnita Dorman, Chelsea Ferrell, Adam Hickman, Jerome Holder, Nick LaRusso, Kat Leiter, Jennifer Sheets, Latoya Thompson, Robert Tribbett, and Jessica Umstetter. Together with the help of their teacher, Ms. Hudson, they successfully learned and applied a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. Their knowledge will be tested yet again during the national finals, where they will compete with more than 1,200 students from throughout the United States.  It is exciting to see these young people from Delaware and so many other students from across the Nation expressing interest in our country's Government. Programs such as ``We the People'' help to inspire new generations of leaders. These students from Woodbridge High School are shining examples of the promise bright young people offer the future of this country.  It is my honor to recognize these students who represent excellence in Delaware scholastics, and I am sure that my fellow Delawareans join me in wishing these young ``Constitutional experts'' the best of luck during the upcoming competition.                          ____________________
