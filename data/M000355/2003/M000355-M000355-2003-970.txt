 President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:45 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the nomination of Deborah Cook to be a Federal judge for the Sixth Circuit.  Under the agreement entered into last week, there will be up to 4 hours of debate on the nomination prior to a vote. Therefore, the first vote will occur at 4:45 p.m. today, and it will be on the confirmation of Deborah Cook.  Upon the disposition of the Cook nomination, the Senate will debate the nomination of Miguel Estrada until 6 p.m., and at 6 p.m. the Senate will conduct its fifth cloture vote on the Estrada nomination.  The majority leader stated on a number of occasions that we are not going to give up on attempting to get Miguel Estrada an up-or-down vote.  In addition to these additional nominations, there are a number of other important issues to be considered during this coming week. On Tuesday, we will begin debate on the energy bill, although amendments will not be in order until Thursday. We are expecting Members to come to the floor to begin the debate on this much needed legislation.  Also, we have been working on agreements that would allow the Senate to consider the State Department reauthorization bill, the NATO expansion treaty, the bioshield bill, and the FISA legislation. Therefore, I will advise our colleagues to prepare for a very busy week with rollcalls each and every day.  Let me also say the majority leader hopes and expects that we will be doing the vote on the Roberts nomination Friday morning, which is pursuant to the agreement the assistant Democratic leader and myself and the two leaders were working on last week. So we hope to be able to wrap that nomination up on Friday as well.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Nevada.
