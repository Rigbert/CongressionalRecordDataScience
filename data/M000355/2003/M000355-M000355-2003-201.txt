 President, we are nearing the end of the debate. There will be three rollcall votes stacked very shortly. Senator Leahy and I are unaware of any requests for any more rollcall votes. So I think it is safe to say that these three rollcall votes will be the last remaining rollcall votes for the night.  With regard to the Bingaman amendment, this amendment adds $200 million of an existing budget of over $2 billion to fight global AIDS. Just to put that in perspective, this amendment adds more than the entire fiscal year 1999 Clinton global AIDS funding level to this year's level on top of what we have already done. It adds $200 million for HIV/AIDS with an offset, taking away from the Millennium Challenge Account, the President's new initiative. We are spending over $2 billion already this year, as has been repeatedly stated tonight, to combat HIV/AIDS, including nearly $200 million for the Global Fund.  The Millennium Challenge Account is a new initiative that enjoys broad bipartisan support. The MCA provides foreign assistance to developing countries that are doing things the right way, from ruling justly to building free market economies.  The Senate just approved the DeWine amendment 89 to 1. That increases HIV/AIDS spending by $289 million. It is time to wrap it up on this bill, to not steal money from the Millennium Challenge Account. I urge opposition to the Bingaman amendment.  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of the time on this side and let the Senator from New Mexico wrap it up.
