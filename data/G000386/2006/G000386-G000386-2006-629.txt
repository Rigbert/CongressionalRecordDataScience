 President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy in sponsoring a resolution designating the month of January as ``National Mentoring Month.'' Adult-to-youth mentoring has long shown positive impacts on our Nation's young people in becoming responsible, productive adults.  This January will mark the fourth anniversary of the National Mentoring Month campaign to focus national attention on the need for mentors, as well as how each of us within the public and private sector can work together to increase the number of mentors and assure brighter futures for our youth.  Currently, it is estimated that 15 million children need or want a mentor. That is 15 million young people who need the guidance to improve life-essential skills, make healthy choices, and increase their own self worth. I hope the rest of the Senate will join in supporting this resolution and supporting this very important campaign.                          ____________________
