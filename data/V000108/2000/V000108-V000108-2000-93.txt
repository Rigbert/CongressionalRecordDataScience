Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I first of all want to congratulate and thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), ranking member, for their very good work on this bill which I fully support, and I would be remiss if I did not also thank all of the staff involved for their professional work, consideration and hard work.  Mr. Chairman, there is report language that accompanies the bill, and just previous to my statement there was a colloquy on the floor. Singular pronouns were used in terms of the word ``State,'' and the word ``Illinois'' as far as reference to a State was used, and I must indicate that I do take exception to the report language. There is no question that in the Chicago metropolitan area, in the Midwest portion of the United States of America, there is a problem as far as capacity. I would agree with all of my colleagues, and I think it is a regional concern, that that issue be studied on a regional basis and that the State of Indiana, as well as the State of Illinois, be consulted and considered.  The second thing that I would point out to my colleagues in the House, if a commitment has been made by an agency of this government, in this case the Federal Aviation Administration, that particular commitment should be made but again in consultation with all interested parties. In this case, the State of Illinois that apparently asked for the study, the State of Indiana, the citizens in the community affected, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) referred to a site near the community of Peotone, but I would also suggest the City of Chicago and the City of Gary because where I disagree with my colleagues and where I disagree with the report language is the solution to the problem, which site, which combinations of actions, is best suited to solve the problem asked to be studied. So I did want to make sure that my perspective was heard.
