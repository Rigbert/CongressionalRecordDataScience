I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. We are not in the majority, so we cannot set the time and place of the hearing. It is my hope that we will have a hearing, that the leadership of the Congress, the leadership of this House will hold hearings on what happened in Florida. The right to vote, and the right to have your vote counted, is the heart and soul of our democratic process.  We just had a discussion a few moments ago about how people suffered, people struggled, people that I knew died for the right to vote. I will never forget in June of 1964, three young men, Andy Goodman, Michael Schwerner, white, Jewish from New York; and James Chaney, black, from Mississippi, were arrested, jailed by the sheriff, then taken over to the Klan where they were beaten, shot and killed because they were there to help people register to vote. Then Jimmy Lee Jackson in Alabama and others.
