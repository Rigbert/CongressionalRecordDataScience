 President, today marks the 86th anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate this terrible crime and to help ensure that it will never happen again.  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their property and land confiscated.  We who enjoy the blessings of freedom and liberty must commemorate this event to ensure that it does not happen again. Far too often during this century we have remained silent as men, women, and children have been singled out, rounded up, and killed because of their race, ethnicity, or religion. By acknowledging the Armenian Genocide we state loud and clear: Never again.  Never again will we let brutal violations of human rights go without condemnation. Never again will we turn our backs on the oppressed and give comfort to the oppressors. Never again will we fail to stand up for justice and human dignity. Never again will we allow genocide to be perpetrated on this Earth.  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. I am proud that my home State of California is home to a vibrant Armenian American community, a half a million strong. They have enriched the culture of our state and have participated in every aspect of civic life. They are a shining example of a people who overcame the horrors of the past to create a better future.  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure that they did not die in vain. Let us come together to remember the crimes of the past and to pledge to one another that they will not happen again in the future. Let us look ahead with Armenia and the Armenian American community to a brighter tomorrow.
