Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 155) urging the Government of the Republic of Albania to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held on July 3, 2005, are conducted in accordance with international standards for free and fair elections.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 155       Whereas the United States maintains strong and friendly      relations with the Republic of Albania and appreciates the      ongoing support of the people of Albania;       Whereas the President of Albania has called for elections      to Albania's parliament, known as the People's Assembly, to      be held on July 3, 2005;       Whereas Albania is one of 55 participating States in the      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),      all of which have adopted the 1990 Copenhagen Document      containing specific commitments relating to the conduct of      elections;       Whereas these commitments, which encourage transparency,      balance, and impartiality in an election process, have become      the standard by which observers determine whether elections      have been conducted freely and fairly;       Whereas, though improvements over time have been noted, the      five multiparty parliamentary elections held in Albania      between 1991 and 2001, as well as elections for local offices      held between and after those years, fell short of the      standards in the Copenhagen Document to varying degrees,      according to OSCE and other observers;       Whereas with OSCE and other international assistance, the      Government of Albania has improved the country's electoral      and legal framework and enhanced the capacity to conduct free      and fair elections;       Whereas subsequent to the calling of elections, Albania's      political parties have accepted a code of conduct regarding      their campaign activities, undertaking to act in accordance      with the law, to refrain from inciting violence or hatred in      the election campaign, and to be transparent in disclosing      campaign funding; and       Whereas meeting the standards in the Copenhagen Document      for free and fair elections is absolutely essential to      Albania's desired integration into European and Euro-Atlantic      institutions, including full membership in the North Atlantic      Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as to Albania's progress      in addressing official corruption and combatting organized      crime: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) welcomes the opportunity for the Republic of Albania to      demonstrate its willingness and preparedness to take the next      steps in European and Euro-Atlantic integration by holding      parliamentary elections on July 3, 2005, that meet the      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)      standards for free and fair elections as defined in the 1990      Copenhagen Document;       (2) firmly believes that the citizens of Albania, like all      people, should be able to choose their own representatives in      parliament and government in free and fair elections, and to      hold these representatives accountable through elections at      reasonable intervals;       (3) supports commitments by Albanian political parties to      adhere to a basic code of conduct for campaigning and urges      such parties and all election officials in Albania to adhere      to laws relating to the elections, and to conduct their      activities in an impartial and transparent manner, by      allowing international and domestic observers to have      unobstructed access to all aspects of the election process,      including public campaign events, candidates, news media,      voting, and post-election tabulation of results and      processing of election challenges and complaints;       (4) supports assistance by the United States to help the      people of Albania establish a fully free and open democratic      system, a prosperous free market economy, and its rightful      place in European and Euro-Atlantic institutions, including      the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); and       (5) encourages the President to communicate to the      Government of Albania, to all political parties and      candidates, and to the people of Albania the high importance      attached by the Government of the United States to this      parliamentary election as a central factor in determining the      future relationship between the United States and Albania.
