 President, I rise today in strong support of the legislation before us to extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of out-of-work Americans. Families across this Nation are hurting, and 15.1 million Americans are currently unemployed. It is imperative that legislation to provide relief to those hardest hit by the economic downturn is passed without further delay.  The Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2009 would: Extend unemployment insurance benefits by 14 weeks; and, provide an additional 6-week extension for those living in States with unemployment rates of 8.5 percent or higher, such as California.  This adds up to a 20-week extension of unemployment benefits for those in the toughest job markets. The legislation is fully-offset, and would not increase the deficit or national debt.  Congress last acted to temporarily extend unemployment insurance benefits in November 2008. Additionally, the economic stimulus bill enacted in February increased benefits by $100 a month, providing much-needed help to those struggling to make ends meet. But, the unemployment rate continues to rise. Jobless Americans need an extension of unemployment benefits, and they need it now.  As of September, the national unemployment rate stands at 9.8 percent--the highest in 26 years--263,000 jobs were lost last month, and 7.6 million have been lost since the recession began in December 2007.  My home State of California has been hit particularly hard. The unemployment rate has risen to 12.2 percent, significantly higher than the National average. The number of people unemployed in California as of September was 2,247,000.  There are 12 States with a smaller population than the number of unemployed Californians: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. Mr. President, 71,000 out-of-work Californians have already exhausted their unemployment benefits this month. According to theCalifornia Employment Development Department--EDD, an estimated 170,000 Californians will exhaust their benefits by the end of 2009 if Congress does not act.  Not only are more workers losing their jobs, but it continues to be more difficult for the unemployed to find work again. The number of Americans who have been jobless for 6 months or longer has reached a record 5.4 million.  America has faced tough economic times before, including four periods of recession since 1980. During all of these recessions we see a disturbing pattern: laid-off workers exhausting their unemployment benefits. By the year's end, 1.3 million people across the nation will lose their unemployment insurance benefits, and 7,000 Americans are running out of benefits on a daily basis.  These are more than just statistics or numbers on a page. Every percentage, or data point, tells the story of another family impacted by downsizing, a factory shutting down, or a local small business forced to close its doors.  The numbers don't tell the full story of the pain, anxiety, and challenges out-of-work Americans are facing. Here are some personal examples from Californians who have written to my office.  A former Chemist from Solana Beach, California wrote:       I have a Masters in Chemistry in drug discovery and have      worked for 15 years in this manner. And though I apply almost      every day to any and all jobs I might be a candidate or hired      (including entry level positions in and out of my field,      waiter, grocery store, fast food, hardware store, etc) I have      only had two interviews in the last 3 months and worked 2      weeks as a temp. No one wants to hire a Masters in Science      for an $8 per hour job even less in my traditional career.      Please vote yes to extend unemployment insurance.  A single mother from Rio Dell, California wrote:       Please, PLEASE do what you can to help with the Federal      extension for unemployment benefits. I will receive my final      check in a matter of days. I am a single mother who is barely      surviving and fear losing my place to live. I have already      received one eviction notice from my landlord due to paying      my rent late. I fear I will lose parental custody if I can't      keep a roof over our heads. I have carefully documented my      work search, but the hope of finding employment is dwindling      along with my hope of providing the most basic necessities      such as water, heat, and shelter as winter approaches. I live      in Rio Dell where the base rate for water and sewer was just      raised to $90 per month. I'm now a month behind. I don't have      a spouse or family to help me. I don't even have a car      anymore. I know I'm not the only one in this position, but it      is of little consolation. So please help. The farther a      person gets down, the harder the climb back up. We are in a      devastating situation that needs immediate attention and      reparation. I sincerely appreciate your time and      consideration.''  A former Postal Service employee from Grass Valley, California wrote:       Dear Ms. Feinstein, I am writing regarding the unemployment      extension. I am a single mother struggling to keep my      daughter clean, fed and in school. I was laid-off from the US      Postal Service and have been desperately looking for work      with no luck. Please urge your colleagues to pass this      legislation as soon as possible and then work on possible      inequities between the states. Thank you very much for your      time.  These are only a handful of the nearly 2,000 letters my office has received. It breaks my heart to read such stories, and I am sure that many of my colleagues are hearing from constituents facing the same tough circumstances.  The situation for those in high unemployment states, such as California, is urgent, and, it is not just about preserving a social safety net or helping those who have paid into the system while they were employed. The unemployment crisis feeds the foreclosure crisis which leads to continued instability in the housing market which was the catalyst for the economic downturn in the first place. Put another way, the longer this legislation is delayed, the longer our economic recovery is delayed.  This extension is a targeted action that will quickly put money into the hands of those who need it most, and are most likely to spend it immediately on everyday necessities. According to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, every dollar spent on unemployment benefits generates a return of $1.64. Given the gravity of the unemployment situation, we have an obligation to take responsible action. There is no time for further delay, or political gamesmanship.  Some will argue that we do not need to extend benefits again, but with the increasing unemployment rate, more job losses, and the jobless staying unemployed for longer periods, American families need a break. We must address the underlying causes of the economic instability facing our Nation. More incentives are needed to ease the flow of credit to businesses and consumers. Special attention must be given to the small businesses that in many communities are the primary engine for job creation and economic development. But, the choice before us today with this legislation is clear.  We should pass this legislation now.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to provide immediate assistance to out-of-work Americans and aid our Nation's economic recovery.                          ____________________
