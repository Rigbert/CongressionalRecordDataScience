 President, I rise to speak for a brave woman, mother and soldier who has fallen. On July 22, 2004, SGT Tatjana Reed was tragically killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near her vehicle during combat operations in Samarra, Iraq.  Born half a world away, Sergeant Reed came to call Fort Campbell, KY her home. She was 34 years old.  For her bravery in service, she received numerous medals, awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.  Born and raised in Germany, Sergeant Reed chose to make America her own, and she chose to enlist in the U.S. Army to protect it.  To hear Tatjana's younger sister, Rebecca Milliner, describe their time together as children, growing up in Germany sounds little different from growing up in America.  ``She had to drag her little sister along to hang out with her friends,'' Rebecca recalls. But ``she never complained about having to take me with her.''  Tatjana graduated from high school in Germany, then later came to America as a young woman in 1991 and graduated from basic training in February of that year.
