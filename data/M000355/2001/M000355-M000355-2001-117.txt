 President, we are about to vote on my amendment, the Paul D. Coverdell teacher protection amendment. This important legislation extends important protections from frivolous lawsuits to teachers, principals, administrators, and other education professionals who take reasonable steps to maintain order in the classroom.  The amendment, I hasten to add, does not protect those teachers who engage in ``willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights and safety'' of a student.  This is not new ground for the Senate. I remind all of my colleagues that last year we approved this virtually identical amendment by a vote of 97-0. It is now the appropriate time for the Senate to revisit this issue and give its full endorsement. Mr. President, 97-0 is about as strong as it gets in the Senate. I hope we will have a similar vote when the vote commences at 12:40.  I know Senator Coverdell would obviously be grateful to see that his legislation may well be on the way to becoming law this year. I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment, as they did the last time it was offered.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
