President, I regret that I must again bring to the Senate's attention the situation of imprisoned Tibetan music and dance scholar, Ngawang Choephel. I had hoped that Chinese authorities would have recognized by now the grave mistake they made in sentencing him to 18 years in prison.  In 1995, Mr. Choephel was in Tibet making a documentary film of traditional Tibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese authorities. After being held incommunicado for 15 months without access to his family or independent legal counsel, Mr. Choephel was sentenced to 18 years inprison for violating the State Security Law. It was insinuated that he was paid by the U.S. Government to spy on behalf of the Dalai Lama. No evidence to support such a claim has ever been produced. The 16 hours of film Mr. Choephel sent to India during the first weeks of his project simply contain footage of the traditional music and dance he said he had gone to document.  Persistent inquiries to Chinese authorities regarding Mr. Choephel's whereabouts and the condition of his health have produced little information. I wrote to the head of the Chinese Communist Party soon after Mr. Choephel's detention and received no reply. I raised his case personally in meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese officials last November in Beijing and received no reply. I have written to President Jiang since then to urge his personal intervention in this case and received no reply. I am just one of many who have sought information about Mr. Choephel to no avail. As of today we have no information as to where Mr. Choephel is being held, or even if he is still alive.  This is an outrageous situation. A former Fulbright Scholar has been deprived of 18 years of his life as a result of spurious charges by a government that will not even reveal his whereabouts. I have urged the White House to raise Mr. Choephel's case with President Jiang. I plan to do the same. If President Jiang is interested in fostering closer ties with the United States, he could make no gesture more meaningful than ordering his release.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from an article entitled ``Who Is Invited to the Banquet?'' by Jeff Kaufman of the Rutland Daily Herald be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Oct. 23, 1997]Who Is Invited to the Banquet?--Tibetan From Vermont Remains in Chinese                                  Prison                           (By Jeff Kaufman)       In a few weeks, the Clinton administration will welcome      Chinese President Jiang Zemin on his first state visit to the      United States. Champagne, smiles, encouraging words and a      good dose of pomp and circumstance will be broadcast, not      just to Americans, but around the world. Sidebar statements      about human and workers' rights will be drowned out by      televised images that will instantly convey the central      message of such a historic meeting: The leaders of the      world's most powerful countries are celebrating joint      ventures and common purpose.                           *   *   *   *   *       Anonymity for political prisoners is a tyrant's ally, so      here is a name and a story to personalize the kind of cruelty      imposed by China's prison archipelago. This individual case      may be not be typical in that it involves a young man who      left the safety of America to travel to his native Tibet, but      it is all too typical in its show of intolerance, judicial      abuse and lack of regard for basic standards of human rights.       Tibetan exile and Fulbright scholar Ngawang Choopal came to      this country at the age of 27 to study ethnomusicology at      Middlebury College in 1993. In the summer of 1995, he      returned to Tibet to film a documentary about traditional      Tibetan music and dance. Sixteen hours of video were sent to      friends in the West; they show beautiful images and sounds of      a great culture, but no military installations, no political      protests, not a critical word against China.       Nonetheless, Chinese authorities arrested Ngawang Choepal      in Llasa's Shigatse market in September 1995. He was      incarcerated for 15 months without being allowed to meet his      family, independent legal counsel, or American      representatives. Sen. Patrick Leahy visited Beijing in      November 1996 and appealed directly to President Jiang Zemin      on behalf of Ngawang. That plea was at first followed by a      vague promise to examine the case. A month later, Chinese      authorities convicted Ngawang Choepal of espionage and      providing information ``to the Dalai Lama clique's      government-in-exile and to an organization of a certain      foreign country.''       The sentence imposed was stunningly severe: 18 years in      prison. Eighteen years in a Chinese jail for videotaping      people dancing to old Tibetan songs.       The Chinese government has ignored assurances from the      United States that Ngawang Choepal is just a non-political      music student, several congressional resolutions in his      support, pleas from his family and a number of worldwide      letter-writing campaigns.       In fact, the international Campaign for Tibet reports that      the American Embassy in Beijing is not even certain in what      prison Ngawang is being held.       Ngawang Choepal's case is tragic on its own very personal      terms and as a reflection of a much wider Chinese decision to      wipe out all opposition no matter how benign and no matter      how inadvertent.       Such an outrageous violation of human rights should be a      serious obstacle to productive relations between the United      States and China (it certainly would be if the offending      country had less trade potential).       Sadly, President Clinton and in essence our whole country      will soon host the man who is responsible for locking up      Ngawang Choepal and who could instantly set him free. When      President Jiang Zemin visits America later this month, he'll      be toasted, feasted, and courted by businesses and lobbyists.      Ngawang Choepal's voice will not pass through the thick stone      walls that he faces every day.       Who will speak out for him and thousands like him?       It should be our president and secretary of state using the      impressive clout of the United States. Soon we will see what      this country really stands for.                          ____________________
