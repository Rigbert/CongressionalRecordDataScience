We have a lot of labor unions coming out foursquare for the bill. Some held back and they want a couple of changes they are looking for. It is interesting that all of them are against this amendment--those who haven't yet endorsed the bill and those who have endorsed the bill. It is the same with the veterans groups. I think they know that this amendment, no matter how well intentioned it would be, if it went through, basically kills the chances of people to recover anything. It puts us back into the decades of litigation where, as people across the spectrum were saying, from the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we need a solution on the floor.
