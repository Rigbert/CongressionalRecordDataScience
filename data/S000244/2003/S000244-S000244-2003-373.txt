Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 160, I call up the Senate bill (S. 151) to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to the sexual exploitation of children, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.  The text of S. 151 is as follows:                                 S. 151       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosecutorial Remedies and      Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of      2003'' or ``PROTECT Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to      protection under the First Amendment under Miller v.      California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v.      Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may      be prohibited.       (2) The Government has a compelling state interest in      protecting children from those who sexually exploit them,      including both child molesters and child pornographers. ``The      prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children      constitutes a government objective of surpassing      importance,'' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)      (emphasis added), and this interest extends to stamping out      the vice of child pornography at all levels in the      distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110      (1990).       (3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in      ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child      pornography remain enforceable and effective. ``[T]he most      expeditious if not the only practical method of law      enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by      imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling,      advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.'' Ferber,      458 U.S. at 760.       (4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the      technology did not exist to: (A) computer generate depictions      of children that are indistinguishable from depictions of      real children; (B) use parts of images of real children to      create a composite image that is unidentifiable as a      particular child and in a way that prevents even an expert      from concluding that parts of images of real children were      used; or (C) disguise pictures of real children being abused      by making the image look computer generated.       (5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,      demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise      depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and      to make depictions of real children appear computer      generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not      already, to computer generate realistic images of children.       (6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions      today involve images contained on computer hard drives,      computer disks, or related media.       (7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child      pornography images being trafficked today were made other      than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless,      technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal      defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography      they possess are not those of real children, insisting that      the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the      images are not computer-generated. Such challenges increased      significantly after the Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition      decision.       (8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by      definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers      and has been transferred over the Internet, often in      different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An      image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely      a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images      can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an      expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts      a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a      paper version into a digital format, this task can be even      harder since proper forensic assessment may depend on the      quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.       (9) The impact on the government's ability to prosecute      child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth      Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions      since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in      Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions      generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the      most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically      identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the      origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child      pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme      Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision,      prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed      concern about the continued viability of previously indicted      cases as well as declined potentially meritorious      prosecutions.       (10) Since the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech      Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost      universally raised the contention that the images in question      could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly      every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the      child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already      been successful.       (11) In the absence of congressional action, this problem      will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect      that the technology exists to create computer or computer-     generated depictions that are indistinguishable from      depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess      images of real children to escape prosecution, for it      threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of      computer images even when a real child was abused. This      threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real      children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional      requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable      doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a      real child--as some courts have done--threatens to result in      the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and      distribution of child pornography for all except the original      producers of the material.       (12) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's      unquestioned compelling interest     in effective enforcement of the child pornography laws that      protect real children, a statute must be adopted that      prohibits a narrowly-defined subcategory of images.       (13) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber decision holding that      child pornography was not protected drove child pornography      off the shelves of adult bookstores. Congressional action is      necessary now to ensure that open and notorious trafficking      in such materials does not reappear, and even increase, on      the Internet.     SEC. 3.
