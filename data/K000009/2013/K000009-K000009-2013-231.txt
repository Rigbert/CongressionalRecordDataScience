Speaker, this month marks the dedication of the new Erie-Ottawa International Airport in Port Clinton, Ohio. This new facility has been made possible through the Port Authority's leadership and the sacrifices and dedication of local citizens who understand what it takes to build a strong community and nation. Their contributions, along with a $1.7 million federal Airport Improvement Grant, have resulted in adding an important new facility along our precious Lake Erie coast for economic growth.  To celebrate this event, citizens gathered during Veteran's Day weekend to mark this historic occasion at the new hanger. At the invitation of the airport's dedicated and visionary Director Stan Gebhardt, all gathered witnessed the first flight from Pelee Island, Canada. The plane was piloted by Griffing Flying Service president Tom Griffing, with passengers Erie County Commissioner Tom Farrell and Ottawa County Commissioner Jim Sass who worked across county lines to bring new growth potential to our coast. Upon landing, they were greeted by numerous local, state and federal officials as well as members of the public who marked the occasion with a special ceremony.  In honor of the occasion, a new US flag was flown over the U.S. Capitol for presentation to the Airport Authority. Let me offer warmest congratulations to all those who piloted this significant project to completion. The new facility and adjacent buildings will allow for improved air service, more hanger storage, expanding commercial development around the airport's perimeter, and enhanced opportunities for tourism and commercial development. May the years ahead bring new opportunity as well as adventure to those who recognize Ohio as America's state where air flight began. Onward and upward!                          ____________________
