The reason I raise that is later I am going to suggest a change in the Senate rules so that when you file an amendment or modification, copies will be given to both the ranking member and the Chair on the floor, as is the custom and rule of the House. That is a good way to make sure there is knowledge of what is being considered and debated as promptly as possible.  Going to the substance of the matter, does the Senator's modification change the original language in his amendment which makes this provision on spousal lobbying retroactive, not prospective? In other words, if there is some Member on either side of the aisle today who has a spouse lobbying at the Federal level, it is my understanding that the Senator would prohibit that in his original amendment unless that spouse was lobbying a year before the marriage or a year before the first election of Congress. Does the modification change that in any respect?
