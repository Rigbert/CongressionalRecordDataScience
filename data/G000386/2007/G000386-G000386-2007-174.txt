 President, we simply, then, have an honest disagreement on whether we want to cover additional low-income kids. Some Members do; some Members do not. I am on the side that wants to cover additional low-income children who are eligible for coverage. It is as simple as that.  The other main difference is the income eligibility for children. Right now, 91 percent of the SCHIP funds are being spent on kids at or below 200 percent of poverty. Under current law, States have the flexibility to adjust their income eligibility to respond to rising health care costs and the cost of living within a particular State because it differs so much between California and Iowa, to name two States.  The Lott amendment imposes a ``Washington knows best'' mentality regarding a State's ability to determine what income within that State is most appropriate. And then it goes one step further: It reduces the Federal match for covering kids above 200 percent of poverty. There are 18 States that currently cover kids above 200 percent of poverty. Under this proposal, a State currently receiving the enhanced match under SCHIP for coverage of eligible children would see that match reduced for those very same children.  While I would prefer that all States focus on children at or below 200 percent of poverty, the fact remains that $42,000 a year for a family of four is a lot harder to get by on in some States than in other States. By imposing this new requirement that States limit eligibility, the Lott amendment would cause kids to lose coverage. The table CBO sent us on the Lott amendment confirms that. I am sorry, but in a bill designed to cover kids, cutting them off is a step in the wrong direction.  The Finance Committee bill takes a different approach. The committee bill would lower the Federal payments to States that choose to cover kids over 300 percent of poverty level. States that go above that limit would only get the regular Medicaid match. Those States wouldn't get the enhanced Federal match under SCHIP for these higher income kids. So the Finance Committee bill creates a disincentive for States to go in that direction.  Some have alleged that the Senate Finance Committee bill would permit States to cover kids and families who make over $80,000. That is false. What the Finance Committee bill does is allow States that have passed State laws to increase eligibility to be grandfathered at the SCHIP match as it is right now. There are no States that do that today. So it is incorrect to say that the Finance package expands coverage for these higher income kids. That just is not accurate.  Right now, the only State that is even proposing to go as high as 400 percent of poverty is New York, and their State plan amendment still must be approved by the Bush administration. The Bush administration, not Congress, has to decide whether to approve that coverage.  So let me repeat. The Senate Finance bill would only permit New York to get an enhanced match for kids and families over 83 percent a year if this administration approves their plan, and it gives my colleagues on this side of the aisle who don't want that to happen a chance to lobby the Secretary of HHS to make sure it doesn't happen.  Given the criticism they leveled against the Finance plan, I would be shocked if they did approve it. I will wait and see, however, if their actions match their rhetoric.  Wrapping up, let me just say again that the Lott amendment has many similarities that I have delineated for the Senate--many similarities to the Finance Committee package. I commend them for their work in putting together this proposal, and I would hope that since their amendment has so many similarities to the Senate Finance Committee bill, perhaps they will take another look at the policies in our bipartisan package. There are key differences in the two approaches, however. I appreciate my colleagues' work in pointing out these differences. I, for one, am happy to stand on the side of covering kids rather than cutting them out, and I support giving States flexibility.          Amendments Nos. 2540 and 2541 to Amendment No. 2530  Madam President, I call up for consideration two amendments by Senator Ensign, amendments Nos. 2541 and 2540.
