Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I again rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment is a backdoor way of authorizing existing Biosphere Reserves. The Heritage areas were recognized in the bill because it is under treaty, but there is no treaty on the biospheres, none. Let us make that perfectly clear. I have a 3-year grandfather clause. We can come back and talk about each one of these. If everybody loves them like they do, it will work.  By the way, I have no fear of outside world government at all. I believe in America. But I suggest respectfully I do also believe, and I think each one of the Members were sworn to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says that Congress, this Congress, the Members and I, are the only ones who can designate lands.  So why is the fear, why do Members want to give this away to somebody else? I have never understood that, and this whole argument. What is wrong with this Congress acting, and by the way, the areas that have been designated can still be, under State participation, under the individual participation, can still have the same type of study and research.  I keep hearing this research charade. The research can go on. There is nothing that stops the research, nothing at all. All we are asking in this legislation is that this Congress fulfill its responsibility of designating lands. If in fact UNESCO or somebody wants to designate it, let them come to Congress. That is all I will ask.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
