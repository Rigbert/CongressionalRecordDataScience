 Two additional questions. The next one would be the Medicare prescription drug bill. Obviously this is a very contentious piece of legislation, with different perspectives on how we can provide seniors in particular with relief on the prescription drug costs.  Can the gentleman tell us what you believe the status of that to be and when we might expect that bill, the conference report, on the floor of the House?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, the gentleman knows, as we all do, that improving and strengthening Medicare is going to be one of the toughest conferences that we will face. There are a lot of issues, very complicated issues, that have to be dealt with.                              {time}  1430  The chairman of the conference, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), is working with all parties on the conference and it just takes a lot of time to work through these issues. We have already worked through some. I happen to serve on the conference. We have worked through some and progress is being made. But our Members need to stay focused. The Members of the other body need to stay focused in order for us to get this done before the end of this session. But as far as predicting when we will be able to do that, that would be very difficult for me to do. But I hope that everyone will work together and get something out before we adjourn for this session of the 108th Congress.
