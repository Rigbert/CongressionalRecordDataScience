President, I rise today to introduce the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act. I am proud to be joined by ten of my colleagues, Senators Lincoln, Crapo, Bond, Isakson, Craig, Chambliss, Cochran, Thomas, Hagel and Roberts. This legislation codifies long-standing Democratic and Republican Administration policy of not requiring a Clean Water Act permit for pesticides in full compliance with their EPA-approved label. It will further affirm historic a Federal practices with regard to the Clean Water Act and fire suppression and other foreset management activities.  In 1972, Congress enacted both the Clean Water Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. CWA authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the Nation's waterways by regulating discharges of large industrial operations and wastewater facilities through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. FIFRA proyided the EPA with the authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides through a comprehensive registration and labeling protocol.  Until some recent court decisions, the application of agricultural and other pesticides in full compliance with labeling requirements did not require NPDES permits. Because pesticides undergo lengthy testing under FIFRA including tests to ensure water quality and aquatic species preservation, a NPDES permit was considered unnecessary and duplicative. These court decisions commonly known as Talent and Forsgren contradict years of Federal policy and undermine the manner in which the Federal Government regulates farmers, foresters, irrigators, mosquito abatement officials, and other pesticide applicators.  Similar cases are pending. Groups are now using the notice of intent to sue to intimidate farmers, mosquito abatement districts and Federal and State agencies into stopping or reducing West Nile virus prevention and crop loss rangeland protection operations. While EPA has proposed a rule to ensure that pesticides sprayed to, near, or over waters do not need a permit, the rule needs to be codified in statute. Environmentalists who filed notices of intent to sue Maine's two largest blueberry farmers have indicated that they plan on threatening others with lawsuits including more farmers and foresters.  Our legislation fills this regulatory gap left by EPA. While the agency's rule is a step in the right direction, our legislation codifies the agency's longstanding policy that the application of agricultural and other pesticides, in accordance with their label, does not require an NPDES permit. Moreover, the rule does not protect farmers, irrigators, mosquito abatement districts, fire fighters, Federal and State agencies, pest control operators or foresters vulnerable to citizen's suits, simply for performing long-practiced, expressly approved and already heavily regulated pest management and public health protection activities. Without such protection, those who protet us from mosquito borne illnesses and other pest outbreaks or combat destructive and potentially deadly forest fires will continue to be potential victims of mischievous citizen's suits.  My bill codifies EPA's rulemaking, as well as affirms Congressional intent and the long-held positions of Republican and Democratic administrations with regard to the CWA and pesticide applications generally, as well as fire suppression and other forest management activities. I am pleased to be joined by so many of my colleagues in this effort and encourage others to cosponsor our proposal.                                 ______                                       By
