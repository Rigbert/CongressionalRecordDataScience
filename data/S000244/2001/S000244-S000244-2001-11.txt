 Madam Speaker, I have a lengthier statement which I will put in the Record, but in the interest of time let me explain the bill and the Senate amendment. Section 7 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 allows the Judicial Conference to redact portions of financial disclosure statements for judges and other judicial officers and employees where the Judicial Conference makes a determination that public disclosure will jeopardize the safety of the judge, the judge's family, or the judicial officer or the judicial officer's family. This provision sunsets on December 31, 2001, in the absence of further legislative action. The House passed this legislation with a permanent extension of the redaction authority. The other body amended the House bill for a 4-year sunset. So with the 4-year sunset, the redaction authority would once again expire on December 31, 2005. I believe that it is a legitimate compromise. It allows the Congress in 4 years to review whether these redactions have been done in a manner that preserves the thrust of public disclosure without jeopardizing the lives and safety of judges and their families; and thus I would urge concurrence in the Senate amendment.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1730
