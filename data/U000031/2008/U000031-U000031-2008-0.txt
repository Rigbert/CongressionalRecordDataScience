Speaker, 4 months ago, this Nation was not talking about a bailout. They weren't talking, say, about a bad economy, although it was certainly weak in Michigan, to say the least. We weren't talking about the loss of 525,000 jobs the month before. No, we were talking about energy and the need for an all-American energy plan. Part of that debate was to wean us off foreign oil and to develop the cars that, in fact, will do just that.  As I sat down with Ford and with Chrysler and with GM and saw their Volt and the other vehicles, we were excited. We were going to make a lot of progress to wean us off foreign energy,but we could only do it if we got the money to retool.  Four months ago, in August, we, in fact, got the tip that the lenders weren't lending. No. They were coming in at 20 percent interest rates. That's what they were going to charge. We went to the administration. We went to the leadership on both sides of this Congress, and we said, if that happens, they'll never get the money; we'll never build these cars, and these companies will go bankrupt before the end of the year.  Sadly, we are here today on December 10, and that may exactly happen if we do not get a bill to the President's desk. It looks like our prediction from last August may be right on track, but if you thought 525,000 jobs lost last month was a problem, you wait until we get to 2 million to 3 million jobs when we lose those in a month or two if we don't get this bill done.  This isn't new money that we're asking for. It has already been directed. It has already been appropriated. What we ask is just redirection to help a domestic industry so that we can make these vehicles in America--that's right--made in America, not someplace else.  China, as my colleague Sandy Levin has indicated, has already approved $55 billion for the domestic auto manufacturing in China. Europe is doing the same thing.
