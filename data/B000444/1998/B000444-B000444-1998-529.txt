 President, over the last two days we have been debating in the Senate various amendments aimed at curbing drunk driving--a devastating byproduct of alcohol consumption. Today, I want to raise another alcohol-related issue--that of drinking on college campuses.  In recent years, we have all heard the stories about college students who are dying because of alcohol. A drunk student falls out of a dorm window in Virginia. Students from Massachusetts to Mississippi die of alcohol poisoning--drinking so much so fast that the alcohol literally kills them. In fact, so far this academic year, there have been at least 17 college students who have died in binge drinking incidents.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated minority of college students. According to surveys, 44 percent of college students are binge drinkers, and nearly one in every five college students is a frequent binge drinker. This is not what parents expect when they send their kids off to college.  It is time for the culture on college campuses to change.  So, today, I am submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on college and university administrators to carry out activities to reduce alcohol consumption on college campuses. This resolution--the Collegiate Initiative to Reduce Binge Drinking--was first submitted in the other body by Mr. Kennedy of Massachusetts. I want to commend him for his initiative, and thank him for allowing me to join in this effort.  Specifically, the resolution calls on colleges and universities to appoint a task force to establish a policy on reducing alcohol and other drug-related problems; provide students with the opportunity to live in an alcohol-free environment; enforce a zero tolerance policy on the consumption of alcohol by minors; and eliminate alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It also encourages colleges to work with local officials in the town in which they are located.  These activities are very similar to what is happening now at my state's largest college--the University of Delaware--which, according to a study by Harvard University, has had a binge drinking rate 50 percent higher than the national average. But, Mr. President, under the direction of the University's President, David P. Roselle--along with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation--the University is actively seeking to reduce this rate and to reduce alcohol consumption on campus. So far, it appears to be working. In just one year--from October 1996 to October 1997--there were 30 fewer alcohol-related incidents on campus.  The lesson is that if we take the problem seriously and seriously address the problem, we can make a difference. The lives of students can be saved. I ask my colleagues to join me in encouraging college administrators to step up to the challenge--before the problem gets any worse.                          ____________________
