Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Let me remind him that--although there seems to be some tangential relationship because of the self-proclamation by the killer, the person who created the massacre in Orlando--the person who created the massacre in Charleston, Roof, had no relationship to ISIL or anybody in the international community. He didn't like African Americans. He killed them because of the color of their skin, and we speak out against that, properly so.  Had the background check been appropriate in that case, that may have been stopped. We don't know. But it is certainly worth making the effort to ensure that guns do not get in the hands of those who ought not to have them. Again, as I say, a majority of the American people support that.  And, yes, the Export-Import Bank was bottled up in committee--we understand you can bottle things up in committee--over 2\1/2\ years. When it finally got to the floor, a majority of Republicans and all but one Democrat voted for it, over 300 votes for it, but it was bottled up in committee. That may be regular order, but it is not openness, and it is not having the House work its will.  I would urge that those two items in particular--the no fly, no buy legislation and the enhanced ability to know whether people ought to have guns or not--whether suffering from some sort of mental problem or having criminal records, that they not buy guns. I would hope we can bring that to the floor and have this House work its will, as has been suggested your side would do when and if it was in power, and it has been in power now for some period of time.  If the gentleman wants to make additional comments, I will yield. If not, I will yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield for one point?
