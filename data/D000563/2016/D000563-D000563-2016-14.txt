President, let me say at the outset that I took the floor last week and said a few words in tribute and friendship to my colleague, Senator Kirk. I am glad to hear the majority leader's statement this morning. It was spot-on, and it captured his public spirit, as well as his personal strength, that has brought him to this moment in history. I have been honored to serve with him for the last 6 years.  I would say to my colleague Senator Coats from Indiana: We served together in the House, in the Senate, and I actually visited him when he was an ambassador representing the United States in Germany. It is an amazing public career on his part, and I wish him the very best for whatever the future holds for him.                                  DACA  Mr. President, I wish to tell a story about an extraordinary young woman whom some of you may know. Her name is Laura Alvarado. When she was 8 years old, Laura was brought to the United States from Mexico. She grew up in Chicago in my home State of Illinois.  In high school, she was an extraordinary student and was involved in extracurricular and volunteer activities. She was a member of the National Honor Society. She played soccer, tennis, basketball, and was a member of student government, the school newspaper, the chess club, the yearbook club, and many more. She decided to go to Northeastern Illinois University. She worked two jobs while she was going to school because she didn't qualify for any Federal assistance to go to college.  In 2006, she graduated with honors from Northeastern. Her major was justice studies. But then she was stuckagain. Her ambition in life was to become a lawyer, but she couldn't pursue her dream. It took her 6 years. In 2012, President Obama established DACA, an Executive action which said to Laura and thousands just like her: You are in a special category. You were undocumented in America, but you were brought here as a child. You didn't make the decision to come to this country; your family did. So we are going to give young people like Laura a chance, on a temporary basis, if they will pay a filing fee of almost $500, submit themselves to a criminal background check to make certain they are no threat to anyone in this country, we will give them a 2-year status where they cannot be deported and they can work in America.  Laura applied. There were people who were cautioning her: Be careful. If you identify yourself as undocumented to this government, somebody might use it against you someday. But Laura, who aspired to be a lawyer, decided to follow the law, register, pay her fee, go through the background check, and try to get the status of DACA. She received it. And because of it, she was allowed to apply and be accepted at Southern Illinois University School of Law at Carbondale.  In law school, she was an outstanding student again. She won the moot court competition. She was selected for the Order of Barristers, a legal honor society.  This spring, 10 years after she graduated from college, Laura received her law degree. Over the summer she passed her bar exam, and just last month she received her Illinois law license, which she is holding here proudly.  Laura never gave up on her dream of becoming a lawyer, but it is a dream that never would have happened were it not for President Obama's Executive action, the Executive action that didn't give her a free pass to law school--just the opposite. It said to her: If you are accepted into law school, the government will not pay you a penny to help with your education. You have to go out and work for it. She did.  Now we face a question with a new President coming in who says he wants to abolish the DACA that made Laura eligible to go to law school. He wants to abolish the status where these young people, brought as babies, toddlers, into this country are not subject to deportation and can work for a living. If that is abolished, then Laura, despite all of her hard work, all of her education, all of her achievements in life, faces deportation from this country.  Laura said she wants to use her law degree to help people who don't have a fighting chance without lawyers who are more focused on service than on money. We are better if Laura is here as a lawyer practicing in America. We are certainly better in Illinois to have someone with a law license willing to give back to our State.  Now the choice is up to Congress. Are we going to step in and give Laura the chance she asked for to prove herself again as she has so many times in her young life? I am glad to say that Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina, and I are joining in an effort to draw up legislation to achieve that goal and at least to give these DACA-eligibles a temporary reprieve so that if there is an elimination of this Executive action, we don't eliminate the protection that keeps them here in the United States and where they cannot be deported and they have a chance to work. That is something we need to do--not just for Laura but for 744,000 other young people as well who grew up in this country and just deserve a chance to make this a better nation.                      Tribute to Barbara Mikulski  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saluting the public life of Senator Barbara Mikulski. Before I do that, I want to thank a woman who is not here. She was a Catholic nun and the debate coach for Senator Mikulski when she was in high school at the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore, the same school Nancy Pelosi graduated from.  As a young Barbara Mikulski was preparing to debate a particularly tough opponent, this nun, her debate coach, told her: ``You can do it, Barb--get out there and roll those Jesuit boys!''  I went to a Jesuit college and law school, and I am proud and relieved to report that I never had to face Barbara Mikulski in that kind of debate. I have rarely found anybody who can stand up to her in a debate. She can still ``roll those Jesuit boys,'' or anyone else who tries to stand in the way of helping women, children, seniors, or advancing fairness.  Barbara Mikulski has been my colleague for 20 years, my friend, the chairwoman of my Appropriations Committee and the ranking member, and so many times an inspiration.  As most of my colleagues know, my first job was working in the Senate as an intern, myself, in the office of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. Like Barbara Mikulski, Paul Douglas was a champion for the underdog, and he was a pit bull when it came to protecting the American taxpayers.  Every year, the University of Illinois chooses a leader of uncommon decency and courage to receive the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. This year, I was honored to present that award on behalf of the University of Illinois and in the name of Paul Douglas to Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. I know Senator Douglas would have been thrilled that she is carrying on that same public service tradition.  Some day--and I hope and trust I will live to see it--the ultimate glass ceiling will break, and there will be a woman elected President of this country. When that historic day comes, we can be sure that Senator Barbara Mikulski will have had a hand in bringing it about.  Many of my colleagues have spoken about the long list of times she has already broken glass ceilings herself: Barbara Mikulski, first woman ever elected statewide in her beloved State of Maryland; Barbara Mikulski, first Democrat elected to both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate; Barbara Mikulski, first woman to ever serve as head of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.  But as Barbara, very self-deprecating, has often said: She has never been interested in simply being the first. She wants to be ``the first of many,'' and she has been.  When Maryland voters sent Barbara Mikulski to this Senate in 1986, there were two women in the entire body: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, a Democrat--two women in this Chamber out of 100 Senators. Today, there are 20 women Senators, and after they are sworn in on January 3, there will be 21. That is great progress, but not nearly enough by Barbara Mikulski's standards.  Senator Mikulski also had the brainchild of making sure the women in the Senate became an even more powerful force. Her bipartisan, women Senators-only dinners were a rare display of bipartisanship in an institution too often divided. The discoveries of common cause, common trust, and common purpose resulting from those dinners have made a big difference on the floor of the Senate.  Barbara Ann Mikulski is the proud granddaughter of Polish immigrants. Her parents owned a small grocery store in Baltimore. She, her parents, and her two younger sisters lived across the street in one of the famous Baltimore row houses. As a young girl, Barbara thought about becoming a Catholic nun. She changed her mind because, as she put it, ``that vow of obedience kind of slowed me down a bit.'' So she found other ways to practice the social gospel of justice.  She was a driving force behind the first bill signed by President Barack Obama, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I was there that day. The President signed the bill, and he took the first pen from the first bill he was signing and handed it to Barbara Mikulski because he knew that she had been a champion for equality in the workplace for women throughout her career.  There are two stories that I always think of when I think of Senator Mikulski.  In October 2002, the Senate voted on whether to authorize the war in Iraq. Only 23 of the 100 Senators then serving voted against the Iraq war resolution. Of those 23 Senators, only 8 still remain in the Senate today: Barbara Boxer, who is leaving at the end of this Congress, Patrick Leahy, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Debbie Stabenow, Ron Wyden, Barbara Mikulski, andmyself. This is a woman who has always been willing to risk her career to follow her conscience.  One of her great heroes is Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement. The reason, Barbara Mikulski says, is that Dorothy Day was always ``trying to find the hopes of people,'' rather than preying on people's fear and anger.  I saw Barbara Mikulski's instinctive appeal to hope on that infamous sad day--September 11, 2001. As dust was settling on that heart-wrenching, heartbreaking day, most of the Members of the Senate gathered on the steps of the Capitol. The hope was that there would be a demonstration by Members of both parties to the Nation and to the world of solidarity. Suddenly--unplanned, unscripted--Barbara Mikulski started singing ``God Bless America.'' Everyone joined in. In one of America's darkest hours, Barbara Mikulski brought us together. That is what a real leader does.  I and so many in the Chamber and so many untold millions of Americans are going to miss her presence in the Senate. We take consolation in knowing that, while she is leaving the Senate, she is not leaving the fight. She will never leave the fight.  Those of us who are returning in the next Congress have learned from Senator Mikulski, and we will continue to fight the good fight to invest in lifesaving, job-creating medical breakthroughs at the National Institutes of Health--or, as Barbara Mikulski calls it, the ``National Institutes of Hope.'' We will continue the good fight she has fought with such pithiness and passion to make our Nation safer and make our economy fairer for all Americans. I know that she will continue that fight as well.  Barbara Mikulski may be leaving the Senate, but no one ever has, and I doubt anyone ever will, think of Baltimore's Barbara Mikulski as ``retiring.''  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
