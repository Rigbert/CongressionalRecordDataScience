  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the lives of those who were taken too soon at Umpqua Community College on Thursday, October 1, 2015.  I ask that all Americans pray for the friends and families of these nine victims as they grieve and rebuild from this tragedy.  We must also keep in our thoughts and prayers those who were injured physically and emotionally by this event. It will take time, our support, and patience as they grieve and recover.  Mr. Speaker, Roseburg is a small, strong, and tight-knit community. I am heartened, and not surprised, by the acts of kindness and generosity in response to this unthinkable act. We call that ``UCC Strong,'' ``Roseburg Strong.'' It is this strong spirit that will carry everyone through this difficult time.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in honor of those impacted by the tragic events at Umpqua Community College last week.
