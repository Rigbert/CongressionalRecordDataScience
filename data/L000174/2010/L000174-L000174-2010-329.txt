President, lucky is the town that has a good civic minded newspaper.  Vermont is fortunate to have several, and two reasons for that are the brothers Emerson and Angelo Lynn. The Lynn brothers have shown how public spirited newspapering is also good business.  A profile of the Lynn brothers in a recent edition of Vermont's Seven Days newspaper, written by Ken Picard, opens with this: ``Newspapermen Emerson and Angelo Lynn learned a long time ago that it's not enough for a community paper to be good. It's also got to do good. And the one that achieves both goals can thrive in its niche--even when larger corporate newspapers are struggling.''  Emerson and Angelo Lynn--with roots in Kansas and newspapering in their heritage--have made their homes in Vermont since the 1980s, and it was the chance to publish newspapers that brought them to our State. Emerson has published the St. Albans Messenger since 1981. Angelo arrived soon after to purchase and publish the Addison County Independent.  The Messenger, the Independent and the other publications they own and manage have flourished under their management. Not only have they invested significant time and energy into the success of their own newspapers; they also generously mentor and support other local publishers.  This is a time of uncertainty and introspection in the Nation's newspaper businesses. Alternate media streams and a severe economic recession have driven down earnings and have driven some papers out of business. New formulas will be tried. But in the meantime, Emerson and Angelo Lynn have shown that the old formula of civic minded journalism can still work.  The Lynn brothers have been successful because they care deeply about where they live, and they invest in their communities in every sense, including their hearts and souls. Theyact out of a sense of responsibility to their readers. Their tone is civil and constructive. Mr. Picard quotes veteran Vermont journalist Stephen Kiernan: ``These guys have a real sense of place. They know when a business is doing well; they know when something is changing; they know what's in the wind. A sense of place is essential to any business in Vermont, but it's especially true in the media business.''  These two extraordinary Vermonters continue to give their best, and their businesses have become keystones in the civic infrastructure of Franklin and Addison Counties, and beyond.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article from Seven Days, ``Brothers in Ink,'' by Ken Picard, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Jan. 27, 2010]                            Brothers in InkWhile others elegize print journalism, Emerson and Angelo Lynn are hot                              on the presses                            (By Ken Picard)       Newspapermen Emerson and Angelo Lynn learned a long time      ago that it's not enough for a community newspaper to be      good. It's also got to do good. And the one that achieves      both goals can thrive in its niche--even when larger      corporate newspapers are struggling.       Emerson Lynn, editor and publisher of the six-days-a-week      St. Albans Messenger since 1981, knows his paper has      influence in the community. Shortly before Christmas, the      Hannaford supermarket in his town participated in a company-     wide ``Fund-a-Feast'' campaign. Throughout the holidays,      shoppers could buy a $10 box of food to donate to their local      food shelf. The store in Vermont that sold the most boxes      would win $1000 for its food shelf, and the winning store in      the entire 171-supermarket chain would get an additional      $2500.       A week before the contest ended, Emerson approached store      manager Dan LeCours and asked him how many boxes he needed to      win. LeCours said he didn't know, but was sure he didn't have      enough on hand to even come close.       ``Emerson said, `You get me that number, and I'll take it      from there,' '' LeCours recalls. ``Coming from Emerson, if he      says it, he means it.''       Knowing that one in eight Vermonters is now on food stamps,      Emerson ran free full-page ads in the Messenger the following      week, asking his readers to rise to the challenge. They did.       ``That last weekend we sold $9000 worth of Fund-A-Feast      boxes. None of that would have happened were it not for      Emerson Lynn,'' says LeCours. ``It just goes to show the      power of the press when the person behind it is highly      trusted and highly respected.''       Lately, it's hard to find any good news about print      journalism. In December, the now-defunct-in-print Editor &      Publisher magazine essentially wrote its own obituary when it      reported that more than 40,000 newspaper jobs disappeared in      2009, nearly twice as many as the 21,000 that vanished in      2008. Mainstream newspapers such as the New York Times and      the Boston Globe have continued to echo that death knell.       But you won't find that story anywhere in the pages of a      Lynn publication, or in their bottom lines. Emerson's younger      brother, Angelo, has been editor and publisher of the twice-     weekly Addison County Independent since 1984. According to      Emerson, 2008, the first year of the current recession, was      the Lynns' best year ever. Emerson admits that profits are      down, but only slightly, and neither brother has laid off      staff.       In fact, both the Messenger and the Independent have      employees who've been with them for more than 30 years. In      the Messenger's newsroom, editor Gary Rutkowski and staff      writer Leon Thompson have a half-century of combined      experience between them. Emerson and Angelo insist their      papers wouldn't be where they are today without that level of      institutional memory.       Of course, reaching out to the next generation is crucial,      too. Both the Messenger and Independent routinely devote      space to publishing the work of students in the Young Writers      Project. Once a month, Angelo delivers 200 free copies of the      ``Addy Indy,'' as it's often called, to Middlebury Union High      School. Inside each is a copy of the Tigers' Print, the      student newspaper. Emerson does the same thing for Bellows      Free Academy--St. Albans.       This isn't just smart PR for the Lynn newspapers--it's also      a long-term investment in their readerships.       ``For our newspapers,'' says Emerson, ``this is our seed      corn.''       It's a fitting metaphor, coming from two Kansas brothers      who moved to Vermont more than 25 years ago to sow the seeds      of community journalism in the Champlain Valley. Since then,      the Lynns have reaped the journalistic equivalent of a bumper      crop. In addition to the Messenger and the Independent, the      brothers now publish the Colchester Sun, Essex Reporter,      Brandon Reporter and Milton Independent. Angelo also puts out      Vermont Ski & Ride Magazine, a winter monthly on the ski      industry, and several telephone books in southern Vermont.       In an age when the public has an overabundance of news      sources to choose from--websites, blogs, social networking      sites, 24/7 cable-news channels--how do Lynn publications      manage not just to survive, but to thrive? Very simple,      Emerson explains. They remain faithful to their core mission:      Give readers in-depth local coverage--school board meetings,      high school sports, property taxes and so on--that they want      and can't find anywhere else.       ``When you have a tight-knit community, everybody likes to      know that everybody else is on the same page, and Addison and      Franklin counties are pretty tight-knit communities,'' Angelo      adds. ``What you find now is that, increasingly, the      community newspaper is the glue that binds.''       Stephen Kiernan agrees. A former staff writer at the      Burlington Free Press for 15 years and a longtime Middlebury      resident, he's impressed by how involved Angelo and Emerson      are in their respective communities. This means, for example,      that he sees Emerson out running at a middle-school lacrosse      jamboree attended by hundreds of parents and children. Or he      spots Angelo at a performance of the play Our Town, and the      next day reads his editorial about how the play reflects      Middlebury's diversity.       ``These guys have a real sense of place,'' Kiernan says.      ``They know when a business is doing well; they know when      something is changing; they know what's in the wind . . . A      sense of place is essential to any business in Vermont, but      it's especially true in the media business.''       Steve Terry, also a longtime Middlebury resident and former      editor of the Rutland Herald, agrees. He says that whenever      big institutions in Addison County want to break a story,      they make sure the Independent gets it first.       ``People could read in the Herald or the Free Press that      something happened in Middlebury,'' Terry says, ``but they      just wouldn't believe it or feel it was covered until they      read it in the Independent.''       Tyrone Shaw, director of the journalism program at Johnson      State College, is an aficionado of sorts of small community      newspapers. Shaw says that Lynn newspapers consistently      provide ``aggressive but responsible'' news coverage of      important local issues. He's especially fond of their      editorial and letters sections, which he calls ``meaty and      interesting.''       In large part, that's because Angelo and Emerson typically      write their own editorials. They come from opposite ends of      the political spectrum. Angelo is more left leaning than      Emerson and far more likely to criticize the governor, Jim      Douglas' residence in Middlebury notwithstanding. Emerson, a      regular contributor to the conservative blog Vermont Tiger,      is more likely to attack Bernie Sanders and the actions of      the left-dominated legislature. In the last election,      however, he supported Barack Obama.       Despite some divergent views on elected officials, economic      growth and job creation, the Lynn brothers insist they see      eye to eye on all social issues, such as abortion and      gay rights. Back in July 1997, the Messenger was the first      daily paper in the state to endorse civil unions. It's      that sophisticated understanding of the issues, Shaw says,      that makes the brothers' papers invaluable reading in      their communities.       ``I think they were both born with newspaper ink in their      blood,'' he concludes. ``They're old-fashioned newspapermen      in the very best sense.''       That assessment of the Lynn DNA isn't far off. Emerson and      Angelo are fourth-generation newspapermen. Their great-     grandfather, Charles F. Scott, bought the Iola Register, a      small weekly in southwestern Kansas, in 1882. His son, Angelo      Scott, took over the paper and ran it until 1965, when he      turned it over to Emerson and Angelo's father, who's also      named Emerson.       The elder Emerson and his wife, Mickey, met at college in      Australia, but returned to Kansas in 1950. They published      first the Humboldt, Kan., Humboldt Union, then the Bowie News      in Bowie, Tx., where Emerson and Angelo lived for seven      years.       ``Every single Wednesday night Dad would load us into the      car and take us down to the paper, and we'd insert the      papers,'' recalls Angelo. It's a job the brothers still do on      occasion in the Messenger's ancient, lime-green press room in      St. Albans.       In 1965, the Lynns' parents returned to their Kansas roots      and took over the Register. They ran it until last year, when      Emerson and Angelo's mother died and their father turned over      the publishing duties to their sister, Susan Lynn. The      siblings have a third brother, Michael, a pastor in Hamden,      Conn. Angelo jokes, ``The four of us are either preaching      from the pulpit or from the editorial pages.''       Perhaps it was inevitable that Emerson and Angelo would      choose the newspaper business. In 1970, when Angelo was 16,      he attended a summer camp at the University of Kansas for      kids interested in journalism. On the third day, he recalls,      antiwar protesters bombed the student union. He happened to      be in the office of the photography instructor, who grabbed a      camera and dashed to the scene.       ``Minutes later,'' Angelo remembers, ``we were crouched      behind a police car, the cops with pointed guns surrounding      the student union, and us with our cameras clicking . . . I      was hooked.''       Both Emerson and Angelo eventually graduated from KU's      William Allen White School     of Journalism. Emerson got married and moved east to work on      Capitol Hill as a speechwriter for then-U.S. Sen. Jim      Pearson, a Kansas Republican--then for his successor, Sen.      Nancy Kassebaum.       But Emerson quickly grew bored with his duties and began      looking around for a newspaper to buy. He considered some in      the Rocky Mountain area, but quickly realized he'd never      afford one. In 1981, a broker approached him with a proposal      to buy a stridently right-wing daily in northwestern Vermont.      The St. Albans Daily Messenger, then owned by publisher      William Loeb, had never made money. Emerson bought the paper      and quickly improved its reputation and financial      performance.       Three years later, Gordon Mills, owner of the Addison      County Independent, approached Emerson and asked him if he      was interested in buying his newspaper, too. Emerson declined      but suggested he contact Angelo, who at the time was running      the Yates Center News, a small, struggling weekly in      southeastern Kansas.       So in August 1984, at age 30, Angelo bought the Vermont      weekly. Four years later, he turned it into a twice-weekly      paper. Today the Addison County Independent has a staff of 21      employees, seven of whom (including Angelo) work in the      newsroom. Angelo insists that his commitment to news coverage      continues to pay off. Though he says he's made only a modest      investment in the paper's website over the years, in 2009 the      Vermont Press Association named it the state's best.       Meanwhile, the Lynns have continued to acquire flailing      newspapers and turned them into money-making ventures. And      they've done so with seemingly boundless energy.       ``As Angelo likes to say, we're always the last ones on the      treadmill,'' Emerson says. ``You may be smarter than us, but      you'll never outwork us.''       Indeed. As kids, Emerson and Angelo spent most summers at a      family cabin in Colorado. Each morning they'd wake at the      crack of dawn, load their packs and spend the next 10 to 14      hours hiking to a summit.       That commitment to rigorous outdoor exercise hasn't      flagged. Emerson and Angelo are well past 50--in a rare show      of vanity, Emerson declines to disclose his age, and Angelo      won't betray his brother. But neither looks or acts it. Trim,      hale and handsome, the brothers have chiseled bodies and      resting heart rates that would be the envy of men half their      age.       Both routinely compete in marathons, triathlons, canoe      races and other competitions that demand iron-man stamina.      Angelo skis 40 to 50 days per year. Last year, he competed in      the Canadian Death Race, a three-day endurance course that      traverses a raging river and three mountain summits and      includes 17,000 feet of elevation change.       Never one to be outdone by his younger brother, Emerson      recently took on a 3100-repetition weight-training workout      challenge. He completed it in under one hour and 50 minutes.       ``We're excessive,'' Emerson admits unapologetically. ``The      two of us are extraordinarily competitive. But it's never me      against him or him against me. It's ``Let's see what we can      do.' ''       That drive for peak performance is reflected in their      careers. Both are self-described workaholics--Emerson is      still married, Angelo divorced--and are intimately involved      in every detail of their publications, from writing daily      editorials to selling ads to distribution. On a recent visit      to Seven Days, Angelo's station wagon was filled with      newspapers that needed delivering.       ``I have never met anyone in daily journalism who has      maintained such a high level of energy day after day after      day,'' notes Chris Graff, the former Associated Press writer      who ran the Montpelier bureau for 26 years. Speaking of      Emerson, he recalls, ``When I was at the AP, his routine was      to arrive at work at 5 a.m. every day--and he wrote an      editorial every day.''       But the Lynns' competitive spirit doesn't come with a      bullying or predatory attitude. The brothers have helped      fellow Vermont publishers, including those at Seven Days, who      benefited from Angelo's free advice when this paper launched.      Angelo was also on hand when a group of journalists and      publishers gathered recently in Grafton to discuss working      cooperatively in the digital age.       M. Dickey Drysdale, editor and publisher of the Herald of      Randolph, calls the Lynn brothers ``the best gift that Kansas      has ever given to Vermont journalism.'' Drysdale, who's been      at the Herald since 1971, says Emerson and Angelo have given      him business advice and suggestions for advertising campaigns      over the years, never expecting anything in return.       ``You can sometimes get the idea that press lords are      supercilious and very, very serious,'' Drysdale adds. ``Both      [Emerson and Angelo] seem to approach their jobs with a high      seriousness, but also a cheerful attitude that makes them fun      to deal with and makes their newspapers very approachable.''       The Lynns say they don't view other community newspapers as      competition, even in markets where they compete for ad      revenues. As the state's biggest dailies shrink in size--     lately, the Monday Burlington Free Press has had fewer pages      than the Monday Messenger--neither brother sees any reason to      alter their course.       ``I don't think you get stronger because other people get      weaker. You're stronger because of your adherence to your      mission,'' Emerson concludes. ``We're not having to      rediscover that local news is important. We've been doing      that forever. That's our bread and butter.''                          ____________________
