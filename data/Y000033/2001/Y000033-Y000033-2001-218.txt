Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and out of respect to the Speaker, he is not too quick when it comes to picking up when the gentleman yielded to me.  I would also say just one thing. What bothers me most about this debate is what we are thinking about is the time frame. If we do not do something tonight and the market opens up Monday, I want everybody to think about this, we are hoping and I am praying because I have been through about four of these and some of you have not, being one of the seniors Members of this House. When most of the American people come back and, in fact, believe in America and the faith of America and will not drop the stock market. I have watched this. Check the Gulf War. Check World War II. Check the Korean war and the Vietnam. I have been all through them.  I believe the American people will, in fact, stand up and say yes we are willing to invest; but I will tell you what will happen. We have airline industry on the verge of collapse, and if we do not lay down a mark in the sand and say, yes, we are willing, because of action of our government to back up those airline industries to allow some moneys, they will start going down and every other stock will start following it. Keep that in mind. Keep in mind what I am saying here.  I may be wrong, I hope I am wrong, but if you do not pass this tonight, and Thursday when we have a crash, I hope that those who object to this understand what I am saying because you have created it.
