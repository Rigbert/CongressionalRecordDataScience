President, today I am reintroducing legislation to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to share in the cost of the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant for Hermiston, Oregon. The bill is identical to legislation which passed the House of Representatives in the previous Congress, by voice vote, and which was reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee without opposition last year.  The reason for involving the Bureau in this project is quite simple. Once constructed, the plant will provide the Bureau-authorized West Extension Irrigation District with enough additional high-quality water per year to irrigate approximately 600 acres of high value crops. This will have a significant, long-term benefit to the farming industry in the Hermiston area.  The Hermiston project has gotten the sign off at every level from the local irrigation district to Federal agencies. The City and the Bureau have completed the required feasibility report and the Bureau of Reclamation has formally concluded that the project meets the requirements of the Title XVI cost-sharing program. The regional office of the National Marine Fisheries Service at NOAA has completed a biological opinion approving the project. The City and the West Extension Irrigation District have signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to develop the project. The Bureau has concluded its environmental review of the authorization to transfer the water to the District and issued a finding of no significant impact or FONSI.  Although the Bureau will be sharing in the cost of the project, I want my colleagues to know that the City, not the Bureau, will be responsible for the bulk of the expense. CBO has estimated that the Federal share of the $26 million project would be $7 million or just over one-quarter of the cost.  The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation have also recognized the benefits of the project and support it. These benefits include a significant improvement in the quality of water discharged to the Umatilla River in winter and protection of sensitive fish habitat during summer. These benefits have led the tribe to endorse construction of the Hermiston Water Recycling System Improvement Project and the City's effort to obtain federal funding.  This project will increase agricultural production while improving the local economy, the environment and habitat for endangered fish. I look forward to working with my colleagues to complete action on this legislation after it had advanced so far in the last Congress.                                 ______                                       By
