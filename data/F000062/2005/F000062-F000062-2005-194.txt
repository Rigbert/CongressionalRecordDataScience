 President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition to the motion to proceed on the gun liability bill.  Before I begin, I want to say I find it incongruous that we had the Defense Authorization bill up, an important bill--we were about to consider some amendments affecting enemy combatants and detainees, I think very important amendments, by Senator McCain, Senator Warner, and Senator Graham. The bill was up for an unprecedented short time, and had to have cloture, according to the Republican side. Well, some of us wanted to hear what Senators McCain, Warner, and Graham had to say. So, we voted against cloture. Then, the leader took down the bill, and now we are on a bill for a real special interest in this country, the National Rifle Association.  Mr. President, I have carefully reviewed this bill, and in my assessment is it is mistitled. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act has nothing to do with protecting lawful commerce; rather, it protects one segment of industry against the lawful interests of our States in remedying and deterring negligent conduct.  The bill pretends to be part of the long-ranging and important debate about gun regulation. Its proponents argue that lawsuits need to be stopped in order to defend their view of the second amendment. But that is pretense. This bill is a simple giveaway to one industry--the gun lobby. It is a special-interest windfall.  I, for one, do not believe we should be giving the gun industry sweeping and unprecedented protection from the type of lawsuits that are available to every individual involving every other industry anywhere in America.  We have to recognize that guns in America are responsible for the deaths of 30,000 Americans a year. If we remove this one avenue for enforcing responsibility, individuals will have no recourse. Gun owners and gun victims alike will be left virtually powerless against an industry that is already immune from so many other consumer protections. So we find ourselves today on the cusp of yet another NRA victory.  Simply put, we are considering legislation that would ensure that it is not in the financial interests of gun manufacturers or sellers to take reasonable care in administering their business. We are removing the incentives of the tort system to encourage responsible behavior. No longer will those incentives to responsible behavior be present.  Let me be clear, if this bill is approved, it will not be a victory for law-abiding gun owners who might someday benefit from the ability to sue a manufacturer or dealer for their negligent conduct. No, this will be a victory for those who have turned the NRA into a political powerhouse, unconcerned with the rights of a majority of Americans who want prudent controls over firearms and who want to maintain their basic legal right in our civil law system.  Now, I do not support meritless lawsuits against the gun industry. I do not think anybody does. It is my belief gun manufacturers and dealers should be held accountable for irresponsible marketing and distribution practices, as anyone else would be, particularly when these practices may cause guns to fall into the hands of criminals, juveniles or mentally ill people.  This legislation has one simple purpose: to prevent lawsuits from those harmed by gun violence as a result of the wrongful conduct of others. These include lawsuits filed by cities andcounties responding to crimes often committed using guns that flood the illegal market, with the full knowledge of the distributors that the legal market could not possibly be absorbing so many of these weapons--that is why so many mayors have written strongly against this legislation--and lawsuits filed by organizations on behalf of their members and victims of violent crimes and their families who are injured or killed as a result of gun violence facilitated by the negligence of gun manufacturers or sellers.  This issue is not an abstract one. The bill is going to hurt real people--victims not only of criminal misuse by a well-designed firearm, but victims of guns that have been marketed in ways which, quite frankly, should be illegal.  Essentially, this bill prohibits any civil liability lawsuit from being filed against the gun industry for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a gun by a third party, with a number of narrow exceptions.  In doing so, the bill effectively rewrites traditional principles of liability law which generally hold that persons and companies may be liable for their negligence, even if others are liable as well. This bill would essentially give the gun industry blanket immunity from civil liability cases of this type, an immunity no other industry in America has today. This is truly a remarkable aspect of the legislation. It is a radical approach to our Nation's laws and the principles of federalism.  The bill does allow certain cases to move forward, as its supporters have pointed out, but these cases can proceed only on the narrowest of circumstances. Countless experts have now said that this bill would stop virtually all of the suits against gun dealers and manufacturers filed to date which are based on distribution practice, many of which are vital to changing industry practice and compensating victims who have been horribly injured through the clear negligence or even borderline criminal conduct of some gun dealers and manufacturers.  With any other business or product, in every other industry, a seller or manufacturer can be liable if that seller or manufacturer is negligent, but not here. Since money, rather than life or liberty, is at stake in a civil case, the standard of proof is lower. There need not be a criminal violation to recover damages. In the overwhelming majority of civil cases, there is no criminal violation. But here, contrary to general negligence law covering almost every other product, the bill allows negligent gun dealers and manufacturers to get off the hook unless they violated a criminal law. This is dreadful. It is despicable. This bill would create a special area of law for gun manufacturers and says that unless they violate a law, they can be careless in how they stock, secure, and sell dangerous weapons.  The judge in Washington State, presiding over the case brought by the DC area sniper victims--the case where a sniper lay in the trunk of a car with a hole punched through the trunk, went to different gasoline stations, schools, parks, and stores, and simply fired at people, indiscriminately killing them--has ruled twice that the dealer of the weapon used in the shooting, Bull's Eye Shooters Supply, and its manufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms, may be liable in negligence for enabling the snipers to obtain their weapon. But even with the new modifications of this bill, the sniper victims' cases will likely be thrown out of court under this legislation. So guess whose side this Senate is coming down on. Not the side of the victims of the DC sniper but the side of Bull's Eye Shooters Supply and the manufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms.  Let's make that clear. This is the most notorious sniper case in America. There is negligence on the part of the gun dealer who sold that gun. He didn't report it until very late. He allowed the snipers to get the gun. Now we are passing a law to prevent the victims from suing under civil liability. Nowhere else in the law does this concept exist in this form. It is a special carve-out for the DC sniper gun manufacturer and gun seller.  In another case, a Massachusetts court has ruled that gun manufacturer Kahr Arms may be liable for negligently hiring drug-addicted criminals and enabling them to stroll out the plant door with unmarked guns to be sold to criminals. But with these proposed changes, the case against Kahr Arms would be dismissed. A case would be dismissed where a gun manufacturer negligently hired drug-addicted criminals and let them go out the plant door with unmarked guns to be sold to criminals. That is what this does.  This conduct, though outrageous, violated no law--negligent, yes; criminal, no. Contrary to current law which allows judges and juries to apportion blame and damages, this bill would bar any damages against a manufacturer if another party was liable due to a criminal act.  Why should firearms get special treatment? In our society, we hold manufacturers liable for the damage their negligence causes. We do this across the board for every industry, such as the automobile industry if they build a faulty gas tank or if they are negligent putting it together. Lawsuits filed against the gun industry provide a way for those harmed to seek justice from the damages and destruction caused by firearms. Just as important, they create incentives to reform practices proven to be dangerous. I will bet Kahr Arms will make every effort not to hire drug addicts to sell guns to criminals. If that case is dismissed, they can hire them. They can sell to criminals. That is not going to make a difference.  When this bill was introduced in the last Congress and again in this Congress, its supporters spoke about the need to protect the industry from frivolous lawsuits and the need to protect the industry from the potential loss of jobs brought on by future lawsuits. These claims are unfounded. This bill is simply the latest attempt of the gun lobby to evade industry accountability. The suits against the gun industry come in varying forms, but they all have one goal in common--forcing the firearms industry to become more responsible. What is wrong with that? Under the principles of common law, all individuals and industries have a duty to act responsibly. What is special about the gun industry that they should be exempt from this most basic of civil responsibilities? Answer: Nothing. This is an industry that is less accountable under law than any other in America right now. The only avenue of accountability left is the courtroom. This bill attempts to slam the courtroom door in the face of those who would hold the industry responsible for its negligent actions.  We ought to hold the industry responsible for taking the proper precautions to ensure law-abiding citizens are able to obtain the guns they choose while criminals and other prohibited individuals are not.  Let me read from a letter that was sent by more than 50 full professors from law schools all across this Nation, from the University of Michigan School of Law, UCLA Law School, the University of Oregon School of Law, Indiana University School of Law, Harvard Law School, Syracuse University College of Law, Brooklyn Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, Lewis and Clark Law School, Roger Williams University School of Law, Northwestern School of Law, University of Chicago Law School, William Mitchell College of Law, University of Colorado School of Law, Duke Law School, Albany Law School, University of California Hastings College of Law, Houston Law Center, Widener University School of Law, Rutgers, Tulane, Boston, Albany, Temple University Beasley School of Law, Case Western Reserve University School of Law, Cornell Law School, Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University, NYU School of Law, The George Washington University Law School, Boston College Law School, Tulane University Law School, Columbia Law School, New York Law School, University of Alabama School of Law, Emory University School of Law, University of California Boalt School of Law, and on and on.  Let me tell you what they say. I will read parts of it. They have reviewed this bill, S. 397.       No other industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed such a blanket      freedom from responsibility for the foreseeable and      preventable consequences of negligent conduct.       S. 397 . . . would abrogate this firmly established      principle of tort law. Under this bill, the firearms industry      would be the one and only business in which actors would be      free utterly to disregard the risk, no matter how high or      foreseeable, that their conduct     might be creating or exacerbating a potentially preventable      risk of third party misconduct. Gun and ammunition makers,      distributors, importers, and sellers would, unlike any other      business or individual, be free to take no precautions      against even the most foreseeable and easily preventable      harms resulting from the illegal actions of third parties.      And they could engage in this negligent conduct persistently,      even with the specific intent of profiting from the sales of      guns that are foreseeably headed to criminal hands.  They could engage in the conduct in an unlimited way and profit from the sales of guns that are foreseeably headed for criminal hands.       Under this bill, a firearms dealer, distributor, or      manufacturer could park an unguarded open pickup truck full      of loaded assault weapons on a city street corner, leave it      there for a week, and yet be free from any negligence      liability if and when the guns were stolen and used to do      harm.  Mr. President, this is what we are doing. This isn't just my view, this is the view of more than 50 professors of law at major law schools all across the Nation. We are facilitating criminal conduct by providing this protection against liability.  It goes on to say:       A firearms dealer, in most states, could sell 100 guns to      the same individual every day, even after the dealer is      informed that these guns are being used in crime--even, say,      by the same violent street gang.  That is a direct quote. So you are facilitating a situation where somebody could sell a hundred guns a day to a street gang and have no liability for that action. That is what I think is really despicable--all because of the power of one lobby.  Again, it goes on to say:       It might appear from the face of the bill that S. 397 and      H.R. 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability      for truly egregious misconduct, by virtue of several      exceptions set forth in Section 4(5)(I). Those exceptions,      however, are in fact quite narrow and would give those in the      firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks of      foreseeable third party misconduct.       One exception, for example, would purport to permit certain      actions for ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on,      however, to define ``negligent entrustment'' extremely      narrowly.       The exception applies only to sellers, for example, and      would not apply to distributors or manufacturers, no matter      how egregious their conduct.  So when somebody comes to the floor and argues this bill provide for negligent entrustment, don't believe it. It is so limited that it doesn't cover the whole field of those who handle firearms.  And then it goes on to say:       Even as the sellers, the exception would apply only where      the particular person to whom a seller supplies a firearm is      one whom the seller knows or ought to know will use it to      cause harm. The ``negligent entrustment'' exception would,      therefore, not permit any action based on reckless      distribution practices, negligent sales to gun traffickers      who supply criminals--  That is the pickup that is parked on the street corner containing loaded assault weapons and sold to anybody who comes by.       The negligent entrustment exception would, therefore, not      permit any action based on reckless distribution practices,      negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals,      careless handling of firearms, lack of security, or any of a      myriad of potentially negligent acts.       Another exception would leave open the possibility of      liability for certain statutory violations, variously      defined, including those described under the heading of      negligence per se. Statutory violations, however, represent      just a narrow special case of negligence liability. No      jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to      every detail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there      is no need. Why is there no need? Because general principles      of tort law make clear that the mere absence of a specific      statutory prohibition is not carte blanche for unreasonable      or dangerous behavior. S. 397 and H.R. 800 would turn this      traditional framework on its head, and free those in the      firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like,      so long as the conduct has not been specifically prohibited.      If there is no statute against leaving an open truckload of      assault weapons on a street corner, or against selling      hundreds of guns to the same individual, under this bill      there could be no tort liability.  That is what this bill is opening up.       Again, this represents a radical departure from traditional      tort principles.  Again, this isn't just me saying this; this is more than 50 law professors from almost 50 different law schools.       As currently drafted, this bill would not simply protect      against the expansion of tort liability, as has been      suggested, but would in fact dramatically limit the      application of longstanding and otherwise universally      applicable tort principles. It provides to firearm makers and      distributors a literally unprecedented form of tort immunity      not enjoyed, or even dreamed of, by any other industry.  Mr. President, I know the motion to proceed will pass. I also know that what is being engaged upon is the most stringent test of germaneness I have ever seen take place in this body to prevent amendments from being offered once cloture is invoked, which is going to happen. This Senate is going to do the people it represents an enormous harm. They are going to protect the most powerful lobby in the United States and open millions of Americans to egregious injury from negligent practices by distributors and sellers of firearms in this country.  That is not what we were elected to do. No one in this body was elected to be the Senator from the National Rifle Association. Although they have a point of view, and although this point of view is popular in many places, the question is, do we still protect the public welfare?  I say to you we do not protect the public welfare, as more than 50 professors of law have pointed out.  Additionally, I will put into the Record a letter of opposition from law enforcement. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 26, 2005.     U.S. Congress,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As active and retired law enforcement      officers, we are writing to urge your strong opposition to      any legislation granting the gun industry special legal      immunity. S. 397 would strip away the legal rights of gun      violence victims, including law enforcement officers and      their families, to seek redress against irresponsible gun      dealers and manufacturers.       The impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is      well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former Orange, New      Jersey police officers Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. On      January 12, 2001, McGuire and Lemongello were shot in the      line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a West      Virginia dealer. The dealer had sold the gun, along with 11      other handguns, in a cash sale to a straw buyer for a gun      trafficker. In June 2004, the officers obtained a $1 million      settlement from the dealer. The dealer, as well as two other      area pawnshops, also have implemented safer practices to      prevent sales to traffickers, including a new policy of      ending large-volume sales of handguns. These reforms go      beyond the requirements of current law and are not imposed by      any manufacturers or distributors.       If immunity for the gun industry had been enacted, the      officers' case would have been thrown out of court and      justice would have been denied. Police officers like Ken      McGuire and Dave Lemongello put their lives on the line every      day to protect the public. Instead of honoring them for their      service, legislation granting immunity to the gun industry      would deprive them of their basic rights as American citizens      to prove their case in a court of law. We stand with officers      McGuire and Lemongello in urging you to oppose such      legislation.
