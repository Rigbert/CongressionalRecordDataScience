President, today I pay tribute to an outstanding Rhode Islander, a Vietnam veteran, and champion of workers' rights and justice in the workplace who retired after 35 years of service--my friend, Stan Israel.  After serving two tours in Vietnam, Stan began working for the Service Employees International Union, SEIU, in 1974, first as an organizer with Local 1199, covering New York and Long Island. Stan represented health employees in hospitals and nursing homes organizing employees around workplace safety and fair wages. Then, in 1983, after a short stay in neighboring Connecticut, Stan moved to Rhode Island to head the New England District of SEIU, where he recently retired as executive director.  For nearly three decades, Stan led Rhode Island's second largest union, which represents hard-working health care employees at hospitals across my State and hundreds of nursing and community health centers as well. Stan is a man of principle, good judgment, and great character. Moreover, he has been an unmatched advocate for the social and economic concerns of those in greatest need.  Indeed, Stan's focus and dedication has always been geared towards improving patient care in our hospitals and nursing homes and preserving the collective voice of workers' rights. He demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to workers and their families, which extended to their safety and health on and off the job.  Over the years, Stan organized the labor management committees at our hospitals to educate and train health care employees and worked to secure funding for training and professional growth programs. Moreover, Stan helped craft the Rhode Island Safe Patient Handling Act, a State law that has helped reduce the number of injuries suffered by patients and caretakers in health care facilities. And, after many years of Stan's efforts and activism, another bill was signed into Rhode Island law preventing hospitals from forcing mandatory overtime for nurses and nurse's aides, except in the case of emergencies.  But these are only a handful of Stan's achievements. And while these accomplishments came with great sacrifice and setbacks, Stan never quit and never stopped fighting to elevate the dignity and value of workers.  Stan's career represents a lifetime of distinguished service to his country, his State, and above all his members.  Now, after a well-deserved retirement, congratulations and thank you. I wish you and your wife, Cynthia, your children, Caitlin and John, the very best in all your future endeavors.                          ____________________
