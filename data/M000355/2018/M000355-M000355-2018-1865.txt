 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so ordered.  All postcloture time has expired.  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.  The motion was agreed to.                          ____________________
