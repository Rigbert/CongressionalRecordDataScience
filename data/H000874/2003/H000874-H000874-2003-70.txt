Speaker, I take this time for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to my friend the distinguished majority leader for the purpose of discussing the schedule for the coming week and perhaps the weeks thereafter.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of today.  On Tuesday, the House will convene at 9 a.m. for morning hour and 10 a.m. for legislative business. We may consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. We also hope to have the conference report on H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003, ready for consideration.  In addition to that, there is a chance that we could consider a number of appropriations conference reports, as well as the Department of Defense authorization conference report.  Members should also be aware that we will likely move a continuing resolution next week, as the current one expires on October 31.  Finally, I would like to make all Members aware that we may be working into the late evening on Tuesday as we work to complete these important pieces of legislation. I urge Members to plan accordingly.  Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to answer any questions the gentleman may have.
