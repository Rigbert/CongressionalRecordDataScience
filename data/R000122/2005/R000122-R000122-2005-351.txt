One is an amendment authored by Senator Kohl, which I offered on child safety locks. The floor manager and I have discussed this amendment. There are some technical concerns about it. But that is one.  The second is an amendment Senator Corzine would like to offer about exempting law enforcement officers from the provisions of the bill.  The third is an amendment Senator Lautenberg would like to offer with respect to the denial of immunity when the victims are children.  These are the three amendments. But we are not seeking any extraordinary, provocative amendments. We are trying to get amendments up that are relevant to this discussion about gun safety. I honestly believe that 3 hours--my amendment is going to take 3 hours--and at least several hours for the other amendments will be sufficient time to review this.  I am not going to make a formal parliamentary inquiry now, but I am not under the impression, under the rules of the Senate, that a Senator must get the permission of any other Senator to offer an amendment. If he has the floor, and particularly before cloture, the amendment can be offered. I will seek to clarify that. I do not want to be in error on that point.  But we have gone to great lengths to be cooperative, collegial, to be able to offer these amendments, and to this point we have got this sort of silence--or not silence, but simply: We are looking at it, we are looking at it, we are looking at it. I do not think we can continue in this posture indefinitely.  I thank the Democratic leader.
