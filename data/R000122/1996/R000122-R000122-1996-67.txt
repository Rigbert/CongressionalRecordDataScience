Speaker, I rise today to take this opportunity to congratulate and recognize the distinguished career of Wallace Kido, the manager of the Providence district of the U.S. Postal Service. In that capacity, Mr. Kido is responsible for serving postal customers throughout the State of Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, a region generating revenues in excess of $440 million. Sadly, after 32 years of exemplary public service, Mr. Kido has announced that he will be retiring early next year.  During his tenure with the Rhode Island office, Mr. Kido has been a good friend and an effective representative of the U.S. Postal Service. His career with the U.S. Postal Service began back in 1964, when he started as a clerk in San Francisco.  Since then, Mr. Kido has taken on a series of increasingly higher positions and assignments, including director of the Office of Human Resources at Postal Service headquarters. Mr. Kido joined the Providence Postal Service in 1986 as general manager-postmaster. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Kido earned a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he represented the Postal Service in the Alfred P. Sloan Fellows Program.  Mr. Kido's duties as Providence district postmaster include managing 195 post offices, 3 processing and distribution plants, and almost 9,000 employees. His remarkable energy and commitment to the task makes what he does seem effortless.  During his 10 years as manager in Providence, Mr. Kido has brought a degree of excellence, and more importantly, a sense of pride, to the challenging task of coordinating the processing of 1 billion pieces of mail each year. In fact, average overnight delivery service in Rhode Island has exceeded the national average over the last seven quarters.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Kido's exemplary service. He will be greatly missed as the Providence district manager, and I wish him all the best as he embarks upon a new phase of endeavors.                          ____________________
