President, I thank my good friend from Florida for his statement. I again welcome him back. I heard in his absence statements from both Republicans and Democrats worried about him. I am glad to see him back. The Senator and his wife are dear and close friends of mine and my wife.  Sometimes people forget the Senate is a family. There are only 100 of us. We tend to know each other and spend time with each other. No matter what political positions we take, we worry about each other's health. We talk about each other's children and where they are going to school.  This is an example of those who were concerned about a very popular Senator. I am glad to see him looking in such great health. I welcome him back.I thank him, of course, for his very thoughtful statement. I am glad to hear the quotes from a book that I probably enjoyed as much as any in the last 10 years, David McCullough's book on John Adams. I do not own the publishing company or anything else, but I recommend that book to anyone who wants to read it.
