President, at the direction of the majority leader, I announce there will be no further votes today. The next vote is scheduled for 4:30 on Monday. It will be a cloture motion filed by Senator McConnell relative to the bill on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  The Senate will be in session tomorrow at 9:30 for morning business and debate. Members who care to may come to the floor to discuss issues of their choosing. I would say on behalf of the majority leader as well our frustration that we have reached this point. We have a deadline of February 1 to enact this new FISA act. The President has argued he needs this to keep America safe. We have offered to the Republican side an extension of the current law so that the President would be able to continue this policy and program uninterrupted for a month, several months, as long as a year and a half, and we have been rejected. The Republican leadership on the floor has argued they do not want to extend this program as we try to work out differences on the issue of the liability of telephone companies that provided information to the Federal Government. That is unfortunate.  It is also unfortunate that we had Members of the Senate come to the floor in good faith to offer amendments to this bill. I can tell you, having spoken to those on our side of the aisle, each of the amendments was prepared and offered to the Republican side for their review, no surprises. We understood that they would offer their own amendments in response. That is certainly proper. It would engage the Senate in debate on some very important issues relative to national security. But it was the decision of the Republican leadership they wanted no amendments, they wanted no debate. They wanted the President's version of this bill, take it or leave it. They would rather run the risk of closing down this program of surveillance of terrorists than perhaps give us a chance for a few amendments to be debated and voted on in the next 24 hours. That is an unfortunate start to the 2008 Senate session.  In the last year of the Senate, the Republicans were responsible for some 62 efforts to stop debate on the floor, 62 efforts at filibusters, which is a modern record; in fact, it is an all-time record for the Senate; 62 different occasions the Republicans engaged in filibusters to stop debate.  We were hopeful as we talked about the stimulus package and bipartisanship, working together, that things had changed. And then within a matter of hours, the Republican leadership came to the floor to stop us from having any amendments, any debate in a timely fashion on this important bill, and also to stop us from extending this bill, this law, so the President can use this program, and that America would never have its security at risk.  I think the Republicans have taken an untenable, indefensible position. They do not want the law extended so the President can use it. They do not want us to enact any revision to the law or even debate it on the off chance that there might be a change. They have taken the position it is their way or the highway.  Well, we will have a vote on Monday, an unfortunate vote that would have been avoided with a modicum of cooperation here in the Senate.  So there will be no further votes today; the first vote will be at 4:30 on Monday.                          ____________________
