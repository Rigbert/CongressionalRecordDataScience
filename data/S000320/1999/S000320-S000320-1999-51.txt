 President, I am aware of this issue due to the diligence of the Michigan Senators, and I understand the concerns they have regarding Coast Guard's proposal. I have seen the amendment filed by colleagues from Michigan to ensure the continued search and rescue coverage from the Muskegon Air Station during the high-traffic summer season. While I would be concerned if the closure of this facility would cause a degradation of search and rescue capability, it is not possible at this point to incorporate such legislative directives to the Coast Guard given the large number of other legislative initiatives regarding Coast Guard facilities that have been presented to the Subcommittee.
