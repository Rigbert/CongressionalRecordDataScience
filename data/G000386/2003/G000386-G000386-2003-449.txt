 President, in case I do not get an opportunity tomorrow--or who knows, maybe even forget it--I am reminded by the Senator's statement that even though we have disagreed on the substance of this legislation, the Senator from Montana, the ranking member of the committee, has very cooperatively helped us move this legislation along. We have entered into several agreements to help us get amendments out of the way. A couple of times when there were some political differences, he helped smooth my path to move this bill along. That is all within the tradition of the Senate Finance Committee, and I say it not only to bring attention to the cooperative effort of Senator Baucus and also of the committee but also to demonstrate to the people of the country who might be watching this debate on the Senate Finance Committee bill and feel, well, it is just all the Republicans on one side and all the Democrats on the other side, that we are always that way and very seldom is a product from the Senate Finance Committee not a bipartisan product.  I thank Senator Baucus for helping us move this bill along, even though he is not in agreement with the substance of the legislation.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
