  Under our bill, each country is required to have an established system of controls deemed adequate by the DEA. Only DEA permit or license holders in those countries may receive regulated products. Re-exports are limited to one single cross-border transfer. The DEA must be satisfied by substantial evidence that the exported substance will be used to meet an actual medical, scientific or other legitimate need and that the second country of receipt will hold or issue appropriate import licenses or permits. The exporter must notify the DEA in writing within 30 days of a re-export, and an export permit must have been issued by the DEA.  The legislation specifically retains the Drug Enforcement Administration's authority to deny a request to export or re-export a controlled substance. A company seeking to export a drug for subsequent transfer must provide the DEA with exhaustive information on both the country of initial export and the countries to which the controlled substances would ultimately be destined. In addition, DEA must be provided follow-up notification of any cross border shipment within 30 days of that transfer. The U.S. Government will know where all drugs are being shipped and for what purpose. Without that information, U.S. pharmaceuticals will never leave our soil.
