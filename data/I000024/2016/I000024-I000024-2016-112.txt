President, we have been here before. The same language that is in the base bill right now was in a year ago. On the floor last year, we passed the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment, requiring a Secretary of Defense report on commissary benefits. It passed by unanimous consent with 25 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and it was supported by 41 outside organizations and by the administration. It required a study on the impact of privatization of commissaries on military families before a pilot program on privatizing could be implemented that was to look at modifications to the commissary system.  I am sending the language now, which I will get to in a minute. It required a Comptroller General assessment of the plan no later than 120 days after submittal of the report.  Here is the situation. The House passed the fiscal year 2017 NDAA, and it doesn't include privatization language. The Senate version has the same language as last year, which would authorize a pilot program to privatize five commissaries on five major military bases. But only yesterday, we received the report from the Secretary of Defense. We have not yet received the Comptroller General's review.  Congress asked for this study because of concerns about the impact that privatization could have on our servicemembers and the commissary benefit. It seems as if we are taking away benefits. We are working these guys and gals harder than we ever have before, and this is one very significant benefit that is there.  Senator Mikulski and I, along with our now 38 cosponsors--last year it was 25--and with the support of 42 outside organizations are offering a simple amendment that strikes the privatization pilot program, allowing Congress to receive and vet the Secretary of Defense report and the valuation of the Comptroller.  This is not the first time this was done. The January 2015 report by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission determined that commissaries were worth preserving, and they did not recommend privatization. That report took place almost 2 years ago.  When surveyed in 2014, 95 percent of the military members were using commissaries and gave them a 91-percent satisfaction rate.  According to the Military Officers Association of America, the average family of four who shops exclusively at commissaries sees a savings of somewhere between 30 percent to 40 percent.  Mr. President, I have six testimonials from military members about using commissaries that I wish to enter into the Record. They said the following:       ``Our family needs the commissary! We wouldn't be able to      afford a decent amount of groceries for our family if we had      to shop off post!''       ``My husband is currently active duty AF, and I drive 30      one way just to be able to shop at the commissary. We are      stationed at a base in the middle of nowhere and if I were to      shop at our local store, I would pay nearly twice as much.      And, I know that a vast majority of those stationed where we      are use the commissary for the same reason. And please      consider those stationed overseas and in other rural      locations. If the commissaries were privatized, they could      increase the prices and without competition, our grocery bill      would be significantly higher.''       ``Whether I am in the states or overseas I use my benefits      of lower food cost. I've been in the military for 22 years,      I've seen a lot of changes. But this should not be one. If      anyone from your office wants more information feel free to      contact me.''       ``While there are some items that may be found at a lower      individual price on the economy the total combined savings      remains constant.''       ``When I went out in town and we tried to get the same      amount, we got about half of the groceries that we could      afford at the Commissary.''       ``If you want to keep an all-volunteer military, you must      keep the benefits that are in place as of today and for the      future. All that are serving and have served depend on the     commissary and exchange for low-cost goods. If the Commission      does not recommend a pay increase, all benefits are extremely      needed.''  Commissaries are required to operate in remote areas. A lot of these objections are from commissaries in remote areas where people don't have any other place to actually make their purchases.  At a time when thousands of junior servicemembers and their families use food stamps, we should not be making changes that could increase costs at the checkout line.  The commissary benefit encourages people to reenlist, preserving a well-trained, dedicated military. It ensures that training investments are well spent, saving the expense of retraining the majority of the force every few years. The commissary savings and proximity and the consistency of the commissaries also encourage spouses, whose opinions may be a deciding factor in reenlistment decisions.  I know this is true. Just last Friday I was at Altus Air Force Base. I went into the commissary and talked to someone who was reconsidering. It was the wife of a flyer. Right now one of the biggest problems we have in the Air Force is the pilot shortage. They said that would be a major determining the factor. So it is the right thing to do.  It also provides jobs for families of servicemen. Sixty percent of the commissary employees are military related. The greatest benefit is that their jobs are transferable. If they are transferred from one place to another, they are already trained and ready to go.  As I said, the Department of Defense delivered their report only yesterday and no one has had a chance to really go over it. The mandated GAO review of this plan is now under way. Of course, it could be up to 120 days after this for the next step to become completed.  The report supports section 661 of the Senate bill regarding optimization of operations consistent with business practices, but it doesn't affect 662. That is the section where we had the pilot program.  We have addressed this before, but the report also acknowledges that privatization would not be able to replicate the range of benefits, the level of savings, and geographic reach provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality.  It states that the Department of Defense--and I am talking about the report from the Department of Defense--is continuing its due diligence on privatization by assessing the privatization-involved portions. They are already doing that right now. In fact, some things have already been privatized, such as the delis, the bakeries. They have been privatized already in those areas and that is actually working. So privatizing military commissaries before having a full assessment of the costs and benefits is not the responsible thing to do. We owe that to our members.
