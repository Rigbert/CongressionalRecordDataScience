. Fish and Wildlife Service for 38 years.  Terry began his career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service performing work involving the conservation, propagation, management, protection, and administration of wildlife species. Terry dedicated his life to implementing and advancing practices necessary for the conservation and management of wildlife resources and habitats. His experience and expertise has proven invaluable to the fish and wildlife community throughout his career.  This hard work eventually led him to become a leader within the Partner for Fish and Wildlife Program, which provides technical and financial assistance for the restoration and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat on private lands. I am incredibly proud of the work he has put in over the years for the people of our great State of Oklahoma.  I want to thank Terry Dupree on his years of service and wish him well in his retirement.  Well done, Terry.                          ____________________
