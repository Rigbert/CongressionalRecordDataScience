 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the brave men and women who serve around the world in America's Armed Forces, and to recognize what the California State Assembly has designated as Blue Star Families Week.  Blue Star Families Week is an opportunity to show that the United States and California stand behind members of the Armed Forces and their families as they serve with valor at home and abroad.  The Blue Star Flag is an official banner authorized by the Department of Defense and is given to families with loved ones serving in the Armed Forces to place in their windows as a visible sign of their family's sacrifice. Blue Star flags date back to World War I and serve as a symbol of community support and solidarity in times of war and hostility.  I am proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces that are bravely serving all over the world to protect our freedom, our democracy and our way of life. During my recent trip to Iraq I had the honor of witnessing the strong character of our troops. We owe an immeasurable debt to the families of these men and women who are willing to sacrifice their futures for our country. The Blue Star program is another way we can show how much we value their heroism and bravery.  I am pleased to take time this week to salute the brave heroes in the Armed Forces, and their loved ones, for their tremendous sacrifice and dedication.                          ____________________
