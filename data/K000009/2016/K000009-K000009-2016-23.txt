Speaker, I thank the gentleman for organizing this event this morning, and I wish to also say that the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was a breakpoint historical event that marked a turning point in the cold war.  It took great courage by those who participated during that unforgettable period as freedom fighters in Budapest and across that country stood tall in opposition to the communist-installed Hungarian people's false government and its Soviet-imposed repression.                              {time}  1030  You can travel to Budapest, Hungary, today, and you can see the bullet holes and the tank markings in some of the old, old buildings in that country. We know over 2,500 Hungarians died, 20,000 were imprisoned, and over 200,000 more fled as refugees.  Congressman Ross has referenced certain individuals in my own region. Some of those refugees came to Ohio, including men like Reverend Martin Hernady, who ministered his entire life in Ohio serving the Hungarian diaspora, and the Ujvagi family of Toledo, whose compassion, patriotism, and genius have meant so much to our community and to me, personally.  In October and November of 1956, the country at the heart of the European Continent underwent 3 weeks of political turmoil that shook the region and exposed the ideological fissures behind the Iron Curtain.  The movie, ``Torn From the Flag,'' I recommend to all of our colleagues. It gives people living today a sense of what happened during that fateful period.  During the 60th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and its freedom fight, we commemorate tens of thousands of Hungarians who took to the streets to protest the heavyhanded invasion by the Soviet Union. Their heroism is legendary, and it has made a difference in world history. They showed a united front and one that called upon their government to promote democratic ideals and unification.  This moment in time was encapsulated in a statement by the then-director of the Hungarian News Agency just before his untimely death in the revolution. He said: ``We are going to die for Hungary and for Europe.''  In the years since the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Hungary has made progress toward democratic reform and has since become a member of the European Union and NATO. Its award of Nobel Prizes in every single scientific and cultural field is a testimony to the talent and to the abilities of the people of that country.  So like Congressman Ross, as co-chair of the Congressional Hungarian Caucus, I remain dedicated to continuing channels of cooperation to further these efforts and to ensure that the principles of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution are fully realized.  I think the Partnership for Peace initiative between our respective militaries is a foundation stone to build our continuing relationship forward and support the revolution recognizing this important moment in world history in the 20th century.  May I say, long live liberty and long live Hungary.  I thank the gentleman, all the members of our Congressional Hungarian Caucus, and, again, I thank the Ambassador from Hungary for being here with us today and all of our colleagues for listening.                          ____________________
