Mr. Speaker, the gentleman was speaking about his bear and the cooperative effort. This is the one thing, I know, in 1973, when we voted for this act, we thought we were doing, but for some reason we have lost track of the agency, that they have decided without looking at Federal lands, which we have 835 million acres of, we find out with the species residing in those areas they do not do that unless it is multiple-use land. They will come after the individual and say, you must do this. We lose this cooperation, we lose this partnership.  Mr. Speaker, I have said all along that we must be partners in this law in order to protect the species. You cannot expect the Government to protect the species by itself. The partners who should be part of it will in fact extinguish the species because they have no other choice.
