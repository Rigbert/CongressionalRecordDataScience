Speaker, this past week, America laid to rest Ms. Rosa Parks, preeminent civil rights leader of the 20th century. Ms. Parks embodied the clarion call of Sojourner Truth to champion the rights of those dispossessed and marginalized. Through her acts of courage and inspiration, she, as woman, awakened the conscience of a nation and moved us to be better than we had been, indeed to form a more perfect union. In her memory, a homegoing memorial service was held in Detroit, Michigan, her adopted hometown, on Nov. 2, during which the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr. of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, rendered these words of comfort. It is my privilege to enter them in the Congressional Record as a living testimony to her life and the world and nation she helped transform.                      Rosa Parks: Words of Comfort       We are here this morning for serious business. On so many      occasions, negros have been intimidated and humiliated and      oppressed because of the sheer fact that they were negros.      Just the other day, just last Thursday to be exact, one of      the finest citizens in Montgomery--not one of the finest      negro citizens, but one of the finest citizens in      Montgomery--was taken from a bus and carried to jail and      arrested because she refused to get up to give her seat to a      white person.       When the history books are written in the future, somebody      will have to say, ``There lived a race of people--, a black      people, a people who had the moral courage to stand up for      their rights!.''--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Montgomery,      Alabama, December 1955                 rosa parks: freedom fighter--liberator       The Book of Esther. Chapter IV, Verses 12-16:       12: And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.       13: Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not      with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more      than all the Jews.       14: For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,      then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the      Jews from another place; but thou in thy father's house shall      be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the      kingdom for such a time as this?       15: Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer.       16: Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in      Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink for      three days, night or day: I and also my maidens will fast      likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not      according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.       Isaiah, 40 chapter, 31st verse, ``but they shall wait upon      the Lord shall renew their strength; they will mount up with      wings like eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they      shall walk and not faint.''       The 2005 freedom bound train is full of giants. John      Johnson, Johnson Publishing, who illuminated our way. Vivian      Malone Jones who opened up closed doors at the University of      Alabama; C. Delores Tucker, first African American Secretary      of State of Pennsylvania, a pacesetter. Judge Constance Baker      Motley along with justice Thurgood helped to brake backbone      of legal segregation. And now Rosa Parks, our morning star,      the star that led us by night; when it's real dark, one light      will challenge all of the darkness, and give us hope and      direction.       For such an awesome force in history, we wrestle with the      countless ways, ``how do we express ourselves, our thanks,      her meaning, her impact.       The question was once raised in Micah, how do you worship?      Do you give the Lord fatted calves and rams and rivers of      oil? Meaningless sacrifices. The answer was, ``O man, you      know what is good; you know what matters. Do justice, and to      love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?       Perhaps for Sister Parks, a statue in the great Hall of      Congress as projected in a legislative bill by Congressman      Jackson, as a founding mother of the new America. Surely if      Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, leaders of the Confederacy      who led the drive for secession, sedition, segregation and      slavery and treason, could be there, why not have the      guardian angel there to keep an eye on them, and to protect      the true character of the American Dream.       Perhaps the extension of the voting rights with enforcement      powers, 50 years later.       Perhaps a White House conference on civil rights. 50 years      later--post Rosa Parks and hurricane Katrina, a White House      conference on civil rights is needed. We must say to Mrs.      Parks, your legacy is secure, your sacrifice is not in vain,      but your work is unfinished and under attack. You lifted us      up; we will not let you down.       We often reference her qualifications for this huge role in      history--her vocation as a seamstress, her civil rights      membership, her humility and temperament. But her biggest      quality is she was available.       One of the outstanding attributes of Mrs. Parks is that she      was available. Her humility, her steeled courage, her non-     negotiable dignity, speaks to us in the fullness of time,      after 336 years of struggle--from the hull of ships to the      back of the bus--in the fullness of time, she said, here am      I, send me. I am available.       God uses the strength of the available. He is not bound by      the credentialed and the unavailable. Each time I go back      across the bloodstained Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma,      Alabama--the battlefield of our modern day voting rights      act--I recall the struggle led by Hosea Williams, a shot up      war veteran, and Congressman John Lewis, a student, on that      Sunday. There were no pastors of major churches, no      convention presidents, no bishops, no doctors or lawyers, no      political party leaders, no scholars, no elected officials,      judges or business leaders. Just ordinary people.       Mrs. Boynton, Mrs. Foster, Sunshine, Lester Hankerson,      Cottonreader from Mississippi. Ordinary people, available to      do God's will. Ordinary people.       They upended the Congress, the White House, and the world.      They captured the imagination of the world by absorbing the      blows and suffering us into a new day. Your success and      reputation and status are not bargaining chips with God.       Calvary teaches, suffering breeds character, character      breeds faith, and in the end, faith will prevail.       Who are the available?       (a) It may be some teenage boy, a great underdog with a      slingshot, taking on some giant Goliath. He emerges the      winner, an unlikely hero. He was available.       (b) It may be some rescued baby, Moses, avoiding a death      warrant by the King, an edict of genocide, aided by some      ingenuous prayer warrior mother, who grew up in the King's      household but comes unto his highest self and says. ``Let My      People Go.''       (c) It may be some Esther, some orphan, after prodding by      her uncle, moving beyond the political law and risking      personal comfort for the common good, who rises up realizing      her people are in jeopardy, declaring if I perish, let me      perish. I am going to meet the King. God uses the available.       (d) It may be some freedom fighting seamstress, unarmed      without guns or bullets, but with a breastplate of      righteousness in the heart of the confederacy which says      ``Like a Tree Planted by the Rivers of Water, I Will Not be      Moved.''       I will defy the unjust state law that defies federal law.      You may fire me, you may jail me, and you may kill me. But      like Esther, if I perish, let me perish. Enough is enough!       If you need somebody, I am available. Here am I, send me.       Rosa Parks: It is not her passing, but in her living, the      timeliness of her actions, that bring us here today. It has      captured the attention of the world.       I was in South Africa meeting with President Mandela last      week when the news broke. He acknowledged her impact and      sends his condolences. Apartheid ended in 1954 in North      America. And in South Africa in 1994. He understands the      connections.       An NAACP freedom fighter, she offered her body as a living      sacrifice. She embodied the hope, the longing and the anguish      of three centuries of prayers. Her light in darkness      illuminated the path of the majestic leadership of Dr. Martin      Luther King, Jr. Together they were part of a team. A season.      That changed the course of America and world history for the      better. Ms. Parks was in the historical rocking chair between      the legal triumphs of Thurgood Marshall and the prophetic      utterance of Dr. King.       It is our burden to put her in context of our struggle. And      not allow wolves in sheep's clothing to mis-interpret her      legacy, or our struggle.       So when children ask of us, who was Rosa Parks? We shall      tell them how she helped get us across the rough waters.       Why was she arrested? Is it relevant today? Or is this some      sentimental journey that we are on, with all of these      services and celebrations.       She was arrested for defying State's rights laws--     segregation--a hangover from the Confederacy. The South would      not honor the dream of a more perfect union. And the red      states still resist.       The relevance of her living legacy is no sentimental      journey.       So today, as the courts are stacked with States' rights      judges, and New Orleans' people float face down in the      waters, and civil rights are suspended, prevailing wages      suspended, affirmative action suspended, environmental laws      suspended, veterans preferences suspended . . .       As FEMA will not give the addresses of the people exiled in      41 states. The addresses that will allow the State Board of      Elections to communicate with them so they might vote in      February. New Orleans is being de-populated with its people      stranded in exile. While Louisiana is being demographically      re-configured.       Is this struggle relevant today or is this service a      sentimental journey?       For our sister beloved Rosa, we must adore, admire and love      her. But we must not romanticize her mission. Hers is an act      of defiance, challenging the prevailing right wing political,      legal and religious order. She challenged state's rights in      the heart of the Confederacy.       Her mission was to even the playing field, to afford all      Americans equal protection under the law, to gain and defend      civil rights--she sought a more perfect union.       Many of her former adversaries have changed stripes or      parties, but not their anti-civil rights, anti-labor, anti-     gender equality, and anti-poor agenda.       To be on her freedom train requires the courage and the      vision to defy unjust law, take the risk and live with the      consequences.       After 58 years of legal racist segregationist apartheid      law, upon continuous charges by the NAACP, led by Thurgood      Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, Charles Hamilton Houston,      Dr. John Hope Franklin, Dr. Kenneth Clark, the court reversed      itself from the 1896 apartheid decision which succeeded      slavery.       May 17, 1954 was the biggest legal victory we had known      since the abolishment of slavery in 1865 and the broken      promises of 1877 and the end of reconstruction. But it had no      immediate impact on the ground. States continued to defy the      law and vilify the court as legislating and engineering      change and of not being ``strict conservative      constructionists.''       Racial segregation remained in our schools, transportation,      trains, public housing, work place, voting. We lived without      the umbrella of protection of the law.       Emmett Till was lynched, August 28, 1955, (eight years to      the day before the March on Washington, 1963). The lynch mob      was not prosecuted and the FBI did not investigate.       His mother brought his bloodied, watermarked body back to      Chicago. 100,000 people demonstrated passed his body . . .      afterwards they were never the same.       Jet and the Black Press told his story. There was an      emotional uprising.       I once asked Ms. Rosa Parks, why did she not go to the back      of the bus, given the risks?       She said I thought about Emmett Till and I could not go      back. She said, ``My legs and feet were not tired, that is a      stereotype, and I felt violated. I paid the same fare as      others, I was not going back.'' She stood with Emmett Till's      mother until the very end, reaffirming that kindship.       Her dominant feature was not that she was a seamstress; she      was not arrested for sewing. She was a dignified, resisting      freedom fighter. An NAACP officer at a time when the NAACP      was banished from most parts of the south. Most teachers      could not join and keep their jobs.       The states defied federal law, and she defied the state      law. She took the test, paid the price and the law failed.      She was arrested for defiant behavior. She went counter-     culture. She resented the sign above the drivers head that      read, ``colored seat from the rear, whites from the front.      Violators will be prosecuted.''       She chose with resolve and courage to fearlessly face the      option of being fired, jailed or killed to test the law,      December 1, 1955.       An immediate after effect was the emergence of Rev. Dr.      Martin Luther King, Jr. A one year boycott, his house      bombed--they were threatened. She won the legal case after 13      months. It took 10 years of testing to get from the back of      the bus to the right to vote.       Sitting down, we hear over and over again was a simple act      by a dignified woman. The act was simple, but the reaction      was violent, relentless, led by the State. Arrests, loss of      jobs, death threats. Governors blocking school doors, state      terror. And the resistance of her challenge for a more      perfect union is still under attack by the devotees of      State's rights, undermining a more perfect union for all      Americans.       It was the first of many courageous tests: 1957, Daisy      Bates and the Little Rock Nine; the sit-in's of the 1960's;      the assassination of Medgar Evars and others; the killing of      Jimmie Lee Jackson that triggererd the Selma March; the      killings of Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney; The Birmingham      bombings; the march from Selma to Montgomery to end the      reign of legal state sponsored terror.       There was a long bloody road ahead after December 1, 1955.      Of course, by extension today, abandoned cities, flourishing      suburbs, second class schools and first class jails. Three      strikes and you're out . . . even if you don't have a bat,      rather than four balls and you're on, because we really      intend to leave no child behind.       We, with a narrow view, say Rosa Parks would not get up and      let the white man have her seat. It was not about ``A'' black      woman, and ``A'' white man. It was a dilemma of all blacks      and all whites. Victims of a system with all losers.       The white bus driver would not drive off, the white police      arrested her, but they were all victims of racist, state's      rights law as well. They were following the legal, political,      religious edict of their day.       She was following the moral law. She chose Calvary over      convenience.       The white rider, out of cultural expectation and the law,      had a right to ask her to get up. The bus driver had a legal      obligation to demand that she move, or the bus would go no      further. The police had a legal obligation to arrest her.       Those men must now feel awful, and their children ashamed.      History has condemned them. But their political leaders      placed them there.       If they had not done their jobs, they would have lost their      jobs, and if she had gotten up, she would have lost her      dignity.       The legal changes of 64' and 65' allowed both to have      dignity and decency.       Now Alabama and Auburn can play black and white together.      We can choose uniform color over skin color in that game,      because the new law protects our shared dignity.       Unfortunately 50 years later many still are trapped in the      system that chooses racial insecurity and cultural identity      over their economic interests and life options.       If Rosa Parks were not successful, blacks would have      remained at the back of the bus and in a ditch. Southern      whites would have remained in the ditch with us. No      southerner could have gone to the White House from the south,      because of the stigma, just as no white South African could      leave South Africa without stigma.       Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Vice President      Gore, President Bush, all owe their presidencies to a new      freed South, not hampered by racial stigma.       Her act helped to free the whole south.       Changing the laws and the culture did not take place      automatically or inevitably. It took demonstrations,      sacrifice and martyrs. But now with affirmative action and      Pell Grant and no more political mileage for governors      blocking school doors, we can sit in the front of buses,      class rooms, live in a neighborhood of our choice.       Auburn could be number 1 last year. Alabama could be      undefeated this year and not face the predicament that Bear      Bryant faced playing USC and Nebraska without the best talent      in the State, and being humiliated by Sam Cunningham of USC      and Johnny Rogers of Nebraska.       Oh what a morning Rosa Parks ushered in. There are those      who will honor her during this season, but who will seek to      reverse the course she took and not enforce the laws for      which she was arrested and struggled. She is their trophy but      she is our morning star. Our 1955 liberation Christmas      present. Oh what a morning this noble woman has helped to      usher in.       This is a time to mourn and celebrate, where we must watch      as well as pray. For those on the Rosa Parks, Medgar Evers,      Schwerner, Goodman Chaney, A. Phillip Randolph, Constance      Baker Motley, Cesar Chavez, Martin Luther King side of      history, we must be a ware of wolves in sheep's clothing who      try unrelentingly to defeat her purpose.       While we have gone from the back of the bus in Montgomery,      burnished in our memory is the back of the rescue in New      Orleans.       Like Esther, you counted the costs, took the risks and paid      the price. But our God offered you a comfort level ultimately      that defied your enemies and surpasses our understanding.       Sister Rosa, you are our eagle bird of hope, a gift sent      from up above. Like the eagle--a bird of strength. and power      and resolve--you looked in the noon day sun and didn't      flinch. You looked at the little ones whose wings were less      strong and not as long. You inspired us out of our fears, and      allowed a rebirth of hope. You stirred your nest, and gave us      comfort and protection. You showed us how to fly.       Fly fearlessly, no matter the weather. When we failed in      our efforts, God allowed you to be close enough and live long      enough to pick us up again.       We know we fall down sometimes. We got back up again. Again      and again. Because you reminded us nothing is too hard for      God. You showed us the power of right over might, the power      of moral authority, the power stronger than guns and wealth,      just by being available to do God's will.       You have been the wind beneath our wings. The Lord promised      that they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;      they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run      and not be weary; they shall walk and not feint.       The writer promised this morning this great morning, one      glad morning, we can fly away. You are faithful over a few      things. Now He has called you up higher. Keep looking up to      those stars, in their silver sockets of glory, to that place      in the sky.       Now, Mother Eagle, God today has called you back to the big      nest in the sky. This morning, Sweet Angel, take your rest,      take your rest. Take your heavenly flight. You made your      reservations. You prepaid your ticket. Now you can sit where      you choose to sit. You have a reserved seat at the welcome      table. When you get tired of sitting, you can just walk      around heaven all day.       By the way, stop by and give Dr. King our highest regards.      Tell Fannie Lou Hamer, howdy. Pluck those bullets out of      Medgar Evars' back. Tell Emmett Till what he meant to you.      Sit down with Daisy Bates.       Stop by and see Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney.       By the way, thank John Johnson for telling our story. Tell      Mahalia. We are all moving up a little higher. And don't      forget to tell Rev. C.L. Franklin thanks for teaching us how      eagles stir their nests.       Make room for us. It won't be long now. We are too close to      turn around now. We've wept bitter tears, but joy keeps      coming. Sit where you want to now. There will be no arresting      officers. No signs of disrespect. No more handcuffs. We thank      you for your hope. We thank you for your healing. We thank      you for being available. Good night, Sweet Angel. We will see      you in the morning. You served us well. You've done God's      will.                          ____________________
