We have been trying to consult with Senators on the Judiciary Committee and outside the Judiciary Committee as we have gone forward. We have consulted with Republicans, Democrats, the White House, and with the Department of Justice. I have tried to keep the distinguished majority leader informed each step of the way, and I know Senator Hatch has done the same with the distinguished Republican leader.  We put the bill in last week.
