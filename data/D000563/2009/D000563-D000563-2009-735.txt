This is a little complex, but if you will follow me.  First, I agree with Senator Bond's amendment and will vote for it, but not at this moment. Here is why. This rescission Senator Bond wants to achieve is something most of us agree with. If it doesn't happen, the penalties will come to our States on September 30. What we have is the assurance of the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that she will put this rescission in the reauthorization of the highway trust fund before September 30 so there would not be any loss to States.  So what is the problem? Why don't we do it today? Because if we do it today, we jeopardize this extension of the highway trust fund until September 30. We are trying to get this done in short order so we can end the session and come back and do the right thing before September 30. All we are asking today is for you to join us in saying to Senator Bond: Thank you for your good thought, but hold that thought until September.  We still have time to make sure we do the right thing, and we have the assurance of the chairman that it is going to happen. It pains me greatly to raise a point of order against my friend from Missouri on an amendment whose substance I agree with, but if we want to protect the highway trust fund and we want to have an orderly adjournment to the session and not jeopardize jobs, then we need to vote against the Bond amendment.
