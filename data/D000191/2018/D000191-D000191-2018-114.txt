Speaker, I will vote in support of H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the Farm bill.  The bill contains many of my priorities. As the author of the 1990 Organic Food Production Act and co-chair of the House Organic Caucus, I am pleased the conference report includes robust funding to help conventional producers transition to organic farming, strong research funding, and new authority for organic producers to be eligible for conservation programs when previously the programs were only available to conventional farmers. The bill also maintains current SNAP benefit levels, increases funding for food bank programs, including The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and keeps separate funding streams for the Environmental Quality Incentive Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program.  However, the bill maintains the current agricultural subsidy programs, which I strongly oppose. The subsidies are only supposed to go to those ``actively engaged in farming.'' Yet under the bill, the nearly $900 billion in subsidies continue to be skewed towards wealthy individuals and mega-farms at the expense of small and medium-sized farms. In fact, the Environmental Working Group found that 18,000 Americans living in urban areas received more than $63 million in subsidies in 2015 and 2016.  Not only do the subsidy loopholes from previous Farm bills remain, they are made even worse in this newest Farm bill, which expands the definition of ``actively engaged in farming'' to nieces, nephews and cousins--even if they have never set foot on the farm.  Real farmers, especially small- and medium-sized family farms, are in the middle of one of the worst economic downturns in decades, and they need and deserve our help before they are forced to sell their farms and lose their way of life. While the Farm bill contained many improvements to previous bills, the lack of reform and the expansion of subsidy program eligibility is outrageous. I will continue working to reform agricultural subsidy programs to ensure that the benefits go to small- and medium-sized farms, and only to those that actually work the land.                          ____________________
