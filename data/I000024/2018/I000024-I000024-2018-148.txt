If you look at that, it talks about what we are supposed to be doing here. The priorities are defending America and then they called it--transportation infrastructure. I would say this: We are a great team when we do that. We couldn't have had the successes--I could not have had the successes as the chairman of that committee without you on my side, making sure we are doing what we are supposed to be doing here in taking care of our infrastructure. Right now, we are looking at an opportunity in this administration to do the same thing.  I will say right now--and predict--it is going to end up with you and a closely knit group of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans working together to make America great in terms of our infrastructure.
