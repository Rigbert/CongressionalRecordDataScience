Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this disruption to those responsible for managing healthcare adds an unnecessary burden under the circumstances they confront daily. Many States are now preparing to shut down their CHIP program in case Congress doesn't act. How is that for a Christmas or Hanukkah present to the children of America?  The Republican majority's priorities are out of line, and no leadership on budgetary caps, no leadership on working with Democrats to find common ground on funding priorities, no leadership to finalize government funding for the entire 2018 fiscal year, which began 3 months ago. Unacceptable.  Instead, Republicans choose to avoid doing what is critical. Rather than pass a tax bill that rewards the wealthiest in our country and wreaks havoc on America's hardworking middle class families, they ought to do the dutiful work of managing the funds to operate the departments that serve the people of the United States. The American people are worried, Mr. Speaker, and the majority has abdicated their leadership.  I urge my colleagues to keep their powder dry on any hasty vote on this bill, and demand the majority come to the table to finalize the fiscal year 2018 spending plan.
