 President, the best time to target a new drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has overwhelmed our communities.  The advantages of doing so are clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most important, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the abuse of the drug.  Today, we are tracking the arrival of two new drugs--rohypnol and what is called ``special K''--as they begin to show popularity in several States. So, today is the time for action against these drugs.  Heightening this urgency is one stark fact--these new drugs are being used primarily by our children--our teens and young adults. One need not be unduly alarmist, but we must proceed with dispatch to do what we can to stop the spread of rohypnol and special K.  That is why I am today introducing legislation to make both these drugs subject to much stricter regulation. This can be accomplished by moving these drugs to different schedules under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.  This is not a step to be taken lightly, because there is a regulatory procedure in place for scheduling controlled substances. But, unfortunately, this regulatory procedure can take years to accomplish our goal, and what we need to do must be done in months, not years.  In the past decade, Congress has taken legislative action to change schedules in at least two other instances.  In 1984, in response to an alarming increase in illicit trafficking and nonmedical abuse of the drug, Congress enacted legislation to move quaaludes, a previously medically approved sedative, to schedule one of the Controlled Substances Act.  In the decade since this legislation took effect, quaalude abuse has decreased significantly, with emergency room quaalude overdose reports down 80 percent from 1985 to 1994.  And in legislation I sponsored, which was passed as part of the 1990 Crime Control Act, steroids were reclassified as a schedule three substance, subjecting them to more strict controls and penalties.  This change was also in response to an explosion of abuse--particularly by young athletes. The effects of this legislation has also been significant, with the rate of annual use of steroids down 42 percent in the first 2 years following the enactment of the legislation.  It is now time to legislate stricter controls for rohypnol and special K. The record high drug abuse rates of the 1970's were accompanied by a unique drug culture signified by the presence of ``club'' drugs--drugs that were popular with youth and young adults who frequented dance clubs and often mixed drugs with alcohol and other substances.  Recently, club drugs have made a resurgence in popularity, and they are often showing up at both bars and ``raves,'' all-night dance marathons popular with teens.  Club drugs are typified by the way they suddenly gain popularity and become the drug of choice, becoming trendy among youth. Often these drugs are legally manufactured but are being used by youth in ways unintended by the manufacturer and unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Rohypnol and special K are two of the drugs which have recently hit the youth scene and quickly become popular. Both of these drugs are very dangerous drugs whose current legal status does not reflect the dangers inherent in their abuse.  Rohypnol abuse was first documented in the United States in 1993. Although abuse was first noted in southern Florida, in the past 2 years abuse has spread rapidly, and rohypnol activity has now been reported in more than 30 States.  Without rapid and strong Government action, abuse will continue to spread to uncontrollable levels.  Teenagers find rohypnol attractive for a number of reasons. Frighteningly, one major reason is that youth do not see rohypnol as dangerous because it has a legitimate medical use in some areas of the world, and they mistakenly believe that if they are taking a drug which is in its original packaging from the manufacturer, it is both safe and unadulterated.  In addition, there are few existing means for testing and prosecuting youth for rohypnol possession and intoxication. The combination of rohypnol and alcohol makes it possible for youth to feel very intoxicated while still remaining under the legal blood-alcohol level for driving.  In addition to gaining attention for increasing rate of abuse, rohypnol hasalso been the focus of another social problem: crime, particularly date rape. In fact, in many areas and in a number of newspaper accounts, rohypnol has been referred to as a ``date rape drug.''  This connection between rohypnol and rape is due to the drug's disinhibitory effects and its likelihood of causing amnesia when combined with alcohol.  Unfortunately, this amnesiac effect is one of the reasons many people who abuse rohypnol are attracted to it. It is commonly reported that people taking rohypnol in combination with alcohol typically have blackouts, or memory losses lasting 8 to 24 hours.  The novelty of blackouts attract youth, particularly youth who are combining drugs with alcohol.  This has led to rohypnol being referred to as the ``forget me pill'' or the ``forget pill.'' Even more frightening, many people are finding the drug attractive as a way of creating blackouts in others.  The combination of disinhibition and memory loss caused by rohypnol mixed with alcohol makes women especially vulnerable to being victims of date rape by people who convince women to take rohypnol while drinking or put the drug in a woman's drink without her knowledge.  Recently, in Florida and Texas, there have been a number of investigations into these types of victimizations.  There have also been a number of reports of teens and young adults who have entered drug abuse treatment facilities in Florida, reporting rohypnol abuse and suicidal feelings they experienced while using rohypnol.  The most famous example of rohypnol overdose made the news with the attempted suicide of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the rock band Nirvana. Cobain ultimately succeeded in committing suicide on March 18, 1994, but the rock singer had attempted suicide earlier in the month when he fell into a coma following a near fatal mixture of champagne and rohypnol. Cobain remained comatose for nearly 2 days before regaining consciousness after this drug experience.  Special K is also hitting the club scene at alarming rates. This drug is a hallucinogen very similar to PCP. Special K, or ketamine hydrochloride, has become popular as a new designer drug.  Although this drug has been in existence for several years, its abuse has rapidly become more prevalent in recent years.  Now many parties and raves at dance clubs are called bump parties, as a way of conveying special K is available. It is particularly attractive to kids at these types of events because along with its mind-altering effects, the drug gives a burst of energy, and it can be mixed with water so kids can take it in public without attracting attention.  In fact, a club in New Jersey was recently closed by police after it was discovered that teens were attending raves there where club employees distributed bottled water for this purpose.  In addition to seizures in New Jersey, recent newspaper articles have mentioned seizures in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, and Florida. Drug tracking experts have also cited the presence of special K in Georgia and the District of Columbia, and in my home State of Delaware.  Special K is considered the successor to PCP--or angel dust, as it is known on the street--due to similarity of the two drugs' chemical compositions and mind-altering effects. There have also been reports of PCP being sold to people who think they are buying special K.  Ketamine is primarily a veterinary anesthetic. Although it has some limited use for human medical treatment, its use in this manner is not extensive due to the unpleasant and often dangerous side effects that can accompany its use.  It is clear that the current controls on rohypnol and ketamine do not reflect the dangers these drugs now pose to our society, particularly to women and children. In the United States rohypnol is classified under the Federal Controlled Substances Act as only a schedule four drug, and ketamine is not scheduled at all.  Last week, the Treasury Department announced that custom officials would begin seizing all rohypnol which is brought across U.S. borders. This is a step in the right direction. But this ban on all rohypnol is only the first step.  Further action is needed to make sure cracking down on the illegal trafficking of rohypnol is a high priority and that illegal traffickers of rohypnol are given tough sanctions.  That is why I am introducing legislation to increase the restrictions on both special K and rohypnol. By moving rohypnol to schedule one of the Federal Controlled Substances Act and adding special K to schedule two of the act, this legislation will subject both drugs to tighter controls, increased penalties for unlawful activity involving the two drugs, and will increase the attention and enforcement efforts directed at the drugs by Federal, State, and local law and drug enforcement officials.  In essence, these tighter regulations will mean that rohypnol will be subjected to the same restrictions and penalties as heroin, and special K will face the same controls as cocaine.  I hope my colleagues will join me in seeing to speedy passage of this legislation--taking action to make these drugs less available to our youth now.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1609       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. RESCHEDULING.       Notwithstanding sections 201 and 202 (a) and (b) of the      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811, 812 (a),(b))      respecting the scheduling of controlled substances, the      Attorney General shall, by order--       (1) transfer flunitrazepam from schedule IV of such Act to      schedule I of such Act; and       (2) add ketamine hydrochloride to schedule II of such      Act.                          ____________________
