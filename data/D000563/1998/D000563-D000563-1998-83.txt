President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut.  I would like to ask several brief questions to clear up this debate.  It has been said on the floor of the Senate that because of the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, that someone serving in the U.S. military under the age of 21 could not get a credit card. Is that true or false?
