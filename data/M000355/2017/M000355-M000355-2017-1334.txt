 President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm Jeffrey Rosen as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. In a couple of hours, we will take a cloture vote to advance another well-qualified nominee, Rachel Brand, to serve as the Associate Attorney General.  Rachel Brand's impressive background includes experience clerking for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, and she has already been confirmed by the Senate twice before. She is ``extraordinarily talented,'' as Chairman Grassley noted at her hearing, and ``dedicated to the full and even-handed enforcement of our laws.''  Ms. Brand also has the support of a bipartisan group of former senior officials at the Justice Department, including Jamie Gorelick and Seth Waxman, who, in a recent letter on her behalf, cited her ``stellar reputation for . . . integrity, legal skills, and respect for the law.''  As they pointed out, Ms. Brand's extensive private and public sector experience would serve her well as the Associate Attorney General. They also noted she would be a ``trusted leader in the Department.'' I look forward to advancing her nomination later this morning.                          ____________________
