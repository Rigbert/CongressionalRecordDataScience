 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I appreciate the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations pointing that out because it will take all night tonight to work on those amendments, and during the time of the debate on the motion to instruct and the supplemental, we will have to firm up those agreements so that the debate on VA-HUD will go smoothly.
