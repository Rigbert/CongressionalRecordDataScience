President, today I honor the dean and president of Vermont Law School, Geoffrey B. Shields, as he announces his retirement after four decades as a practicing attorney, educator, and scholar. He will leave a legacy about which he should be very proud.  Dean Shields arrived at Vermont Law School in 2004, following a distinguished career in the public and private sectors. He received a bachelor of arts in economics, magna cum laude, from Harvard University in 1967. He earned his juris doctor from Yale Law School in 1972.  Over the last 8 years, Dean Shields has guided Vermont Law School alonga path of steady growth. Through his leadership the school has gained many new and talented faculty members, and has seen substantial growth in its endowment. He has initiated capital improvement projects on the school's campus, expanded the school's international partnerships, and has developed new clinics and institutes to focus on distinct fields of legal study. And he has sustained and built upon Vermont Law School's environmental law program, which has been rated the best program in the Nation for the last three consecutive years, and in the top two for the last 21 years. These continuing successes are reflective of Dean Shields' strong leadership and the dedication of the faculty, staff, and students who sustain a vital community of learning and innovation in the hills of central Vermont.  During his career in public service, Dean Shields served as assistant to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and as counsel to Senator Frank Church. After he earned his law degree, he served as a law clerk for the late Judge James Oakes of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, for whom a class room building at Vermont Law School is named.  In the private sector, he served as a partner at the Chicago and Washington, DC, law firm of Gardner Carton and Douglas, where he was nationally recognized for his expertise in nonprofit law, corporate law, health care law and international trade law.  Dean Shields has also made important contributions to education and scholarship beyond Vermont Law School. In Brattleboro, VT, he served as a foreign student advisor and assistant to the president at the Experiment in International Living and as an adjunct professor of economics at Marlboro College in Marlboro, VT. Dean Shields has also been involved in foreign policy issues through editing and writing, and as a member of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Dean Shields recently overcame serious illness with grace, humility, and determination. As he moves into the next chapter of his life, Marcelle and I wish him and his wife Genie the best for continued health and happiness.  I thank Dean Shields for his 8 years of dedication to Vermont Law School, and I convey my admiration and respect for the contributions he has made to Vermont. He will leave Vermont's young law school and its faculty, staff and students in a strong position for continued growth and success. I am sure he will be greatly missed by all of those who have worked with him and learned from him. I wish him all the best.                          ____________________
