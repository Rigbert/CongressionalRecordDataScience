Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would inform Members that in putting together the current bill, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, provisions of H.R. 2854, in doing this, our committee has worked with the Consolidated Farm Service Agency at the Department of Agriculture to work out many operational and administrative details that will allow the CFSA to implement this very important legislation as quickly as possible, which is very important to farm country, more especially where spring planting will soon be starting. The changes made in the en bloc will aid the Department of Agriculture and more especially the CFSA in being able to move quickly with the implementation of the Agriculture Market Transition Act.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Volkmer].
