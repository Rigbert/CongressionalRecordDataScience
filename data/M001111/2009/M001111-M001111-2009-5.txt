 President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2923       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Jobs Act of 2010''.     SEC. 2. SUMMER AND YEAR-ROUND YOUTH JOBS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) a $1,500,000,000 investment in summer and year-round      employment for youth, through the program supported under      this section, can create up to 450,000 temporary jobs and      meaningful work experiences for economically disadvantaged      youth and stimulate local economies;       (2) there is a serious and growing need for employment      opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth (including      young adults), as demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau      of Labor Statistics stating that, in November 2009--       (A) the unemployment rate increased to 10 percent, as      compared to 6.8 percent in November 2008;       (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose to      26.7 percent, as compared to 20.4 percent in November 2008;      and       (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- to 19-     year-olds increased to 49.4 percent, as compared to 32.2      percent in November 2008;       (3) research from Northwestern University has shown that      every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the      local economy;       (4) summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement      the income of families living in poverty;       (5) summer and year-round jobs for youth provide valuable      work experience for economically disadvantaged youth;       (6) often, a summer or year-round job provided under the      Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is an economically      disadvantaged youth's introduction to the world of work;       (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at      Northeastern University, early work experience is a very      powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor      market, and early work experience raises earnings over a      lifetime by 10 to 20 percent;       (8) participation in a youth jobs program can contribute to      a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior for youth; and       (9)(A) youth jobs programs benefit both youth and      communities when designed around principles that promote      mutually beneficial programs;       (B) youth benefit from jobs that provide them with work      readiness skills and that help them make the connection      between responsibility on the job and success in adulthood;      and       (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged      productively, providing much-needed services that meet real      community needs.
