 First, related to the fact that we both have large rural populations in our State, as the Senator from North Dakota understands, the tax laws do not help family farmers pay for their health insurance as they should. We have worked together to try to have full deductibility of health insurance. The family farmer, self-employed person trying to get health insurance coverage has to pay more out of pocket than anyone who works for a corporation, for example, because of our tax laws.  We have the Republican version of this issue, the Patients' Bill of Rights, which doesn't cover these same family farmers and give them protection. So they pay more for their insurance, higher premiums. They pay more out of pocket for it and don't get protection from the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights, whereas the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights provides this protection.
