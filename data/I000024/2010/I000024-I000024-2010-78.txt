President, first of all, let me say it was my intention to come down and talk about the same subject my friend from Alabama has addressed, and I will do that if there is time at the conclusion of my first subject, which has to be said and addressed today, and if not, I may have to come back after my friend from Connecticut to address this subject. It has to do with the liability limits--something we need to think through. There is a gross misunderstanding and a lot of pandering going on of people demagoging that issue, and I want to address that.                          ____________________
