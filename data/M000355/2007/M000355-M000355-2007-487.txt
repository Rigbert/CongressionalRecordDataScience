 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant and a true friend to the people of Kentucky, Mr. Michael A. Parker. After years of exemplary work as the program manager for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives Program at the Department of Defense, Mr. Parker is retiring, and I want to express to him my thanks for his service.  Mr. Parker has held the post of program manager since December 1996. In that role, he consistently worked hard toward the goal of safely and expeditiously disposing of the dangerous chemical agents stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Madison County, KY. The people of Madison County are living right next door to over 500 tons of the deadliest material ever conceived by man. Understandably, they would like to see these weapons disposed of as safely and quickly as possible. Mike has been a key player in working toward that goal.  Mike appreciates the unique culture at the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives Program and understands the need to work closely with the local community to reach acceptable solutions. The people of the Madison County area are going to miss Mike, as will I.  Proof of Mike's drive for excellence in his work lies in his numerous honors and awards. He holds the Presidential Rank Award at both the Distinguished and Meritorious levels. He also holds the Defense Department Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Army Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service, the Army Research and Development Achievement Award, the Army Commander's Medal, and the Army Meritorious Civilian Service Award.  Mr. President, Kentucky has been lucky to have such a friend in Michael A. Parker, and I speak for many in the Commonwealth when I say he will be missed. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in thanking Mike for his years of dedication and service and in wishing him good luck in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
