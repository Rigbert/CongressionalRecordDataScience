Who knows. Mr. Goodlatte, I apologize for that.  The Republican leadership refuses to allow an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage. And that is not about horses; it is about 6.6 million Americans working every day and living in poverty. I have concern about these horses, but I have much, much more concern about 6.6 million Americans who are living in poverty while working 40-hour weeks.  We have still not passed legislation that moves our Nation towards energy independence, yet we focus on horses.  Reforms are broken in the immigration system, yet we focus on horses.  We have not addressed the fact that 46 million Americans do not have health insurance, yet we focus on horses.  We need fixes to the Republicans' flawed prescription drug program and reforms to our convoluted tax system, yet we focus on horses. I am concerned about horses, but I am much, much more concerned about the American people. That is what we ought to be focused on. That's where we ought to be paying attention.  That is why I call this the ``do less than `do-nothing Congress of 1948.'''
