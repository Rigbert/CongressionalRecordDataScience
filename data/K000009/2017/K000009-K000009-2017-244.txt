Speaker, I rise today to honor a Toledo area legend as he celebrates his 90th birthday, Yehia ``John'' Shousher. An American of Lebanese heritage, a proud U.S. citizen and indefatigable Ambassador of Goodwill, Mr. Shousher has been a one-of-a-kind Arab American leader in Greater Toledo since he adopted the community as an immigrant to our nation.  Yehia, who with his brother ran a real estate investment company and J-S Vending, has been a leader in the Toledo community for decades as a civic-minded businessman as well as a Multi-Faith and Multi-Cultural Ambassador.  Yehia has served as an administrator, public relations representative, and fund-raiser in the Muslim community for many years. His generosity has been felt in many homes and organizations in our community. At the same time, he has also focused his efforts on building back hope in his ancestral land of Lebanon. He worked to establish student exchanges, village development and medical education throughout Lebonon's Bekaa Valley.  Yehia was one of the founders of the first mosque in Toledo, which was established in 1954 on East Bancroft Street. After the membership of the Mosque on East Bancroft Street outgrew the location, Yehia helped secure and plan the 48-acre campus that has become one of the icons of Perrysburg Township: the mosque and Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, which opened in 1983.  The Center has been a fulcrum of the Muslim and Interfaith communities, working to promote freedom and tolerance of religion and, together with his cherished wife Emney, Yehia has been an integral part of its inner workings and work in the larger community.  Always involved in events which promote cooperation among the faith and ethnic traditions in our community, Yehia's dedication to cultural diversity was recognized when he became a 2013 inductee into the Heroes of Compassion Gallery for Toledo.  Yehia's commitment to the Toledo community has been passed on to his children, Hussein, Lila, Mona and Mariam, his 10 grandchildren and his six great-grandchildren.  When I think of John, I see him carrying the flag of Lebanon at the annual Multi Faith Council's parade of nations at the University of Toledo on Martin Luther King holiday. I see him hospitably greeting guests with his wife Emney at events throughout our community welcoming new citizens. He has been instrumental in inviting religious leaders and public officials from throughout the world to visit Toledo and built our community into a place of gracious welcome.  I see him setting up exchange programs for students from Arab speaking countries to transmit the learning and values of a free society. He graciously took the time to include me on unforgettable travels with his family through the village of his ancestors and adjoining territories. The memories of that journey greatly inform my work.  Yehia with Emney at his side, and their bright smiles, have been indefatigable forcesfor good in our community for nearly a century. We wish them well in the coming years and consider our community fortunate to have them among us.  The Quran 7:199 teaches, ``Show Forgiveness, Enjoin Kindness, Avoid Ignorance.'' Yehia ``John'' Shousher has spent his life on this earth demonstrating this message through word and deed. His legacy is writ large in his faith community, his family, the land of his birth and our region.  We celebrate with Yehia as he reaches this milestone birthday of his 90th year. We take this moment to thank him for all he has done for so many in our community, for his leadership, for his efforts to promote mutual understanding and tolerance of diverse cultures and foster acceptance of our differences. Best wishes to both John and Emney as he celebrates this special milestone.                          ____________________
