The other problem is--and I say this with some knowledge as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee in the Senate Armed Services Committee--that we have roughly 60 percent of the capability that we had, in terms of force strength, that we had during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. And when I say that, I can quantify. Talking about 60 percent of the Army division, 60 percent of the tactical air wing, 60 percent of the ships floating around there; and yet we are in a more threatened world today.  So I believe that little pittance that the President is talking about of $110 billion over 6 years, of which only $2 billion of new money would be in the coming fiscal year, does not meet the expectations of the American people. It has not fulfilled the requirements of his own Secretary of Defense, his own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four chiefs who said: We are going to have to put a minimum of $25 billion of new money in each year for the next 6 years in order to get to a point where we can defend America on two regional fronts.  With that, I thank the Senator from Georgia for this very scarce time that he has given me.
