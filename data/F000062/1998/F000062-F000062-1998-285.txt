 . . urges you to support continuing debate about the potential negative impact of Senator Trent Lott's legislation.''  This is accompanied by, I would have to say, 30 campuses and companies. Ligand Pharmaceuticals, two letters for the Record. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Genentech, Inc.                              San Francisco, CA, February 9, 1998.     Hon. Connie Mack,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Mack: I am writing with regard to legislative      proposals currently pending in the Senate relating to cloning      entire human beings. This vexing topic needs to be put into a      larger perspective before the Senate votes on a bill, S.      1601, which was introduced only last week.       The biotechnology and research community has been very open      and public about its support for the President's request for      a voluntary moratorium on activities that could lead to the      cloning of entire human beings. This exercise of      responsibility in science is consistent with our long history      of restraint in the pursuit of basic biomedical research. We      do not plan or seek to clone entire human beings. In      addition, we fully recognize the existence of various federal      laws setting out the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug      Administration which, when taken together, would bar the      commercialization of cloning of entire human beings. Because      of this moratorium and existing legal limitations on action,      it is possible to deliberate and exercise caution and      restraint in legislating this issue.       The reality of modern biomedical research is that it is      difficult to predict in advance exactly how specific, even      esoteric, areas of research will produce breakthroughs. As      Michael Bishop (cancer researcher, Nobel laureate in medicine      and my colleague from the University of California, San      Francisco) spoke of this issue recently, in 1968 his work      with Dr. Harold Varmus, and Professor Herb Boyer would have      never been foreseen as leading to breakthroughs in      recombinant DNA research and cancer genetics. Similarly, work      done in the 1980s on transgenic animals by Dr. Phil Leder, of      Harvard, and others, would not have easily been understood as      being essential to the development of animal models that      could facilitate dramatic advances in our ability to test new      AIDS therapies.       It is also the case that with virtually every scientific      advance there are voices that seek to delay legitimate, if      misunderstood, advances in science. In the early 1970s, some      government officials sought to vary virtually all recombinant      DNA research out of exaggerated fears about the safety of the      technology. Researchers and companies voluntarily adopted a      moratorium on some research until more information was      obtained. Fortunately, the calls for more radical local or      federal regulation were rejected. The self-regulatory efforts      by industry and the research community worked, and there were      no significant safety issues to arise out of that research.       In the 1980s some critics advocated bans on transgenic      animal research out of fear of science. These requests for a      halt to research were often based on assertions of      pseudoscience. Again, we are fortunate that Congress did not      act to bar the creation of transgenic animals, which are now      so commonly used in drug development, especially in AIDS      research. In addition, transgenic animals may someday be used      for the actual production of pharmaceutical compounds. This      hope for pure protein production at a lower cost is yet to be      realized, but if Congress had acted in the 1980s to end      research, patients would have had that hope foreclosed.       Now Congress is faced with difficult decisions about how to      react to a single experiment in sheep. Each side of the      current debate has sincere motivations and convictions about      its legislative approach. Senators Bond, Frist and others      have bona fide concerns about cloning human beings and hope      that their bill would not affect biomedical research. Yet,      determining how to prohibit the act of cloning an entire      human being has proven to be a daunting task. For a set of      reasons outlined below, we prefer the approach taken in the      bill, S. 1602, to that found in the bill currently pending,      S. 1601.       Most importantly, in considering restrictions on scientific      research in the private sector (as opposed to previously      enacted limitations on the expenditure of federal funds),      great care must be exercised. In addition to the legal rights      of persons to free expression and inquiry in the private      market, there is little precedent for imposing limitations on      research except for reasons of safety or other narrowly      crafted circumstances.       In this instance, there are multiple possibilities of      promising research with somatic cells. Our hope in the      research community is that this branch of research will lead      to discoveries that permit us to develop new cures and      treatments for serious and unmet medical needs. Some of our      colleagues in academe have already begun exploring questions      of how to turn on and off these somatic cells so that new      biological material could be generated for transplantation      and for other therapeutic purposes. At this point in the      discovery process, it is not known exactly how to accomplish      this therapeutic goal, but one possible way is to use the      technique known as somatic nuclear cell transfer. Such      research could, in some circumstances, involve conduct that      would be permitted under S. 1602 and would be criminalized      under S. 1. This difference (among others noted below) is the      reason we prefer your bill.       There seems to be little dispute within the Congress about      the current inappropriateness of using somatic nuclear cell      transfer technology to create an embryo which is implanted      into the uterus, with the goal being reproductive in nature.      On the other hand, it is hard to understand why scientists      should become criminals if they pursue legitimate new      therapies for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other      diseases, and if their research has no prospect or intent of      creating an entire cloned human being.       Given our current state of knowledge, there is no      reasonable prospect for creating a new human being unless an      embryo is implanted into the uterus of a woman. Thus, the      approach should be to adopt a bill that effectively bars what      the political consensus     wants to prohibit, while simultaneously retaining the option      of research that is aimed at new therapies, not at      reproductive ends.       There are several other reasons to support the approach      taken in S. 1602:       S. 1602 preempts inconsistent state laws. Given the rush to      judgment in various states, the high likelihood for      overlapping and inconsistent standards, and the clearly      negative effect on interstate commerce, a federal standard is      appropriate.       S. 1602, unlike S. 1601, uses a civil penalty structure      that will be sufficient to deter unwanted conduct. If      criminal penalties or asset forfeiture are threatened for      research activities, there is likely to be a chilling effect      on research in this entire area. Moreover, there are      additional sanctions available under the Food, Drug and      Cosmetic Act to address human cloning.       S. 1602 appropriately requires that Congress should review      these limitations on research after a set period of time.      This review could be facilitated if, using carefully drawn      criteria, there was a balanced review of this area of      research by a nonpolitical entity.       The suggestion in S. 1602 for international cooperation on      this topic is welcome, as is the ratification of the      authority of the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug      Administration.       One final point, S. 1601 would establish a commission that      could approach the bioethics questions associated with      certain limited new somatic cell nuclear transfer      technologies. This concept is worthy of serious      consideration. As we approach scientific advances, it is      important that we make sure that science reflects our basic      human and ethical values.       The work done by existing entities, such as the Recombinant      DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH, and the NIH-DOE Working      Group on Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Human      Genome Research, has advanced the public discussion. In this      regard, the work already done by the President's Commission      on the topic of cloning entire human beings has materially      assisted the national debate on this topic. We leave to the      political process questions of whether any such bioethics      commission should be situated in the Executive Branch and who      should exercise the appointment authority.       There are several caveats worth noting, however:       Past history, here and in Europe, suggests that there is a      real risk that any such commission could inadvertently begin      to function as a new regulatory entity and serve to delay the      approval of new treatments for patients. This temptation      should be avoided at all costs by explicitly limiting the      role of the commission.       There is a risk that any new commission will be led by      other political agendas into discussions that do not advance      progress on improving human health. This temptation should      also be avoided by narrowly circumscribing the commission's      charter.       The composition of any commission should broadly reflect      the best available thinking in science, law, and ethics. The      mere prohibition on political officials serving on such a      panel is not likely sufficient to prevent the politicization      of the appointment process. There are, I understand,      precedents that permit certain relevant professional      societies to offer lists of nominees to an appointing      authority. This approach would appear to mitigate the risk of      an overly political appointment process.       In closing, let me thank you for having the special      sensitivity and commitment to biomedical research to ask for      greater deliberation and for crafting a more precise bill      that seeks a uniform consensus about how to ban the cloning      of entire human beings.       The issue before the Senate is: Can we simultaneously      advance science and the search for cures for serious diseases      while also barring the cloning of entire human beings? We      believe that to foster further dialogue and deliberation can      help achieve that common goal.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the CBRA Governing      Board, I am writing to encourage your ``no'' vote on the      cloture vote on S. 1601 scheduled for Tuesday, February 10,      1998. The Association urges you to support continuing debate      about the potential negative impacts of Senator Trent Lott's      legislation.       Somatic cell transfer technology is essential to continuing      research into cures for some of our greatest human health      threats--Parkinson's Disease, leukemia, diabetes, Alzheimer's      disease and spinal coral injuries. Unintended consequences of      this bill as currently written could threaten the future      health of millions of Americans.       Please feel free to contact our office if you should need      further information.           Sincerely,                                                     Suzanne Ness,                                                        President.                         members (partial list)       Allergan       Alliance Pharmaceutical       ALZA Corporation       American Association for Laboratory Animal Science      Northern, Orange County       San Diego, Southern and Palms to Pines Branches       American Cancer Society, California Division, Inc.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San      Diego and its more than 300 employees, like other responsible      members of the biomedical community, deplore the recent      announcement by Dr. Richard Seed of his intention to clone a      human being. We regard such an effort to be medically      irresponsible and ethically abhorrent. Nevertheless, we are      concerned that Congress and State legislatures, in      understandable zeal to prevent Dr. Seed and anyone of a like      mind from actually attempting to clone a human, will enact      legislation that fails to distinguish between vital medical      research and misguided human cloning. Therefore, we ask that      you and other members of Congress carefully consider both the      need for and the scope of any legislation addressing this      issue before acting upon it.       With respect to whether legislation is needed, Ligand      suggests a careful review of existing legislation to      determine whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)      already has the authority to regulate research related to and      the actual cloning of a human being. Many, including the      Biotechnology Industry Organization to which Ligand belongs,      believes the FDA has this authority.       If legislation is deemed to be necessary, it should achieve      two important ends. The first is that it should be drafted      narrowly to deal with the cloning of a human being and not      contain broad or even ambiguous prohibitions on cloning which      would halt or disrupt vital medical research based upon      widely accepted cloning techniques. Secondly, it should be      preemptive of State laws governing cloning. Biomedical      research is carried out, often with Federal funding,      throughout the United States. This research occurs in public      and private universities and in big and small companies. Much      of this research is done on a collaborative basis involving      entities in more than one state. Furthermore, every advance      paves the way for further progress. The individual states      should not, therefore, be allowed to erect a maze of law and      regulation which unnecessarily regulates this area of      research.       Congress, unlike the states, has ready access to the      expertise of NIH, NSF, FDA and other sources of expertise      that should be drawn upon before the drafting of appropriate      legislation. That fact, and the interlocking nature of      biomedical research, suggests that preemption is in the best      interests of the country with respect to dealing with the      issues raised by Dr. Seed. We believe this to be the case      even though our Federal system rightly contemplates that the      fifty states can exercise sovereignty in most areas, either      in concert with, or in the absence of legislation at the      national level.       Should you, therefore, have the opportunity to shape the      debate on this important, and even emotional issue, we ask      that you support hearings which address first whether new      legislation is required. If a reasoned analysis of current      law suggests that FDA is not able to effectively regulate,      then     and only then should legislation carefully drawn based on      input from the biomedical community be enacted.           Very truly yours,                                               William L. Respess,     Senior Vice President.                                  ____                                       Ligand Pharmaceuticals,                                      San Diego, February 5, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Ligand      Pharmaceuticals Inc. asking that you oppose Senator Bond's      Bill S. 1599 concerning human cloning. It is my understanding      that this bill is to come up for a vote without hearings or      mark-up. We believe that is an action that is too precipitous      and could result in legislation which will adversely impact      the biomedical industry.       I wrote to you on February 2, 1998 expressing opposition to      the announcement by Dr. Richard Seed to engage in an effort      to clone a human being. However, legislation or regulation to      ban such activity must be carefully drawn so as not to      inhibit legitimate research. Therefore, it is essential that      hearings be held on any bill to permit testimony by      scientists, representatives of the biomedical industry, and      others potentially affected by such legislation to be heard      on the specifics of any bill. This is not the time for a      justifiable rush to judgment on Dr. Seed's announced      intention to result in hastily conceived legislation which      may do as much harm as good. Research on cloning and the use      of cloning techniques are important to the progress of      medical science. While Congress should move with deliberate      speed, this is not the occasion to act outside of the usual      congressional scheme of engaging in hearings before      appropriate committees before taking action on matters of      such import.       In my letter of February 2, 1998, I suggested that Congress      first look to determine whether the FDA already has the      authority to regulate in this area and, only if it is      persuaded that the FDA lacks such authority, to undertake to      draft legislation. I still believe that is the most      appropriate process.           Very truly yours,                                               William L. Respess,                                            Senior Vice President.
