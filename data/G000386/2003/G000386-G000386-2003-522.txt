 President, the Senator from Arkansas has done well in the last tax bill and this tax bill to help in the area of refundability, and I compliment her for that, but this amendment goes too far because it provides a new entitlement with regard to the child credit.  The bill already provides $95 billion for the child credit. That is the biggest part of this bill. It also includes acceleration of the child credit for low-income families, an issue of great importance to Senator Lincoln as well.  The bill has a balance between spending and investment. The amendment cuts back significantly on the investment part, the partial dividend exclusion. I appreciate the Senator's efforts, but this amendment would gut our jobs bill.  The pending amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocations. Therefore, I make a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
