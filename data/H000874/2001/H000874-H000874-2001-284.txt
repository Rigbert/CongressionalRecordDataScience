Speaker, Calvin Coolidge once said that, ``Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not . . . genius will not . . . education will not. . . . Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.''  Mr. Speaker, the country finds itself on the edge of its seat, waiting with baited breath, as March Madness unfolds. The Final Four is just around the corner, and for the first time in history, the Mighty Maryland Terrapins will be there to show what persistence they've possessed, and what talent they exude.  Words can not possibly describe the poise and teamwork that the Terps exhibit. Their performance is to be applauded; their spirit imitated. What a deep sense of pride they have instilled in all of us for their hard work.  Under the tremendous coaching of Gary Williams, the Terps performance during this tournament has not only exceeded expectations, but has set a new standard for excellence. We can only hope that Terrence Morris mystifies, Steve Blake bolts, Juan Dixon dominates, Lonnie Baxter bounds, and Byron Mouton maneuvers the way they have so far. This will be the fourth meeting between the Terrapins and the Duke University Blue Devils. Each game has been an instant classic, and this contest shall truly be a game for the history books.  I stand before you today, an alumnus of Maryland, with the support of the entire State of Maryland, in praising the mighty Terrapins team, Coach Gary Williams and Athletic Director Debbie Yow. I encourage all in the Washington metropolitan area to join in saluting the Maryland Terps and wishing them success this weekend in Minneapolis.  Nuthin' but Net, Mr. Speaker . . . FEAR THE TURTLE!!!                          ____________________
