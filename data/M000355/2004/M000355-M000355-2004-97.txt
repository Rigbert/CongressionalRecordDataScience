 President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin consideration of the FSC/ETI JOBS conference report. We will be unable to reach a limited time for debate; therefore, cloture will be filed on the conference report. At approximately 9:15 a.m., the Senate will begin the first cloture vote on the pending substitute amendment to the intelligence resolution. It is my expectation that cloture will be invoked, and we should be able to adopt the substitute shortly thereafter and then proceed to the cloture vote on the underlying resolution.  I also encourage Senators who wish to offer the amendments that are listed on the amendment list approved earlier tonight to come forward and offer those amendments. We hope to dispose of those tomorrow. Following the disposition of the resolution, the Senate will resume consideration of the FSC/ETI JOBS conference report.  Again, we have been unable to lock in a time certain for a vote on the conference report, and it appears cloture will be necessary. We will continue to work with all Members to move forward on our remaining work. As I mentioned earlier, we will finish both the Senate intelligence reform resolution and the FSC conference report prior to adjourning, as well as the Homeland Security appropriations conference report and/or Defense conference report as they are available.
