 President, I think local authorities should make that judgment. They should decide. I don't think you should discriminate, whether it is at risk or not at risk. It should be after-school programs in which everyone is entitled to participate. Let the States make those decisions, not us; but let's spend the money.  My point is, spend money on after-school programs. All of the other programs the Senator listed do impact indirectly on youth violence. The problem is, 14 million kids with nothing to do for 3 hours, where 40 percent of the crime is committed. None of those programs are directed at that. We don't deal with that. We don't deal with the problem, in my opinion.
