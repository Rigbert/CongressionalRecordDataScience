Speaker, reclaiming my time, so we can let the American people know where this bill is whether it first came through the House, it had to then go to the Senate. The Senate has passed a bill. Under our rules, we now have to do what we say ``go to conference.'' That means to work out the differences between the House and Senate bill.  The problem is the Senate has appointed conferees. But guess what? The leadership of this House has not appointed conferees. Therefore, we cannot clear a bill because they have not even worked out the differences.  It is now into the fourth month of this Congress, and spring planting is now. People have to make life-and-death decisions now. I have had seed companies call me from back home saying, ``Marcy, I have debts from last year related to credit I extended, and I cannot do it again. I got a lot of farmers totally at risk here.'' And yet we are sort of fiddling here in this Chamber while rural America burns across this country and we cannot even get a conference committee appointed.
