I would say to the gentleman it incorporates two of the amendments by the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], with regard to the transfer of catastrophic insurance fees collected by the Department of Agriculture to private insurance companies and a change in the funding for the establishment of the Office of Risk Management.  Finally, the en bloc incorporates the amendment No. 9 offered by my colleague, the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Tiahrt], to the Ag Trade Act of 1978 that directs the Secretary in a manner consistent with our obligations under GATT to maintain our historic share of exports with regards to the sale of wheat flour.  I know of no opposition to this amendment, and in regards to the Livingston amendments and the described intent of the amendments that I have described to the House previously to the gentleman's question, it was to certainly enable the Department of Agriculture to implement what we pass here in a quick and timely manner.
