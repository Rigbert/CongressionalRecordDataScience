Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. Obviously he articulates reasons that he believes this bill is an important piece of legislation.  In light of the fact that the Speaker has not yet decided who he wants to appoint as conferees, does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might contemplate having the conference committee meet and then, of course, the conference report on the floor? I ask that from two perspectives: one, as the representative of the party who would like to know what is going on, as I am sure the gentleman would as well; and, secondly as an appropriator.  As the gentleman knows, until the conference committee report is adopted, it has the appropriations committees somewhat in limbo as it relates to allocations to the committees and then allowing us to make the 302(b) allocations.  Mr. Speaker, I yield further to my friend in terms of what expectations he might have as to timing from this point to when we might adopt a budget, in light of the fact it is my understanding from the staff of the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) that there is hope that we will start to mark up bills sometime in mid-May. I do not know whether the majority leader has the same understanding or not.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman continuing to yield. The gentleman has touched on many points. I am advised, and I stand to be corrected, but having served on the Committee on Appropriations, the rules allow that once we pass the April 15 deadline for having a budget, the Committee on Appropriations is allowed to start their work without a budget.  I am advised also by the gentleman from California (Chairman Lewis) of the Committee on Appropriations, who is walking in front of me right now and hopefully will correct me if I am wrong, that the gentleman from California (Chairman Lewis) has begun the appropriations process in earnest and he has a very ambitious schedule. In fact, I am told that we will have the opportunity to schedule appropriations bills for the floor by the middle of May, and I anticipate, not anticipate, we have set as a schedule, another way of putting it, we have turned over the schedule to the Committee on Appropriations to get their work done. It will be a very ambitious appropriations schedule starting the middle of May.
