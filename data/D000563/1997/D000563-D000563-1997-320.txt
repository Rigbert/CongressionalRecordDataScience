It just may be a fact that there is insufficient evidence to support the charges which the Senatorfrom Utah and other Republicans believe. Now, this Attorney General has been involved in this investigation for a long period of time with 50 different FBI agents. If the newspaper reports are accurate, she has basically said that she will turn to her career prosecutors to make this call. I trust her judgment. I think we should trust her judgment. Applying political pressure at this point on the Attorney General is not in the best interests of a good investigation that may be necessary and may lead to the appointment of an independent counsel.  I will be happy to yield.
