Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Illinois and Nevada for this opportunity.  When we were preparing for this debate, it was very important to me we keep it in the context of the bill that was being amended. I cannot think of more important legislation facing our Nation than the passage of the Defense appropriations bill at a time when America is at war.  Before I prepared the amendment which is before the Senate, I received assurances that we would not face a filibuster. I received assurances that we would not face what we have seen this evening. I was told there would be an up-or-down vote, and I was prepared to accept the outcome of that vote. Something has changed. As a result of that change, the Senate has been here for 3 hours. The most important appropriations bill we can consider has been stalled and slowed down.  I feel very strongly about this issue, but I also feel very strongly about our responsibility in the Senate. I am prepared to save this battle for another day because I do not want to diminish the ability of this Nation in its war against terrorism or diminish in any way the resources available to the men and women in uniform. I do not know when that day will come. I hope it will be soon for the sake of my State that we will consider this important legislation for our airport, for our aviation needs in our State.  I express my apologies to the Senate. I never believed for a moment that we would face a filibuster over this. In fact, I received assurances otherwise. That is not the case. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
