 President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 485, H.R. 6, and that Senator Alexander or his designee be recognized to call up amendment No. 4013; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Alexander amendment No. 4013 be agreed to; and that H.R. 6, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate vote without intervening action or debate on the bill as amended.
