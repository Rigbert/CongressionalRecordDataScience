I think the gentleman has made his point. I think the gentleman needs to take the time to read what is done with the title III money. The gentleman will understand that when you spread $29 million over the poorest countries in the world, you literally give a tiny helping hand.  Let me give an example. In Honduras, the title III money is being used for purposes such as providing food to 1.3 million children and nursing mothers. In Sri Lanka they have developed a Food Stamp Program for the poorest of the poor who live in rural areas; in Bangladesh, establishing a strategic food reserve so that farmers can basically have food when they go through these droughts and lose everything.  I would say to the gentleman, if we need to find $29 million more for title I, I will work overtime to find it. Please do not take it out of title III. We have cut this program dramatically. It is a program that truly is a compassionate program. I have been there. I have seen it. The gentleman just does not understand the gravity of this program and its importance to some of the poorest people in the world.  I urge my colleagues, do not do this in the name of false economy. If we have a famine and a disaster, we will respond with much more than $29 million. Please defeat this amendment.
