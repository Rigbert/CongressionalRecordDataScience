Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Janet Blaufuss, a woman of vision. She passed from this life in May 2013, in Toledo, Ohio.  Janet was born in Minneapolis on July 6, 1941 to Mary Vonda and George Bernard Boutlinghouse. She graduated from the University of Illinois College of Nursing. During the 1960s, she worked in juvenile and psychiatric nursing, and was instrumental in establishing the first sheltered care homes in central Illinois. She served as president of the Illinois Association of Local Health Department Nursing Administrators.  Janet then moved to Toledo to work for the Visiting Nurse Service. She worked for the agency for eleven years and was its executive director for the last four years. In 1978, Janet Blaufuss teamed with other leaders in the American hospice movement to found Hospice of Northwest Ohio. ``She believed strongly in it because it allowed people to remain at home with more dignity and comfort'' her son explained.  In 1989, Janet Blaufuss moved to North Carolina to become director of nursing for the Iredell County Health Department. Fourteen years later, she returned to Toledo and family.  Janet Blaufuss invested her life in caring for people and taking care of others. Her legacy has lifted up countless others and their families in their time of need. We offer our condolences to her family, and hope they may draw strength from Janet Blaufuss' memory and the gift of her life.                          ____________________
