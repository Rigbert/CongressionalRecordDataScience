 President, in the last few seconds remaining on this side, let me just say the Senator from Vermont has done an admirable job of trying to get the D.C. appropriations bill through, and I commend him. But I do think, despite the fact that this bill needs to pass, that with the unnecessary riders and messages and political motivations, now is not the correct way to do it.  If we defeat cloture today, we can go back and do what the Senate did before and pass a D.C. appropriations bill that is acceptable to all Members of the Senate.  I yield the remainder of my time.
