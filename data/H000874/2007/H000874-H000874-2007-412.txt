Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, we believe this resolution is well-crafted, and it's well-crafted to effect the end that it seeks. And the end that it seeks is very simple, that when issues are raised, the Ethics Committee will pursue them and that they will give confidence to the American public that we are taking seriously the allegations and/or the transgressions that might undermine the integrity of this House.  We think that's what the American people want. That's what we are pursuing. We think this legislation is very clear on that issue.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand).
