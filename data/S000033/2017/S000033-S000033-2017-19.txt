 President, let me conclude my remarks.  I would urge my Republican colleagues to come down to the floor of the Senate and explain to the American people what section 14504 is about and who benefits from some $600 million in tax breaks over a 10-year period. Is it two hedge fund managers? Is it five hedge fund managers? What is it?  That is my request, and I hope we can get a response to that quick question as quickly as possible.  With that, I yield the floor.
