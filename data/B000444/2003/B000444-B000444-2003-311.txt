 President, as another semester begins, many college students are worrying not only about their course loads and class work, but about how they will pay for school. Today, the average cost of room, board and tuition at a public four-year college has jumped to over $9,000. Tuition and fees alone jumped 9.6 percent from last year. The average cost of room, board and tuition at a private four-year college has jumped to just over $25,000 with tuition and fees having risen 5.8 percent.  What do the rising costs of attending a college or university mean for American families? It means that despite their best efforts to save and plan ahead, hard working families have to spend a larger percentage of their income than ever before to send their children to school. To attend my alma mater, the University of Delaware, it costs nearly 20 percent of a Delaware family's average annual income to cover costs. In fact just a few months ago, tuition was increased from the Fall to Spring semester by $120 to make up for an expected $3.1 cut in state aid to the university. If a Delaware family wants to send their child to a private university, approximately 50 percent of their income is required.  To help counteract these spiraling costs, I come to the floor today to reintroduce ``The Tuition Assistance for Families Act,'' a comprehensive package of tax credits and deductions, grants and scholarships that will assist American families in sending their children to college. Building upon the previous efforts of mine and others, this legislation will provide more families with much needed assistance so that the decision to send one's child to school will not be overshadowed by the decision of how to pay for it.  Specifically, the ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will raise the current tuition tax deduction for higher education expenses from $3,000 to $12,000. Based on legislation that I previously sponsored with Senator Schumer, this $9,000 increase will go a long way in helping middle class American families afford tuition.  The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' expands tuition tax credits already in law, the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Currently, the Lifetime Learning Credit allows a 20 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of one's higher education expenses. Under my bill, this percentage jumps to 25 percent while the amount of expenses subjected to the credit rises to $12,000. This means that a student who files a return in tax year 2003 under my plan could get up to $3,000 back in taxes. This is $1,000 more than the $2,000 maximum allowable credit available under current law. That means that under my plan, up to an additional $1,000 can go directly back into a student's pocket to pay for books, a computer or tuition. To maximize the utility of the tax credits, my bill also raises the income limits for both the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Credit to up to $130,000 per family, per year. This will allow more families to access the help that they need.  My bill reintroduces the idea of a $1,000 merit scholarship to be awarded to each high school senior graduating in the top 5 percent of his or her class. These types of scholarships not only reward student achievement, they help to ensure that the best and brightest students have the ability to go on to college thereby increasing the pool of well-qualified Americans in the workforce.  Finally, the ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will increase the maximum Pell Grant award from $4,000 to $4,500. During the 2001-2002 school year, the maximum Pell Grant award covered approximately 42 percent of the average tuition, room and board at a public four-year university. During the 1975-76 it covered 84 percent of these same costs. Clearly, the purchasing power of these grants has declined dramatically over the years. As such, the debt load of American students and American families has increased as students have looked to federal and private loans to finance their education. Shockingly but not surprisingly, 64percent of today's college students graduate with student loan debt at an average of $16,928, double the debt load of 1994.  It is the dream of every American parent to provide for their child a better life than they had themselves. Part of doing this involves sending your kids to college. This is why I have spent a great deal of my time in the Senate fighting to provide tax relief for middle class American families struggling with college costs. And while I was pleased when some of the ideas I advocated were adopted in the 1997 tax cut bill, it is clear that as tuition costs rise dramatically, Americans need additional assistance. The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will provide extra help so that more families can afford to give their children a brighter and better future. The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' goes one step further in committing the federal government to making college more affordable for Americans.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows                                 S. 174       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Johnson):  S. 175. A bill to establish a direct line of authority for the Office of Trust Reform Implementation and Oversight to oversee the management and reform of Indian trust funds and assets under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and to advance tribal management of such funds and assets, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination Act and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am proposing bipartisan legislation to provide the basis for reform of the administration and management of the assets and funds held by the United States in trust for federally recognized Indian tribes and individual Indians. I am pleased that my two colleagues from South Dakota, Senators Daschle and Johnson, are once again joining me in this effort.  Last year, we introduced a similar bill to serve as a legislative vehicle in the event a consensus agreement could be reached during an extensive dialogue between a designated tribal task force and the U.S. Department of Interior on administrative and legislative reforms to federal management of trust funds and assets. Unfortunately, the dialogue resulted in a stalemate. While we received many favorable comments to move forward with this legislation, and conducted a full committee hearing to consider it, a sufficient consensus did not exist to approve the legislation prior to the adjournment of the 107th session.  We are reintroducing this legislation again because we believe it is important to continue to offer a legislative remedy to the management problems plaguing the Interior Department and instill a meaningful role for Indian tribes in the process. Indian trust funds management continues to be mired in controversy and systemic mismanagement. Native American beneficiariescontinue to be denied a full reconciliation of money rightfully belonging to them.  The history of Indian trust funds management is long, exhaustive and fraught with controversy. It is a problem inherited by successive Administrations yet only limited progress has been made. The major structural changes called for in the 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act have not been accomplished. Two Special Trustees have resigned in frustration and high-level government officials have twice been held in civil contempt by the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for breach of fiduciary duties.  No one is more frustrated about the lack of resolution to these long-standing problems than the Native American beneficiaries. However, recent reorganization plans submitted to the Court by the Interior Department earlier this month have only raised more controversy and concern among Indian tribes and beneficiaries as to the extent the Department will fully account for lost and mismanaged trust accounts. Significant questions have also been raised as to the impact of these proposed plans on long-standing Federal policies of self-determination and the function of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  I cannot speak as to the merits of the Department's recent plans. The fact is, many in the Congress were not notified of the Department's intended actions nor has there been an opportunity to evaluate these plans through the respective legislative committees of jurisdiction. I have sought a commitment from the incoming Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, to hold hearings as soon as possible on recent Department proposals that will restructure trust funds management as well as to consider legislative proposals such as the one we're proposing today.  The purpose of this legislation we are introducing is simple. It focuses on two primary changes to the 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, the underlying law governing Indian trust funds management. First, it creates a single line-of-authority in the Interior Department by establishing a Deputy Secretary for Trust Management and Reform; and second, the bill strengthens provisions for Indian tribes and beneficiaries to directly manage or co-manage with the Interior secretary trust funds and assets, based on successful self-determination policies.  A fundamental objective of this legislation is to raise the profile of Indian trust funds management within the Interior Department and provide a statutory basis for Indian tribes to assume a greater management role in future management of their trust funds and trust assets. The structure of this legislation is similar to the bill introduced last year, but it is modified to reflect comments received from Indian tribes.  The legislation affirms the fiduciary standards to be applied to the management of Indian trust funds and assets. The Office of Special Trustee is abolished and replaced with the Office of Trust Reform under the direction of a new Deputy Secretary. The existing Advisory Committee to the Special Trustee is replaced with a Task Force composed of representatives of the tribes and the Department who will work with the new Deputy Secretary to develop appropriate standards and further necessary changes.  Senator Daschle, Senator Johnson and I introduce this legislation as a demonstration of our continuing commitment to seek a real and meaningful trust reform solution that provides an active role for tribal participation and consultation. We hope this legislation will prompt the necessary dialogue to ensure reform to Indian trust funds and trust assets management in a way that increases accountability of the Interior Department and respects the fact that the tribes must be involved as active participants without the threat of termination of the trust responsibility.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 175       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Trust Asset and Trust      Fund Management and Reform Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds and affirms that the proper discharge of      trust responsibility of the United States requires, without      limitation, that the trustee, using a high degree of care,      skill, and loyalty--       (1) protect and preserve Indian trust assets from loss,      damage, unlawful alienation, waste, and depletion;       (2) ensure that any management of Indian trust assets      required to be carried out by the Secretary--       (A) promotes the interest of the beneficial owner; and       (B) supports, to the maximum extent practicable in      accordance with the trust responsibility of the Secretary,      the beneficial owner's intended use of the assets;       (3)(A) enforce the terms of all leases or other agreements      that provide for the use of trust assets; and       (B) take appropriate steps to remedy trespass on trust or      restricted land;       (4) promote tribal control and self-determination over      tribal trust land and resources;       (5) select and oversee persons that manage Indian trust      assets;       (6) confirm that Indian tribes that manage Indian trust      assets pursuant to contracts and compacts authorized by the      Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25      U.S.C. 450 et seq.) protect and prudently manage those Indian      trust assets;       (7) provide oversight and review of the performance of the      trust responsibility of the Secretary, including Indian trust      asset and investment management programs, operational      systems, and information systems;       (8) account for and identify, collect, deposit, invest, and      distribute, in a timely manner, income due or held on behalf      of tribal and individual Indian account holders;       (9) maintain a verifiable system of records that, at a      minimum, is capable of identifying, with respect to a trust      asset--       (A) the location of the trust asset;       (B) the beneficial owners of the trust asset;       (C) any legal encumbrances (such as leases or permits)      applicable to the trust asset;       (D) the user of the trust asset;       (E) any rent or other payments made;       (F) the value of trust or restricted land and resources      associated with the trust asset;       (G) dates of--       (i) collections;       (ii) deposits;       (iii) transfers;       (iv) disbursements;       (v) imposition of third-party obligations (such as court-     ordered child support or judgments);       (vi) statements of earnings;       (vii) investment instruments; and       (viii) closure of all trust fund accounts relating to the      trust fund asset;       (H) documents pertaining to actions taken to prevent or      compensate for any diminishment of the Indian trust asset;      and       (I) documents that evidence the actions of the Secretary      regarding the management and disposition of the Indian trust      asset;       (10) establish and maintain a system of records that--       (A) permits beneficial owners to obtain information      regarding Indian trust assets in a timely manner; and       (B) protects the privacy of that information;       (11) invest tribal and individual Indian trust funds to      ensure that the trust account remains reasonably productive      for the beneficial owner consistent with market conditions      existing at the time at which investment is made;       (12) communicate with beneficial owners regarding the      management and administration of Indian trust assets; and       (13) protect treaty-based fishing, hunting, gathering, and      similar rights-of-access and resource use on traditional      tribal land.
