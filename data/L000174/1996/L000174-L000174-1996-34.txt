President, today Senator Lugar and I are introducing legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This legislation updates and streamlines U.S. futures trading law.  There is a strong interest in maintaining a viable futures market. Senator Lugar's and my review of committee testimony combined with the informal meetings with the industry, regulators, and interested academics has convinced us that it is appropriate to make these revisions to the CEA.  I do not expect that this bill will become law during this session. But introducing it now will afford an opportunity to engage in an active public discussion and debate over the changes that we propose here today.  It is my experience that such a dialog helps develop solid bipartisan legislation. As with most issues, there are many interests that must be balanced. And, Senator Lugar and I have strived to strike the right balance between these interests. But we will profit from the dicussions that this bill is sure to prompt.  I am pleased to join my colleague in offering this bill. Senator Lugar and I have worked together on futures issues since we came to the Agriculture Committee. We did the same on this bill--working to ensure that these markets remain competitive while still maintaining effective provisions on customer protection and market integrity such as the 1992 audit trail provisions.  I look forward to continuing our discussions.                                 ______                                       By
