President, we took an important step in the last Congress to preserve law enforcement's wiretapping tool and increase privacy protection for our telephone and computer communications by passing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. This law expanded privacy protection to cordless telephones, restricted the ability of law enforcement to obtain transactional information from e-mail messages, and improved the privacy of mobile phones by expanding criminal penalties for stealing the service from legitimate users.  This new law also imposed new requirements to ensure that court orders for electronic surveillance can be carried out, rather than stymied by new technologies used on our telephone networks.  Significantly, these new requirements for our Nation's telephone networks were accompanied by guidelines designed to bring public oversight and accountability to the process of implementing them. For the first time, decisions on how new and existing telecommunications systems will remain accessible to government surveillance must be made in the sunshine of public scrutiny.  Thus, the new law requires for the first time that law enforcement's demands regarding the number of wiretap, pen register, and other surveillance orders that telephone companies must be able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized in a public procedure.  In compliance with this new requirement, the FBI published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1995, a proposed notice setting forth its capacity demands. According to the proposed notice, these capacity demands were predicated upon a historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity. Yet, the Federal Register notice did not include publication of this underlying information.  Shortly after the notice was issued, I wrote to the FBI Director requesting copies of this information, and urging him to release the information to the public to ensure the fullest dissemination of the information.  I am aware that the comments filed by the deadline on January 16, 1996, in response to the proposed notice on behalf of civil liberties groups, telephone companies, and cellular companies have criticized the proposed notice for failing to disclose the supporting data for the capacity demands. As one set of comments filed by the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Center for National Security Studies noted, ``it is impossible to say whether or not the capacity requirements proposed in the notice are justified'' without the supporting data.   The FBI has now provided me with a 13-page report explaining how they collected information about past law enforcement surveillance activity from Federal and State court offices, State attorneys general offices, and over a thousand telecommunications carriers. This report also describes the method the FBI used to analyze this information and figure out how much wiretap capacity law enforcement would need for the foreseeable future and up to 10 years from now in three broad categories of geographic areas.  I fully appreciate the amount of hard work that went into collecting this critical data and doing the analysis. Indeed, this is the first time that law enforcement has ever been required to estimate its future surveillance activity and the demands that will be made on telecommunications carriers. This is also the first time that this information has ever been required to be made public.  I am pleased to make this report available for public dissemination. It does not identify which geographic areas fall into which of the three different categories with differing capacity requirements. Thus, it does not tell us whether Vermont is in category I, where the greatest level of interception activity has occurred and is likely to occur in the future, or in category III, where the number of law enforcement wiretaps have been low or nonexistent. Telecommunications carriers doing business in Vermont and Vermonters will want to know which category we fall into.  The FBI has assured me that they are in the process of preparing two additional documents that will explain the proposed capacity notice in greater depth. I look forward to examining those two additional documents upon their release by the FBI.  The public process set up in the new law is working. I commend the FBI Director for his efforts to fulfill the public accountability provisions of the law by making available this report and future reports on the capacity requirements.  Since these reports were not available prior to the deadline for comments on the original proposed notice, however, I would urge the FBI to consider issuing a revised or supplemental proposed notice to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed capacity demands with the benefit of this new information.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Information Concerning Implementation of the Communications Assistance                     for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA]                               Background       CALEA was enacted to preserve law enforcement's ability,      pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization, to      access communications (content) and associated call-     identifying information in an ever-changing      telecommunications environment. Because many interceptions      \1\ in the future will be initiated through equipment      controlled by carriers, CALEA obligates the Attorney General      to provide telecommunications carriers with information they      will need (a) to adequately size and design their networks to      accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous interceptions      that law enforcement potentially might conduct after October      25, 1998, and (b) to be capable of accommodating the actual      number of simultaneous interceptions law enforcement      potentially might conduct as of October 25, 1998. The CALEA      specifically refers to two levels of capacity, maximum and      actual.     Footnotes at end of article---------------------------------------------------------------------------       CALEA requires the Attorney General to provide a notice of      the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the      communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap trace      devices that the Attorney General estimates that government      agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may      conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years      after enactment (i.e., after October 25, 1998). The Attorney      General must also provide a notice of the actual number of      communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap trace      devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity, that      the Attorney General estimates that government agencies      authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and      use simultaneously as of October 1998.\2\                            Maximum Capacity       Unlike actual capacity, CALEA indicates that the maximum      capacity applies to a time, not specified, after the date      that is 4 years after the date of CALEA's enactment. The      maximum capacity has been interpreted as chiefly a design      requirement for telecommunications carriers that will be      utilized to size and define an upper bound capacity ceiling      for the mid-term to intermediate future (i.e., 1998-2004), as      discussed in more detail below. This ceiling is intended to      provide carriers with certainty and stability, as well as      with a framework for cost effectively designing and      engineering future capacity requirements into their networks.       As CALEA makes clear, the maximum capacity is in no way      synonymous with actual capacity (i.e., the interception      capacity that law enforcement may actually use as of October      25, 1998). Rather, maximum capacity is viewed as relating to      a longer term, more enduring design requirement that would      serve as a defined technological bound to interception      activity, but yet would provide room for expeditiously      accommodating certain future interception-related ``worst      case scenarios.'' For example, it would be impossible for      law enforcement to predict unusual, anomalous, but      nonetheless very serious or violent events such as those      associated with certain acts of terrorism or extreme      instances of drug-trafficking or organized crime activity.      Maximum capacity provides a safety-net that would enable      telecommunications carriers to expeditiously respond to      serious, unpredictable, emergencies that require very      unusual levels of interception capacity.                            Actual Capacity       Under CALEA, estimates of actual capacity are to apply to      all simultaneous interception activity that may be conducted      by the date that is 4 years after the date of enactment of      CALEA. CALEA makes clear that actual capacity represents only      a portion of the maximum capacity. Actual capacity thus      pertains to the amount of interception activity that      potentially may be needed when many of CALEA's requirements      are scheduled to take effect in October 1998. Consequently,      when viewing the maximum and actual capacity levels set forth      in the Initial Capacity Notice, realistically only the actual      capacity estimates should be construed as in any way      reflecting the amount of simultaneous interception activity      that potentially may be conducted by law enforcement in any      geographic area as of October 1998.                          Methodology Overview       The CALEA mandate which obligates the Attorney General to      estimate future capacity marks the first time (a) that      information has been required to be provided to carriers in      order for them to properly design and size future networks      with reference to interception activity; and (b) that the      entire law enforcement community has been required to project      its collective potential future interception needs, thereby      in effect placing possible technological limitations on its      lawful authority to conduct electronic surveillance. This      circumstance, as viewed by the law enforcement community,      obviously generates great and legitimate concern, because      historically telephone technology placed no constraints on      law enforcement's court ordered electronic surveillance      authority. If not implemented with care, CALEA could have the      unintended effect of potentially placing restrictions on the      lawful use of electronic surveillance authority. Thus, if law      enforcement errs by underscoping its potential, legitimate,      and lawful interception needs, effective law enforcement will      be hampered and, more importantly, the public safety will be      jeopardized.       The FBI, which is implementing many of the responsibilities      conferred upon the Attorney General by CALEA, was required to      issue the capacity notice. In order to meet this obligation,      we proceeded by employing a rigorous, comprehensive      methodology to acquire critically needed information and to      establish analytic tools for determining the simultaneous      interception activity of the recent past and for estimating      future maximum and actual capacity.       The methodology used was intended to take into      consideration the concerns of the parties principally      affected by CALEA. On the one hand, CALEA provides law      enforcement with an opportunity and means to ensure that its      future electronic surveillance needs can be met. On the      other hand, CALEA presents an opportunity and means for      telecommunications carriers to understand the nature and      extent of their obligations to accommodate law      enforcement's electronic surveillance needs and to do so      in a way that will not be unduly burdensome or excessive.      Law enforcement's approach and perspective regarding its      electronic surveillance needs relate to its mission to      combat serious crime, acts of terrorism, and acts of      violence. Traditionally, this mission has been tied to law      enforcement agencies' geographically-based jurisdiction      and associated jurisdictional legal authority.      Telecommunications carriers' approach and perspective      regarding law enforcement's electronic surveillance needs,      however, chiefly relate to the effect such needs may have      on particular components within their systems that are      used to serve subscribers within a given market (i.e.,      switches and other network components).       As a goal, law enforcement sought to harmonize the      different approaches and perspectives of these parties in its      methodology. The methodology sought to produce a result that      acknowledged and factored in the interrelationship between      the geographic, jurisdictional contours of law enforcement      interception activity and the geographic service areas      covered by the carrier switching facilities that will be      likely used to provide interception access. By identifying      key pieces of      data associated with these approaches and perspectives, we were able to      formulate and then analyze past interception activity in      terms that enabled us to establish one of the key components      (one pertaining to past peak levels of interception activity      in localities of various sizes) in an equation leading to an      estimate of future interception capacity. The other key      component (one pertaining to projected growth) was derived      from a statistical model that included a number of variables      reasonably believed to predict potential future capacity      bounds and potential future interception needs. Once the      projections were made to estimate future capacity needs, the      results were reviewed and adjusted to ensure reasonableness      before publishing the results in the Initial Capacity Notice.       By presenting capacity levels in the Initial Capacity      Notice with reference to engineered capacity (discussed      below), the FBI intended to express interception capacity in      an understandable fashion as a percentage of a carrier's      switch or other network component capacity. This approach was      intended to enable carriers to tailor their technological      responses to law enforcement's potential interception needs      within specific types of geographic areas. The following      discussion highlights the methodological steps used to arrive      at the actual and maximum capacity figures published in the      Initial Capacity Notice.      part one: deriving key data from past interception activity       As a first step, we sought to establish a baseline of past      simultaneous interception activity. Information concerning      the actual number of all types of simultaneous interceptions      occurring throughout the United States in the recent past was      collected. Such information, needed to establish the      baseline, had never before been collected and did not exist      in a single repository. Amassing this detailed and extremely      sensitive information required an unprecedented and time-     consuming effort on the part of law enforcement. It involved      identifying sources from which accurate information could be      retrieved in an efficient and effective manner.      Specifically, we sought to identify sources that could      provide the exact number of all types of interceptions (to      include call content, pen register, and trap and trace)      performed by all federal, State, and local law enforcement      agencies, in terms of the actual number of telephone lines      \3\ intercepted at each locality.       To obtain specific line-related information regarding past      simultaneous electronic surveillance activity, records of      interception activity were acquired from telecommunications      carriers, law enforcement officials, and most importantly,      from the Federal and State Clerks of Court's offices--the      official repository for all interceptions conducted      simultaneously between January 1, 1993 and March 1, 1995, for      all geographic locations. Specifically, highly sensitive      interception information pertaining to each interception      start/end dates, and to area code and exchange was collected.      The period January 1, 1993 to March 1, 1995 was chosen in      order to obtain recent interception information that was      reasonably retrievable given the time constraint of one year      imposed by the CALEA with regard to publishing a capacity      notice.       Approximately 1500 telecommunications carriers (those      serving the majority of subscribers in the U.S., and      representing the largest of the wireline and cellular      telephone companies (as of March 1995)) were requested to      provide information that would identify where and how many      interceptions had occurred within their networks during the      period of study. Acquisition and examination of sensitive      electronic surveillance records maintained pursuant to      statute under seal with the Clerks of Court offices was      pursued through two separate efforts. All Federal court order      information was collected pursuant to special court orders      directing the unsealing of interception court orders for the      limited purpose of enabling the Attorney General/FBI to      comply with the capacity notice obligation. State and local      law enforcement information was obtained through the State      Attorneys General (AG) offices. Each State AG was requested      to coordinate the collection of interception information      within the AG's respective State.       By reviewing the data collected, the number of simultaneous      interceptions that had occurred within switching facilities      was identified throughout the country during the study      period. One of the key pieces of relevant information was the      highest number of interceptions that had ever occurred      simultaneously within any telecommunications carrier's      switch.\5\       For the years studied, the highest number of simultaneous      interceptions occurring within any one switch in the United      States was 220; that is, 220 pen register, trap and trace      and/or call content interceptions were active at the same      time within a particular switch. Further analysis revealed      that the 220 interception number far exceeded the number of      simultaneous interceptions conducted in other high activity      switches and was due to a single unusual occurrence. The      switch that had the second highest level of simultaneous      activity supported 120 pen register, trap and trace and/or      call content interceptions.       The distribution of baseline simultaneous interception      activity by switch was varied. Among switches which had      supported interceptions during the period studied, there was      a broad and varied distribution of simultaneous interceptions      ranging from 1 to 120. Switches with the greatest levels of      interception activity frequently existed in urban areas.      Switches with lower levels of interception activity existed      across a variety of geographic areas, encompassing urban,      suburban, and rural areas.       The review of the baseline of interception activity yielded      certain key data on simultaneous interceptions for specific      switching systems, but law enforcement usually approaches      crime within the context of geographic or jurisdictional      areas. The next analysis challenge was to associate the      baseline simultaneous interception data on specific switches      with law enforcement's need to express requirements relative      to geographic areas. To do this, law enforcement sought to      identify geographic boundaries that could provide common      reference points between law enforcement and      telecommunications carriers.       A number of geographic boundaries which define service      areas of telecommunications carriers were considered (e.g.,      State lines, local access transport areas (LATA),      metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), rural service areas      (RSA), and major and basic trading areas (MTA, BTA)).      However, in each case, these boundaries did not provide a      good match with defined law enforcement areas. Law      enforcement jurisdictional legal authority in a great number      of cases is defined by county boundaries (i.e., for local law      enforcement agencies). County boundaries rarely change and      are not disputable. In most cases, a group of counties are      encompassed by the boundaries that define a      telecommunications carrier's service area. Consequently,      county boundaries were used as the common reference tool in      formulating an analysis for future capacity.       From the baseline of interception activity, interception      data was aggregated for a group of specific switches by      county. Switches were assigned to counties based on their      geographic location. The data can be divided into their      different levels (or categories) or interception activity:      high, moderate, and low.       As part of the consultative process with the      telecommunications carriers, law enforcement understood that      one of the primary carrier concerns with regard to capacity      was that each switch in a carrier's network should not be      held to the same requirement for capacity levels. The      carriers had indicated generally that although CALEA requires      the Attorney General to estimate future capacity sizings and      to estimate future potential interception activity that may      occur in their network, every attempt should be made by law      enforcement to express its needs in accordance with the      variability of interceptions that had occurred in the past.      Recognizing this, we chose to define law enforcement's      potential future interception needs using categories and not      just one absolute number that would apply without regard to      the often varied nature of interceptions in a carrier's      geographic service area.       As a result of considering the relative relationships      between law enforcement and telecommunications carriers      geographic areas, it was determined that three separate      categories for stating capacity requirements should be      created. The use of categories permitted capacity      requirements to be stated in a way that reasonably reflected,      and was responsive to, law enforcement interception needs      without unduly burdening all carriers with the same level of      capacity or requiring a particular carrier to provide the      same capacity level everywhere in its network. As alluded to      in the Initial Capacity Notice, Category I represents a small      number of geographic areas where the greatest level of      interception activity typically has occurred and is likely to      occur. Category II also represents a relatively small number      of geographic areas, which consist of some urban and suburban      areas. Category III represents the vast majority of areas      where electronic surveillance activity has historically been      low or nonexistent, principally in rural and many suburban      areas.       With regard to Category III, as the nation moves toward the      future, law enforcement must have the capability to conduct a      minimum level of electronic surveillance in any locality,      regardless of previous levels of criminal activity or prior      levels of electronic surveillance activity. Terrorism, drug      trafficking, and violent crimes are constant and      unpredictable threats to the public in all localities, as      evidenced by the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995.      Consequently, unlike Categories I and II, which are defined      principally with reference to past levels of electronic      surveillance activity, Category III constitutes a minimum      interception capacity for any location in which law      enforcement may need an interception capability in order to      protect the public and effectively enforce the law.       Once the geographic areas could be generally (but only      tentatively) associated with each category, the historic      baseline of interception activity for these areas could be      used as a way of defining the distinct levels of past      electronic surveillance activity. For the Category I level,      as noted above, the highest number of simultaneous      interceptions from a switch was 120. Our analysis also      determined that within the Category II level the highest      number of simultaneous interceptions from a switch was 42.             the use of percentages and engineered capacity       Law enforcement considered it appropriate and prudent to      express capacity requirements in the Initial Capacity Notice      in      terms of a percentage rather than as a fixed number for several      reasons. First, percentages are very appropriate, if not      essential, with regard to new service providers, new      switches, new services, and new technologies. If absolute      numbers were set forth, the introduction of new basic      service, as well as more advanced services and features,      could be impeded--a prospect that is unacceptable to either      the Congress, law enforcement, or the telecommunications      industry. Second, percentages allow capacity requirements to      adjust slightly to a changing subscriber base as it increases      or decreases over time.       To enable carriers to apply the percentages to the affected      systems in their networks properly, capacity level      percentages were tied to engineered capacity. Engineered      capacity was referred to in the Initial Capacity Notice as      the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by a      carrier's equipment, facilities, or service. In the main, a      carrier's switching facility was the key network component      associated with this foregoing terminology. With regard to      the highest level of simultaneous interception activity in      the baseline data with regard to Category I (120), the switch      associated with that interception activity was one that      typically served an average of 35,000 subscribers. This led      to the historical electronic surveillance activity being      expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity of 0.34%.      This percentage was derived by dividing the 120 simultaneous      interceptions by 35,000 subscribers. With regard to the      highest level of simultaneous interception activity noted in      the baseline data occurring with regard to Category II (42),      the switch associated with that interception activity was one      that typically served an average of 27,000 subscribers. This      led to the historical electronic surveillance activity being      expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity of 0.16%.      This percentage was derived by dividing the 42 simultaneous      interceptions by 27,000 subscribers.       As discussed above, the interception activity which was now      being associated with Category III reflected little or no      activity in the past. Hence the capacity level associated      with Category III was dervived in a different manner. To      establish a percentage regarding areas where there had been      little or no past interception activity, for purposes of      future analyses, we examined the distribution of historical      interception activity for those switches with very little or      not interception activity. The majority of these switches had      electronic surveillance activity of less than 0.1% of the      capacity associated with such switches. This led law      enforcement to assign 0.1% as the level of historical      electronic surveillance activity for Category III, expressed      as a percentage of engineered capacity. This figure,      therefore, was selected essentially to ensure a bare minimum      capacity to support law enforcement interceptions.part two: estimating and using growth rates to project future capacity                        and interception activity       CALEA's mandate that law enforcement identify capacity      requirements marked the first time future carrier capacity      sizings and future potential interception activity were      required to be estimated. Although CALEA provided no specific      date as an outer bound for the projection for maximum      capacity, the year 2004 was used for its projection of      maximum capacity. We used the year 2004 because it      reflects a ten year period from the last date for which      historical data was available (1994). A ten year period is      commonly used as a period of time within which to analyze      and prepare projections. An analysis of a period of this      length also provides the affected telecommunications      carriers with the information that would produce the      greatest level of stability for the mid-term to      intermediate future. By comparison, CALEA specifies      October 1998 as the date for projecting potential future      interception activity (actual capacity).       Four steps were followed to determine the maximum and      actual capacity percentages which were published in the      Initial Capacity Notice. These four steps are as follows: step 1: establishing a statistical model; projecting title iii court  Order trends as a predicate for projecting future design capacity and                  potential future interception activity       Projections regarding future design capacity that may be      required to accommodate unusual future interception activity,      as well as the amount of potential future interception      activity itself (call content interceptions, as well as the      much more prevalent pen register and trap and trace      interceptions), in terms of the number of lines that possibly      could be implicated, are not readily and easily derived. For      example, when one considers just one of the relevant groups      of information (past Title III court order authorizations) it      becomes apparent that a simple straight line trend does not      exist. In reviewing the number of such authorizations on a      yearly basis over the last 15 years (1980-1994), there is      over a 100% increase (from 566 to 1154). However, the year to      year increases are anything but consistent, with variations      from -12% to +19% occurring by way of yearly changes.       Although it may be impossible to discern precisely why      increases (or decreases) occur on a yearly basis with regard      to all of the types of interception activity, a number of      factors were considered (discussed further below) which over      time presumably would logically influence such activity. In      brief, these factors relate to population, telecommunications      technology, law enforcement resources, and relevant crime      statistics.       Notwithstanding the difficulty in making long range      estimations about a design capacity level capable of      accommodating reasonable growth over the intermediate future      (1998-2004) and which, more importantly, could also address      totally unexpected worst case scenarios (maximum capacity)      and future potential, interception activity (actual      capacity), in terms of the number of lines implicated, we      were obligated to respond to CALEA's mandate to produce      capacity estimates.       Law enforcement determined that it was imperative to      construct and utilize an analytical statistical model in      order to address the variability related to relevant      historical data that could be associated with interception      activity. The model selected was a widely-used model referred      to as a multi-variable linear regression statistical model.      With such a model, future trends central to predicting      capacity could be projected.       In broad terms, this model sought to project potential      future behavior based upon an analysis of the relationships      between two data groups for which historical data was      available over the last 15 years. One data group was the      number of criminal Title III court orders authorized between      1980 and 1994. The other data group was composed of a suite      of relevant factors (multi-variables) related to population,      telecommunications technology, law enforcement resources, and      relevant crime statistics. Once trend relationships were      noted between the second group and the first, an equation was      produced from which projections as to the future level of the      first group (Title III court orders) could be established      based on growth projections of the second group. The      projection for the criminal Title III court order      authorizations was an important analytic first step in      projecting the design capacity and future potential      interception activity in terms of the number of lines      (interceptions) that may be involved.       The first data group consisted of the number of Title III      court order authorizations recorded per year in the Wiretap      Report, compiled each year by the Administrative Office of      the United States Courts. In an attempt to establish a trend,      we examined the criminal Title III court order authorizations      granted per year over the last 15 years (1980-1994). As noted      above, however, an examination of this data showed      significant yearly fluctuations thereby precluding a simple,      straight line trend for approximating future authorizations.      Also, as noted above, the Wiretap Report only documents the      number of criminal Title III court orders; it does not      specify the actual number of call content interceptions      associated with each order, nor does it address at all the      vastly greater number of interceptions associated with pen      registers and traps and traces. Nonetheless, because it was      the only longstanding electronic surveillance data source in      existence, it was concluded that it necessarily should play      an important role in the model because it did document past,      relevant interception-related information from which      projections of design capacity and future potential      interception activity could later be made.       The second data group consisted of factors or multi-     variables deemed relevant with regard to the conduct of all      types of interception activity. These factors, as noted      above, were population, telecommunications technology, law      enforcement resources, and relevant crime statistics.      Historical and projected future data on population totals was      collected from the United States Census Bureau. Historical      and projected future data for wireline telecommunications      subscribers was collected from the Federal Communications      Commission. Historical data on wireless subscribers was      acquired from reviewing publications issued by the Cellular      Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA). Projected      future data for wireless subscribers was derived based upon      an analysis of information found in trade journals concerning      future projections of the number of wireless subscribers and      attributed to the CTIA, the Personal Communications Industry      Association, and other industry sources. Historical data on      total number of law enforcement officers and reported      incidents of violent crime was collected from the FBI's      Uniform Crime Report. Projected future data on the total      number of law enforcement officers and crime was derived      based on an assumed linear growth rate of the historical      data. For each of the above factors, projections for future      data were made out to the year 2004.                     step 2: computing growth rates       Using the projected future data produced by the equation,      the statistics indicated a growth rate of 130% in the first      group between 1994 and 2004, a factor which was included in      the subsequent analysis used to project maximum (design)      capacity. By comparison, a projection for potential future      interception activity (actual capacity) was arrived at by      noting the statistics in the first group, that had applied      the same trends projected by the statistical model,      suggesting a growth rate between 1994 and 1998 of 54 percent.      As noted above, when one reviews the number of criminal Title      III court order authorizations on a yearly basis during the      last 15 years (1980-1994), there is more than a 100% increase      (from 566 to 1154). Also, when one reviews available official      reports regarding the vastly more prevalent pen register and      trap and trace court orders granted during the last 8 years,      one observes an increase      of 219%. Finally, for the same period, with regard to such pen register      and trap and trace court orders ``the number of persons whose      telephone facilities were affected'' increased by 345%.\6\      Consequently, the model's results are considered to be      reasonable and consistent with past interception-related      activity and appropriate for use as part of the analysis.     step 3: projections for design capacity and potential future                          interception activity       As noted above, the historical interception activity      expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity for Category      I was 0.34% (120 simultaneous interceptions out of a switch      serving a possible 35,000 subscribers); and the historical      interception activity expressed as a percentage of engineered      capacity for Category II was 0.16% (42 simultaneous      interceptions out of a switch serving a possible 27,000      subscribers). For Category III, the minimum level of      interception activity expressed as a percentage of engineered      capacity was 0.1%. The computed growth rates of 130% and 54%      were converted into growth multipliers of 2.3 and 1.54, for      maximum and actual capacity, respectively. By multiplying the      historical interception activity figures for Category I,      Category II, and Category III by the growth multipliers, we      calculated numbers for a ``raw'' maximum and actual capacity,      as illustrated in the table below.     RAW MAXIMUM AND ACTUAL CAPACITY PREDICTED BY THE GROWTH FACTORS    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Maximum             Actual      ------------------------------------------------------------------------Category I......................  0.34%2.3=0.78%....  0.34%1.54=0.52%   Category II.....................  0.16%2.3=0.37%....  0.16%1.54=0.25%   Category III....................  0.10%2.3=0.23%....  0.10%1.54=0.15%   ------------------------------------------------------------------------    step 4: applying reasonableness criteria to the raw calculations       In projecting future design capacity (maximum capacity) and      capacity for potential future interception activity (actual      capacity) that may be needed by all law enforcement agencies,      for publication in the Federal Register, the FBI made      downward adjustments to the numbers that were set forth with      regard to the raw actual capacity in both Categories I and      III. A substantial downward adjustment was made in Category      III. These downward adjustments were made because law      environment recognized that a majority of the affected      telecommunications carriers fall in Category III, and that      our historical interception activity was minimal in this      category. Therefore, we chose to lessen the burden on the      telecommunications industry and minimize the costs of      installing solutions, consistent with assuring an essential      minimum level of interception capacity.       The numbers set forth for the raw maximum capacity in      Categories I, II, and III were adjusted upward for a number      of reasons. First, as noted above, the interception activity      associated with pen registers and traps and traces by far      represents the most frequently used type of interception. The      growth rate in the number of pen register and trap and trace      court orders far exceeds that projected in the statistical      analysis. As noted above, the percentage of increase in such      court orders during the past 8 years was 219% and the number      of persons whose telephone facilities were affected increased      345%.       Second, although the peak number of simultaneous      interceptions identified in the baseline data was 220, we      elected not to use it in the statistical analysis because it      was deemed to be an anomaly. However, this level of      interception activity, although anomalous, is indicative of      the type of worst-case scenarios that law enforcement should      not easily ignore or completely discount. Hence some      provision needs to be made for such situations.       Third, although every effort was made to capture as      accurately as possible the actual levels of past interception      activity in compiling our baseline of historical intercept      information, there may be some instances where data was not      fully collected or reported. Also, there is an amount of      interception activity associate with national security that      must be accounted for in the final capacity projections.       Fourth, during the study period (1980-1994), the number of      States granting State and local law enforcement interception      authority by statute increased and a number of      States expanded interception authority to cover additional      types of crimes and/or additional types of communications      devices (e.g., cellular telephones and pagers). There is a      reasonable likelihood that in the future other States may      grant similar interception authority and/or increase the      scope of existing interception authority.       Finally, law enforcement believed that judgment needed to      be brought to bear on the numbers for raw actual and maximum      capacity, in terms of making appropriate upward or downward      adjustments. In particular, the FBI, acting on behalf of the      entire law enforcement community, had a responsibility to be      careful not to overstate or understate capacity needs.      Importantly, however, if capacity needs were understated it      could pose direct harm to the public safety and effective law      enforcement.                        initial capacity notice       On October 16, 1995, the FBI published in the Federal      Register its Initial Capacity Notice. The estimates of actual      and maximum capacity, expressed as a percentage of engineered      capacity, were stated as follows in the Initial Capacity      Notice: ESTIMATES FOR PROJECTED MAXIMUM AND ACTUAL CAPACITY AS PUBLISHED IN THE                            FEDERAL REGISTER                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Maximum     Actual  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Category I......................................      1.00%       0.50% Category II.....................................      0.50%       0.25% Category III....................................      0.25%       0.05% ------------------------------------------------------------------------       After the FBI's publication of the Initial Capacity Notice      in the Federal Register, you requested two documents in your      correspondence: (1) the historical baseline of electronic      surveillance activity, and (2) an analysis of that activity.      By way of response and clarification, although we examined      past electronic surveillance activity and utilized certain      key pieces of information derived therefrom as discussed in      this letter, no ``document'', as such, was ever created.      Similarly, the factors utilized in our analysis were never      compiled into a document.       Nonetheless, because of the interest and the      misunderstandings that have been associated with this matter,      we currently are in the process of preparing two methodology      documents which will explain our capacity notice efforts in      greater depth. The first document will describe the process      used to collect historical electronic surveillance      information. The second document will describe the analysis      used in developing the Initial Capacity Notice, as well as      the Final Capacity Notice. Regarding the latter, it will take      into account the written comments we have received and the      input from our ongoing meetings with the telecommunications      industry and other interest groups. The FBI will provide      copies of these two documents to you upon their completion.                                summary       As you are aware, in 1968 when Congress statutorily      authorized court ordered electronic surveillance, telephone      technology permitted law enforcement to execute, without      impairment, essentially all court orders--a 100 percent      capability/capacity to accommodate law enforcement's court      ordered electronic surveillance needs. However, the onset of      new and advanced technologies has begun to erode the capacity      and capability of the telecommunications industry to support      law enforcement's interception needs. For the first time,      technological limitations will potentially be set on law      enforcement's ability to lawfully conduct electronic      surveillance. In view of these potential limitations, an      attempt was made to estimate law enforcement's capacity needs      in an accurate and reasonable manner with the goal of      striking a balance of meeting law enforcement's interception      needs without introducing unduly burdensome or excessive      requirements on telecommunications carriers. This in no way      changes law enforcement's fundamental statutory      responsibility to obtain proper legal authority to conduct      electronic surveillance. CALEA's capacity requirements simply      ensure that, after law enforcement obtains proper legal      authority, telecommunications carriers will have sufficient      capacity to accommodate lawfully authorized electronic      surveillance activity.       To project capacity needs, the previously described      national methodology was employed in order to prepare an      Initial Capacity Notice for publication in the Federal      Register. Since release of the Notice, law enforcement has      met with privacy advocates, the telecommunications industry,      and other interested parties to clarify and further describe      how best to apply capacity needs within a given carrier's      network, and it is reviewing and considering the formal      written comments provided in response to the Initial Capacity      Notice.       In closing, CALEA is important to the public safety and      national security of this nation and its full and timely      implementation is critically important to the American      public. On behalf of the law enforcement community, we would      again like to express our appreciation for your support and      leadership regarding this significant and complex issue. With      the continued support of the Congress, we are confident that      CALEA will be fully implemented in an effective and efficient      manner.                               footnotes     \1\ For purposes of this discussion, the word      ``interception'' refers to all types of interceptions: (1)      interceptions of communication content (e.g., Title III); and      (2) interceptions of dialing-related information (call      identifying information) derived from pen registers and traps      and traces.     \2\ 47 U.S.C. 1003 (1994).     \3\ For purposes of this discussion, the word ``lines''      refers to the transmission path from a subscriber's terminal      to the network via a wireline or wireless medium.     \4\ Although a valuable source for historical information on      criminal Title III (call content) court orders, The Wiretap      Report, published annually by the Administrative Office of      the United States Courts, does not identify the actual number      of interception lines associated with each court order or,      more importantly, with the vastly greater number of lines      associated with pen register and trap and trace interceptions      that have been performed by all law enforcement agencies.      Even though the FBI used information pertaining to the number      of court orders reported in The Wiretap Report as an      essential element for forecasting purposes, the Report does      not contain the line-related information that was needed to      identify the actual level of past interception activity      related to specific switches.     \5\ For purposes of this discussion, the term ``switch'' also      represents a licensed cellular service area.     \6\ 18 U.S.C. 3126 (1986). By law, the Department of Justice      is required to report to the Congress on a yearly basis      information on the use of pen registers and trap and trace      devices by law enforcement agencies within the Department of      Justice. This report includes information concerning the      number of original orders, extensions, the number of      investigations, the number of persons whose telephone      facilities were affected, and the number of overall dialings.
