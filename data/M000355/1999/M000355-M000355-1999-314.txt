A bill to conserve global bear populations by prohibiting the importance, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and items, products, or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear viscera, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.                        the bear protection act  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bear Protection Act. This legislation, which I sponsored in the 105th Congress, is aimed at eliminating the poaching of America's bears for profit. As you may know, bear parts, such as gall bladders and bile, which are commonly referred to as ``viscera,'' have traditionally been used in myriad Asian medicines--for everything from diabetes to heart disease to hangovers, and in luxury shampoos and cosmetics. Due to the popularity of these products containing bear viscera, Asian bear populations have been decimated, causing poachers to run to American bears to meet the increasing demand.  Mr. President, the practice of poaching bears for viscera is both a national and international problem. Asian and American bear populations are threatened by high demand for and low supply of bear parts and by the black market trade in exotic and traditional medicine cures. The problem is compounded by the fact that the poaching of bears for their viscera is a very profitable enterprise, and one in which at least 18 Asian countries are known to participate. In fact, bear gall bladders in South Korea, for instance, are worth more than their weight in gold, fetching a price of about $10,000 a piece.  Mr. President, each year, nearly 40,000 black bears are legally hunted in 36 States and Canada. Unfortunately, it has been estimated that roughly the same number is illegally poached every year, according to a former chief law enforcement officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While I am pleased to report that for the most part, U.S. bear populations have remained stable or are increasing, I continue to remain concerned about the threat posed by unchecked poaching.  Since 1981, State and Federal wildlife agents have conducted many successful undercover operations to aimed at exposing the illegal slaughter of American bears. As recently as this past February, a group of State and Federal officers arrested 25 people in Virginia and charged them with 112 wildlife violations including bear poaching as part of Operations SOUP, or ``Special Operation to Uncover Poaching.'' Operation SOUP is a major undercover investigation, which has been ongoing for three years and is aimed at the trafficking of gall bladders and other bear parts from black bears in Virginia and Shenandoah National Park.  Mr. President, I have with me two press releases from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fishing, as well as an article from the Washington Post which I would like to have placed in the Record.  Mr. President, as these and other news reports will attest, this problem with poaching and trading bear parts must be addressed. Although many States and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are making efforts to combat this problem, these agencies have neither the funds nor the resources to adequately solve the problem. Moreover, there are loopholes created by a patchwork of State laws that allow these illegal practices to flourish. There are fourteen States in which the sale of bear gall bladders is legal--eight of those States limit the sale to viscera taken from bears in other States, and there are five States that have no law in this regard. This patchwork of State laws enables poachers to ``launder'' the gall through the States that permit the sale of gall bladders. As long as a few States allow this action to go on, poaching for profit will continue.  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this is both a national and international problem--and it is a growing problem. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which the United States is a party, has recognized the issue of bear conservation as a global issue. In fact, CITES has noted that ``the continued illegal trade is bear parts and derivatives of bear parts undermines the effectiveness of the Convention and that if CITES parties . . . do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the extirpation of certain populations or even species.'' The Convention goes on to say that in order to achieve this goal, ``submitted and measurable action'' must be taken--this includes adopting national legislation.  I would like to point out that members of the U.S. delegation to the CITES Convention contributed to the drafting of that resolution, and in doing so, made a strong statement about the need to strengthen our national commitment to eradicating the poaching of bears. Recently, the Secretariat pointed out that bear poaching is most likely to flourish in countries that have inconsistent internal trade, import, and export controls. In such instances where there are differences in national, Federal, and State laws, the Secretariat asserts that confusion and enforcement difficulties arise which will contribute to the availability of bear viscera that can become available for international trade.  Mr. President, in order to halt the poaching of America's bears, we need to effectuate legislation that not only prohibits the import and export of bear viscera, but we need to close the loopholes in State laws that encourage poachers to evade the law. To effectively reduce the laundering of bear viscera through the United States, all states must have a minimum level of protection. We must also stop the import and export of bear viscera, so that we can shut off the international trade before America's bear populations suffer the same fate as Asian bear populations.  The Bear Protection Act will do just that. It will establish national guidelines for trade in bear parts, but will not weaken any existing state laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. The outright ban on the trade, sale or barter of bear viscera, including items that claim to contain bear parts, will close the existing loopholes and will allow State and Federal wildlife officials to focus their limited resources on much needed conservation efforts.  Mr. President, let me underscore that my bill would in no way infringe on the rights of hunters to legally hunt bears. These sportsmen would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears killed during legal hunts.  The Bear Protection Act will also bolster America's efforts to curtail the international bear trade by directing the Secretaries of the Interior and State, as well as the United States Trade Representative to establish a dialogue with the counties that share our interest in conserving bear species. This, too, is an important element of the legislation because I believe efforts to both reduce the demand for bear parts in Asia and encourage the increased usage of synthetic and other natural products as an alternative to beargall should be made a priority.  Mr. President, it is important that we act now to protect the American bear population. The United States must take a stand and be an example to the rest of the world by prohibiting the illegal taking and smuggling of American bears. If we act now, we can stop the poaching of bears, which left unchecked, will lead us down a path toward these magnificent creatures' extinction. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this worthwhile legislation.  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of my legislation and additional material to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to the printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1109       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of      1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown      bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant      panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or      II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered      Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249)      (referred to in this section as ``CITES'');       (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may      adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for      trade, taking, possession, or transport of species on      Appendix I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a      resolution (Conf. 10.8) urging Parties to take immediate      action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts      and derivatives;       (3) the Asian bear populations have declined significantly      in recent years, as a result of habitat loss and poaching due      to a strong demand for bear viscera used in traditional      medicines and cosmetics;       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed      that American bears have been poached for their viscera;       (5) while most American black bear populations are      generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could      stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the      demand for bear viscera increases; and       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United      States and exportation from the United States, as well as      prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera      and products containing, or labeled or advertised as      containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the      United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear      population as a result of the commercial trade in bear      viscera.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term      viability of the world's 8 bear species by--       (1) prohibiting international trade in bear viscera and      products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing,      bear viscera;       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to      eliminate such trade; and       (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with      respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products      containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear      viscera.

SEC. 8. REPORT.       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Secretary, in cooperation with appropriate State      agencies, shall submit to the Committee on Environment and      Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of      the House of Representatives a report detailing the progress      of efforts to end the illegal trade in bear viscera.                                  ____ [From the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Jan. 18,                                  1999]           Joint Effort Tackles Poachers, Illegal Bear Trade       Luray, Virginia.--Earlier today, nearly 100 state and      federal officers arrested almost three dozen defendants      charged with more than 150 state wildlife violations.      Officers executed approximately a dozen search warrants to      further the investigation into the illegal trade of bear      parts. The action is part of the continuing investigation      Operation SOUP, or Special Operation to Uncover Poaching. The      operation is expected to yield one of the largest      prosecutions in the nation's history for crimes relating to      bear poaching and illegal trade in bear parts. Operation SOUP      is a joint effort of the Virginia     Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF), the National      Park Service, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.       Operation SOUP's three-year undercover investigation      involves a three-pronged approach targeting the      commercialization of bear parts used in the jewelry trade;      bear gall bladder and paw trafficking; and poaching by      individuals associated with specific groups suspected of      supplying bear parts. In addition to the arrests made today,      more misdemeanor and felony indictments may follow in the      weeks and months ahead as this joint effort identifies other      individuals involved in poaching and commercial trafficking      of bear parts. By working together, these government agencies      have been able to increase their manpower and resources to      combat the illegal sale of bear parts.       A major aspect of the investigation focuses on the bear      gall bladder trade. This worldwide market is driven by the      demand for its use in traditional Asian medicine. Since the      substantial decline of the Asian bear populations, the      American black bear has been targeted for this trade. One      bear gall bladder may sell overseas at auction for thousands      of dollars. Dried and ground to a fine powder it is sold by      the gram at a street value greater than cocaine.       Details of Operation SOUP will be announced at a press      conference to be held tomorrow, Tuesday, January 19, at 1 PM,      at the Shenandoah National Park administrative headquarters      on U.S. Route 211 east of Luray, Virginia and west of the      Skyline Drive.                                  ____ [From the Virginia Department of Game and Island Fisheries, Jan. 19,                                  1999]      Successful Joint Effort Tackles Poachers, Illegal Bear Trade       Luray Virginia.--On Monday, January 18, 1999, nearly 110      state and federal officers arrested 25 defendants charged      with 112 wildlife violations, and executed 14 search warrants      as part of Operation SOUP, or ``Special Operation to Uncover      Poaching''. Operation SOUP is a major, on-going, undercover      investigation into illegal hunting and commercialization of      American black bears in Virginia and in Shenandoah National      Park. This three-year investigation has been a joint      operation of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland      Fisheries, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish &      Wildlife Service. Much of the investigation has been      concentrated in the Blue Ridge region of Virginia. Upon its      completion, Operation SOUP is expected to yield one of the      largest prosecutions in the nation's history for crimes      relating to bear poaching and illegal trade in bear parts.       Operation SOUP utilizes a three-pronged approach to combat      this criminal activity. The first has targeted the sale of      bear parts, mostly claws and teeth, for use in the jewelry      trade. Sales of intact bear paws used to make ashtrays and      other trinkets also fall into this category. This      investigation has confirmed that in Virginia there is active      trade in bear parts used for jewelry. Independent of      yesterday's arrests, over the last eight months 12      individuals have been arrested and charged with 94 counts of      buying or selling bear parts in violation of state law.       The second prong of Operation SOUP has targeted trafficking      of gall bladders and frozen bear paws. This aspect of the      investigation has confirmed that significant trade in gall      bladders and bear paws out of Virginia exists, including from      bears within and around Shenandoah National Park.       To further this portion of the investigation, 11 federal      search warrants were executed in Madison and Rappanhannock      Counties in Virginia, and near Petersburg, West Virginia.      They were issued on a combination of homes, businesses and      vehicles. Seized were five vehicles, several freezers, and an      assortment of bear parts, firearms, and cash. Federal felony      indictments may be forthcoming in the weeks and months ahead.      Three arrests made on Monday have connections with      trafficking of bear parts. Additional details will be      released as they become available.       The third prong of Operation SOUP has targeted the poachers      themselves. These individuals are associated with specific      groups that are suspected of being a source of bear parts for      commercial trade. On Monday, 22 individuals were arrested and      charged with a total of 107 state wildlife violations.      Although bear may be legally taken in Virginia by legitimate      sportsmen, these individuals are accused of using illegal      hunting practices to harvest bears. Undercover investigations      in this portion of the operation indicated that some of these      individuals may also have engaged in bear poaching within      Shenandoah National Park where it is unlawful to hunt. This      is still under investigation and may result in federal      indictments for illegal hunting within the park being passed      down in the weeks or months ahead.       At the heart of Operation SOUP are concerns about an      international problem that has a toehold in Virginia. The      bear gall bladder trade is a worldwide industry driven by the      demand for its use in traditional Asian medicine. Many people      from Asian cultures believe bear parts, particularly the gall      bladder, have medicinal value for treating and preventing a      variety of ailments. A single gall bladder can be sold at      auction overseas for thousands of dollars. Dried, ground and      sold by the gram, bear gall bladders have a street value      greater than cocaine. In this operation, 300 gall bladders      were purchased or seized with an estimated U.S. value of      $75,000 and an international value of more than $3 million      dollars. Bear paws also have high commercial value. Bear paws      are purchased as an ingredient in Bear Paw Soup, considered a      delicacy in some ethnic Asian restaurants. A single bowl of      this soup can sell for hundreds of dollars overseas. The      serious decline in the Asian black bear population has lead      to the American black bear being targeted for this trade. The      government agencies behind Operation SOUP are deeply      concerned about these activities and will continue to      investigate illegal bear poaching and trafficking of bear      parts.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 16, 1999]               Bear Poaching on Rise on Shenandoah Region                     (By Maria Glod and Leef Smith)       It was early January when the call came in on Jeffrey      Pascale's unlisted phone line: The goods were available. Was      he interested?       A date was set, and Pascale agreed to meet James Presgraves      at a roadside dinner in Stanley, Va. The deal was completed      several miles away at Presgrave's home, where he allegedly      removed an assortment of bear gallbladders from the freezer      and Pascale, an undercover U.S. Park Ranger, paid him $925      for six of the golf ball-size organs.       The purchase of the bear organs was documented last month      in affidavits filed in U.S. District Court in Roanoke in      support of search warrants and signaled to the close of a      three-year state and federal investigation into what      authorities said was a highly profitable loosely organized      bear-poaching ring operating in Virginia's Blue Ridge      mountains. Instead of killing the bears just for their meat      and fur, officials said, poachers were harvesting the animals      for their paws and gallbladders, which can sell for hundreds      of dollars in this country and thousands of dollars in Asia.       No charges have been filed against Presgraves.       As bear populations dwindle in other parts of the world--     victims of excessive hunting and disappearing habitats--     poaching has become increasingly lucrative in North America,      where an estimated 400,000 bears live. Each year, hundreds of      bear carcasses turn up, intact except for missing      gallbladders, paws and claws, according to testimony given to      Congress.       Gallbladders and the green bile they store are prized in      Asia, where they are used in medicine to treat a variety of      ailments, including heart disease and hangovers. Bear paw      soup is considered a delicacy in some Asian cultures and is      sold--off the menu--in some restaurants for as much as $60 a      bowl, investigators say.       ``People are willing to pay any amount of money [for a bear      product] if they want it really bad,'' said Andrea Gaski of      the World Wildlife Fund, which monitors bear poaching.       While bear hunting is legal in Virginia, it is illegal, as      in most states, to sell the animal's body parts--including      gallbladders, heads, hides, claws or teeth. Bear hunting is      not permitted in Maryland. Last year, Congress considered,      but did not pass, legislation aimed at halting the trade in      bear organs.       In Virginia, hunters legally kill 600 to 900 bears each      hunting season. Officials say it is unclear how many more of      the population of about 4,000 bears are taken by poachers. In      the most recent investigation, law enforcement officials      seized about 300 gallbladders and arrested 25 people. They      have been charged with offenses ranging from illegally buying      wildlife parts, a felony, to misdemeanor hunting violations.      Authorities said that some of the charges stem from selling      jewelry made with bear claws or teeth, while others target      alleged traffickers in the bear organs. Officials say that      some of the parts sold in Virginia are hunted legally. The      federal investigation is continuing.       The state and federal investigation in Virginia began in      1996 when investigators began receiving tips from hunters      about poaching in and around Shenandoah National Park,      officials said.       Agents ultimately infiltrated the local ring, accompanying      poachers on hunts and posed as middlemen.       ``Some of those people were blatant enough that if you left      a business card saying, ``I want to buy gallbladders,' at a      hunting lodge, they would call you back,'' said Don      Patterson, a supervisor with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife      Service who helped lead the investigation.       According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in      Roanoke, Pascale met six times during 1997 and 1998 with      Bonnie Sue and Danny Ray Baldwin at their home in      Sperryville, Va., to purchase bear gallbladders and paws.       During the course of his investigation, according to the      affidavit filed in support of a search warrant application,      the Baldwins told Pascale they had been in business for 13      years, selling about 300 gallbladders annually to customers      in Maryland, New York and the District.       According to court records, the Baldwins said they obtained      their bear parts from several sources including hunt clubs,      farmers and orchards, as well as from the bears that Danny      Baldwin bagged by hunting or trapping.       No charges have been filed against the Baldwins.       Investigators compare the illegal trade in bear parts to      drug trafficking, saying the poachers typically work through      a middleman who delivers the gallbladders and paws to either      local or overseas Asian markets.       Nationwide, federal authorities have intercepted 70      shipments of bear parts headed to Asian markets in the past      five years, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials.       ``If you don't watch this situation and keep your fingers      on the pulse, you can quickly look at it and say, `Where did      [the bears] all go?' '' said William Woodfin, director of the      Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. ``We have      an obligation to future generations to make sure the black      bear will be there for them to enjoy.''                                  ____             Conf. 10.8--Conservation of and Trade in Bears       Aware that all populations of bear species are included      either in Appendix I or Appendix II of the Convention;       Recognizing that bears are native to Asia, Europe, North      America and South America and, therefore, the issue of bear      conservation is a global one;       Noting that the continued illegal trade in parts and      derivatives of bear species undermines the effectiveness of      the Convention and that if CITES Parties and States not-party      do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may      cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the      extirpation of certain populations or even species;       Recognizing that long-term solutions for the protection and      conservation of bears require the adoption of substantive and      measurable actions;       The Conference of the Parties to the Convention urges all      Parties, particularly bear range and consuming countries, to      take immediate action in order to demonstrably reduce the      illegal trade in bear parts and derivatives by the 11th      meeting of the Conference of the Parties, by:       (a) confirming, adopting or improving their national      legislation to control the import and export of bear parts      and derivatives, ensuring that the penalties for violations      are sufficient to deter illegal trade;       (b) increasing CITES enforcement by providing additional      resources, nationally and internationally, for wildlife trade      controls;       (c) strengthening measures to control illegal export as      well as import of bear parts and derivatives;       (d) initiating or encouraging new national efforts in key      producers and consumer countries to identify, target and      eliminate illegal markets;       (e) developing international training programmes on      enforcement of wildlife laws for field personnel, with a      specific focus on bear parts and derivatives, and exchanging      field techniques and intelligence; and       (f) developing bilateral and regional agreements for      conservation and law enforcement efforts;       Recommends that all Parties review and strengthen measures,      where necessary, to enforce the provisions of the Convention      relating to specimens of species included in Appendices I and      II, where bear parts and derivatives are concerned;       Recommends further that Parties and States not-party, as a      matter of urgency, address the issues of illegal trade in      bear parts and derivatives by:       (a) strengthening dialogue between government agencies,      industry, consumer groups and conservation organizations to      ensure that legal trade does not provide a conduit for      illegal trade in parts and derivatives of Appendix-I bears      and to increase public awareness of CITES trade controls;       (b) encouraging bear range and consumer countries that are      not party to CITES to accede to the Convention as a matter of      urgency;       (c) providing funds for research on the status of      endangered bears, especially Asian species;       (d) working with traditional-medicine communities to reduce      demand for bear parts and derivatives, including the active      promotion of research on and use of alternatives and      substitutes that do not endanger other wild species; and       (e) developing programmes in co-operation with traditional-     medicine communities and conservation organizations to      increase public awareness and industry knowledge about the      conservation concerns associated with the trade in bear      specimens and the need for stronger domestic trade controls      and conservation measures; and       Calls upon all governments and intergovernmental      organizations, international aid agencies and non-     governmental organizations to provide, as a matter of      urgency, funds and other assistance to stop the illegal trade      in bear parts and derivatives and to ensure the survival of      all bear species.                                 ______                                       By
