President, I am pleased to join Senators Kohl, Feingold, Grassley and Schumer in introducing the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act of 2007. This legislation is a continuation of a longstanding, bipartisan effort to provide consumers with more choices for medications at lower costs. Better access to affordable prescription medication is of vital importance to seniors, families, and consumers across the Nation who are struggling to keep up with the ever increasing costs of health care.  This legislation builds on the Drug Competition Act, which I authored in 2001 and which became law in 2003 in the Medicare Modernization Act. Recently, two Federal courts undermined the intent of this law; the legislation we introduce today will address that problem. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act will result in lower prescription drug costs for all Americans by preventing a pernicious practice in which brand-name pharmaceutical companies pay other drug companies not to produce and market generic drugs--which can be 80 percent less expensive than their brand-name counterparts--as part of private patent settlement agreements.  The Hatch-Waxman Act was intended to facilitate the entry of lower-cost generic drugs into the market, making medication more affordable, while protecting patent rights to foster innovation. It created a process, known as the Abbreviated New Drug Application, ANDA, to speed approval of generics. Under ANDA, an applicant can receive expedited approval from the FDA to market a generic product. An applicant using ANDA may certify that the manufacturing of its new drug will either not infringe on a previously patented drug on which it is based, or that the existing patent is invalid. After certifying an ANDA, the generic applicant must give notice to the patent-holder, at which point the patent-holder has 45 days to file a patent infringement against the applicant.  More times than not, disputes over an ANDA are resolved through private settlements. Unfortunately, theunderpinnings of these private settlements are becoming more and more questionable; drug companies are abusing Hatch-Waxman provisions, and using settlement opportunities to limit consumer choices and keep consumer prices artificially high. The FTC had been policing these deals to ensure they were not anticompetitive until two recent appellate court decisions limited it's role.  Hatch-Waxman created a good framework for promoting innovation while speeding the market entry of affordable drugs. The trend of anticompetitive agreements between brand-name pharmaceutical companies and generic companies to delay entry into the market is a troubling abuse of that good law. Some drug firms have colluded to pad their profits by forcing consumers to pay higher prices than they would pay for lower-cost generics. Congress never intended for brand-name drug companies to be able to grease the palms of generic companies by paying them not to produce generic medicines.  Rarely do we have such a clear-cut opportunity as this to remove obvious impediments that prevent the marketplace from working as it should--to the benefit of consumers. Congress should seize this opportunity and enact legislation that plainly makes anticompetitive deals, such as those I have outlined, illegal.  The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act will accomplish this goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this timely and needed legislation.                                 ______                                       By
