 President, in 1965--30 years ago this week--in Independence, MO, Medicare was signed by President Lyndon Johnson, with Harry Truman looking on.  Over the last 30 years, Medicare has become one of the largest public health insurance systems in the world, having grown from 19 million seniors at a cost of $3 billion to 37 billion seniors costing over $159 billion last year.  In 1995--30 years later--Medicare is at a turning point.  In fact, some would say the Medicare is under attack, because Medicare is slated for $270 million in cuts over the next 7 years under plans which are scheduled to be enacted later this year.  This proposed 14 percent cut in Medicare spending is the largest Medicare ever proposed and makes up over 20 percent of the $1.2 billion in cuts in the Republican resolution.                        the benefits of medicare  While there are many disagreements about which direction Medicare should go in the future, there is no doubt about the benefits and achievements of the current program.  Before Medicare was enacted in 1965, health care for seniors was expensive and often unavailable, due to the lack of insurers willing to cover seniors and the fact that, even with Social Security, seniors have been one of the highest-poverty age groups in America.  Only 50 percent of seniors had health insurance, and so an illness could quickly force a senior into a charity ward or consume a lifetime of family savings.  In comparison, the benefits of the current Medicare program are clear to millions of individuals and the families of those who are enrolled; health coverage is provided for 37 million seniors--including 3.6 million Californians.  Ninety-nine percent of the elderly population is covered through Medicare, giving seniors the highest rate of health coverage for any age group in the United States;  The average lifespan for older Americans has increased 3 years since Medicare began, and quality of life has been improved by procedures and treatments such as hip replacements developed through Medicare.                        problems facing medicare  Nonetheless, there are some clear problems with Medicare that must be addressed, including; the anticipated bankruptcy of the Medicare Part A Hospital Trust Fund, which is projected to occur in the year 2002 at current spending rates; high annual increases in spending of 10 percent, which have helped cause the program to go from $3 billion in 1965 to $160 billion in 1994; fraud and abuse that eat up $44 billion in total health care costs annually, according to a GAO report, and result in $140 million in excess charges paid by consumers each year; the lack of potentially cost-saving managed Medicare, which enrolls only 10 percent of Medicare participants even though additional dental and prescription drug benefits are sometimes available (the rate is 25 percent in California).  In short, the current Medicare Program pays out much more in benefits than it is taking in from premiums and payroll contributions. Without reform, Medicare will continue to grow out of control. Costs for new technologies and procedures continue to increase rapidly, and about 1 million additional Medicare participants each year will add to costs.                      reasonable medicare reforms  To address these problems and lower Federal spending, I support a number of tough-minded Medicare reforms, including tightening controls and preventing fraud in Medicare; using successful State and Federal models such as the California Public Employee Retirement System [CalPERS] and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan as a basis for cooperative, market-based systems. I support asking the wealthiest Medicare recipients to pay more into the system than they do now; making managed care plans more beneficial to the Federal Government and more easily available to seniors, only 10 percent of whom are currently enrolled in HMO's.  To help solve these problems, I voted in favor of $54 billion in Medicare cuts and reforms contained in the 1993 budget reconciliation bill, and I supported national health care reform such as the mainstream coalition proposal.       republican budget proposals cut medicare too far, too fast  However, I strongly oppose destructive Medicare reform proposals that go too far, too fast, without any certainty as to the results, including those that would force all Medicare enrollees to change doctors, give up their choice of doctors, or join HMO's involuntarily; steeply raise Medicare cots to participants, who already spend a national average of 21 percent of their incomes on health costs; rely almost entirely on appealing but untested changes to the current Medicare system, such as private vouchers and medical savings accounts; target the 3.6 million Californians who participate in Medicare for an unfair share of the deficit-reduction burden.  As a result, I voted against the Republican budget resolution, which cuts $270 billion from the current baseline for Medicare over the next 7 years.                    unknown effects of medicare cuts  What exactly do health care cuts of this size really mean? Well, no one really knows, but health care experts tell us that the options for cuts of this size are few, and estimates by the Health Care Finance Agency, which runs these programs, have projected dramatic effects.  Under the Republican budget proposal--and the initiatives that are being considered for enactment later this fall--more will be taken out of seniors' Social Security checks, because that is where the Medicare part B premium is deducted. Medicare premiums and Social Security checks are linked together because under the integrated Social Security check-issuing system, Medicare premiums are automatically taken out of Social Security checks.  Cuts to Californians on Medicare would total over $36 billion over the next 7 years--13 percent of the $270 billion total cut despite the fact that California only has 9.5 percent of the total population--Health Care Finance Administration.  Costs to seniors will have to be steeply increased, even though over 80 percent of Medicare goes to seniors with less than $25,000 in income, who already pay over 20 percent of their income for health costs.  Managed care could be implemented on a large scale without any real assurance that there will be more benefits to seniors and increased savings to the Federal Government. The current demonstration of managed Medicare has not yielded savings to the Federal Government, according to recent studies.  Popular but untested ideas such as private voucher systems and medical savings accounts, which have not been tried at anywhere near this scale, could once again allow insurance companies to discriminate against older, sicker seniors, or force families to spend their savings in order to provide care.  Relatively small-scale purchasing pools, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, which covers only 9 million people nationwise, will be expanded enormously without any clear knowledge of the potential effects on care for the elderly.                               Conclusion  There is no argument that Medicare needs to be strengthened and improved, and I have supported reasonable Medicare reform in the past. But cutting $270 billion out of the program and implementing reforms that have yet to be tested is not really reform, it's dismantling the program.  The effects of cuts on this scale may not be felt immediately, and the plans for how to achieve them are certainly being kept under wraps until the last minute, but sooner or later it will be clear that cutting $270 billion out of Medicare goes too far, too fast.  I only hope it is not too late to save the program before the American people realize it, and that 30 years from now this Congress is known for having reformed but not reduced the Medicare Program that has gotten us so far.                          ____________________
