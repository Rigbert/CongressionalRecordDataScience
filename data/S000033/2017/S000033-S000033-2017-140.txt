  I live 50 miles away from Canada, and in many cases they pay 50 percent less for the same exact medicine that we buy in Vermont or in America, and we all know the reason why. The power and wealth of the pharmaceutical industry and their 1300 lobbyists and unlimited sums of money have bought the U.S. Congress. Let's be clear about it.  Today Mr. Trump--a guy I don't quote very often--said that pharma gets away with murder. That is what Trump said. He is right. Year after year, the same old, same old takes place. We get amendments like Senator Alexander's, and the pharmaceutical industry makes more and more money, and the American people pay higher and higher prices.  The time has come for us to stand up to the drug companies. Let's do it tonight. Let's defeat the Alexander amendment. Let's support the Klobuchar-Sanders amendment.  Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
