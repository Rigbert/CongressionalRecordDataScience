Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Unfortunately, the Department of Transportation disagrees. We sent this language to them, and they said, yes, it appears, by repealing 23 USC 319, the amendment would remove the Secretary's authority to approve, as part of the construction of Federal aid highways, the costs of landscape and roadside development, including acquisition and development of publiclyowned and controlled rest and recreation areas and sanitary and other facilities reasonably necessary to accommodate the traveling public.  So I am pleased that it was not her intention. But, according to DOT, this amendment would do that, and that would be very deleterious to the traveling public. So I would oppose the amendment, as drafted.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), as modified.  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
