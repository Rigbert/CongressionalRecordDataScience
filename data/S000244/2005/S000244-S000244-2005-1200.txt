Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of House Resolution 210 is to congratulate the World Intellectual Property Organization, commonly referred to as WIPO, for its work and to support the goals of World Intellectual Property Day, which include teaching the importance of intellectual property as a tool foreconomic, social, and cultural development.  WIPO is considered the most important international organization for the promotion of intellectual property.  Among its other responsibilities, WIPO administers those treaties known as the Berne and the Paris conventions to protect intellectual property globally. The United States is a WIPO member.  Five years ago, WIPO member states celebrated the founding of the organization by establishing World Intellectual Property Day. April 26, 1970, is the date on which the convention that created WIPO took effect.  House Resolution 210 commemorates the achievements of WIPO and its designation of April 26, 2005, as World Intellectual Property Day for the current year.  I support the resolution and urge other Members to do so as well.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
