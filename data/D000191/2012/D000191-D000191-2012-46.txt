  Mr. DeFAZIO. The clock is ticking. Six days from today, an incompetent, ideological Board of Governors in the United States Postal Service intends to close thousands of post offices and processing centers, degrading service and denying access for millions of individual Americans, especially seniors, veterans, small business owners, and others. And what's the reaction of the Republican leadership in the House? Nothing. Silence.  We were in session until 1 o'clock in the morning voting on imaginary amendments to a bill that's not going anywhere, but they can't bestir themselves to bring forward a bill to save this critical institution. The Senate has acted. Their bill is not perfect, but it's better than inaction in face of the wrecking crew that is governing our postal services.  I urge my colleagues to support my bill, cosponsor my bill, H.R. 3591, put the postal service on a sustainable path toward a 21st century postal service, modernized and self-sufficient. But inaction and indifference will destroy this critical institution.                          ____________________
