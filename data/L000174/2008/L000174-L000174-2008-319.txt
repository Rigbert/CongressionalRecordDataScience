President, with the enactment of bipartisan Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, reform legislation late last year, Congress demanded and won more openness and accountability in monitoring the activities of our Government. But, regrettably, just weeks after this historic open government legislation was signed into law, there are troubling signs from the Bush administration regarding how this law will be enforced.  Last week, the President buried a provision in the administration's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal that would move the functions of the new Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, which was created under the OPEN Government Act, from the independent National Archives and Records Administration to the Department of Justice. The President's proposal is not only contrary to the express intent of the Congress, but contrary to the very purpose of this legislation--to ensure the timely and fair resolution of American's FOIA requests.  The Office of Government Information Services was established to, among other things, mediate FOIA disputes between Federal agencies and FOIA requestors, review and evaluate agency FOIA compliance and house the newly established FOIA ombudsman. When Senator Cornyn and I drafted the OPEN Government Act, we intentionally placed this critical office in the National Archives, so that OGIS would be free from the influence of the Federal agency that litigates FOIA disputes--the Department of Justice. We also placed OGIS in the apolitical National Archives to enhance this office's independence, so that all Americans can be confident that their FOIA requests would be addressed openly and fairly.  Given the clear intent of Congress to establish OGIS as an independent office in the National Archives, the President's budget proposal should not--and cannot--go unchallenged. What's more, given the Justice Department's own abysmal record on FOIA compliance--a recent Bureau of National Affairs Daily Report for Executives article found that the Justice Department's Office of Information Policy is burdened by increasing FOIA backlogs--it is simply unfathomable that this agency would be entrusted with overseeing the processing of American's FOIA requests.  When the Congress unanimously passed the OPEN Government Act just a couple months ago, Democrats and Republicans alike joined together in promising the American people a more open and transparent government. I intend to work to ensure that that this was not an empty promise, but one that will be honored and fulfilled.  I call on all Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers, to join with me to ensure that the Office of Government Information Services is promptly established and fully funded within the National Archives. The American people have waited for more than a decade for this office and for the other historic FOIA reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act. They should not be forced to wait any longer.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from a coalition of more than 40 different open government organizations that strongly oppose moving the Office of Government Information Services to the Department of Justice be printed in the Record.  Congress must work to beat back the administration's ill-advised attempts to undermine the intent of Congress in a bill that this President signed into law. In the coming weeks and months, I will be working with other advocates of FOIA in the Senate to do just that.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 6, 2008.     Hon. Robert C. Byrd, Chairman     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran: We are      writing to express our concern that the Bush Administration's      proposed FY 2009 budget attempts to repeal a section of law      and shift funding for a new Office of Government Information      Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records      Administration (NARA) to the Department of Justice (DOJ).      President Bush signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in      our National Government Act (OPEN Government Act), which      creates OGIS at NARA, a mere five weeks ago. We urge you to      ensure the President's budget reflects congressional intent      and the explicit mandate of the statute as the budgetary      process unfolds.       Currently, the president's budget proposes: ``The      Department of Justice shall carry out the responsibilities of      the office established in 5 U.S.C. 552(h), from amounts made      available in the Department of Justice appropriation for      General Administration Salaries and Expenses. In addition,      subsection (h) of section 552 of title 5, United States Code,      is hereby repealed, and subsections (i) through (I) are      redesignated (h) through (k). (Commerce, Justice, and Related      Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008.)'' (Section 519 of Title V      of the Department of Commerce; p. 239 of the Appendix)       The OPEN Government Act (P.L. 110-175) established OGIS      specifically at NARA. It did so as a result of congressional      findings that interests promoted by the Freedom of      Information Act (FOIA), as well as American traditions and      ideals regarding the value of an informed citizenry and the      legitimacy of representative government, were being      insufficiently served by the existing system of agency      practices and implementation, in which DOJ has been the lead      agency for 30 years. Additionally, since it is the      responsibility of the Department to defend its government-     agency clients in litigation brought by requestors, there is      a built-in conflict of interest in vesting DOJ with      responsibilities to resolve FOIA disputes informally and to      hold agencies accountable for FOIA implementation. Congress      specifically directed the creation of an ombudsman office      apart from the Department of Justice for mediation of      contested requests, thus reducing the amount, and concomitant      costs, of litigation--burdens whose reduction would be      beneficial to all. The new office, established with strong      bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress, also has the      critical mandate to evaluate agency implementation of FOIA      with a disinterested eye.       We strongly oppose this effort to use the budget process to      rewrite the law, undermining congressional intent and      flouting a specific statutory mandate. We urge you to      appropriate necessary funds to establish the Office of      Government Information Services in the National Archives and      Records Administration, as your legislation wisely requires,      and, to reinforce the intent of the OPEN Government Act,      reject Section 519 of the proposed budget.
