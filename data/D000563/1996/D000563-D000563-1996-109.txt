Chairman, I greatly respect the gentlewoman from California and have the same admiration for her legislative record as she does for mine.  Having said that though, we make a point of saying, for example, we are going to have drug-free school zones, gun-free school zones. We single out certain areas of vulnerability. The gentlewoman knows, as I do, many of the families in public housing today are terrorized by drug gangs and violent criminals who prey upon children and families that need extra protection. That is the reason for this amendment.
