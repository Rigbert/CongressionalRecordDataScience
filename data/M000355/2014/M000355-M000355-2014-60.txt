  U.S. Air Force SSgt Daniel N. Fannin, of Morehead, KY, was killed in the crash of his reconnaissance plane near Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan on April 27, 2013. It was just a few weeks after his 30th birthday.  For his service in uniform, Staff Sergeant Fannin received several medals, awards, and declarations, including the National Defense Service Ribbon, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Achievement Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and the Bronze Star.  Daniel's mother Sharri Jones recalls this of her son:       Daniel flew on this Earth as an airman. His faith has      earned him angel wings now. He died serving others, serving      his country, and serving God. This mother is blessed.  Daniel grew up in Morehead and attended Rowan County Senior High School, from which he graduated in 2001. He enlisted in the Air Force shortly after graduation and at the time of his death was a 12-year veteran.  Daniel's mother Sharri remembers:       I frequently told Daniel he was my hero. Benjamin Disraeli      said, ``The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name      and the inheritance of a great example.''       These words epitomize my son. His name will be remembered,      and his works are indeed great examples. He was then, and      will forever be, my hero.  Daniel's mother Sharri continues:       I used to tell Daniel that it didn't matter what he did as      a career in life, but I expected him to be the best that he      could be, no matter if he was a ditch digger or a CEO. He did      me proud by doing just that. He was the best man that he      could possibly be.  As Daniel grew up, he had to learn how to do chores such as laundry, cleaning, and cooking. Sharri's mother said:       Like all kids do, he complained constantly, and sometimes      it was a battle getting him to do those things. I was      fortunate enough to get to attend his Air Force basic      training graduation ceremony in San Antonio. During liberty,      he took me aside and said: ``Mom, I want to thank you.'' I      said: ``What for, son?'' He said: ``For making me do all of      those things you made me do, like laundry. It sure made      things a lot easier for me here. Some of these guys didn't      even know how to turn a washer on!''  Daniel was an avid reader from his early childhood. ``The hardest form of punishment for him was not to allow him to read,'' says his mother Sharri. Daniel's wife Sonya Fannin certainly agreed. ``He could read a 400-page book in a day or less,'' she says.  Daniel met Sonya while stationed in Oklahoma City. Sonya says:       One of my favorite stories to tell was that on our first      date he went to the flower shop to pick a bouquet. He spent      hours in the shop, he said, before finally picking two dozen      white roses. When he presented them at the door, Danny didn't      know that those were my favorite flowers, but that was the      moment I knew.  Daniel loved to go camping, hiking, biking, and fishing. He loved the outdoors. On his and Sonya's 5-year anniversary trip to Maui, Danny's favorite activity was a submarine ride 170 feet below sea level. He liked to say he had been to the depths of the ocean and flown to the highest heights after that trip.  Daniel was assigned to the Air Force's 552nd Operations Support Squadron at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. He was an airborne sensor operator and a qualified Air Force air surveillance instructor who served with distinction at Tinker Air Force Base.  In his dozen years of service, Daniel deployed on three tours as an E-3 AWACS, or airborne warning and control system, aircraft surveillance technician. He was also an MC-12 sensor operator. While in Afghanistan, Daniel was assigned to the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron as a member of the 451st Air Expeditionary Wing at Kandahar Air Base.  His mother said:       After his death, multiple superior officers have told me      how respected he was, how well Daniel performed his duties,      and that he was exceptional at mentoring young airmen      personally as he was professionally. Daniel was a very devout      man. Many have said that he led them to Christ or reconnected      them with the Lord.  His wife Sonya agrees:       He was a Christian man of Christian values and morals. He      served God in all that he did.  Daniel also liked to laugh and joke with his family and friends. Sonya says:       He went by many nicknames; ``Dan the man,'' ``Fan Dannin,''      and my dad's favorite, ``Lieutenant Dan.'' My dad would      always ask, ``Lieutenant Dan, have you flown much lately?''      Danny would stick his arms out to each side and say he had      been flying as much as he could.  After Daniel's death, at a park located near Tinker Area Force Base, where he had been stationed, Daniel's legacy was honored with a replica E-3 AWACS aircraft dedicated in his honor in a ceremony in April of this year. Inscribed on the tail of the E-3 replica honoring Daniel are the words ``Service Before Self,'' one of the Air Force's core values those who knew Daniel knew he lived by.  Sonya Fannin was present for the dedication to her husband, and she spoke to the crowd of about 300. She said:       This memorializes Daniel's very essence, his giving spirit      in a way which those in the public can see. Memorializing      Danny here in the public park, a place in which our civilian      friends and family can visit and heal on their own time, is      truly special.  Daniel's family members and friends are foremost in our thoughts as I recount this story for my Senate colleagues today. They include his wife Sonya Fannin, his mother Sharri Jones, his grandparents Henry and Fern Hamm, and many other beloved family members and friends.  I would like to close with some words from Daniel's mother Sharri about her son. Here is what she said:       I know that there are many who continue to grieve deeply      over Daniel's passing. To them I would say, take the things      that Daniel shared with you, learn from them, and pass them      forward. Give others what he gave you. In that way, he will      live forever.  I couldn't agree more with such a heartfelt sentiment.  I would like the family of SSgt Daniel Fannin to know that Members of the Senate do indeed recognize the things Daniel gave to his country-- namely, his service, his life, and his sacred honor. We will be forever grateful.                          ____________________
