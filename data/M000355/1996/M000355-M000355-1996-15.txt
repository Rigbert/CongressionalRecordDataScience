 President, in the United States, there are 571 Federal wildlife refuges. There is only one State that doesn't have any, and that, unfortunately, is the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  To look at a couple of States that are comparable in the size of population to my State, Oklahoma has 9, Louisiana has 16, Alabama has 7.  Mr. President, it is pretty clear that Kentucky, when it comes to Federal wildlife refuges, has not been treated properly down through the years. I have been working on this issue since 1989. I introduced the first bill to create the first Federal wildlife refuge in Kentucky. It is not easy to find appropriate spots in the east. Many of our friends out west have more public land than they want. But in the east, it is not so.  We isolated--``we,'' working with the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--identified an area in Kentucky that makes sense. I introduced a bill which was reported out of the Environment and Public Works committee to authorize this refuge. It is my hope that the Interior appropriations bill will include both the authorization and appropriation to begin the acquisition.  Let me just say that no land will be condemned under this proposal. Only land will be purchased from willing sellers. That is a little bit different from the way some Federal wildlife refuges have been created. As a result of that, there is very minor opposition in our State to the creation of our first Federal wildlife refuge.  My dear colleague from Kentucky earlier today took to the floor to point out that this was not needed, and that we had another facility called the Land Between the Lakes--which is operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority; it is a wonderful facility; a wonderful place--but that it really needed the money; and, if he were given the opportunity to do so, would offer an amendment to take the money away from the Federal wildlife refuge and give it to the Land Between the Lakes.  Mr. President, the Land Between the Lakes has already been given all the money they asked for. I am on the appropriations Subcommittee of Energy and Water which receives the request. We gave them all they asked for. They may ask for more someplace down the road, and it may be appropriate to give them more someplace down the road. But I do not think, particularly in these tight times, that it makes sense to throw money at a group, or a project, or an activity that is not asking for it.  So, if this amendment is offered at some subsequent time, obviously I am going to oppose it. I find it somewhat astonishing that my colleague would find it inappropriate for Kentucky to finally--it came into the Union in 1792--to finally have a Federal wildlife refuge.  It was suggested by my colleague that this was an incredibly controversial proposal. In fact, it is just the opposite. There are few who may oppose it, although if they own land in the area and don't want to sell they don't have to. And a wildlife refuge is a good neighbor. If you do not want to sell, it is a great neighbor to have right next to you. There is nothing that would keep any landowner in this area from keeping this property forever in this proposal.  There are 57 conservation groups and sportsmen from Kentucky who support this.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, Mr. President.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Organizations That Have Endorsed the Creation of the Kentucky National                             Wildlife Refuge       Appalachia Science in the Public Interest.

Mr. President, my colleague made reference to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and said that was a bunch of ``foreigners'' and didn't have a presence in Kentucky. He might want to know that there are several thousand supporters of this group in Kentucky. Just because it is called the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation does not mean it does not have a lot of Kentucky members. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Kentucky State chairman of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,                                Bowling Green, KY, March 19, 1996.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Please accept this letter as my      support of your intention to propose legislation that would      establish and fund the Clark's River National Wildlife Refuge      in Western Kentucky. I sincerely appreciate your efforts to      establish this area as Kentucky's first National Wildlife      Refuge.       I am the Kentucky State Chairman for the Rocky Mountain Elk      Foundation. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation is one of the      cooperating partners that have helped to establish the Elk      and Bison Prairie at TVA's Land Between the Lakes.      Additionally, I am the Co-Chairman for the fund raising      committee charged with the effort of raising $244,000 for the      first phases of this very important project at Land Between      the Lakes. I am very happy to report to you that this project      is not even open to the public yet and we have already raised      $222,000 toward our goal. However, I certainly see a      distinction and a need for you to create Kentucky's first      National Wildlife Refuge at the East Fork of the Clark's      River. As you are aware, the NWR site evaluation team      determined that not only did this site best fit the Untied      States Fish and Wildlife Services biological and feasibility      criteria, this area was deemed most worthy of perpetual      protection from degradation and development that would be      afforded by establishment of a refuge.       I am certainly one of the strongest supporters of LBL and      am aware of the budget problems that this agency faces. I can      assure you, as State Chairman for the RMEF that I donate      hundreds of hours of my time in support of LBL and the Elk      and Bison Prairie project. The bottom line is both of these      projects are very worthy projects and both of these projects      are worthy of your support, but in my opinion, the creation      of Kentucky's first National Wildlife Refuge should be      established at the Clark's River.       I would be happy to discuss this issue with you personally      if you should have any other questions.       Working for Wildlife.           Sincerely,                                                  Thomas M. Baker,                                          Kentucky State Chairman.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in addition to that we worked with the Kentucky Farm Bureau. They typically don't endorse these kinds of projects. But what is interesting to note is that they chose not to oppose this one, and the reason they chose not to is because we worked with them on the ``willing seller provision'' so that nobody involved in agriculture in this area would be required to sell. It is very important to me that we protect farmers property rights.  Mr. President, with regard to the Land Between the Lakes, which my colleague would give more funding than they asked for by taking it away from the Federal wildlife refuge, I would like to place in the Record a letter from the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Mr. Craven Crowell, who said, ``I want to express my sincere appreciation for your support for TVA's fiscal year 1997 budget. You played a significant role in achieving our goals.''  In other words, with regard to LBL, TVA got everything it wanted.  In addition to that, Mr. President, I would like to also have printed in the Record a letter I received yesterday from William Kennoy, who is the Director of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and a Kentuckian, who also confirms that the Land Between the Lakes operated by TVA was given all they asked for in this year's budget.  I ask unanimous consent that it, along with the letters from Mr. Crowell and the Kentucky Farm Bureau, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     Kentucky Farm                                             Bureau Federation                                   Louisville, KY, April 20, 1996.     Mr. Don Overby,     President, Calloway County Farm Bureau, Almo, KY.       Dear Donnie: This is to acknowledge and thank you and      Calloway County for your attendance and participation in the      Measure the Candidate training session held April 8. Also, I      wanted to reply to your question on the proposed Clarks River      National Wildlife Refuge.       As I had mentioned, Laura Knoth has been working diligently      with Senator McConnell's staff to ensure Farm Bureau's policy      is contained in the language of the proposed legislation.      Specifically, language which protects farmer's property      rights. The following provisions, your Farm bureau policy,      have been successfully integrated into S. 1611, ``The      Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge Authorization Act:''       Section 2:6 . . . the refuge should not restrict      agricultural and silvicultural activities on private lands.       Section 6C(I) no activity carried out in the refuge will      result in the obstruction of the flow of water so as to      affect any private land adjacent to the refuge; and       (ii) no buffer zone regulating any land use (other than      hunting and fishing) is established.       On March 28, the Environment and Public Works Committee      passed S. 1611 by unanimous consent. As of this date, it has      not been placed on the Senate calendar to receive floor      action.       Donnie, I have also enclosed for your review a copy of a      letter from Tom Bennett, Commissioner, Kentucky Department of      Fish and Wildlife Resources, which outlines significant and      unique criteria the Clarks River possesses for the proposed      wildlife refuge. I am hopeful that his information is      helpful. If you have any further questions, please do not      hesitate to contact Laura, or myself.           Sincerely,                                           Timothy A. Cansler,                                        Director, National Affairs     and Political Education.                                                                    ____                                       Tennessee Valley Authority,                                Knoxville, TN, September 13, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I want to express my sincere appreciation for      your support of TVA's fiscal year 1997 budget. You played a      significant role in achieving our goals.       We will wisely manage these funds for the benefit of the      people of the Tennessee Valley. We hope you will be pleased      with the results.       Thank you for being a good friend to TVA.       With warm regards,     Craven Crowell.                                                                    ____                                       Tennessee Valley Authority,                                Knoxville, TN, September 18, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Yesterday an article appeared in      the Paducah Sun referring to a letter I sent Congressman      Whitfield on funding for LBL. The letter was inadvertently      faxed without my authorization or signature.       The level of funding provided in the Energy and Water      Conference report will fully meet TVA and LBL requirements      that we have requested of Congress.       I am in the process of preparing an inventory of the needs      of LBL's infrastructure for the next few years but this is      not yet complete and we have, therefore, made no request to      Congress for this future funding.       I understand TVA Chairman Crowell recently wrote you      expressing his appreciation for your support for TVA's Budget      and noted the ``significant role you played in achieving our      goals.'' You have been a strong supporter of TVA and we have      no desire to jeopardize that relationship because of      inaccurate comments through miscommunications. We appreciate      your dedication to LBL over the years.           Sincerely,                                           William H. Kennoy, P.E.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that it is unusual, to say the least, for two Senators from the same State to differ on projects of this matter. I am sorry that seems to be the case here. But let me say in conclusion and in summary that there are 571 Federal wildlife refuges in the Nation but not one in Kentucky. We are long overdue for our first Federal wildlife refuge. This proposal was developed over a number of years in cooperation with the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Service, and over 57 sportsmen and conservation groups from across Kentucky feel that this great need should be met.  No land under this proposal will be taken from anyone--only from willing sellers. It is my hope, Mr. President, that this proposal authorizing and appropriating some money to begin Kentucky's first Federal wildlife refuge will be a part of the Interior appropriations bill.  I hope my colleague will not offer an amendment to strip out the money provided--whatever money is ultimately provided--for this first Federal wildlife refuge in order to give it to the Tennessee Valley Authority which says it does not need it.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
