Recently, a new Senator, Al Franken, came to my office the day after he was sworn in, and we talked about his adjustment to the Senate. He talked to me about his concern about the first three votes he cast in the Senate, that he was pushed in quickly and had to make decisions and didn't have a chance to reflect as he would have liked to reflect on those votes. I said to him that I understood that, but after he has been in the Senate for a while--or the House for that matter--and he has cast many votes, he would realize that some are more important than others.  This is an important vote. It is not the most important vote a Member of the Senate can cast--a vote for a nomination of the Supreme Court. I would argue the most important vote you cancast is whether America goes to war because if the decision is made in the affirmative, as it has been, people will die. I can't think of anything more compelling than that vote.  But this ranks a close second in terms of the impact it will have.
