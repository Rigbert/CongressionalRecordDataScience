President, I inadvertently neglected to ask that a copy of legislation I introduced with Senators Dodd and Simon be printed in the October 3, 1996, Congressional Record.  I request that this bill, the Human Tissues Safety Act of 1996, be printed in the Congressional Record to be dated October 21, 1996.  The bill follows:                                S. 2195       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. HUMAN TISSUE.       (a) In General.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and      Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end      the following:       ``(hh)(1) The term `human tissue' means a collection of      similar human cells which--       ``(A) is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure,      mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease or      condition in a human or for reproduction;       ``(B) achieves its primary intended purpose through repair      or replacement of bodily tissue by structural support or      cellular function;       ``(C) may have been propagated or otherwise processed      before use;       ``(D) may be combined with substances that are safe under      conditions of intended use and not intended to provide a      therapeutic effect; and       ``(E) includes reproductive tissue, demineralized bone,      heart valves, dura mater, and manipulated autologous cells.       ``(2) The term `human tissue' does not include vascularized      human organs, gene therapy, blood, soluble blood components,      milk, or products made by combining human tissue with      biomaterials.       ``(3) Human tissue is not a drug, biological product, or      device unless reclassified by the Secretary pursuant to      section 352A of the Public Health Service Act.''       (b) Regulation of Human Tissue.--Subpart 1 of part F of      title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following section:                      ``regulation of human tissue       ``Sec. 352A. (a) Subject to Regulation.--       ``(1) In general.--Human tissue shall be subject to      regulation under this section only if the Secretary publishes      a finding in the Federal Register, after a hearing before the      Commissioner, that voluntary regulation under generally      accepted scientific standards is inadequate to protect the      public health with respect to any particular type of human      tissue or human tissue generally.       ``(2) Exception.--Human tissue shall not be subject to      regulation as a drug, biological product, or device unless it      is reclassified under subsection (f).       ``(b) Registration.--       ``(1) In general.--Any person subject to regulation under      this section who recovers, processes, stores, or distributes      human tissue for transplantation or implantation in the      United States shall register in accordance with the      registration procedures established for drugs under section      510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Such      registration shall contain the name of the person, the      location of its facilities, a list of the types of human      tissue recovered, processed, stored, or distributed by such      person, and a brief description of the basic method or      methods of processing of such tissue.       ``(2) Authorized activities.--A person registered in      accordance with paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be      authorized to conduct human tissue recovery, processing,      storage, and distribution activities as identified in the      applicable registration unless--       ``(A)(i) the Secretary determines, upon inspection, that      such person fails to meet applicable operating standards      under subsection (c);       ``(ii) the Secretary notifies such person of a      determination under clause (i), advises the person of the      steps necessary to meet such standards, and provides the      person with a reasonable opportunity to establish compliance      with the standards;       ``(iii) the Secretary determines, after an opportunity for      an informal hearing, that the person has failed to establish      compliance as provided for in clause (ii) within the      applicable period and such failure constitutes a threat to      the public health; and       ``(iv) the Secretary suspends or revokes the authority to      conduct such activities;       ``(B) the Secretary determines, after an opportunity for an      informal hearing, that such person has failed to comply with      any patient registry or other retrospective patient data      requirement, and the Secretary suspends or revokes the      authority to conduct such activities; or       ``(C) the Secretary determines that such person presents an      immediate or substantial danger to the public health, and the      Secretary suspends or revokes the authority to conduct such      activities, in which case an informal hearing shall be      conducted within 5 business days of the date of such      suspension or revocation.       ``(c) Operating Standards.--The Secretary may establish,      after notice and opportunity for comment, operating standards      for human tissue that shall be limited to the following      general requirements for the recovery, processing, storage,      and shipment of human tissue.       ``(1) Requirements for infection control designed to      prevent transmission of disease.       ``(2) Requirements for processing practices that assure the      safety of, and prevent damage to, human tissue.       ``(3) Requirements for labeling and recordkeeping to      identify the type of tissue and any added foreign substance      and to permit tracing.       ``(d) Labeling and Advertising.--Statements made in      labeling, advertising or promotional materials regarding      clinical benefit with respect to human tissue shall consist      only of accurate and balanced representations that are      consistent with sound scientific information, including      current data from a registry required or established under      subsection (e), if available.       ``(e) Registry.--A person registered under subsection (b)      may be required by the Secretary to maintain a patient      registry or meet other retrospective patient data      requirements if, after notice and an opportunity for comment,      the Secretary determines that such tissue has been      commercially available within the United States for a period      of less than 5 years and that such data requirement is      necessary to protect the public health.       ``(f) Reclassifications.--       ``(1) Human tissue.--The Secretary may reclassify a      particular type of human tissue as     a drug, biological product or device if, after notice and an      opportunity for comment, the Secretary determines that--       ``(A) with respect to the particular type of human tissue--       ``(i) the tissue is subject to a patient registry or other      retrospective data requirement under which the collection of      information has been required for at least 5 years (or such      other time period as agreed to by the Secretary and the      registered person); and       ``(ii) the information received from such patient registry      or other retrospective data requirement is insufficient to      confirm the safety and clinical benefit from the use of such      tissue; or       ``(B) a particular type of human tissue should be      reclassified because it presents an imminent hazard to public      health.       ``(2) Upon secretarial action.--The Secretary may      reclassify a human drug, biological product or medical device      as human tissue if the Secretary determines, after notice and      an opportunity for comment, that such previous classification      is not necessary to protect public health.       ``(3) Upon petition.--The Secretary may reclassify a drug,      biological product, medical device, or human tissue upon the      petition of the sponsor of such drug, biological product or      device, or the registered person for such human tissue, if,      after notice and an opportunity to comment, the Secretary      finds that such reclassification is consistent with the      protection of public health.       ``(g) Enforcement.--       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that any      person has violated any provision of this section or any      regulations promulgated under this section, and the Secretary      determines that the violation constitutes a significant risk      to the public health, the Secretary may issue an order that      such person cease distribution of human tissue, or that human      tissue recovered, processed, stored or distributed by such      person be retained, recalled, or destroyed. After receipt of      such an order, the person in possession of the human tissue      shall not distribute or dispose of the human tissue in any      manner inconsistent with the provisions of the order.       ``(2) Hearing.--A person subject to the order under      paragraph (1) may obtain an informal hearing regarding the      order if the person requests such a hearing not later than 5      days after receiving the order. If the person does make such      a request within such period, the Secretary shall conduct the      hearing within 30 days after receiving the request and      shall issue an order not later than 15 days after the      hearing is conducted. Such order shall be considered a      final order of the Secretary.       ``(h) Inspection.--Each person registered under subsection      (b) shall be subject to inspection under section 704 of the      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Secretary may, with      the concurrence of the registered person, authorize an      inspection be conducted by any person specifically accredited      by the Secretary to conduct such inspection under section 712      of such Act.       ``(i) Cord Blood.--       ``(1) In general.--This section (including provisions      regarding reclassification) shall apply with respect to cord      blood to the same extent and in the same manner as this      section applies with respect to human tissue.       ``(2) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement this      section with respect to cord blood under regulations      promulgated after notice and opportunity to comment.       ``(j) Eyes.--The Secretary shall not regulate eyes until      such time as the Secretary makes a finding under this section      that voluntary regulation under generally accepted standards      is inadequate to protect the public health.''.
