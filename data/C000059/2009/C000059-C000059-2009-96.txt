I stand to recognize the Inauguration of the eighth Chancellor at the University of California, Riverside: Dr. Timothy P. White. The Inauguration ceremony will be held on March 17, 2009.  Chancellor White was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His family would later immigrate to the United States where he would come to call California his home. A first-generation college graduate, Chancellor White has certainly made his family, who deeply values education, proud.  Dr. White began his collegiate studies at Diablo Valley Community College, and later graduated Magna Cum Laude from the California State University of Fresno, where he received his Bachelor's Degree. He then pursued and obtained his Masters Degree from the California State University of Hayward. Later Dr. White added a doctorate in exercise physiology from the University of California, Berkeley to his resume.  Chancellor White's curriculum vitae includes a long list of work throughout the United States as an educator and scientist at the University of Michigan, Oregon State University,University of California Berkeley, the University of Idaho, and now the University of California Riverside. Chancellor White is internationally recognized for his discussion of physiology in various published medical journals and editorials. With more than 30 years of service in higher education, Dr. White's experience is not only an impressive accolade, but a symbol of his passion and tireless commitment toward the sharing of knowledge and ideas. The University of California, Riverside will benefit greatly from Dr. White's impressive knowledge and skills, especially as it embarks on the establishment of a medical school.  Riverside is an area that calls for great leaders that are ready to achieve goals that will propel both the university and the community forward. Dr. White has proven he is a true leader and his experience and passion will greatly benefit UC Riverside, a proud part of the Riverside community and the state of California. Chancellor Timothy P. White represents a welcome addition to the University of California at Riverside and to the region it serves. On behalf of the Inland Empire delegation, I wholeheartedly welcome Dr. White as the eighth distinguished Chancellor of the University of California, Riverside and look forward to working with him for many years to come.                          ____________________
