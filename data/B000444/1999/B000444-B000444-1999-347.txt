 I know the Senator has a very important appointment he has to make. I am prepared, if it is all right with the Senator from Arizona, to switch with him and follow him. In other words, then the Senator from Massachusetts will be next and then I will speak.  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, be recognized for 15 minutes, followed by Senator Biden for 30 minutes, and the Record will show the incredible generosity of the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, having allowed two--not one, but two--Senators to precede him.
