Speaker, earlier this month on November 11, 2018, the Polish people celebrated 100 years of regained independence for their nation. I am delighted to rise along with my fellow Congressional Poland Caucus Co-chairs to introduce a bipartisan resolution to commemorate this historic event as well as the democratic values the United States and Poland have shared since the 1700s.  As a proud Polish American, I join thousands of members in the Polish diaspora across our nation and in the world to acknowledge this very auspicious achievement.  Indeed, the United States-Polish friendship precedes the birth of the United States, where Polish Generals Taddeus Kosciuszko and Casmir Pulaski bravely fought for independence and freedoms for both the United States and Poland.  In the late 1700s, Poland adopted its first constitution in Europe, inspired by ours, based on the ideas of liberty and constitutional monarchy, which paved the way for future democratic reforms. Tragically just four years later, Poland was invaded and succumbed to the third partition between the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Hapsburg Monarchy, and as a result lost its sovereignty for the next 123 years.  Then in 1918, following World War I, with the support of President Woodrow Wilson, Poland was restored to the map of Europe and resumed its persistent climb to freedom. Heroic Polish resistance fighters and soldiers fought in World War II against tyranny on all fronts and at home only to find that liberation from the Nazis became domination by the Soviet Union. Yet, Poland refused to surrender.  Poland's Solidarity movement, the largest European resistance movement, led to the ultimate defeat of communism and the fall of the Soviet Empire. In 1989, after 43 years of increasing resistance to occupation, Poland's fierce love of liberty spilled over into a massive electoral victory won by Solidarnosc.  Poland's accomplishments in the generation of freedom which followed are nothing short of remarkable. Today we celebrate Poland's membership in the NATO Alliance and the European Union as a sign of its continued commitment to liberal democratic values, rule of law, human rights, and freedom of the press.  Let this 100th anniversary year of Poland's rebirth serve as an occasion to honor thecourage and sacrifice of the people of Poland, who never lost their determination to advance the cause of Polish independence. Let us come together to wish the Polish people one hundred years more of close friendship between our nations and the democratic values that bind us.                          ____________________
