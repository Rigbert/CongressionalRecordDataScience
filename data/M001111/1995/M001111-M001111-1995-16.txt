 President, the bill we have before us provides an excellent example of how good people, working together, can find a way to balance safety and cost concerns. I commend the bipartisan effort that developed the Safe Drinking Water Amendments Act of 1995. I also rise to thank these same chairmen and ranking members for agreeing to the amendment that Senator Gorton and I proposed regarding the city of Seattle's water supply that was approved earlier today.  Safe drinking water is probably the single most important thing a government can supply its people. This bill, S. 1316, accomplishes that task by giving the Environmental Protection Agency flexibility to set drinking water standards based on peer-reviewed science. It encourages State and local governments to become full partners in the development, implementation, and enforcement of drinking water regulations. It targets our scarce public resources toward greater health risks and away from more trivial risks.  S. 1316 will be particularly helpful for small systems serving fewer than 10,000 people. These small systems will be eligible for variances that allow them to use affordable treatment technology. While regulators may grant variances, S. 1316 also authorizes consumers to participate in the decision to grant a variance and requires variance renewals every 5 years. I have heard from many small communities about how burdensome the current Safe Drinking Water Act requirements are. I share their enthusiasm for the flexibility and innovation contained in this bill.  I also want to draw my colleagues' attention to the amendment Senator Gorton and I proposed regarding the city of Seattle water supply. With our amendment, Seattle will be able to provide its customers safer water, at a lower cost, and with a better taste than it could have under current filtration requirements. Our amendment will allow local governments that have undeveloped watersheds with a consolidated ownership to use a process other than filtration if that alternative ensures significantly greater removal of pathogens.  The Seattle Water Department has concluded that ozonation, a process commonly used in Europe, may provide 100 times more protection from Cryptosporidium and other pathogens than would a filtration system. Should ozonation deliver as much protection as it promises, the people of Seattle will have safer water and will pay $130 million less for that safety than they would have had to pay for a Cedar River watershed filtration system.  Mr. President, like all bills that pass through the process of compromise and negotiation, S. 1316 is not perfect. However, it is a good bill that goes a long way toward solving some of the more troublesome aspects of the current Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill offers responsible reform, flexibility, and balance. I have heard from a number of local governments urging my full support of this bill. I intend to offer that support, while at the same time voting in favor of stronger right-to-know provisions.  Again, I thank the chairmen and ranking members for their hard work on this bill and for accepting Sen. Gorton's and my amendment.                         Seattle's Water Supply  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Safe Drinking Water Amendments Act of 1995 and commend the managers on their excellent work. In addition, I would like to address the amendment that Senator Gorton and I proposed, which was accepted as a managers' amendment, that will provide the people of the city of Seattle with quality drinking water at an affordable price. Like this bill before us, our amendment seeks to protect our citizens from unnecessary costs while providing safe, high quality drinking water.  Our amendment requires the EPA to amend its drinking water protection criteria to allow a State to establish treatment requirements other than filtration where a watershed is uninhabited, has consolidated ownership and has controlled access. Our amendment allows an alternative to filtration where EPA determines that the quality of the source water and alternative treatment requirements established by the State ensure significantly greater pathogen removal efficiencies than would a combination of filtration and chlorine disinfection.  Mr. President, the Cedar River watershed is unique. The city of Seattle will own 100 percent of this 90,490 acre watershed by the end of the year. The city controls access to and activity in this watershed. It practices model land stewardship, supplying a wide variety of public values, including healthy populations of wildlife. In short, it is a crown jewel. It is the type of water supply all major cities should aspire to have.  The watershed met all of the criteria for remaining an unfiltered supplier for the first 18 months after passage of the SDWA amendments of 1986. However, because of a severe drought and an abundance of wildlife, the watershed exceeded one of the unfiltered water criteria, that of fecal coliform. After receiving notification of noncompliance, the Seattle Water Department began investigating filtration and non-filtration systems to ensure it would satisfy requirements of the SDWA.  The water department discovered that a process widely used in Europe, called ozonation, would reliably remove more cryptosporidium and giardia--the pathogens of most concern--than would filtration. An ozonation facility would inactivate 99.999 percent of cryptosporidium, while filtration would inactivate only 99.9 percent. In simple terms, ozonation can be economically designed to provide two orders of magnitude, or 100 times greater protection than filtration. Not only is ozonation more effective against the most serious threats to the Seattle water supply, but it costs less and makes the water taste better.  The Seattle Water Department's studies indicate that an ozonation plant would cost its customers $68 million, while a filtration plant would cost $198 million. While Seattle water officials believe that the Cedar River water may require filtration sometime in the future, the system has a number of other more pressing needs--such as covering open, in-city reservoirs and installing a filtration plant in the Tolt River watershed--that make ozonation the best course for today. The ozonation plant will be built in such a way as to be compatible with a filtration plant should the need for one arise in the future.  Mr. President, this amendment offers the city of Seattle needed flexibility so that it can provide its customers the safest water at the lowest cost in the very near future. It is worth re-stating that this filtration flexibility may be given only where a watershed is undeveloped and, most importantly, the alternative to filtration proves to ensure significantly greater pathogen removal efficiencies. Delivering safe drinking water is the fundamental goal of this amendment and this bill.  Again, I thank the bill's managers for their assistance and support on our amendment and in developing the comprehensive, balanced Safe Drinking Water Amendments Act of 1995.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
