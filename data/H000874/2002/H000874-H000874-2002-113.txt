Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate both gentlemen from Florida, (Mr. Shaw) and (Mr. Wexler), who have worked tirelessly on this issue. I know the chairman and I have spent literally hours with each gentleman because of their deep concern over the public health challenge that this causes the people of South Florida. I want to assure both of them that I know the chairman and I will spend a lot of time on this and try to bring this matter to a successful resolution, and I thank the gentlemen for their work.
