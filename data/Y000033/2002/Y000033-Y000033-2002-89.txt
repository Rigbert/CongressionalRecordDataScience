Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, that everybody is thanking everybody means this is a good day, and I would suggest we especially thank again the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the ranking member on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the work he has done, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larson) and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Carson).  Everybody has worked together and we have got what I think is a good piece of legislation.
