Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's assertion of what we have done in the past and that he hopes we can continue to do that.  The intelligence authorization, when does the gentleman believe that that would be coming up? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I am advised that it is quite possible that the intelligence reauthorization bill would come on Tuesday or Wednesday.
