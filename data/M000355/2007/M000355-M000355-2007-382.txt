 President, of all the many milestones along the way of the extraordinary career of Senator Robert Byrd--and, by the way, we have celebrated a few of those on the floor of the Senate since I have been here, as he achieves more and more distinction by setting more and more records about Senate service, I am always reminded that Senator Byrd said his greatest accomplishment was his extraordinary marriage to Erma for a longer period of time than many Americans live. I would suspect that if Senator Byrd were to list his most important achievement, it would be his incredible, successful marriage to his beloved Erma.  Mr. President, let me add, on behalf of those on this side of the aisle, our congratulations to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.
