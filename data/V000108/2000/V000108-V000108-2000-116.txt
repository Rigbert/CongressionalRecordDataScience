Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in Northwest Indiana. On April 8, 2000, in a salute to their workers' durability and longevity, the Hammond Carpenter's Union Local 599 recognized their members for 25 years or more of dedicated service. They were recognized during a pin ceremony banquet to be held on Saturday at the Carpenter's Union Hall in Hammond, Indiana. These individuals, in addition to the other Local 599 members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are a testament to the prototypical American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.  The Carpenter's Local 599, which received its charter in 1899, honored members for their years of devoted service. The members honored for 55 years of service include: John Giba, Sylvester Reising and Tensey Roberts. The members honored for 50 years of service include: Robert J. Busch, Robert Herhold, Earnest Latta, Kenneth Ogden and Oliver J. Vogeler. The members honored for 45 years of service include: Louis B. Biedron, Lafayette M. Bundren, William J. Burgess, Guy Casey, William C. Dowdy, Elmer F. Lucas, Raymond Lukowski and John Sills. The members honored for 40 years of service include: John M. Davich, Robert Dimichelle, C. J. Krupinski, Ethard McIlroy, Richard Meyers, John E. Shoup, William Simmons, Joseph M. Staes and Robert Washington. The members honored for 35 years of service include: John R. Billings, Kenneth E. Clayton, James McCready, Harold Neil, Elmer C. Phelps, Jr., Paul V. Reppa, Dale R. Robert, Harold Sills and Richard C. Thiel. The members honored for 30 years of service include: Robert E. Chorba, Glen E. Flaherty, Jr., Uwe H. Grantz, James Liming, Sr. and Paul W. Steinhauer. The members honored for 25 years of service include: Denny L. Crouse, Thomas A. Dorsey, John P. Hindahl, Donald King, Joseph Lippie and Richard A. Polus.  As Orville Dewey said, ``Labor is man's greatest function. He is nothing, he can be nothing, he can achieve nothing, he can fulfill nothing, without working.'' The men and women of Local 599, in addition to all of the local unions in Northwest Indiana, form the backbone of our economy and community. Without their blood, sweat, and tears, Indiana's First Congressional District would not be a place of which to be proud, it would not be the place I love, nor would it be my home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and outstanding members of the Hammond Carpenter's Union Local 599, in addition to all the hardworking union men and women in America. The men and women of Local 599 are a fine representation of America's union men and women; I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. Their hard labor and dauntless courage are the achievement and fulfillment of the American dream.                          ____________________
