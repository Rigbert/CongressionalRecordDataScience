Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 54) recognizing the historic significance of the first anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 54       Whereas Ireland has a long and tragic history of civil      conflict that has left a deep and profound legacy of      suffering;       Whereas since 1969 more than 3,200 people have died and      thousands more have been injured as a result of political      violence in Northern Ireland;       Whereas a series of efforts by the Governments of the      Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom to facilitate      peace and an announced cessation of hostilities created an      historic opportunity for a negotiated peace;       Whereas in June 1996, for the first time since the      partition of Ireland in 1922, representatives elected from      political parties in Northern Ireland pledged to adhere to      the principles of nonviolence and commenced talks regarding      the future of Northern Ireland;       Whereas the talks greatly intensified in the spring of 1998      under the chairmanship of former United States Senator George      Mitchell;       Whereas the active participation of British Prime Minister      Tony Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern was critical to      the success of the talks;       Whereas on Good Friday, April 10, 1998, the parties to the      negotiations each made honorable compromises to conclude a      peace agreement for Northern Ireland, which has become known      as the Good Friday Peace Agreement;       Whereas on Friday, May 22, 1998, an overwhelming majority      of voters in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of      Ireland approved by referendum the Good Friday Peace      Agreement;       Whereas the United States must remain involved politically      and economically to ensure the long-term success of the peace      agreement; and       Whereas on Good Friday, April 2, 1999, a one-year deadline      passed without agreement among all major parties, putting the      entire peace process in jeopardy: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the first      anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement;       (2) salutes British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish      Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the elected representatives of the      political parties in Northern Ireland for creating the      opportunity for a negotiated peace;       (3) commends Senator George Mitchell for his leadership on      behalf of the United States in guiding the parties toward      peace;       (4) congratulates the people of the Republic of Ireland and      of Northern Ireland for their courageous commitment to work      together in peace;       (5) encourages the Governments of the United Kingdom and      the Republic of Ireland with the active involvement of the      United States to continue to work together to ensure the      forward movement of the peace process; and       (6) reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation that      exist between the United States and the Governments of the      Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which ensure that      the United States and those Governments will continue as      partners in peace.
