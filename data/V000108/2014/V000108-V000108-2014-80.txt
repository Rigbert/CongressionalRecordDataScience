I do not oppose it. I would simply mention a concern I have, which is not with the intent of the gentleman's but, rather, with the amount.  I just want my colleagues to know that the underlying bill already provides $11 million from the operations and maintenance funds of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for the construction and furnishing of additional Fisher Houses, a total not to exceed $33 million. This amendment, obviously, would add $20 million to that amount. I am concerned that the rapid increase in construction funding in a single fiscal year would be very difficult for the foundation to utilize.
