. automotive industry in northern Ohio--from Cleveland, Elyria, Lorain, Avon Lake, Sandusky, Toledo, Defiance, the whole corridor--what we are seeing is a reinvestment in the supplier chain. That includes steel such as Republic Steel. People don't realize how many jobs in America are connected to the automotive industry.  Your State of California, which manufactures a lot of semiconductors, half of the semiconductors procured in this country go into the automotive industry. If you think about carpeting, half of the carpeting sold in this country goes into automotive production. Plastics, glass--think about what is really in there. As a result of what we were able to do here, with a lot of flak from one side of the aisle, although there was some support, was to refinance the U.S. auto industry.  We just had an announcement in Avon Lake that the truck platform will be coming back to us from Mexico. So that is retention of jobs in Avon Lake. It is part of the rebirth of automotive and truck transportation across the north. We are producing vehicles like the Wrangler, one of the most popular vehicles in the country, obviously, and the new Cruze for General Motors.  But all the supplier chain, Republic Steel, they're putting in a new arc furnace. You're looking at the restoration of production. It's coming slowly, but it's coming. So we have to be proud of actions that were taken by the Government of the United States of America through the action of Congress and by the President to help save one of America's lodestar industries, which has now paid back its loans and is rehiring.
