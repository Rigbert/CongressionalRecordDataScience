His reaction was that of a true American hero: He turned the use of the photo against his captors by proclaiming that the photo proved the rightness of the cause of freedom. He was proud that we in this great country ``are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with us.'' Let us heed his words and ``not be afraid of freedom.''  Mr. President, we are each custodians of the Constitution as well as contemporary representatives during our brief terms in office. We were given a Bill of Rights that has served to protect our rights and speech for over 200 years. We should provide no less to our children and grandchildren.  My family and I fly the flag at our home. I display it in my office. No law tells me to do that. Love of my country and its symbols tells me to. That love is far more compelling than any law.
