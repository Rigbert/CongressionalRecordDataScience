Speaker, if the gentlemen from Texas (Mr. DeLay) does not object, let me yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking member, because I know he has worked very hard with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), as you well know, in a very bipartisan way. You mentioned 63 to 5, 65 to 5; and so we did not perceive there to be much opposition to the bill.
