 The bill requires the Pacific Council to develop a rationalization program within 24 months from date of enactment. The Pacific Council has been working on a comprehensive ground fisheries management program for more than 3 years and is on target to complete that process by 2008. As I understand the bill, the Pacific Council can continue the development of its groundfish management program without having to restart the process. Is that correct?
