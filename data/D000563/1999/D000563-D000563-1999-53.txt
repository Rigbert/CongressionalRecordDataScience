President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy, Senator Levin and others in submitting a resolution that would designate November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members. The resolution uses the theme Give Thanks, Give Life to encourage these discussions so that informed decisions can be made if the occasion to donate arises.  Traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families to take time out of their busy lives to come together and give thanks for the many blessings in their lives. This presents the perfect opportunity for family members to discuss their intentions on the issue of organ and tissue donation. Although designation as an organ donor on a driver's license or voter's registration is a valuable first step in the donation process, it does not ensure donation will take place since the final decision on whether a potential donor will share the gift of life is always made by surviving family members regardless of their loved one's initial intent.  There are approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the United States who receive the gift of life each year through transplantation surgery made possible by the generosity of organ and tissue donations. This is only a small proportion of the more than 66,000 Americans who are on the waiting list, hoping for their chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Tragically, nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13 patients each day) die while waiting for a donated heart, liver, kidney, or other organ.  In order to narrow the gap between the supply and the increasing demand for donated organs, there must be an effort to encourage willing donors to make their desire to donate clear to the only people able to make the decision, if the occasion should arise--their immediate family members. Although there are up to 15,000 potential donors annually, families' consent to donation is received for less than 6,000 donors. As the demand for transplantation increases due to prolonged life expectancy; increased prevalence of diseases that lead to organ damage and failure including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C infection, this shortfall will become even more pronounced. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow with the predicted population trends.  Many Americans will spend part of the Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members who would be most likely approached to make the important decision of whether or not to donate. Therefore, this would be a good time for families to spend a portion of that day discussing how they might give life to others on a day devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings. Open family discussions on this topic on a day of relaxation and family togetherness will increase awareness of the intentions of those willing to make the courageous and selfless decision to be organ donors, leading to more lifesaving transplants in the future. Designation of November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to Give Thanks, Give Life is an important next step to promoting the dialogue between willing donors and their families, so that family members will know their loved ones' wishes long before the issue arises.  We have received the support of many national organ and tissue donation organizations for this resolution including: the American Heart Association, American Kidney Fund, American Liver Foundation, American Lung Association, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, Coalition on Donation, Eye Bank Association of America, National Kidney Foundation, National Minority Organ and Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP), Transplant Recipients International Organization (TRIO), United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and the Wendy Marks Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness. The efforts of these groups and others have been critical in increasing donor awareness and education of the public on this extremely important cause.  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this worthwhile resolution designating Thanksgiving day of 2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members, a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life.''                          ____________________
