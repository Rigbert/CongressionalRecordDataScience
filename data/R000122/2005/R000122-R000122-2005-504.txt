President, today many Americans in communities across the Nation are being left behind in our economy. Federal community and economic development programs, such as Community Development Block Grants, Community Development Financial Institutions, and Economic Development Administration grants, have a history of ``being there'' for communities--providing funding for housing rehabilitation, job creation, and infrastructure. I thank Senator Sarbanes for offering his amendment to save these important programs from elimination, and I am glad to be a cosponsor. Senator Sarbanes' amendment will restore funding to these vital programs by closing tax loopholes that the majority of the Senate supported closing in the FSC/ETI bill.
