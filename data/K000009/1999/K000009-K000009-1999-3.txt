 During 1932 and 1933, the people of Ukraine were devastated by hunger, though not the kind caused by unfavorable natural conditions. Instead, only certain regions or a part of the country suffered famine while the government of the former Soviet Union turned their backs upon the population.  The famine of 1932 and 1933 stemmed from political rather than natural causes. In 1932, Ukraine had an average grain harvest of 146,600,000 metric tons of wheat, and there was no danger of famine, or at least there should not have been.  But the famine was first and foremost a planned repression of the peasants by the Soviet government for their resistance to collective savings. Second, it was an intentional attack on Ukrainian village life, which was the bulwark of Ukrainian heritage. Third, it was the result of the forced export of grain in exchange for imported machinery which was required for the implementation of the policy of industrialization.  The events of 1932 and 1933 are considered a man-made famine because food was available. But what happened was politically motivated. It characterized the Soviet system and ultimately resulted in the deaths of over 6million people, including our great grandparents.                              {time}  2000  People died by the millions, and they were piled at the village edge like cord wood. According to Stalin's commands and the law that was enacted in 1932, Party activists confiscated grain from peasant households. Any man, woman, or child either could be, and often was, executed for taking a handful of grain from a collective farm field or was punished by 10 years of hard labor.  Gangs of Communist Party activists conducted house-to-house searches, tearing up floors and delving into wells in search of grain. Those who were already swollen from malnutrition were not allowed to keep their grain, and those who were not starving were suspected of hoarding food. An average peasant family of five had about five pounds of grain a month to last until the next harvest.  Lacking bread, peasants ate pets, rats, bark, leaves, and garbage from the well-provisioned kitchens of Party members. There were occurrences of cannibalism. People dug in the frozen ground with their raw hands to find even an onion for soup. But many villages died out, in spite of the fact that party activists continued confiscating grain.  The unprecedented calamity came in the winter and spring of 1933, before a new harvest could be gathered, when the world population was left without any means of sustenance and authorities did not organize any supplies for the villages. Some villages in the regions of Poltava, Kharkiv, and Kyiv were completely deserted by the spring of 1933.  When the casualties of collectivization, famine, the purges of the 1930s, and the nearly 6 million who died during World War II are combined, it is estimated that more than half the male and one quarter of the female population of the Ukraine perished. Along with these people, the achievements, lessons, and hopes that one generation communicates to another were destroyed. Under the circumstances, it was all the more remarkable that Ukrainian society had any strength left for self-assertion in the postwar period. In summing up the famine in Ukraine, it is no exaggeration to say that the Ukrainians' greatest achievement during that decade and this century has been to endure and survive.  In this sense, we must recognize the Ukrainian famine on a yearly basis to bring light to the tremendous sacrifices a people had to endure. Last year we commemorated the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian famine with a commemorative resolution. Later this week, on November 20, the Ukrainian community will have an opportunity to commemorate the fallen victims of the famine with an ecumenical service and program at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. I join with the Ukrainian-American community in commemorating this tragic period in the world's history, certainly in the history of Ukraine. Always remember, never forget.  And here in America we will attempt to tell the history of a people who struggle even today to build a nation where democratic reforms and freedom are possible for millions and millions of those who survived and those who remember the great price that their families paid only because they wanted to be free.                          ____________________
