Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Clement), for yielding me time, from the great City of Nashville, where I had the opportunity to study and to learn much from the people of Tennessee and the people of Nashville.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues for working to bring this bill before us today. I rise today in support of H.R. 3442, the National Museum of African American History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission Act of 2001.  During the past few months, Mr. Speaker, it has been my honor and pleasure to work with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts), and his staff. I want to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and also my own staff for their good work on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this Commission would develop and recommend a legislative plan of action for creating a national African American museum. It is my hope and prayer that this will finally bring Congress closer to achieving the goal of establishing a national African American museum in our Nation's Capital.                              {time}  2000  This Presidential commission is a step, a necessary step in the right direction to preserve the rich history of African Americans.  As I travel across this land, I have been to several local African American museums in such cities as Memphis, Birmingham, Philadelphia, and Detroit. So I believe the time has long passed for a national African American museum right here in our Capitol city, right here in Washington.  I have introduced legislation during every session of Congress since 1988 to authorize a national African American museum. The time has come for passage of this legislation. By establishing this museum and placing it on the national Mall, we will be able to honor the legacy of African Americans and put it in a national light where it belongs.  African American history is an important part of our country; yet the vital and important contributions of African Americans go virtually unrecognized. Until we understand the full African American story, we cannot understand ourselves as a Nation. The African American story must be told and a national African American museum in Washington, D.C. is critical to telling that story.  This Presidential commission is our chance to take an important and productive step in establishing an African American museum and healing our Nation's racial wounds. This is our chance to create an African American community of every individual, an all-inclusive community that is at peace with itself, a beloved community.  Mr. Speaker, the time is right. The time is now.
