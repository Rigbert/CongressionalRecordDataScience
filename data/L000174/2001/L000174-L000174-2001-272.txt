In fact, I got up at 3 this morning in Vermont to come back in time to be prepared to go forward to discuss the bill, to have a full discussion today or tomorrow, if need be, so that Senators could ask questions and they could either vote for it or against it. I say to my friend, the senior Senator from Nevada, throughout those nights and days, a lot of times I would leave about 1 a.m. and the staff would still be there at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. We made a number of changes. Nobody is more protective of the rights of individuals than I, and considerably more than that, I feel very strongly in agreement with Benjamin Franklin's comment when he literally had his neck on the line when he said people who would trade their liberty for security deserve neither.  We are trying to get that balance between liberty and security. Is it a perfect bill? No. Could we pass a perfect bill? I doubt it very much. Is it far better than when it was originally proposed by the administration as far as being protective of civil liberties? I believe it is.
