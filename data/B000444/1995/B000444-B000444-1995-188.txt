 President, Howard Schroeder first encountered southern Delaware during his Army service in World War II. His job was to protect the coast, which he did by applying his military training and muscle to help lay mines in the bay, and by applying his artist's eye and talent to help record the landscape of the area.  Some of those first Schroeder landscapes remain on display today in the Lewes, DE, public library and middle school, testaments to a love affair that lasted a lifetime.  Even beyond a lifetime--when he died at his Lewes home on Friday, September 8, at the age of 84, Howard's family announced that, in accordance with his wishes, his ashes would be scattered over the sand dunes and in the water at nearby Cape Henlopen State Park.  The people of my State take great comfort in knowing that Howard Schroeder is still guarding our coast, not only in the resting place he chose but in the legacy of his love for the beaches, the small towns, the fishing boats, the marshes, the old buildings, the people--everything that is the beauty and heart of Delaware's coastline.  It is a recorded legacy of work, literally thousands of sketches and paintings that, as one Delaware reporter wrote, ``virtually define our mental image'' of parts of our State. Howard said that he was always ``looking for the unspoiled,'' and he was able to find it, and to share it, not because he knew where to look but because he knew how to look.  It is a living legacy of teaching, because Howard Schroeder was, always, inspired to inspire others. He taught at the St. Andrew's School, at the Rehoboth Art League, which he had served as president, and in workshops that he founded in towns through Kent and Sussex Counties. He started the Artists' Sketch Group to help local artists bring out the best in each other, and he was a founding member of the Sussex County Arts Council.  He was, as his friend and fellow artist Jack Lewis wrote, ``a champion for the arts,'' and his drive to teach wherever there was someone willing to learn has left a permanent and deep imprint on the artistic community in and well beyond Delaware.  Howard Schroeder's personal legacy is rich in family and friends. His wife, Marian, was his partner in every way, including the years she and Howard sold his work at their Rehoboth Beach art supply and gift store. Together, they raised six children, at a time when it was, as Jack Lewis said, ``unheard of'' to make a family living on an artist's earnings. Marian and Howard succeeded in doing the unheard of.  Their son John, a Delaware State legislator, published a biography of his father, and remembers Howard as working until late at night in his studio but always making time for his children. Daughter Carole memorialized her father in a poem, in which she wrote:     ``You showed me the beauty of life     Through your music and your art     Through history and words of prose     But mostly, by living it.''  Howard shared his life's lessons also with sons Stephen, Howard, and Robert and daughter Gail, with their families, and with countless fortunate friends and admirers.  Mr. President, Howard Schroeder worked all over the world, he was profiled on national television, he was raised in the Bronx and in northern New Jersey. But he chose Delaware, and we remember him, gratefully, as a Delaware State treasure, a treasure that we were proud to share in his lifetime and that I am proud to share, and to honor, in the Senate today.  Howard Schroeder was a neighbor with a special gift to see, and to teach us to see, the unspoiled in our own backyard. By his vision and his talent, and by the sincerity of his love, he led us to the best in ourselves, which may well be the greatest accomplishment and contribution of all.
