 While I agree with you that it is vitally important that this Omnibus Appropriations bill adheres to principles of fiscal responsibility, I must stress that the continuation of the Byrne Formula Grants is absolutely critical to local law enforcement, especially in rural States like Iowa. I voted on the procedural motion to table the Harkin amendment, because of our need for fiscal responsibility. However, I would not have done so, if you had not made a personal commitment to me that the funds for the Byrne Formula Grants would be fully restored in conference. Because the availability of these funds makes such a difference to Iowa, I want to once again get an assurance from you that when we take the final vote on this bill the full funding for the Byrne Grants will be included in the bill.
