President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great educator and champion of science and technology, who recently passed away.  Dr. John Hopps was a true public servant who most recently furthered the cause of our national security as deputy director of defense research and engineering and deputy under secretary of defense for laboratories and basic science at the Department of Defense. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I had the privilege of knowing John and witnessing first-hand his support of programs, projects and personnel in the defense laboratories.  Prior to his position with the Department of Defense, Dr. Hopps worked to encourage our Nation's youth in their pursuit of academic excellence, especially in this fields of physics and chemistry. As provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and professor of physics at Morehouse College, John was in a position to guide young minds and manage academic departments and multi disciplinary programs.  Immediately before joining Morehouse College, John Hopps served as director of materials research at the National Science Foundation. During his tenure with Draper Laboratory, which began in 1977, John was manager of energy program development, manager of the laboratory's fault-tolerant systems technology research program, and education director for the laboratory.  During his tenure as deputy director of defense research and engineering, Dr. Hopps made great strides in reaching out to the scientific and academic communities and in working to ensure the technological superiority of the defense laboratories and workforce who develop the tools, protective equipment and weapons that are so important to the U.S. warfighter of today and tomorrow. Under his leadership, the Department increased the National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship Program and pursued a program and structure--Materials World Modules--he developed to connect students of all ages to the excitement and value of science.  This year's defense authorization bill contains a provision that authorizes the Department to establish a pilot science, mathematics and engineering scholarship program that will continue much of the work championed by John in his efforts for the Department of Defense and in his other positions both inside and outside the Federal Government. John's academic background combined with service in the Federal Government gave him a unique perspective on the importance of basic research for future technological advances, linkages he helped us all to make.  John Hopps' patient, deliberative manner, keen sense of humor, and compassionate approach to life and work will be missed by the many students, educators and public servants, whose lives he has touched. My deepest sympathies go out to Dr. Hopps' wife, family and friends, and to all who knew and loved him.                          ____________________
