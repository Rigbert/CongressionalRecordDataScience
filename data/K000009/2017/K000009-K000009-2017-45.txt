 I was proud to note their statements that Ohio has become number one in solar manufacturing. Just as Mark said, it is important that we ensure that these valuable manufacturing skills are passed along to our youth, and not outsourced.  I am grateful for their contributions and welcome their continued engagement as the negotiations proceed.  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to include their remarks in the Record. They are important for all Americans to read, especially those negotiating the new NAFTA.                          ____________________
