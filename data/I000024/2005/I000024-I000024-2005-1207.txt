President, I want to make a couple comments in response to my good friend from North Dakota.  First, I encourage Members to come down to the Chamber. The current order of business is the motion to proceed to the highway bill. It is very important. It is critical. There is nothing we are dealing with right now that is more important. There is so much at stake, as I already outlined. We need to have more Members come down. Certainly, if I am talking, I will defer to them if they do come to the floor.
