There are times when he and I have come together and I think good things have happened. I think this may be such a moment. I hope it is. I came to the floor to address this issue involving General Boykin, fully cognizant of the great contribution which he has made to this country in his military capacity over many years, risking his life and serving our Nation well, but feeling at this moment in time important questions need to be asked and answered about the things he said and did. I believe the Senator from Virginia--I do not want to mischaracterize his remarks--has suggested he be detailed to another position while these important questions are asked and considered and answers are brought forward. Am I correct in that conclusion?
