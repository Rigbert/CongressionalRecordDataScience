Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The implications are dire, not only for the standard of living of Americans, our productive capacity, our future standing in the world as a great power, but just one last item. During the war with Iraq, we used a lot of cruise missiles. There is a critical component of the cruise missile made in Europe, either Sweden or Switzerland make that component, and they refused to sell us any because they did not support the war.  What is going to happen in 10 years when China is looking at invading Taiwan or Mongolia for its resources, and the United States has to go to the Chinese and say can we buy some weapons from you because we think next year we are going to have to defend ourselves from you.  I do not understand the hawks around here who are blithely allowing this hollowing out of our wealth and capacity to happen. I know it is enriching the contributor class in this country, which has a lot of clout at the White House and in Congress; but it is very disturbing to me. There are so many reasons why Members should be appalled by the trade policy. The policy at the White House is to change the names, not the policy.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating on this, and for all the time he spends on the floor on this and on so many other issues.                          ____________________
