 President, I rise to speak on behalf of the nomination of magistrate judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo to the position of district judge for the Southern District of California.  Judge Bencivengo will fill a judicial emergency vacancy in a judicial district along the southwest border that has one of the highest and most rapidly increasing criminal caseloads in the country.
