Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for the time.  Mr. Chairman, I have heard a few Members come to the floor and seen some press accounts that there is too much in this bill. Now the question will be, too much? Is it that we are meeting and overfulfilling the transportation and infrastructure needs in the United States? No, not at all. In fact, this bill will still leave us with a $30 billion per year deficit in transportation, $16 billion for highways and $14 billion for transit, 254,000 miles of pavement in poor condition, one out of three highway bridges structurally deficient or obsolete, one out of every two transit yard stations and bridges for mass transit in poor condition.  In my own State we need an additional $244 million a year to meet our needs for preservation and maintenance and $351 million for capital improvements. It is not too much in terms of the needs of the country.  Now is it too much in terms of what we have to pay for transportation? No. In fact this bill will not spend all the money which the American people are paying in taxes dedicated to transportation. Every time an American drives to the pump they pay 18.4 cents a gallon gas tax, and this bill, as good as itis, as robust as it is, will only spend about 14 to 15 cents of that tax, and the rest will go elsewhere in the Federal budget. It will go to deficit reduction, or it will go to pay for secret programs at the CIA, or over to the Pentagon or somewhere else, maybe for tax cuts for the wealthy.  That is not why Americans pay a gas tax, and there should be no diversion of the gas tax money until every infrastructure need of this country is met and up to date. So it is not too much to ask that we fulfill the needs, and it is not too much to ask that we spend every penny of that dedicated regressive tax on the transportation needs of this country.
