  Hunting and fishing are traditions that have been an integral part of our history since the inception of our Nation and are among the most basic of our heritage. Through the ages, sportsmen have shown a deep respect and appreciation for the land and have made a concerted effort to wisely use our Nation's renewable natural resources. All across this country, very successful alliances have been formed between hunting and fishing enthusiasts and conservationists. Both are very concerned about protecting natural habitats, and when working together their force includes some 70 percent of the U.S. population.  Today, millions of Americans participate in these venerable pastimes. Over 60 million Americans enthusiastically participate in fishing activities and 14 million citizens are licensed hunters. These recreational activities are a significant boost to many local and State economies, as well as the Nation. Sportsmen spent more than $67.9 billion last year on goods and servicessupporting an industry that employs more than a million people across the country. When discussing the contributions sportsmen have made to our Nation, often overlooked is the fact that sportsmen have carried the burden of financing fish and wildlife management and preservation through the years.  America owes our sportsmen a debt of gratitude for their pioneering achievements on behalf of wildlife and habitat conservation. The Sportsmen's Bill of Rights recognizes the important role fishing and hunting play in our society by providing anglers and hunters with explicit access to public lands; opening the process of wildlife management and protecting the integrity of the sportsmen's trust funds. This bill ensures that hunting and fishing opportunities are considered in Federal land management decisions, and provides a clear procedure for Federal agencies to follow in their management of our Federal public lands.  For too long, sportsmen have been unduly penalized from equitably sharing public land. This bill mandates that Federal agencies analyze the effects of potential hunting and fishing limitations prior to enacting new land use policies. Hunters and anglers should be granted the right to intervene in any civil action where law would limit the use of land for hunting and fishing. The provisions in the sportsmen's bill of rights assure that Federal agencies support, encourage and enhance the opportunities for fishing and hunting.  While this bill promotes access to public lands, it recognizes the need for exceptions and exclusions due to national security concerns, public safety matters, emergency situations and policy reasons that are incompatible with hunting or fishing. This act cannot be used to force the opening of National Parks or monuments administered by the National Park Service to fishing or hunting and this legislation is not intended to place fishing and hunting above other land management priorities. The sportsmen's bill of rights is aimed at setting forth tangible management guidelines.  Additionally, this year marks the 60th anniversary of one of our Nation's most successful Federal restoration programs, the Pittman Robertson Act. P-R, as it is often referred to, is a partnership created by the State fish and wildlife agencies and the funds provided by the anglers and hunters. Sportsman across the land have sponsored, supported and maintained the integrity of P-R throughout the last 60 years. The funds are raised through an excise tax on sportsman's goods and subsequently, placed in a fund to be allocated to the States yearly in accordance with statutory formulas. Today $357 million is raised for wildlife restoration through P-R funds in conjunction with the Dingell-Johnson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act.  Due to the congenial partnership of our Nation's hunters and anglers with Federal-State agencies, America's wildlife is thriving. For every taxpayer dollar invested in wildlife conservation, sportsmen and women contribute $9 dollars. At the turn of the century, only 41,000 elk were counted across our Nation. While the Nation's population soared and massive development occurred, sportsmen's conservation initiatives have enable the elk population in just 10 western States to increase to approximately 810,000. Similar stories can be applied to numerous species including the white-tailed deer, the Canada goose, and the wild turkey. Hunters and anglers have been and will continue to be the champions of wildlife and habitat conservation. These examples just begin to demonstrate the value of anglers and hunters to our society.  The sportsmen's bill of rights will protect and enhance sportsmen's opportunities and enhance the conservation of wildlife. I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
