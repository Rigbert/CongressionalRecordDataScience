Speaker, on Tuesday, December 5, 1995, I was unavoidably absent for rollcall vote No. 837. Had I been present I would have voted ``yea.'' This vote was on passage of H.R. 2684, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act of 1995.  I am pleased to voice my support for H.R. 2684 which will allow our senior citizens to appropriately supplement their income during retirement. Social Security was intended to be supplemented in retirement by pension and asset income. However, under current law, individuals aged 65 to 69 years old with earnings above $11,280 lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 earned. Coupled with standard income taxes and other payroll taxes, this amounts to an overall tax rate of over 70 percent for many of the Nation's working elderly--more than double the rate paid by the wealthiest individuals in America.  I am also pleased that this legislation was brought up as a stand-alone bill, rather than as a provision in the Republicans' budget reconciliation package, which I strongly opposed. In fact, the budget reconciliation package will make this legislation even more vital for America's seniors because the budget package will increase out-of-pocket costs for average Social Security recipients. With their budgets further strained by these increased costs, seniors will need extra earnings just to keep up in the new Republican reality.  I urge prompt enactment of H.R. 2684. Our economy needs older workers. Older Americans deserve the opportunity to continue to enjoy meaningful employment. Last year, Congress eliminated the mandatory retirement age. This year, Congress must act to eliminate this discriminatory policy.                          ____________________
