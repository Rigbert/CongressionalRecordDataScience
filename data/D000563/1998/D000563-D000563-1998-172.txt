President, I would like to yield to my cosponsor of this legislation, the Senator from Rhode Island, 7 minutes.  I say at the outset that I support the bill offered by the Senator from Idaho. It is a good bill. It tries to establish more care with handguns. But it doesn't address the issue which the Senator from Rhode Island and I seek to address.  I yield to him.
