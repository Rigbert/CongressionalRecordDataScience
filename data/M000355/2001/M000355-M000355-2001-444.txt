 President, I yield myself whatever time I may use. I assure my colleagues from Connecticut and from Illinois it will be short.  I have been very pleased by the debate so far on this subject and, frankly, somewhat surprised. The comity in the Senate has been excellent. There has been a total absence of unsubstantiated charges of corruption, which we had on the floor the last time this debate came up. That is a step in the right direction.  On that subject, in today's Washington Post, there was an interesting article by George Will, a columnist. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, March 20, 2001]                          Drops in the Bucket                          (By George F. Will)       McCainism, the McCarthyism of today's ``progressives,''      involves, as McCarthyism did, the reckless hurling of      imprecise accusations. Then, the accusation was      ``communism!'' Today it is ``corruption!'' Pandemic      corruption of ``everybody'' by ``the system'' supposedly      justifies campaign finance reforms. Those reforms would      subject the rights of political speech and association to yet      further government limits and supervision, by restricting the      political contributions and expenditures that are      indispensable for communication in modern society.       The media, exempt from regulations they advocate for rival      sources of influence, are mostly John McCain's megaphones.      But consider how empirically unproved and theoretically      dubious are his charges of corruption.       What McCain and kindred spirits call corruption, or the      ``appearance'' thereof, does not involve personal enrichment.      Rather, it means responding to, or seeming to respond to,      contributors, who also often are constituents. However, those      crying ``corruption!'' must show that legislative outcomes      were changed by contributions--that because of contributions,      legislators voted differently from the way they otherwise      would have done.       Abundant scholarship proves that this is difficult to      demonstrate, and that almost all legislative behavior is      explainable by the legislators' ideologies, party      affiliations or constituents' desires. So reformers hurling      charges of corruption often retreat to the charge that the      ``real'' corruption is invisible--a speech not given, a      priority not adopted. That charge is impossible to refute by      disproving a negative. Consider some corruption innuendos      examined by Bradley Smith, a member of the Federal Election      Commission, in his new book ``Unfree Speech: The Folly of      Campaign Finance Reform.''       In April 1999, Common Cause, McCain's strongest      collaborator, made much of the fact that from 1989 through      1998 the National Rifle Association had contributed $8.4      million to congressional campaigns. However, that was just      two-tenths of one percent of total spending ($4 billion) by      congressional candidates during that period. How plausible is      it that NRA contributions--as distinct from the votes of 3      million NRA members--influenced legislators?       Common Cause made much of the fact that in the 10 years      ending in November 1996, broadcasting interests gave $9      million in hard dollars to federal and state candidates and      in soft dollars to parties. Gosh. Five election cycles.      Changing issues and candidates. Rival interests within the      industry (e.g., Time Warner vs. Turner). And broadcasters'      contributions were only one-tenth of one percent of the $9      billion spent by parties and candidates during that period.      Yet, as Smith says, Common Cause implies that this minuscule      portion of political money caused legislative majorities to      vote for bills they otherwise would have opposed, or to      oppose bills they otherwise would have supported, each time      opposing the wishes of the constituents that the legislators      must face again.       As Smith says, to prove corruption one must prove that      legislators are acting against their principles, or against      their best judgment, or against their constituents' wishes.      Furthermore, claims of corruption seem to presuppose that      legislators should act on some notion of the ``public good''      unrelated to the views of any particular group of voters.       Although reformers say there is ``too much money in      politics,'' if they really want to dilute the possible      influence of particular interests (the NRA, broadcasters,      whatever), they should favor increasing the size of the total      pool of political money, so that any interest's portion of      the pool will be small. And if reformers really want to see      the appearance of corruption, they should examine what their      reforms have done, have tried to do and have not tried to do.       Smith notes that incumbent reelection rates began to rise      soon after incumbents legislated the 1974 limits on      contributions, which hurt challengers more than well-known      incumbents with established financing networks. After 1974,      incumbents' fundraising advantages over challengers rose from      approximately 1.5 to 1, to more than 4 to 1.       Early 1997 versions of the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan      reform bills would have set spending ceilings--surprise!--     just where challengers become menacing to incumbents. Shays-     Meehan set $600,000 for House races. Forty percent of      challengers who had spent more than that in the previous      cycle won; only 3 percent of those who spent less won. In      1994, 1996 and 1998, all Senate challengers lost who spent      less than the limits proposed in the 1995 and 1997 versions      of McCain-Feingold.       There are interesting limits to McCain's enthusiasm for      limits. His bill does not include something President Bush      proposes--a ban on lobbyists making contributions to      legislators while the legislature is in session. Such a limit      would abridge the freedom of incumbents. Campaign finance      reform is about abridging the freedom of everyone but      incumbents--and their media megaphones.  Mr. McCONNELL. It was on the whole subject of unsubstantiated charges of corruption.  In my view, as I have said in the past, and repeat again today, when people make those kinds of charges, they need to back them up. I am quite pleased there have been no such charges made during this debate. It produces an atmosphere that makes it more likely that we can better legislate.  This is the second amendment offered in the last 24 hours that I think addresses some of the real problems in today's campaign finance reform debate. The first problem that we addressed yesterday was the problem of the millionaire candidate. It passed 70-30. It was an excellent amendment by Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine and Senator Durbin that actually addresses a real problem we have in today's campaigns.  Now we have another amendment that addresses a real problem. I commend the Senator from New Jersey for a thoughtful, well-researched, and, in my view, conclusive case, that the law that has been on the books for 30 years requiring the broadcasters to sell candidates time at the lowest unit rate ought to be complied with. None of us likes having to raise money. But it is my view that it is better than getting it out of the Treasury. I assume we will debate later whether or not the taxpayers ought to pick up the tab for our campaigns. If it is inconvenient for us, it ought to come through our efforts, not somebody else's.  As the Senator from New Jersey pointed out, and very persuasively, no matter how many hours there are in a day, with the declining value of the $1,000 contribution set in the 1970s, when a Mustang cost $2,700, and inflation in the television industry, far beyond the CPI--coupled with an apparent unwillingness that we have all experienced in our States of broadcast stations to cover campaigns in the news--we are, in effect, blacked out in terms of earned coverage.  The need for commercials is critical and essential. So what the Senator from New Jersey is saying is, let's apply the law, as originally written, correctly. Give candidates for public office an opportunity to get their message across. I think it is an amendment, the passage of which is necessary if we are going to address one of the real problems in the current campaign finance system.  This is something of a historic moment. I think Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and I are going to be on the same side of an amendment. Come to think of it, it is the second time.  I commend the Senator from Wisconsin, also, for his consistent opposition to amending the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. He and I have been on the same side of that issue over the years. This will be the second time we have been on the same side. I think it bodes well as we move forward in this debate.  In my judgment, we are actually improving this bill. I hope we will make other improvements as we go along. I intend to support the Torricelli amendment. I commend the Senator fromNew Jersey for a completely well-researched, documented case that addresses one of the real problems we have in American politics in the year 2001.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
