President, I rise today to introduce the ``Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2002,'' which will double funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, reauthorize the Center through fiscal year 2006, and increase Federal support to help NCMEC programs to find missing children across the Nation. I am pleased that Senator Carnahan joins me as the original cosponsor of this legislation.  It is painful to see on TV or in the newspapers photo after photo of missing children from every corner of the Nation. As a father and grandfather, I know that an abducted child is the worst nightmare. Unfortunately, it is a nightmare that happens all too often. Indeed, the Justice Department estimates that 2,200 children are reported missing each day of the year. There are approximately 114,600 attempted stranger abductions every year, with 3,000-5,000 of those attempts succeeding. These families deserve the assistance of the American people and helping hand of the Congress.  As the Nation's top resource center for child protection, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children spearheads national efforts to locate and recover missing children and raises public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation.  As a national voice and advocate for those too young to vote or speak up for their own rights, the NCMEC works to make our children safer. The Center operates under a Congressional mandate and works in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's, DOJ, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in coordinating the efforts of law enforcement officers, social service agencies, elected officials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and the public and private sectors to break the cycle of violence that historically has perpetuated these needless crimes against children.  NCMEC professionals have disturbingly busy jobs, they have worked on more than 90,000 cases of missing and exploited children since its 1984 founding, helping to recover more than 66,000 children, and raised its recovery rate from 60 percent in the 1980s to 94 percent today. The Center has set up a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour telephone hotline to take reports about missing children and clues that might lead to their recovery, a National Child Pornography Tipline to handle calls from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children through the production and distribution of pornography, and a CyberTipline to process online leads from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children. It has taken the lead in circulating millions of photographs of missing children, and serves as a vital resource for the 17,000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the U.S. in the search for missing children and the quest for child protection.  Today, NCMEC is truly a national organization, having established its headquarters in Alexandria, VA; and operating branch offices in five other locations throughout the country to provide hands-on assistance to families of missing children, advocating legislative changes to better protect children, conducting an array of prevention and awareness programs, and motivating individuals to become personally involved in child-protection issues. It has also grown into an international organization, establishing the International Division of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which has been working to fulfill the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The International Division provides assistance to parents, law enforcement, attorneys, nonprofit organizations, and other concerned individuals who are seeking assistance in preventing or resolving international child abductions.  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with only a $10 million annual DOJ grant, which will expire after fiscal year 2003. We should act now both to extend its authorization and increase the Center' s funding to $20 million each year through fiscal year 2006 so that it can continue to help keep children safe and families intact around the nation. There is so much more to be done to ensure the safety of our children, and the legislation we introduce today will help the Center in its efforts to prevent crimes that are committed against them.  The ``Protecting Our Children Comes First Act'' also increases Federal support of NCMEC programs to find missing children by allowing the U.S. Secret Service to provide forensic and investigative support to the NCMEC.  The bill also amends of the Missing Children's Assistance Act to coordinate the operation of the Center's CyberTipline to provide all online users an effective means of reporting Internet-related child sexual exploitation, such as child pornography, child enticement, and child prostitution. Since its creation in 1998, the NCMEC CyberTipline has fielded almost 100,000 reports, which has allowed Internet users to quickly and easily report suspicious activities linked to the Internet.  Our legislation gives Federal authorities the authority to share the facts or circumstances of sexual exploitation crimes against children with state authorities without a court order. The bill also gives the NCMEC the power to make reports directly to state and local law enforcement officials instead of only through the FBI and other agencies. Finally, it provides that reports to NCMEC by Internet Service Providers may include additional information, such as the identity of a subscriber who sent a message containing child pornography, in addition to the required reporting of the contents of such a communication.  I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope both the Senate and the House of Representatives will promptly pass this bill to provide more Federal support for the NCMEC to continue to find missing children and protect exploited children across the country.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms.         Cantwell, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Domenici):  S. 3147. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that resources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and juvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Leahy, Grassley, Cantwell, Domenici, and Brownback, to introduce the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act.'' This bipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of planning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer more treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this bill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively by both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge for our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness are incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general population. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only about five percent of the American population has a mental illness, about 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. The Los Angeles County Jail, for example, typically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the country.  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is that jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the mentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the mentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes even sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally ill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and little or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit further offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. This ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within the prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in the mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient community-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will necessarily involve collaboration between the mental healthsystem and criminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater collaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug or alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the federal, state, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse treatment systems to work together at each level of government to establish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The bill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public safety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also would promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious mental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and effectively as possible.  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the establishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed at the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney General with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, the bill requires that two entities jointly submit a single grant application on behalf of a community.  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration would receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that grant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public safety, and if the program they propose would have the active participation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application has the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.  The bill permits grant funds to be used for a variety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. First, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, such as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender who has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and drug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance training of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who must know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. Third, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert non-violent offenders with severe and persistent mental illness from the criminal justice system into treatment. Finally, correctional facilities may use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their transition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more options for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill builds on legislation that I introduced with Congressman Ted Strickland two years ago. That measure, which became law, authorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental health courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable the criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment solution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring accountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing today would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental health courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment services that support such courts.  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to communities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the federal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of Social Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new ways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism among mentally ill adults and juveniles.  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for criminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders from the criminal justice system.  This is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I encourage my colleagues to support this important measure. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3147       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender      Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16      percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and      prisons have a mental illness.       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention, over 20 percent of youth in the      juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems,      and many more have co-occurring mental health and substance      abuse disorders.       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally      Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious      mental illness will come into contact with the American      criminal justice system at some point in their lives.       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into      contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the      diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional      disorder.       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious      mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice      system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and      many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor,      nonviolent offenses.       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or      emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or      juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and      psychological interventions that integrate treatment,      rehabilitation, and support services.       (7) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of      July 1999, 75 percent of mentally ill inmates had previously      been sentenced at least once to time in prison or jail or      probation.       (8) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance      abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure      the provision of services for those with mental illness or      co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can      reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile      corrections facilities, while providing improved public      safety.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by      facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice,      juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance      abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders      with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and      substance abuse disorders;       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental      health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance      abuse treatment options;       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through      diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent      offenders with mental illness;       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system      personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders      and the appropriate response to people with such illnesses;       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment      personnel about criminal offenders with mental illness and      the appropriate response to such offenders in the criminal      justice system; and       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or      juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment      personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and      other support services such as housing, job placement,      community, and faith-based organizations.
