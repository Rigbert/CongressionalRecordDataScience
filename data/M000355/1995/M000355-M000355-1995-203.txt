 President, since last week, the full Senate has debated the arduous task of reforming a welfare system that has failed in its mission to eliminate poverty in America. Throughout our history, Americans have held to the belief that hard work and investment are the staples for family security and economic success. Yet, our Nation's welfare system has turned away from these basic principles. Working Americans complain that the welfare system promotes dependence and waste, while many welfare recipients struggle for the chance to work their way off the rolls.  Since 1965, America has infused $5.4 trillion into a public assistance network composed of almost 80 State and Federal programs. At best, the War on Poverty has produced temporary gains for poor families. While the national poverty rate dropped from a high of 22 percent in 1959 to an historic low of 11 percent in 1973, the poverty rate had risen to 15 percent by 1993. Most tragically, our welfare system has failed to assist our Nation's most vulnerable families. From 1969 to 1993, the child poverty rate declined by less than 1 percent of families headed by single mothers.  America's welfare system has lost its focus. In the 1930's, the Roosevelt Administration created the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program to help widows, orphans, and families suffering from abandonment or unemployment through difficult financial times. Today, those in need must navigate an array of conflicting bureaucratic rules and program divisions that discourage work, and many times, family unity. Instead of liberating Americans from financial crisis, today's AFDC system fosters a detrimental cycle of generational welfare reliance.  Few dispute that welfare reform is necessary. Without change, single-parent families will continue to suffer from poverty, and the escalating cost of the status-quo will overwhelm our Nation's financial resources. Democrats and Republicans alike are focused on similar goals--State flexibility and the end of unconditional assistance. But how can these goals be attained? The answer is real, commonsense reform.  First, we must fundamentally restructure the way our welfare system works. Our patchwork system of Federal and State welfare programs has produced a complex and inconsistent means for distributing benefits. In increasing numbers, States are requesting Federal waivers to restructure federally defined welfare programs so they can effectively deliver the services their citizens need. President Clinton recently promised the Nation's Governors a waiting period of only 120 days for the processing of their waiver requests. However, states need more than a fast-track system for bureaucratic review. They need real flexibility--the authority to develop public assistance programs that promote work, rather than automatic check writing.  Americans are increasingly concerned that an unconditional entitlement to welfare is displacing the desire for independence with the expectation of permanent dependence. To successfully reduce poverty, welfare must focus on employment, not exemptions to work. Over the years, we have tried a variety of complex, federally dominated work programs. Efforts to attain sustainable employment for AFDC recipients have become little more than a paper chase under the current Job Opportunities and Basic Skills [JOBS] Program. Despite good intentions, the JOBS Program has failed and must be repealed. To effectively respond to the day-to-day reality of the job market, States should be empowered with the authority to develop and adjust their work programs according to recipient need and local job resources.  Welfare recipients also should know that public assistance is not free money but an investment in their work potential. Welfare must be contingent on real work. While appropriate job training is important, we must not lose sight of the fact that classroom lessons mean nothing unless one can actually apply them to the workplace. Real work also means real responsibility. Those who refuse to work without sound cause should see their actions directly reflected in their welfare benefit. Just like every other American employee, an hour's work should equal an hour's pay. In addition, a 5-year lifetime limit focuses recipients on welfare's fundamental purpose--support for the attainment of self-sufficiency.  Second, reform should focus on abolishing abuse. I don't know of one taxpayer that wants Food Stamps used for the purchase of drugs or alcohol. I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my concern with fraud in our Nation's largest welfare program. I have dedicated considerable effort to legislative proposals that would curtail waste, fraud, and abuse in the Food Stamp Program. The welfare reform bill before us meets this challenge and helps ensure that food stamps are used for their intended purpose: to help needy Americans buy food to supplement their diet.  I am also pleased to see that this bill retains child nutrition programs at the Federal level while successfully reducing excessive Federal regulation. These programs work and have successfully ensured the health and nutritional well-being of future generations of children.  Third, it is essential that welfare reform uphold a standard of responsibility to our Nation's children and families. Illegitimacy in America is becoming the rule rather than the exception. The facts are alarming. Today, 1 in 3 children are born out-of-wedlock--by the turn of the century, this figure will be 1 in 2. Most disturbing of all is the drastic increase in out-of-wedlock births among our youth. In 1960, 15 percent of births to women under the age of 20 were out-of-wedlock. By 1992, this figure had increased to 71 percent.  Today, the specter of poverty haunts single mothers and their children like never before. From 1976 to 1992, the proportion of single, never-married women receiving AFDC more than doubled, from 21 percent to almost 52 percent. Yet welfare assistance has failed to shepherd these needy families to a better future. The Congressional Budget Office found that single women receiving AFDC in 1992 were poorer than in 1976, even though they worked in about the same proportions.  The increasing number of single mother families living in poverty is fueled by the ease with which absent fathers ignore their parental responsibilities. To reverse this devastating trend, we must take seriously the necessity of paternity identification. Fatherhood is not a one-time-only event--it is a lifelong responsibility and should be treated as such.  Paternity identification is an essential step toward the improved collection of child support. In Kentucky, efforts in paternity identification have head a substantial impact upon the collection of child support for AFDC dependent families. In fiscal year 1994, 7 counties ranked in the top 10 for both paternity identification and child support collection.  Without a doubt, dead-beat dads must be held accountable for their child support obligations. In 1991, fathers owed $17.7 billion in child support payments. Only 67 percent, however, was paid--a shortfall of $5.8 billion. If a father refuses to support his child, States have the right to make his parental responsibility crystal-clear by suspending his driver's or professional license.  Mr. President, real reform means transforming welfare from a dead-end street to a bridge toward self-sufficiency and family security. Last year in Owensboro, KY, three mothers shared with me their personal experiences in the welfare system. They were deeply concerned about the future--how they would care for the health and well-being of their children as they tried to work their way off welfare. As they spoke, it was clear that their success depended on their tenacity to break free from the confines of a welfare system that promises much but delivers little. It is for them and each of our Nation's 5 million AFDC families that we must reject the status-quo of an empty entitlement system and return our welfare system to the basics of fairness, work, and family security.                  the maintenance of effort amendment
