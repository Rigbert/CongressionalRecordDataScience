Speaker, I rise today to recognize the centennial of one of southwest Michigan's most famous landmarks: the three-story red lighthouse located in the beautiful community of South Haven. Artifacts such as this lighthouse are of tremendous historical value. These symbols of our heritage stand as a remembrance for generations to come. This 11-foot wide, 36-foot tall structure was constructed in 1903. Its red-case iron structure has always been one of its defining characteristics, making it easily identifiable to lighthouse enthusiasts and area historians. In fact, a new book has been published by the Michigan Maritime Museum depicting history of this lighthouse in honor of its 100th anniversary. As all folks who live, work, or grew up on the shores of Lake Michigan know, lighthouses provide an invaluable service to communities and commerce of the Great Lakes. I am proud that the South Haven lighthouse has reached its 100th anniversary and I am hopeful that it will survive 100 years more.                          ____________________
