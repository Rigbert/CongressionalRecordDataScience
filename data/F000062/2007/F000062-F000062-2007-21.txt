 President. I rise today to introduce a series of bills, S. 2386, S. 2387, S. 2388, and S. 2390, designed to better prepare for catastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently devastated Southern California.  The Nation watched as these fires swept, uncontrolled, through several counties.  They caused the evacuation of an estimated 750,000 people--the largest evacuation in California history.  They burned more than 500,000 acres. Destroyed more than 2,000 homes.  Killed 10 people. Injured 130.  The financial damage is estimated in the billions.  Simply put: This was a major disaster.  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire losses just 4 years ago.  We must face the fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California's future, and the future of other states.  California is tinder-dry. Global warming is real, leading to extended droughts and longer fire seasons.  Fires are larger, and they burn hotter and with more intensity.  More and more people are living in areas at high risk of wildfire. There are more than 5 million homes in California alone in this high-threat ``wildland-urban interface.''  Across the rest of the country, there are nearly 40 million more homes in the wildland-urban interface.  So the question comes: What can be done?  There is no doubt that we cannot fully eliminate wildfires.  But I believe we can take steps now to better protect communities, to improve firefighting capabilities, and to improve relief and recovery aid.  The four bills introduced today will get this process started. They are the Fire Safe Community Act, which would establish new incentives for communities at risk of wildfires to adopt a new model Fire Safe ordinance; the Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act, to make sure that qualified individuals, displaced by major disasters, can make their mortgage and rental payments; the Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act, to increase the amount of Federal dollars available to homeowners whose rebuilding costs outstrip their insurance coverage; and the Managing Arson Through Criminal History, MATCH, Act, requiring states to create registries of convicted arsonists.  Let me go into greater detail on each of these bills.                        Fire Safe Community Act  This bill will help protect our communities from the catastrophic effects of wildfires.  Most importantly, it does three key things: it instructs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a model ordinance that will serve as a baseline for communities seeking to protect their homes and property from wildfire; it encourages local participation by allowing for greater Federal reimbursement of firefighting costs in communities that adopt the model ordinance; and it creates a grant program to encourage responsible development practices that meet model guidelines in the wildland-urban interface.  In effect, the Federal Government would become the partner to local governments as they seek to make their communities fire-safe.  As I have said, we can never stop wildfires. But we can take importantsteps to make these fires less destructive.  This bill starts with the first step of creating a model ``Fire Safe'' ordinance--with clear, unambiguous language that sets a national standard for how to address all aspects of fire threat.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology would provide this standard guideline for communities, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fire Administration.  States are also encouraged to adopt model ordinances tailored to the needs of their own communities for fire-safe development.  These guidelines will address water supply, construction materials and techniques, defensible space, vegetation management, and infrastructure standards.  The next step is to put this model ordinance to use.  The bill authorizes a $25 million per year grant program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of Grants and Training.  It will help communities implement these standards, and bring the safest development practices to their neighborhoods.  This grant program will be available to local governments located in the wildlife-urban interface, and to high-threat regions that have adopted--or plan to adopt--the model ordinance.  They will have the option of adopting either the federal model ordinance, or one produced by their own state.  As further incentive, this bill would improve Fire Management Assistance Grants to communities adopting a model ordinance.  Today under the Fire Management Assistance Grant program, the Federal Government covers 75 percent of the cost of fighting wildfires.  Under this bill, communities adopting a model ordinance would be eligible for federal reimbursement of up to 90 percent of their firefighting costs.  The Fire Safe Community Act will also make grants available to States to help them compile their own fire maps.  The mapping grants will be matched 50-50 by State funds, and will encourage development of comprehensive fire hazard maps that indicate the exact locations of high-threat fire areas.  This vital information will aid firefighting efforts at all levels.  It's important to note that the model ordinances at the core of this bill are not mandatory--they would provide voluntary guidelines that communities can adopt, or not.  It does not step on the toes of local government. Rather, it would help all of us reach a common goal.  I come from local government--I'm 9 years a mayor, 9 years a county supervisor--and I recognize that zoning is the province of local government.  But we have a real problem here: We know that development in the wildland-urban interface is accelerating, making fires more costly.  So we need to take steps to improve fire safety in these areas.  This bill is an important step toward becoming better prepared.  Now I want to discuss two bills intended to improve recovery aid after disaster strikes.                Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act  This bill will provide much-needed relief to families hit hard by disaster--including people displaced by the recent fires.  It would authorize FEMA to make mortgage and rental assistance available for qualified individuals in communities designated by the President as disaster areas.  It is based on an important point: While catastrophic wildfires and other disasters can destroy homes, they don't relieve people of the financial obligations that come with home ownership or lease agreements.  In most cases, these payments must still be made, even if the residence has been wiped out.  This burden is too much for many families. They incur additional expenses--such as hotel or lodging costs--that come with being displaced following a major disaster.  FEMA used to provide mortgage and rental assistance. But it was eliminated by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.  This bill would reauthorize the program, and make several changes to ensure that assistance is provided only to those most in need.  First, to qualify for assistance applicants must demonstrate that they face significant economic hardships and suffered disaster-related income loss.  The disaster-related income loss must fit into one of the following categories: Your employer, or your own business, must be located in the area declared a major disaster by the President; you lose your job because your employer or business has a significant business relationship with a company located within the Presidentially declared disaster area; or you live in a Presidentially declared disaster area, and have suffered financially due to travel restrictions and road closures post-disaster.  To qualify for this aid, applicants must also provide proof that their employment was discontinued as a result of disaster.  They must also show imminent delinquency, eviction, dispossession, or foreclosure.  Finally, this assistance is available only for up to 18 months, and is subject to income caps.  Only households with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, in high-cost States such as California, would be eligible.  Households in lower-cost States could be eligible if their annual adjusted gross incomes do not exceed $75,000.                   disaster rebuilding assistance act  This second disaster relief bill would increase the amount of money FEMA can provide--for rebuilding and temporary housing--in high-cost States such as California.  It is designed to help disaster victims whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage.  Sadly, many Californians hit by the wildfires are now learning that their insurance coverage was insufficient.  This is a real problem in California; in fact, California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner estimates that as many as 25 percent of the victims of the recent fires may be underinsured.  Let me be clear: This bill will not cover the full costs of rebuilding.  But it will help close the gap, for qualified households in areas declared by the President to be disaster areas.  Today, FEMA can provide up to roughly $28,000 to individuals and households whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage.  This assistance can be used for rebuilding costs, as well as temporary housing.  This bill would increase this amount to $50,000.  The legislation also gives the President the discretion to increase this cap, if necessary, to cover rebuilding expenses in high-cost States.  I believe this bill will provide an important step toward giving Americans the chance they need to rebuild their lives after suffering through a major disaster.  The last bill in this package takes aim at criminal arsonists.              managing arson through criminal history act  This bill--also known as the MATCH Act--is the Senate version of a bill introduced in the House by California Representatives Mary Bono and Adam Schiff.  It would establish Federal and State arson registries; require convicted arsonists to register and update certain specified information for 5 years after a first conviction, 10 years after a second conviction, and for life after a third conviction; and authorize grants and incentives so that these registries will be operational within 3 years.  It is important that we improve our ability to keep track of arsonists, because it is clear that some of these recent wildfires were no accident.  The Santiago Fire in Orange County--which burned at least 27,000 acres--has officially been declared an arson fire.  Would-be arsonists tried to start new fires as the wildfires raged.  In San Diego County, authorities arrested an adult and a juvenile suspected of starting a blaze in Vista.  In San Bernardino, a suspect was charged with setting a brush fire near Victorville.  There were several arson-related arrests in Los Angeles County--one suspect died in a gunfight with police.  The arsonist who started the Santiago fire remains at-large.  There is a reward--it now stands at $250,000--but law-enforcement officialssay an arrest will likely depend on a tip from the public.  It does not have to be that way.  This bill would give fire investigators and law-enforcement officials up-to-date information on potential arsonists.  This is common-sense legislation. It will provide a readily accessible database, and help investigators rule out persons of interest and zero in on arson suspects.  We owe it to our brave firefighters to give fire investigators this important new tool, so they can help bring arsonists to justice.  Catastrophic wildfires are not going away. In fact, the evidence strongly suggests they will occur with greater frequency and ferocity.  But we can take important steps--now--to make our communities safer.  To strengthen our firefighting capabilities.  To ensure that more relief and recovery aid is provided to victims, so they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.  These bills are not a panacea. But they are an important first step. I urge my colleagues to vote for them.                                 ______                                       By
