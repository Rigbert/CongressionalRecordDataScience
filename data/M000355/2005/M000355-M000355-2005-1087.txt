 President, today I honor a young and accomplished musician from my home State of Kentucky. Patrick Henry Hughes, a17-year-old from Louisville, is the recipient of the 2005 VSA arts Panasonic Young Soloists Award, a national award reserved for young musicians with disabilities. Patrick has received the VSA arts of Kentucky Young Soloists Award yearly since 2001.  Patrick was born without eyes and is completely blind. He also has webbing in his arms and legs that prevent him from walking. These handicaps have not hampered his musical or intellectual ability, however, as Patrick is clearly a star on the rise.  An accomplished pianist and vocalist, Patrick performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on May 16, 2005. He has also performed at the Grand Ole Opry, and has shared the stage with Emmy Award-winning singer Pam Tillis, county music band Lonestar, and country music stars Lane Brody, Chad Brock, Bryan White, and Faith Hill.  In addition to playing the piano and singing tenor in his school's chorus, Patrick plays the trumpet in his school's concert and jazz bands. He has been selected to perform in many All-State band and choral festivals, receiving several distinguished awards for each. Patrick currently studies with Hinda Ordman, a Juilliard graduate.  Clearly a talented musician, Patrick also strives scholastically. He is a junior at Atherton High School and participates in the international baccalaureate program where he has maintained a 3.99 grade point average. Patrick received the Presidential Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement from both President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Louisvillian Patrick Henry Hughes for his personal and musical accomplishments.                          ____________________[Pages S7063-S7064]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    TRIBUTE TO PATRICK HENRY HUGHES  Mr. McCONNELL.
