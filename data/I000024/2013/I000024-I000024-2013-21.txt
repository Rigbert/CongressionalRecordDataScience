I hope two things come from this. First of all, that we go ahead andpass the NDA bill and then make sure that next year we are there to make sure this doesn't happen again in the same way it has happened.  I ask unanimous consent to have some testimonials printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Oklahomans Are Hit Hard by ObamaCare       It took me three days to sign up for ObamaCare due to      website glitches. When I finally got through, I saw my own      premium rise 20% and my out of pocket costs go up. But this      is nothing compared to what Oklahomans are experiencing. In      just a week's time, I received more than 400 stories from my      constituents impacted by ObamaCare.       Julia in Broken Arrow said that to keep her family's      current plan, they will pay an additional $1,400 in premiums      and another $4,000 out-of-pocket.       Lloyd, from Tecumseh, says he is dropping his current      insurance and choosing to pay the penalty after learning his      monthly premium will jump from $592 to $1,952.       Stacy, a mother of three in Oklahoma City, shared with me      that her family's health insurance premiums will increase      20%, with an additional $6,000 in out of pocket costs per      person, up to $18,000.       Joy of Oklahoma City said her family's deductible is      increasing by $2,000 and they will have to pay out of pocket      for prescriptions. This will create significant financial      difficulties for them as her husband is battling cancer.       Greg and his family, who live in Oklahoma City, are worried      about having to choose between making a monthly mortgage      payment of $1,100 or an insurance payment of $1,197.       Jim, with employer coverage in Choctaw, is facing a      deductible increase of $4,000.       Janice is currently on a COBRA plan in Sapulpa. On a new      exchange plan, she will be paying $240 more each month.       Paul, who says he is in good health and rarely requires a      visit to the doctor's office, will be paying $70 per month.       Ralph, who has employer-based insurance in Durant, will pay      $80 more each month.       David from Owasso let me know his family's premium and      deductible will increase by $318 a month and $500,      respectively.       Linda in Pryor says ObamaCare has doubled her deductible      and increased her out of pocket costs by 30%.       Darrell, who has a group plan in Cashion, is expecting his      premiums to go up 40% and his deductible to double.       Ed, a widow in Oklahoma City, will be paying $250 more in      premiums every month.       Linda, from Chelsea, says her family's deductible has      increased $700.       Roger, who is on a fixed income in Comanche, says his      premiums have doubled.       Peggy in Boise City said her deductible has increased 250%.       An employer in Tulsa says he must choose between a 128%      premium increase or a 500% increase in deductible for his      staff.       A small business owner in Oklahoma City reports that the      cost of the insurance he provides to his employees has gone      up 41% and will cost him $1,000 per month more. Because of      the mandate to have insurance, more of his employees are now      electing coverage, which will drive his costs up even more.       A family of four in Shawnee is facing a 20% increase in      premiums and a $1,500 increase in deductible.       A single father of two and small business owner in Lawton      says he will be paying 24% more in monthly premiums.       A family of three in Miami is choosing to go without      insurance and pay the penalty rather than see their premium      double and deductible increase by $3,200.       Nancy from Oklahoma City said she probably should be one to      support Obamacare due to her income, but can't because ``it      is not the right answer''. She believes the government      doesn't have the right to tell her how to live or define what      is ``affordable'' for her.       Sharon from Oklahoma City went onto the website. Despite      entering in her full name, social security number and      address, her identity was not able to be verified. She said      she spent 5 weeks trying to get someone to assist her and at      this rate she is ready to give up and pay the fine.       Erin from Beggs is a wife and a mother of three. She was      dropped from her insurance company and instructed to enroll      in Obamacare. She has tried to access the website since it      was ``fixed'' and has not been able to get past the first      step. She is repeatedly kicked off and has to re-enter her      information every time she goes on the site.       Janice from Sapulpa spent over 40 hours attempting      unsuccessfully to apply for insurance on Healthcare.gov. She      finally asked for them to send her a paper application and      when it arrived, it was in Spanish.       The OKC Chamber of Commerce can no longer offer insurance      plans to its members since the plans don't meet mandated      requirements, impacting 1,400 businesses.       A 50-year-old female from Chandler said she and her husband      were dropped from their insurance plan. The plan offered to      her now includes maternity care and pediatric dental care--     neither of which she needs--and will cost over 200% more per      month.       Cyndee of Suphur lost her family's insurance plan while she      was still in a critical time frame for treating her cancer.      She called this a ``scary'' experience. She had this plan for      10 years until ObamaCare deemed it unworthy. Cyndee wrote to      me about her new plan under ObamaCare and said: ``No one      wants affordable insurance more than me, but at $1,100 a      month, just for me--one person--it's certainly not      affordable.''       A married father of two from Muskogee was also dropped from      his insurance plan. The plan offered to him as comparable in      coverage would cost him and his family 46% more than what      they used to pay.       Another male, from Edmond, was dropped from his employer      sponsored health care. The plan he had through his employer      provided him with a 75% employer subsidy on his deductible      and covered 100% of his medical bills.       Rockey from Enid said he and his wife's hours were cut at      work to 25 hours a week because of the employer mandate. Now      that they work part time, they are no longer eligible for      coverage through their employer and Obamacare is not      affordable for them.       Jessie from Moore said her husband's employer is      considering dropping spouse and dependent coverage due to the      rising costs of health insurance.       Debbie of Frederick said she is fortunate enough to still      have insurance through her employers, but because of mandates      in the Act, their family doctor of 30 years has had to      eliminate hospital visits from his services. Any time Debbie      is in the hospital, the doctor who knows her health the best      can no longer be on the front lines of helping make health      decisions with her in the most crucial circumstances.       Donna from Elgin said not only have her insurance costs      gone up, but two of her doctors have left their practice. She      cannot afford the new health insurance, and is having      troubling finding new doctors.       Roderick from Shawnee said within a three-month period,      three of his doctors have chosen to retire. He is worried      about finding new doctors his insurance will cover.       This is devastating. We absolutely need to bring the cost      of healthcare down, but ObamaCare is clearly doing the      opposite. My colleagues and I have supported common-sense      ideas like purchasing insurances across state lines or      enacting tort reform. We could have started here, but      instead, President Obama forced America down a destructive      path that will likely end in a single-payer option. We must      repeal ObamaCare and put common sense healthcare reform in      its place. I'll continue this fight to ensure Oklahomans have      quality, affordable health care options.
