 Lastly, I understand that this amendment prohibits the Secretary from requiring that communities conduct actual counts of families and youth who are newly added to the HUD definition in HUD-mandated homelessness counts. Am I correct that this provision does not prohibit the Secretary from requiring communities to provide estimates of those who are newly added to the definition, so that communities may have a better sense of the shelter and housing needs of all families, children, and youth who will be considered homeless by HUD under this legislation?
