There has been a lot of talk about single payer. There was a lot of talk about it early on in the debate about ObamaCare. I recall in observations made by President Obama that this was the first step toward single payer. I understand that--well, I know that the former Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, had the same plan, that ObamaCare was the first step toward single payer. All you are doing is just saying, OK, if that is the goal, bring it to a vote.
