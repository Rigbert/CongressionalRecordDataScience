 President, I rise to pay tribute to a group of Kentucky's brightest students who, by winning a number of prestigious awards for studying history, have proven themselves to be the leaders of the future. I am referring to the Kentucky winners of the National History Day 2012 contest, which was recently held at nearby College Park, MD, June 10 to 14.  The contingent of students from Kentucky that made the trip was selected by the Kentucky Junior Historical Society, which held a statewide history contest in Frankfort, the State capital, last April. At that event, 68 Kentucky students qualified for the national finals.  In all, 62 Kentucky students from the 6th through 12th grades made the trip to our Nation's capital region, accompanied by about 40 family members and teachers. I was very pleased to have a chance to visit with them during their trip.  The group faced stiff competition. At National History Day 2012, there were 2,800 students competing, representing all 50 States and four international schools. Six Kentucky students stood out from their peers and garnered nationwide recognition for their history projects. Those students are:  Joanna Slusarewicz, of Winburn Middle School and Fayette County, winner of the Salute to Freedom Award and third place, individual documentary, junior division. Her entry was titled ``Respectfully Submitted, Dorothea Dix.''  Neha Kadambi and Jamie Smith, of Winburn Middle School and Fayette County, winners of the Leadership in History Award for group exhibit, junior division. Their entry was titled ``The Fight Without a War: India's Revolutionary Road to Independence.''  Meenakshi Singhal and Daryn Smith, of Winburn Middle School and Fayette County, winners of Best of State: Junior Division. Their entry was titled ``Charles Darwin: What Do You Mean Survival of the Fittest?''  Emma Roach-Barrette, of Menifee County High School and Menifee County, winner of Best of State: Senior Division and individual documentary, senior division finalist. Her entry was titled ``Dead Men Do Tell Tales.''  Every student from Kentucky who made this trip can be immensely proud of his or her accomplishments, and I hope they will continue to engage in the study of history for the remainder of their time in school and beyond. History plays such a large role in the events of today. We continue to be influenced by historic decisions made in this very Chamber.  I also appreciate these students' teachers for helping to foster their love of history, specifically, Theresa Buczek and Michelle Cason of Winburn Middle School and Debra Craver of Menifee County High School. And I want to thank the Kentucky Junior Historical Society and its parent body, the Kentucky Historical Society, for sponsoring this competition and making the trip possible for these students. Established in 1836, the Kentucky Historical Society is committed to helping Kentuckians understand, cherish, and share history.  I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in recognizing the accomplishments of Kentucky's winners of the National History Day 2012 contest and of every Kentucky student who competed.We wish them well in their future studies and are proud they represent the Bluegrass State.                          ____________________
