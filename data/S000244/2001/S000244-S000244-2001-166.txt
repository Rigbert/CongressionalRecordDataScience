 H.R. 2408 will require the Attorney General to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary regarding the effectiveness of the State Justice Institute. This report would be due by October 1, 2002.  Congress established SJI as a private, nonprofit corporation in 1984. Its stated purpose is to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in State courts. SJI is to accomplish this goal by providing funds to State courts and other national organizations or nonprofit organizations which support the State courts. SJI also fosters coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary in areas of mutual concern.  Since becoming operational in 1987, the institute has awarded more than $125 million in grants to support over 1,000 projects; another $40 million in matching requirements has been generated from other public and private funding sources. As noted, H.R. 2048 would require the Attorney General to study the operations of the institute and release a report on its effectiveness. After 14 years and $165 million in grants, it is now more appropriate to take a closer look at the efficiency and effectiveness of this institute and the project it supports.  Madam Speaker, this concludes my description of the bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time
