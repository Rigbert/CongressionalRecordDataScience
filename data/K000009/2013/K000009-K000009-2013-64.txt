 High fuel costs are an enormous burden on America's families and our military. It is also a burden on every branch of the service in which it costs us $400 a gallon to deliver 1 gallon of gasoline--fully costed--to the troops at the front line.  Thank you again to Chairman Bill Young and to Ranking Member Visclosky for their leadership and to our ranking member on the full committee, the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Lowey), and to the gentleman from Kentucky, Chairman Rogers, for working with all of our members in order to meet the needs of our Nation and of our Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force--those who serve the American people every day so nobly.
