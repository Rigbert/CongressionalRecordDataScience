 President, as most of my colleagues know, agriculture is a crucial industry for Iowa. The small, independent family farmer is an important thread which holds together my State's cultural, economic and social fabric. In fact, the family farmer is one of the best things about Iowa's heritage. My colleagues are well aware that I'm committed to preserving and supporting this valuable member of Iowa's communities.  Agriculture is a risky business. I know that from personal experience, I've lived and worked on a farm all my life. But these days, farmers feel especially vulnerable. ``Merger-mania'' has been running rampant, with large companies joining forces to create new business giants in every sector of the economy, including agriculture.  The agriculture sector has witnessed a number of mega-mergers and alliances affecting grain and livestock. And the independent producer is seeing fewer choices of who to buy from and who to sell to. More and more family farmers and independent producers are feeling the pressure and impact of concentration in agriculture. Good men and women who have farmed for years and years are going out of business. Yet, the independent farmer is one of the most efficient businessman in our Nation's economy. That's why the United States can feed itself and a good portion of the world.  I've said before that I am not of the belief that all mergers are in and of themselves wrong or unfair to family farmers. But we need to make sure that open and fair access to the marketplace is preserved for everyone. We need to make sure that large businesses are not acting in a predatory or anti-competitive manner. We need to make sure that family farmers and independent producers can compete on a level playing field. That's how we can keep our economy strong, our agricultural community vibrant and competitive, and our consumers happy.  Now we've heard that a Delaware Court has ordered Tyson Foods and IBP to resume their merger discussions, because Tyson Foods did not have a contractually permissible reason to terminate its merger agreement with IBP when it announced in March that it was rescinding the transaction. While I do not want to take issue with the court's findings, I am concerned about the fact that this merger looks like it will go through and, consequently, the meat industry will consolidate even further. Beginning last September when Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette/Rawhide Holdings Corporation, then Smithfield Foods, and finally Tyson Foods started a bidding war for IBP, I pushed the Justice Department to carefully scrutinize each possible business combination. In January, I wrote the Justice Department urging it to vigorously review the Tyson-IBP transaction from all angles, and to consult with the Agriculture Department to better ascertain the ramifications of such a merger on family farmers and independent producers. I would have thought that a combination of the Nation's largest poultry producer with the world's largest producer of beef and pork products would result in significantly reduced market opportunities, as well as increased the possibility of anti-competitive business practices. I shared the concerns of many farmers and producers that this transaction would adversely impact their ability to obtain fair prices for their products. I was also concerned that a combined IBP-Tyson presence in the retail market would negatively affect product choice and the prices consumers pay at the meat counter.  But the Justice Department determined earlier this year that the potential negative impact on competition was insufficient to sustain an injunction against the merger under the antitrust laws. Because the Justice Department completed its antitrust review in January, I understand that there is nothing further for the Department to do in terms of an antitrust review if the parties re-engage their merger talks in due course and without changes to the transaction. But I remain seriously concerned about the impact this merger will have on our farm community and I hope that, if this merger is ultimately completed, the Justice Department will carefully monitor whether a merged IBP-Tyson will have unintended consequences on competition in the meat economy and, if it does, take appropriate action.  Nevertheless, this development re-energizes my gut feeling that we need to somehow change the way ag mergers are reviewed and approved. So, today I'm re-introducing a bill I authored last year, the ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act,'' to help address some of the competition concerns of America's family farmers and independent producers. My bill will refocus the merger review process as it pertains to agri-business, and will enhance the Department of Agriculture's ability to address anti-competitive activity in agriculture. I believe that bringing to the table a greater understanding of ag producers' needs when ag mergers are reviewed is the biggest missing element to making the merger review process as fair as possible. Closing this gap is the heart of my proposal.  Several provisions in the ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' are based on proposals by the American Farm Bureau, the largest organization representing producers of agricultural commodities. However, I'd like to briefly discuss what I believe to be the most important components of this bill: the enhancement of the Department of Agriculture's role in the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, the creation of a new ``impact on family farmers and independent producers'' standard of review by the Department of Agriculture for ag mergers, and the expansion of the Department of Agriculture's ability to take regulatory and enforcement action with respect to anti-competitive and unfair practices in the agricultural sector.  Far more than the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Agriculture has extraordinary knowledge and expertise in agricultural matters. The Department of Agriculture formulates ag policy for the Nation, and works closely with the farm community about their various concerns. So, I believe that the Department of Agriculture is the office that can best assess the true impact of ag mergers and other business transactions on farmers, ranchers and independent producers. That is why my bill seeks to expand and enhance the role that the Department of Agriculture plays in the antitrust review of ag mergers.  Currently, when the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission assesses a proposed merger, the focus of their analysis is weighted heavily toward the impact of the transaction on consumers. However, agriculture is unique. The antitrust laws already recognize this with the ag cooperative exception. But I believe we need to go further by requiring the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to specifically take into account the effect ag mergers have on familyfarmers and producers. The ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' would do just that by requiring the Department of Agriculture to conduct an assessment of how a proposed ag transaction will affect family farmers and independent producers and their access to the market.  I realize that presently the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission informally consult with the Department of Agriculture when they consider ag mergers. But I believe that the current process does not sufficiently ensure that the farm community's concerns are being adequately addressed. The approach I advocate will ensure that producers' concerns and needs are fully discussed when federal agencies examine proposed ag business mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and openness for family farmers and independent producers, we can go a long way toward alleviating their understandable anxiety about an increasingly concentrated industry.  So my bill requires the Department of Agriculture to do a merger review that focuses on the needs of producers by examining whether the transaction would cause substantial harm to farmers' ability to compete in the marketplace. This review would be conducted simultaneously with the Justice Department's antitrust review, in order to minimize disruption to the current merger review process. Further, my bill encourages the parties and the Department of Agriculture to resolve concerns about the proposed merger during this timeframe. If its concerns are not satisfied, the Department of Agriculture has the ability to challenge the merger in federal court to either stop the merger, or to impose appropriate conditions or limitations on the proposed transaction.  Recognizing that the Department of Agriculture needs to have an individual who will perform this new antitrust responsibility, my bill calls for the creation of a Special Counsel for Competition Matters at the Department of Agriculture. My bill also provides for increased funding for competition matters, and authorizes additional specialized staff--including antitrust attorneys and economists--at the Justice Department and Department of Agriculture, to ensure that these agencies have the appropriate resources to accomplish the goals of this legislation.  Furthermore, under my bill, the competition protection authorities of the Department of Agriculture's Packers and Stockyards Division are extended to include anti-competitive practices by dealers, processors and commission merchants of all ag commodities. This expanded authority, based on provisions in the current Packers and Stockyards Act, will give the Department of Agriculture an increased ability to look at unfair, deceptive and predatory business practices by all ag businesses, not just packers and poultry farmers.  As my colleagues from rural States know, ag concentration is one of the most important issues in agriculture today. Other members here in Congress have introduced bills or are presently working to craft their own legislative proposals to respond to the concerns of America's farmers. I want it to be clearly understood that it is my desire to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the Bush Administration, so that we can make meaningful progress on this issue. I know that my proposal has its critics, but I am willing and ready to listen to their concerns and work on constructive changes to my bill. But I truly hope that we can achieve a bipartisan compromise sooner rather than later on this issue, so we can calm farmers' fears about high levels of ag concentration.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1076       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Procedure Before Secretary for Violations.--       (1) Complaint; hearing; intervention.--If the Secretary has      reason to believe that any dealer, processor, commission      merchant, or broker, has violated or is violating any      provision of this section, the Secretary shall cause a      complaint in writing to be served upon the dealer, processor,      commission merchant, or broker, stating the charges in that      respect, and requiring the dealer, processor, commission      merchant, or broker, to attend and testify at a hearing at a      time and place designated therein, at least 30 days after the      service of such complaint; and at such time and place there      shall be afforded the dealer, processor, commission merchant,      or broker, a reasonable opportunity to be informed as to the      evidence introduced against him (including the right of      cross-examination), and to be heard in person or by counsel      and through witnesses, under such regulations as the      Secretary may prescribe. Any person for good cause shown may      on application be allowed by the Secretary to intervene in      such proceeding, and appear in person or by counsel. At any      time prior to the close of the hearing the Secretary may      amend the complaint; but in case of any amendment adding new      charges the hearing shall, on the request of the dealer,      processor, commission merchant, or broker, be adjourned for a      period not exceeding 15 days.       (2) Report and order; penalty.--If, after such hearing, the      Secretary finds that the dealer, processor, commission      merchant, or broker, has violated or is violating any      provisions of this section covered by the charges, the      Secretary shall make a report in writing in which the      Secretary shall state his findings as to the facts, and      shall issue and cause to be served on the dealer,      processor, commission merchant, or broker, an order      requiring such dealer, processor, commission merchant, or      broker, to cease and desist from continuing such      violation. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be      reduced to writing and filed in the records of the      Department of Agriculture. The Secretary may also assess a      civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each such      violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty      to be assessed under this section, the Secretary shall      consider the gravity of the offense, the size of the      business involved, and the effect of the penalty on the      person's ability to continue in business. If, after the      lapse of the period allowed for appeal or after the     affirmance of such penalty, the person against whom the      civil penalty is assessed fails to pay such penalty, the      Secretary may proceed to recover such penalty by an action      in the appropriate district court of the United States.       (3) Amendment of report or order.--Until the record in such      hearing has been filed in a court of appeals of the United      States, as provided in subsection (c), the Secretary at any      time, upon such notice and in such manner as the Secretary      deems proper, but only after reasonable opportunity to the      dealer, processor, commission merchant, or broker, to be      heard, may amend or set aside the report or order, in whole      or in part.       (4) Service of process.--Complaints, orders, and other      processes of the Secretary under this section may be served      in the same manner as provided in section 5 of the Federal      Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45).       (c) Conclusiveness of Order; Appeal and Review.--       (1) Filing of petition; bond.--An order made under      subsection (b) shall be final and conclusive unless within 30      days after service the dealer, processor, commission      merchant, or broker, appeals to the court of appeals for the      circuit in which he has his principal place of business, by      filing with the clerk of such court a written petition      praying that the Secretary's order be set aside or modified      in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in      such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such      dealer, processor, commission merchant, or broker, will pay      the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs.       (2) Filing of record by secretary.--The clerk of the court      shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be      delivered to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall thereupon      file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided      in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. If before      such record is filed the Secretary amends or sets aside his      report or order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may      amend the petition within such time as the court may      determine, on notice to the Secretary.       (3) Temporary injunction.--At any time after such petition      is filed, the court, on application of the Secretary, may      issue a temporary injunction, restraining, to the extent it      deems proper, the dealer, processor, commission merchant, or      broker, and his officers, directors, agents, and employees,      from violating any of the provisions of the order pending the      final determination of the appeal.       (4) Evidence.--The evidence so taken or admitted, and filed      as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by      the court as the evidence in the case.       (5) Action by the court.--The court may affirm, modify, or      set aside the order of the Secretary.       (6) Additional evidence.--If the court determines that the      just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking      of additional evidence, the court shall order the hearing to      be reopened for the taking of such evidence, in such manner      and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem      proper.
