 President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] which would improve the base closure process by giving more control to the local community in reuse and redevelopment decisions. I am happy to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.  Last year I helped draft legislation that exempts military bases from the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. This legislation, the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, passed Congress and was signed into law by the President last October.  Under the new legislation, instead of being given the right of first refusal to base property, homeless assistance providers were given a seat at the reuse table with the local redevelopment authority. After a reuse plan is developed on the local level, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would review the plan to ensure that the needs of the homeless were met. After the HUD Secretary's approval, the Secretary of Defense would dispose of the buildings and property at the closing base.  While the new law is a substantial improvement over the old base closure and reuse law as well as the McKinney Act provisions, I think more should be done to empower communities, put base reuse decisions in the hands of local officials, and remove a Federal mandate.  The McCain/Feinstein amendment amends the new law by requiring the Secretary of Defense to simply consult with the Secretary of HUD over the reuse plan that is development by the redeveloped authority; it removes HUD's veto power over the reuse plan.  Homeless assistance providers would still be guaranteed a seat at the reuse table, and redevelopment authorities would still be required to accept expressions of interest for base property by homeless assistance groups and other interested parties. In addition, the Secretary of HUD would still review the final reuse plan to ascertain if the needs of the homeless have been met, and have the ability to consult with the redevelopment authority.  However, instead of the Secretary of HUD approving or disapproving the reuse plan, the Secretary of Defense would make the final decision. The Secretary of Defense would simply consult with the Secretary of HUD before making any property disposal decisions. Furthermore, the local redevelopment plan--developed by the local community and local elected officials--would be given deference by the Secretary of Defense.  I believe this amendment would substantially improve last year's Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act. Yet, this amendment does not go as far as the House of Representative's version of the Defense Authorization Act, which contains an amendment offered by Representatives Bilbray and Molinari.  The Bilbray-Molinari amendment would completely repeal the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act and exempt all military bases from the McKinney Act.  In addition to disrupting the base reuse process, the Bilbray-Molinari amendment would prevent homeless assistance providers from acquiring base property at no cost--even when communities want to transfer property for homeless use--and would not guarantee that they have a seat at the reuse table.  The McCain-Feinstein amendment still guarantees that homeless assistance providers will have an opportunity to acquire base property, but it puts base reuse decisions in the hands of local officials who know what is best for their communities.  This amendment also contains some other provisions that will assist in the base closure and reuse process. These include:  Base realignments: This provision would make a technical amendment to the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 by including base realignments, in addition to base closures. Current law requires the Secretary of Defense to dispose of base property in accordance with the sometimes outdated Federal Property and Administrative Services Act regulations. This provision allows the Secretary, in consultation with GSA, to prescribe general policies and methods for utilizing excess property and disposing of surplus property which are unique to base closure situations.  Lease back of base closure property: This provision would allow base closure property, that is still needed by the Department of Defense or another Federal agency, to be transferred to a local redevelopment authority provided that the LRA leases back the property to DOD or the Federal agency on favorable terms, that is: long term lease, nominal rent. This provision is needed to improve the planning and redevelopment of base closure property by providing local communities with certainty over the future use and availability of the property should the DOD or Federal occupant vacate.  Leasing proceeds: This provision would require that leasing proceeds for property at closing or realigning bases be deposited into the BRAC account, rather than a special Treasury account. This would treat leasing proceeds in the same fashion as sale proceeds from BRAC property. It would make additional funds available to base closure and environmental clean-up activities, thus speeding transfer of property to the local community and, thus, economic redevelopment of a closing base.  The McCain-Feinstein amendment makes various changes to existing law to improve the base closure and reuse process, and speed economic redevelopment of closing military bases. I urge my colleagues support of this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors in support of this amendment be placed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 The United States                                         Conference of Mayors,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: At our June 1995 meeting, The U.S.      Conference of Mayors adopted the attached resolution on ``A      National Action Plan on Military Base Closings.'' I would      draw your attention to item 6. This was adopted in response      to the House passed Molinari amendment to the 1996 Defense      Authorization Bill which would repeal the 1994 BRAC and      Homeless Assistance Act.       The U.S. Conference of Mayors believes that local      governments which do not desire transfer for homeless      services should not be subject to HUD approval of their reuse      plans. However, we support the ability of the federal      government to transfer property under existing law      provisions, at no cost to the local community or the homeless      provider, if so desired by the local government.       As the mayor of a city with a naval facility on the 1991      BRAC closure list, I am concerned about the House amendment      which would deny us the ability to implement the homeless      provisions of our local reuse plan.       In Seattle, our adopted reuse plan has a substantial      homeless component of which we are proud and anxious to      implement, as it will greatly add to our services to assist      homeless people in becoming self-sufficient. Without the      property transfer positions nullified in the Molinari      amendment, our critical homeless component is seriously      jeopardized.       Therefore, I urge you to provide for local flexibility and      control while not eliminating the homeless property transfer      provisions for local governments desiring such transfer.           Sincerely,                                                   Norman B. Rice,                                    Mayor of Seattle, President.
