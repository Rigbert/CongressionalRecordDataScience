Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman. I know he is going to withdraw this amendment, and I know it is subject, as well as he knows, to a point of order.  But I know he has done a lot of work on that. He and I have discussed the concerns that University of Maryland system has with respect to this matter, and I thank the gentleman for all the work he has done on this and look forward to looking at this with him. I am sure that the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut who chairs the committee, I suppose, that has jurisdiction over this will also be looking at this closely, and I look forward to working with the gentleman on that.
