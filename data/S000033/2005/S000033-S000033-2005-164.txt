 Speaker, this is actually one of the more absurd debates that I have ever heard in my life, and I think anybody who turns on the television and wonders what is going on here in Congress will then conclude that the reason that this institution is held in so low regard is because we have debates like this.  Let us look at what is going on in America today. The middle class is shrinking. Study after study shows that real wages for American workers are going down; and in the last 4 years, 4 million more Americans have entered the ranks of poverty. While the middle class shrinks, poverty increases. The richest people in America have never had it so good. CEOs of large corporations now make 500 times what their workers make. In America today we have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the history of our country and of any major country on Earth.  So what are we discussing here today? Are we going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage? Are we really going to protect family farmers from low prices? Are we going to stop the hemorrhaging of decent-paying jobs going to China? Do not be silly. We do not talk about that because corporate America does not fund those concerns.  The richest people in America said several years ago, Hey, yes, we are worth billions of dollars. That is not enough. We are going to contribute money to our Republican friends, and do you know what they are going to do? They are going to lower our taxes even more.  Mr. Speaker, we are here debating an issue that has zero impact on 98 percent of the American people. Nobody in the middle class, nobody in the working class, no low-income person pays one penny in the estate tax. All of the estate tax is paid by the wealthiest 2 percent. If their proposal passes, half of the benefits go to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent.  I want to ask my friends a question. This is a question. As my colleagues know, President Bush and the Republican leadership are supporting increased fees on our veterans. They are raising prescription drug fees for our veterans, and they want to charge a $250 co-pay for veterans of wars who enter the VA hospital. I would like to ask my Republican friends do they think it is a good idea to give tax breaks today to billionaires and to charge veterans significantly increased fees for health care. That is my question.  I am listening. I am listening. I do not hear an answer.  That is the answer. They are substantially increasing health care costs for veterans who have put their lives on the line defending this country. They are increasing our deficit, increasing our national debt, all on behalf of the richest people in this country. This bill is bought and paid for by millionaires and billionaires, and anyone who votes for it should be ashamed of themselves.                announcement by the speaker pro tempore
