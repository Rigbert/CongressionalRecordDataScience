Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 1733, was introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee member Susan Brooks from Indiana on March 27 of this year. The legislation went through regular order, and it was reported by the full committee, without amendment, by a voice vote.  This bill, H.R. 1733, requires the Secretary of Energy to review and update a report on the energy and environmental benefits of re-refining used lubricating oil. The bill reauthorizes a study that was previously directed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  We know that recycling used lubricating oil provides environmental benefits. It does, in fact, reduce energy consumption, and, yes, it produces high-quality products for consumers.  H.R. 1733 is a good bipartisan bill. I want to thank Mrs. Brooks for her hard work on this important issue and the other side of the aisle for working with us to bring the bill to the floor this afternoon.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1733, and I reserve the balance of my time.
