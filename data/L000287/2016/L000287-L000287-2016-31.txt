Speaker, I was unable to cast roll call votes on Monday, February 1, 2016. Had I been present, I would have cast the following votes:  I would have voted Aye on roll call vote 46; and  I would have voted Aye on roll call vote 47.  In addition, on Tuesday, February 2, 2016, I would like to clarify for the record that I strongly opposed the amendment under consideration and intended to vote Nay on roll call vote 50 during consideration of H.R. 3700.                          ____________________
