Speaker, I rise as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government. I rise today to pay a solemn tribute to the six employees of the U.S. Secret Service, one of whom is missing and five of whom we know have lost their lives as a result of the heinous attack on the Federal building in Oklahoma City. I rose yesterday in the context of the Oklahoma City resolution to talk about all the Federal employees.  I want to express my deepest sympathy to all the families, friends, and neighbors, but particularly, at this time to the family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues of the brave six Secret Service employees who we lost at Oklahoma City. This is a time of deep anguish and pain for the families of those killed, those injured, and those whose loved ones are still unaccounted for as they were doing the business of the people of the country.  Today we remember Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alan G. Whicher, who served as part of the detail protecting President Clinton, and then was transferred to what I am sure he and his family thought was a more tranquil environment in Oklahoma City. He lost his life.  Special Agent Cynthia L. Brown, appointed a special agent only a little over 1 year ago. She lost her life.  Special Agent Donald R. Leonard. His career assignments included the Vice-Presidential Protective Division. He lost his life.  Special Agent Mickey R. Maroney, who served with the Secret Service since 1971. He lost his life.  An investigative assistant, Kathy L. Seidl, appointed to the Secret Service in 1985, to the Oklahoma City office; and the office manager, Linda McKinney, who was recovered from the rubble only yesterday. She was the one I said was missing, and I was in error. She has been located.  I cannot say that I know the pain the people of Oklahoma City are experiencing. I do know very well the feeling of loss that communities all across this country feel for the people of Oklahoma City and for the loved ones of those who lost their lives.  Mr. Speaker, God blesses America, and he does so through the services of so many, and particularly through the service of those who are fallen but not forgotten. Let us, Mr. Speaker, resolve at this moment to embrace the wives and the children, the mothers and the fathers, the sisters and the brothers, the fellow colleagues, all those who love them dearly, in the fellowship of love and compassion. While they have lost an important part of their families, we must assure them they will always be a part of our larger family.  To the family and friends of those brave U.S. Secret Service agents and employees, my words today, of course, cannot express the sorrow for the loss of this Nation's best, and the gratitude for their sacrifice. I recall the words of President Lincoln, and I quote:       I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine      which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss      so overwhelming, but I cannot refrain from tendering to you      the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the      Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father      may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you      only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost, and the      solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a      sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.  President Lincoln, of course, spoke of those who lost their lives in the preservation of the Union; those who lost their lives in Oklahoma City did so as well.  As a father, a husband, and as a child of God, my heartfelt sympathies go out to each of the families. May they, too, find comfort in their sorrow.  Mr. Speaker, I know that every colleague joins me in expressing our sympathy and our sorrow, and our wishes that God will bless Alan, Cynthia, Donald, Mickey, Kathy, and Linda.                          ____________________
