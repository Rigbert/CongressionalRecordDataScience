Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Southern California are exceptional. Southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Bob Anderson is one of these individuals. At the end of the year, Ben will be stepping down as President of the Building Industry Association of Southern California after many years of dedicated service.  Ben has worked through BIA/SC, the California Building Industry Association (CBIA) and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) to promote the building industry's contributions to the communities that it serves, to advocate on behalf of his colleagues and to create new home-ownership opportunities. Ben has exemplified leadership and dedicated service to the building industry as a CBIA and NAHB director, as BIA/SC Secretary/Treasurer, Second Vice President, First Vice President and President.  Ben has also served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Boys and Girls Club in the City of Fontana and continues to be active in several business organizations both in the Inland Empire and Orange County.  Ben has worked tirelessly to ensure that all Southern Californians have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream of home ownership, and to promote housing as a community asset which strengthens the fabric of our many neighborhoods in Southern California. Ben has been a dedicated, strong and effective voice for the principles and ideals of California's building community during his years as a member and leader of the Building Industry Association of Southern California.  Ben's diligent work as the President of Building Industry Association of Southern California has contributed immeasurably to the betterment of Southern California. His involvement in community organizations makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of the residents and homeowners of Southern California are grateful for his service and salute him as his term comes to an end. I look forward to working with him in the future for the good of our community.                          ____________________
