Our vulnerability, our dependence on foreign oil, means we are drawn into wars and foreign policy decisions which we may not want to make. It also means our economy is burdened by inefficiency and vehicles that are really burning too much gasoline. It also means that for every extra gallon we burn, there is more pollution in the air. So it is from three different perspectives.  Our lack of fuel efficiency in our vehicles is burdening America with responsibilities and decisions which American consumers would agree and American families would agree we should not have to make as a nation.  Now, I know I voted for the Energy bill--I do not know how the Senator from Florida did--because it contained provisions about ethanol and biodiesel. But if you look beyond those provisions, you will find in that bill many subsidies for oil companies. What an irony that we provide subsidies to oil companies at a time when they are experiencing the highest profits, windfall profits, they have ever seen--billions of dollars. And do you know why? Because the price of gasoline is much higher than is warranted by the price of crude oil. So that Energy bill we had the President sign last August really does not step up to the plate and address the reality of the energy challenge of America.  I believe Americans want us to move toward energy independence, to move toward using fuels that are efficient and do not pollute. And I believe they want us, as a nation, to create incentives for renewable, sustainable energy sources, for innovation in energy technology that will create new companies, new jobs, new opportunities in this country.  We cannot be looking backward. We have to look forward in terms of what our children need for energy in the 21st century.
