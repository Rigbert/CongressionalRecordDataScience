President, I rise today to salute a distinguished young man from Troop 66 in Garden City, Rhode Island who has attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.  Not every young American who joins the Boy Scouts earns the prestigious Eagle Scout Award. In fact, only 2.5 percent do. To earn the award, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of leadership, service, and outdoor skills. A scout must earn twenty-one Merit Badges, eleven of which are required from areas such as Citizenship in the Community, Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Safety, Environmental Science, and First Aid.  As one progresses through the Boy Scout ranks, a scout must demonstrate participation in increasingly more responsible service projects. An Eagle Scout candidate must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more specific Troop leadership positions. Ernest Rheaume has distinguished himself in accordance with these criteria.  For his service project, Ernest organized a bicycle and child safety fair at Gladstone Street School in Cranston.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting Ernest Rheaume. In turn, we must duly recognize the Boy Scouts of America for establishing the Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous criteria its aspirants must see. This program has through its eighty-five years honed and enhanced the leadership skills and commitment to public service of many outstanding Americans.  It is my sincere belief that Ernest will continue his public service and inso doing will further distinguish himself and consequently better his community.                          ____________________
