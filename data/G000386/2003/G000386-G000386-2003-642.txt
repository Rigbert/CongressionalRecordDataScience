 President, I want to take a moment to express some concern to the Appropriations Committee about the report language that was included regarding the supplemental request for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Senate report indicates that the committee considers their funding of the President's request as a downpayment on funding for the next fiscal year.  I would like to ask the committee to reconsider taking this position withouta greater examination of both the 2004 request and how the supplemental funding will be used. I believe penalizing the 2004 request because of needed funds today will hamper the effectiveness of this program, particularly when it seems we may be turning the corner.  This request is designed to support our current efforts in Colombia, which are occurring at a significantly higher operational pace than was anticipated when the current fiscal year budget was developed. Since the fiscal year 2004 budget was created, we have seen a wave in urban bombings, the launch of a rescue mission for kidnapped American citizens, a significant increase in the violent attacks against our spray aircraft, and an increase in the violent attacks against President Uribe and other top Colombian officials. These increased threats need to be countered now, and require a revision in the original budget estimates on what will be spent both this fiscal year and next.  The supplemental funding is necessary to continue current operations at their current pace. By including the President's request in this bill, the committee is recognizing this need. But we should not penalize next year's efforts by counting this supplemental appropriations against the 2004 request. I strongly urge the committee to reconsider holding this needed supplemental funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative against the fiscal year 2004 request.                          ____________________
