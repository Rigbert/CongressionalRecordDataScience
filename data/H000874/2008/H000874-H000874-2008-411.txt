 On Monday, the House will not be in session. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday the House will meet at 10 a.m.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by close of business this week.  We will consider H.R. 3521, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. In addition, we will consider legislation regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as we expect the Senate to act on the bill the House sent, hopefully, early next week.
