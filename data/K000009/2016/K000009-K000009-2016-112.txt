Chair, I appreciate Congressman Griffith's efforts here, but, unfortunately, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Let me just say that, in the base bill that we have worked very hard on, there are $645 million in the account for fossil energy. That is about $13 million more over the current fiscal year. In addition, it is $285 million above the budget request.  So I think, if you put it in that frame, we have done quite well with difficult choices inside our bill. The energy efficiency and renewable energy account is already $248 million below this year and more than a billion below the budget request.  So I would say to the gentleman that I don't think the offset you have provided is a very good one.  We know that renewable energy is at the forefront of an energy transformation that is already happening across our country, and we do need a more balanced approach to energy.  While I do support fossil energy research and development and, frankly, transition for communities that have been harmed by the transformation in the energy sector--coal communities and coal-shipping communities across this country--I really can't support this level of disproportionate funding.  So I strongly oppose the amendment and do not agree with its offset. I would urge my colleagues to join me in a ``no'' vote.  I reserve the balance of my time.
