President, I am proud to join as a cosponsor of the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189.  This legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, law enforcement officers, and their families. Specifically, our legislation would: Increase the maximum prison term for forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation, or interference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and the U.S. Marshals Service.  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs this legislation to protect the hard-working men and women who serve in our Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, unfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials of our Federal Government.  Earlier this year, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, IL, was firebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the Federal office building in Oklahoma City 2 years ago. More recently in my home State, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and killed two State troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against him in a land dispute.  There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking the law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or law enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshals Service is concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement officers.  The extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack the judiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was recently quoted as saying: ``The judges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not behave, ``we're going to go after them in a big way.'' I know that House Republican Whip Tom Delay was not intending to encourage violence against any Federal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal judges in the eyes of the public.  Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate and violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve within it with the respect that is essential to its preserving its public standing.  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people and countries around the world that are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, coequal branch of Government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment.  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the Federal Government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal judiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. They deserve our respect and our protection.  I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997 and look forward to its swift enactment.                          ____________________
