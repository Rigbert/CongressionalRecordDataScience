 For those who have been following this debate for the 10 days or more now that we have tried to focus the attention of the Senate on this Patients' Bill of Rights, this is the health insurance issue which American families are focused on already. We have talked about a lot of things on Capitol Hill, but it is time to talk about the things that are important to them.  In the example the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from California addressed, about a doctor being overruled, is it not also the case that in some of these same insurance policies the doctor cannot even tell the patient that he has been overruled by an insurance company, that, in fact, it is not his best medical judgment, but, in fact, the judgment of some bureaucrat in an insurance company that is going to dictate the treatment the patient receives?
