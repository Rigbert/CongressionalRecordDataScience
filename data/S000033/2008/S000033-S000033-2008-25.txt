 I will not go on for too long, but I want the American people to get a glimpse of what has, in fact, gone on in the last 8 years under a President who neither understands the Constitution nor respects the Constitution.

The NSA's warrantless wiretap program.  Using Presidential signing statements to ignore the intent of Congress's laws.
