  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, unlike the allegations of the earlier speaker, the gentleman from Indiana, I do not want to slow down the contract. I am eager to debate the contract on the floor. I would even like to debate it in the committee. I would even like to have an open process, as has been promised in committee and on the floor, and let the sunshine in. But we are going to have to remove some of the gag rules being imposed by the new Republican majority before we can do that.  But there is one thing I do want to stop dead. I want to stop dead the misbegotten bailout of the Mexican economy and those who have been speculating so lucratively in Mexico. It was proposed by President Clinton, but now it is being quietly manipulated through Congress behind closed doors by Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole.  Here is the headline in the Washington Times: ``Gingrich Sees Hill Approval of Mexican Bailout.''  If this bailout passes this body, it will be Speaker Gingrich's version of a bailout, not President Clinton's. I ask the Members to defeat the bailout, no matter whose it is.                          ____________________
