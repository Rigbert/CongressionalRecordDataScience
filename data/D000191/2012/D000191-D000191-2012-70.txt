  Mr. DeFAZIO. Last December, the Speaker told us that the Republican signature jobs bill was going to be the surface transportation reauthorization. Yet, under pressure from the extreme right in his caucus 2 weeks ago, he said in the Republican caucus that this transportation bill is not a jobs bill. And they wrote for the first time since the founding of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National Highway System a purely partisan transportation bill in the hope of jamming it through.  Well, it's all fallen apart now. Yet there are 150,000 bridges falling apart in the Federal system. Forty percent of the pavement on the national system needs to be restored, and there's a $70billion backlog for critical equipment in our transit systems. These could be jobs--Made in America jobs.  But we need to work together. Transportation is not, never has been, and should not be a partisan issue. By trying to make it partisan, they've stalled and failed. It's time to go back to the drawing board and put together a bill that's good for America. We don't have to have partisan politics on every issue, and transportation investment should not be one of those.                          ____________________
