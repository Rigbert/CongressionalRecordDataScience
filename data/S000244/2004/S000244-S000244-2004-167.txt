Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. Currently the bill prevents Federal courts, including courts created by an act of Congress, from striking down ``under God'' in the Pledge, while reserving to the State courts the authority to hear cases involving the Pledge.  The District of Columbia, however, due to its unique constitutional position, does not have State courts. Instead, its courts that are the equivalent of State courts are created by an act of Congress.  So, to preserve a judicial forum for District residents regarding challenges to the Pledge, this amendment simply adds the following section to the bill: ``The limitation in this section shall not apply to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.''  This sentence preserves the authority of the District's courts to hear cases involving the Pledge. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
