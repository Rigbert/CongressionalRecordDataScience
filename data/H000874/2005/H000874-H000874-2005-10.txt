Speaker, Lewis Carroll continues to write their material. Mr. Pence, your Republican leadership has taken us $1.5 trillion into deficit over the last 60 months. That is the so-called revolution. Seventeen years you have controlled the presidency. You have taken us $4 trillion into debt. Bill Clinton was President of the United States for 8 years, $62.5 billion surplus. This time you cut $50 billion. But when we cut $250 billion not one of you had the guts to vote for it.
