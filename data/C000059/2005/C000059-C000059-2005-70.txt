Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Darrell Talbert for the leadership and dedication he has displayed while serving as mayor of the city of Corona, California. On November 29, 2005, Darrell's term as mayor came to a close and I want to thank him for his commitment and service.  Darrell has called Corona home for as long as he can remember and he continues to demonstrate the extraordinary qualities we expect in our community leaders. Shortly after graduation from California State University, San Bernardino in 1989, Darrell co-founded Odyssey Group, Inc. and Odyssey Publications, Inc. The Odyssey Companies quickly became industry leaders in the autograph and memorabilia business.  Just 5 years out of college and ready to take a more active role within the community, Darrell was elected to the Corona City Council in 1994. During his time on the city council, the city of Corona as well as the surrounding region has experienced significant growth. While this growth is surely a positive sign, it undoubtedly presents our local leaders with a number of challenges. In order to maintain the high quality of life residents come to expect, the Corona City Council has taken a number of steps to provide residents with the necessary infrastructure and services.  The city of Corona has had a balanced budget in each of the years Darrell has served on the city council, and they have done so without implementing new taxes. Under his leadership and due to carefully managed fiscal budgeting, the city has added over 100 acres of new parks, implemented the Downtown Revitalization Project and successfully attracted new retails stores, businesses and nationally recognized restaurants to serve the citizens of Corona and the surrounding communities.  I know I speak on behalf of our entire community in expressing my appreciation for Darrell's tireless efforts on behalf of our city. I also want to thank his wife Kimberly and daughter Haley for supporting Darrell and at times sacrificing their time with him to allow him to perform his civic duties.                          ____________________
