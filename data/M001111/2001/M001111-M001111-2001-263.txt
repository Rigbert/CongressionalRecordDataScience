 It was just upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Groups such as Scouts have equal access. Therefore, this amendment is not about the question of equal access. This amendment, however, is about special access. Frankly, we ought to call this proposal the ``unequal access amendment'' because it selects one group over all others for special protection.  There is a second problem with the amendment. I served on a local school board. I know what it is to have limited meeting space in a school and to have organizations that want to use that space who come before you and beg and plead for that ability. Right now schools make those decisions based on their own circumstances within the law. Schools might not have enough space. They might not have the budget for the extra cleanup required for groups to use these facilities or additional groups to use them. They might not have the staff to lock up the building after hours. Teachers might not have the time in the schoolday to rearrange their classrooms. Maybe there are only a few rooms available after school and they are already needed for other things such as tutoring or they have already been given to another group. There might be insurance or liability concerns.  Because of all those variables that local school boards have to live with on a weekly basis, those decisions are made at the local level. Sometimes those local policies keep schools from having to pick one group over the other, from picking winners or losers.  The Helms amendment would overrule all of those local policies, all of those local decisions, and pick one winner and require every school to accommodate them or risk losing their Federal funding.  Scouts already have the same protections as similar organizations, and local schools already make good legal decisions based on those circumstances.  Before I close, I note that I am eager to see how some of my colleagues vote on this amendment which, as I have noted, is not about Scouting. It is about forcing decisions on local schools. In recent years some of my colleagues have spoken at great length about the importance of local control in educational decisions. Of course, having served on a local school board, I reminded them that most decisions are made at the local level and that there is a limited Federal role for efforts such as helping disadvantaged students and reaching national educational goals. Frankly, I do not see how setting up a special national privilege for just one organization falls in that role.  Recently on the Senate floor my amendment to reduce school overcrowding was defeated on a party-line vote. Opponents on the other side said those decisions should be made at the local level. They ignored the fact that funding was optional and flexible, meaning it could be used for class size reduction or teacher training or recruitment. Opponents of my amendment said local control was more important than an effective, targeted, flexible initiative.  Now we get to see if all those Members will stand up to the principles they have advocated. This Helms amendment is far more intrusive. It is not optional. Unlike my amendment, the Helms amendment has nothing to do with schoolday learning. It is definitely a Federal mandate on local schools. It definitely takes decisions out of local hands. Frankly, I do not see how anyone who has called for more local control will support this Helms amendment. This vote will be very telling.  The Helms amendment addresses a problem that does not exist. Groups such as the Scouts already have equal access through existing law. Instead, this intrusive amendment provides special, unequal access for just one group and overrules what is happening at the local level.  I will share with my colleagues how frustrating and difficult it can be, as a school board member, to make decisions about who can use your facilities. I have been in front of many parents who were unhappy with decisions that school boards have made. This Helms amendment may well force a school board to tell a group, perhaps a church group that is already using their gym, that because of the Helms amendment and fear of a lawsuit, if they don't change their mind, we will have to override facilities use by that group. This amendment may well force a school to tell another group that because of our Federal law, the Boy Scouts come in first.  I care about Scouting. I want our Scouts to have facilities. I want it to be under equal access, not special protection. That is what the Helms amendment does.  I thank my colleague from California and yield back my time to her.                               Exhibit 1                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 2001]                       Justices Back Bible Group                  access to school facilities widened                           (By Charles Lane)       The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a New York state      school may not prohibit an evangelical Christian children's      club from meeting on its premises, a decision that may have      cleared the last legal obstacles to religious groups' long-     sought goal of having the same access to school facilities as      other organizations.       By a vote of 6 to 3, the court held that the Milford      Central School's effort to deny the after-school use of its      building to the Good News Club, but not to other,      nonreligious groups, was a form of discrimination on the      basis of religious viewpoint, and thus violated the      constitutional guarantee of free speech.       The Good News Club, which operates thousands of chapters      around the country, urges children as young as 6 to accept      Jesus Christ as a personal savior. The school argued that, in      barring the club from meeting there, it was following a New      York law designed to avert any appearance of official      sponsorship of religious worship and to protect children from      getting the impression that the school endorses a particular      religion.       But the court rejected the notion that the club's use of      the school would create a kind of pro-religious pressure on      children, noting that children could not attend the club's      meetings unless their parents approved.       ``[W]e cannot say the danger the children would misperceive      the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger      that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious      viewpoint if the Club were excluded,'' Justice Clarence      Thomas said in the opinion he wrote for the court.       Conservative legal scholars noted that the case fits into a      recent trend in which the court has adopted a more      accommodating position toward religion in public places when      it believes that it is merely maintaining a fair balance      between religious and secular activity. That could mean      future support for President Bush's ``faith-based'' social      services initiative, or for school vouchers, they said.       ``It will be much harder for anyone to argue that a faith-     based organization's social service treatment program has      crossed a line, becoming, in essence, `too religious,' ''      said Douglas Kmiec, dean of the Catholic University law      school.       But Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for      Separation of Church and State, said the decision maintains a      distinction between state support for religious instruction      and extracurricular religious activity, and therefore ``has      no spillover into the voucher area.''       Of the 4,622 Good News Club chapters around the country,      about 527 meet regularly in public school buildings.      Supporters of the group said the ruling gives a significant      boost to the club and others like it.       ``It's no secret that it helps them attract children when      they meet in a more convenient location,'' said Gregory S.      Baylor of Annandale-based Religious Liberty Advocates, which      filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of Good News's      parent organization, the Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc.      ``Prior to this, a lot of school districts were nervous about      letting them in. Now I can say, `Read the Supreme Court      case.' ''       Opponents agree with this forecast, but they said it shows      how the court has titled the church-state balance in favor of      religion.       ``This is really religious worship directed at young      children,'' said Jeffrey R. Babbin, an attorney who filed a      friend of the court brief on behalf of the Anti-Defamation      League of B'nai B'rith, which backed the school. ``Our      concern is that what can't be done in school shouldn't be      done right after. Often kids can't go home right after      school.''       The case began in 1996 when two parents, the Rev. Stephen      D. Fournier and his wife, Darleen, sought to move the      meetings of their Good News Club chapter from a local church      to Milford's only school building, which houses all classes      from kindergarten through 12th grade.       School authorities in the 3,000-resident rural community      refused, saying that the Good News Club was not simply a      discussion group that talked about morals from a religious      viewpoint, but a form of religious instruction.       The Good News Club's sponsoring organization, the Child      Evangelism Fellowship, based in Warrenton, Mo., says that its      purpose is to ``evangelize boys and girls with the Gospel of      the Lord Jesus Christ and to establish (disciple) them in the      Word of God and in a local church for Christian living.''       Good News Club meetings revolve around prayer, songs,      stories and games drawn from the Bible, and some of the      children attending are ``challenged'' to declare Jesus Christ      as their savior.       The Fourniers sued in federal court. The New York-based      appeals court sided with the school, but because its ruling      clashed with a St. Louis-based appeals court's decision in      favor of access for another Good News Club, the Supreme Court      agreed last year to decide the dispute.       In the court opinion yesterday, Thomas said that this case      was essentially no different from previous ones in which the      court had upheld the right of a Christian parents' group to      show a film at a public high school in the evening and of      Christian students at the University of Virginia to receive      the same funding for their publication as other groups.       When the state operates a ``limited public forum'' in which      citizens may express their views, Thomas wrote, ``speech      discussing otherwise permissible subjects cannot be excluded      . . . on the ground that the subject is discussed from a      religious viewpoint.''       Thomas was joined by the court's other conservative-leaning      members--Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices      Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.      He also picked up the vote of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a      liberal, who wrote a separate opinion to emphasize that he      supported the club's position only insofar as it was asking      for nondiscrimination by the school. He said important issues      remained to be examined, especially whether a reasonable      child might indeed see the club's presence at the school as      an endorsement of religion.       Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader      Ginsburg dissented.       ``It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the      public school premises not for the mere discussion of a      subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for      an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit      themselves in an act of Christian conversion,'' Souter wrote.       The case is Good News Club v. Milford Central School, No.      99-2036.
