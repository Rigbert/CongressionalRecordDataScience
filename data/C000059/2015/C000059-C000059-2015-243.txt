Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the career of Kathy Azevedo; a dedicated public servicewoman, community pillar, and local advocate. On Wednesday, November 18, 2015 Azevedo will celebrate her retirement from the Norco City Council after 12 years of service.  For over 45 years, Kathy has been a resident and supporter of the Norco community. Before beginning her public service work, Kathy opened her own Jazzercise studio. Azevedo has been a member of the Norco City Council since 2003. In addition to the Norco City Council, she also served as Mayor in 2005, 2009, and 2013. She has also served with the Norco Chamber of Commerce, as a member of the executive committee of the Western Riverside Council of Governments, and as a board member of the YMCA of Corona-Norco.  Preservation of Norco's rural and natural environment issues have been at the center of Azevedo's time in office. Her service work has helped lead to the establishment of the Horsetown, USA brand for Norco, establishing the largest city-wide residential zoning codes in the state of California, and the creation of Silverlakes Park, a 144-acre equestrian and recreational land space for the enjoyment of future generations.  In addition to her passion for preservation, Councilwoman Azevedo has also been a large champion of women's health and fitness issues. As a cancer survivor, Azevedo brings complexity and depth to these issues through her unique perspective.  Kathy serves as a member of the National Grant Review Board for the American Cancer Society. In addition to the American Cancer Society, Azevedo also was an original member of United Norconians for Life Over Alcohol and Drugs (Unload) and the founder of the nonprofit group Support Sisterz. Support Sisterz is a group of cancer survivors who help to provide assistance and support to individuals battling the disease.  Outside of her public service, Azevedo is an avid horseback rider and dedicated family woman. She married her high school sweetheart, Danny, and together they have two children and three grandchildren. Her family is her passion and she can often be found on the sidelines of her grandchildren's sporting events. I am proud to call Kathy a fellow community member, American and friend. I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating her on the celebration of her career of serving the city of Norco.                          ____________________
