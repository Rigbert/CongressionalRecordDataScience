Speaker, each year on the 24th of April we commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. As we begin a new century, it is critical that we redouble our efforts to battle the forces of hatred and intolerance that perpetuate the persecution of people because of their ethnic, racial or religious identity. The massacre of Armenians in Turkey during and after the World War One is recorded as the first state-ordered genocide against a minority group in the 20th Century. Tragically, Mr. Speaker, it was not the last. In the 85 years since this unspeakable tragedy, the world has witnessed decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing, wholesale persecution of people simply because of who they are--European Jews, Bosnian Muslims, the Tutsis of Rwanda, Kosovar Albanians.  Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on the magnitude of the Armenian genocide and those that followed in the past century, the words of Helen Keller ring true. ``No loss by flood and lightening, no destruction of cities and temples by the hostile forces of nature has deprived manof so many noble lives and impulses as those which his intolerance has destroyed,'' she said.  Mr. Speaker, we honor the memory of the Armenian people who perished and express our condolences to their descendants. We stand with them and together reflect upon the meaning and lessons of their suffering and sacrifice. We must reflect, we must learn, but we must also be prepared to act. Let us vow in this century and for all future generations to make the words ``never again'' ring true.  Mr. Speaker, while we remember their tragic history we also marvel at the strength and determination of the Armenian people. Independent Armenian statehood has been restored to guarantee the security and future of the nation and serves as an inspiration to Armenian people everywhere. Since gaining its independence Armenia has made great strides in fortifying democratic institutions and promoting a market economy, but the road has not been easily traveled and the way ahead will not be without challenge. Mr. Speaker, we also honor the memory of Armenia's leaders who were killed by a shameless band of assassins last year. We express our condolences to their families and to the people of Armenia.  Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the Armenian people will continue to strengthen their democracy and prosper. It is my fervent hope that the parties to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh will renew and redouble their efforts to reach a negotiated settlement and to help bring peace and prosperity to the entire region--now and for generations to come.                          ____________________
