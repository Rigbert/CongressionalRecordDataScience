 President, this amendment essentially corrects what I believe is a mistake in the bill. Present law allows for the use of both English and Spanish in deportation orders. The bill, as it came out of committee, struck that section. Therefore, only English could be used in deportation orders.  Frankly, it does not make sense to give somebody a deportation order that they cannot read. And the dominant majority of illegal immigrants in the State of California speak Spanish only. Therefore, it would make sense that a deportation order be in Spanish and in English.  My amendment would simply strike the English-only requirement. I am joined by Senator Simon in this amendment that would restore the language to its prior situation.  If I might, I neglected to mention something, and I would like to remedy that, Mr. President. Senator Boxer is a cosponsor on the alternative language on the triple fence.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the second amendment.
