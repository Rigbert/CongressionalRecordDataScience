 President, today I am introducing legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S. Government.  Last year, tax forms were printed in a language other than English for the first time in the 131 year history of the IRS. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is now conducting non-English language citizenship ceremonies. I find these policies very disturbing. The Government is sending a clear message that to live in the United States, one must not learn the English language.  I believe such Government policies establish a dangerous and expensive precedent. The idea that the U.S. Government can accommodate better than 300 foreign languages now found in America, is absurd.  In order to assimilate the various cultures and ethnic groups that comprise this great land, we must use English. Of all the different homelands and dialects introduced to the United States in the 18th century, the language the immigrants choose was English. They did not choose French, German, or Spanish.  A common, established language allows individuals to engage in conversation, commerce and of course political discussion. A common language serves as a bridge unifying a community by opening the lines of communication. In this diverse land of ours, English is the common line of communication we share. English is what allows us to teach, learn about and appreciate one another. It is therefore important that the Federal Government formally recognize English as the language of Government and pursue efforts to help new citizens assimilate and learn the English language.  The inability to communicate fosters frustration and resentment. By encouraging people to communicate in a common language, we actually help them progress in society. A common language allows individuals to take advantage of the social and economic opportunities America has to offer. The ability to maintain a law abiding citizenry is hindered and the ability to offer true representation is certainly hampered if individuals cannot communicate their opinions.  There might be concerns that this legislation will deprive non-English speaking individuals of certain rights or services. Let me assure you it will not. This legislation does not deny individuals their right to use native languages in their private lives nor does it deny critical services. This bill only affects the official functions of the U.S. Government. If anything, this legislation reflects the need to provide services that help non-English speaking people learn English and assimilate to America. Participatory democracy in this country simply requires people learn the English language.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join in this effort to establish a national language policy for the U.S. Government by cosponsoring the Language of Government Act of 1995.                                 ______      By
