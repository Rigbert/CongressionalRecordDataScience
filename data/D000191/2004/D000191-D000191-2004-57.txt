Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his time and the gentlewoman from California for her excellent work on this legislation.  To echo the words of the gentleman from Indiana who preceded me in the well, this is a good step but it is not an adequate step. I would differ only in that he said we need more laws. We do not need more laws. We need to enforce the existing laws.  I was one who voted against Permanent Most Favored Nation status for China because I thought the only leverage we had over them to stop them from this piracy was the annual renewal of that trade status. The argument of the prevailing side was, well, now they will be in the WTO and they will have to follow the rules; and in fact, that has been pursued successfully once.  One time the administration has filed one complaint against the largest pirate of U.S. copyright patents and materials in the world, China, which was on a tax benefit extended to semiconductors; and, in fact, that worked. China backed off, although they are going to phase out this subsidy. I think they should have them immediately end it, but in any case that step did yield some results.  The administration is now raising concerns about Viagra, but it is not raising concerns about Videx. What is Videx? Videx is a little dream company in my district, started by a former Hewlett-Packard employee, started up in his garage, now employs directly more than 60 people and hundreds of other people in the production of his product, all done in the United States of America. Videx produces two different systems, a coding system that is not based on bar codes, but a different system, which is very successful, and now a new electronic locking system.  One day they got a call from their distributor in China. They had filed for Chinese patent protection, Chinese trademarks, had done everything according to Chinese law, and they got contacted by their distributor in China. They were very concerned and they did not understand why they had chosen to have another distributor. They thought they had exclusive rights. They said, what are you talking about? They found out that their entire company had been cloned in China, including the Web site. In fact, the Chinese went one better. They had little tiny American flags waving up on top of the building on the phony Videx Web site.                              {time}  1330  Everything. They used the U.S. copyright and even translated U.S. copyright patent into Chinese in stealing the software. And they made a crappy product.  So it not only cost them market share because of the counterfeiters, the counterfeiters also besmirched the name and quality of their product. And now the Chinese fakes are beginning to market this beyond China.  I have contacted everyone I can in the administration, including the Commerce Secretary and the Special Trade Representative. I have introduced legislation. I have raised this issue many times. It has been noted on the Lou Dobbs Report. We have gotten as much publicity as we can. And the only result is that Videx, in my district, has been contacted by dozens of other United States firms around the country saying exactly the same thing happened to us. Our company, our product was stolen by the Chinese. We had registered it, we had followed all the rules, and the administration will do nothing, nothing to help us.  And that is the current status we have here. Yes, they have stood up for the semiconductor giants and got some concessions from the Chinese. They are going to stand up for Pfizer and Viagra, but not for Videx, for the American dream, for small business, for dozens of companies like Videx around America who need the strong support of the United States Government to fight Chinese piracy.  This resolution is good. It will note the concern of Congress. But firmer steps are necessary.  I have introduced companion legislation to a bill in the Senate by Senator Lautenberg that would force the United States Trade Representative to file complaints against Chinese piracy. It is one thing that we are losing jobs because they have dirt-cheap labor, they do not follow environmental rules, and they should fix that, but it is another thing when they are outright stealing the intellectual property, the copyrights, and putting Americans out of business through theft. That has to stop.  This legislation is a start, but we need to take more action and the administration needs to take action in this area.
