President, I am a little distressed. I understand we are not going to be able to take up some amendments that I believe should be taken up on this bill. I, at least, want to get into the Record, in the hopes some of these things can be addressed in conference, my strong feeling about a couple amendments.  The Exon amendment, Coats amendment, and the Smith amendments address the same thing, and that is just a modest and overdue measure to get Government out of the business of promoting and subsidizing abortions. It is my understanding that under section 512, if not enacted, obstetrics and gynecology residents' programs will be required to perform abortions including late-term abortions. Residents with moral or religious objections who wish to opt out of performing abortions should be required to explain why in a way that satisfies stringent and explicit criteria. I am very much concerned about that. We have debated this issue over and over again. However, I am hoping this is something that will be taken up in conference.  The second thing is the amendment to defund Goals 2000, the Education Act. Under this program, Federal intrusiveness reaches a new height. The Goals 2000 creates tighter and more definite links between State, Federal and local levels and makes it easier for the Department of Education to tamper with local schools. The Goals 2000 is the idea that the Federal Government should be involved in creating and certifying standards for education and determining official knowledge.  I think if there is anything that has been very evident during the elections of November, it was a trend to get Government out of things, not in things, to get the Washington influence out of our lives instead of in our lives.  I certainly hope that we will be able to take up some measure at some point, perhaps in conference, to do away with the Goals 2000 program.
