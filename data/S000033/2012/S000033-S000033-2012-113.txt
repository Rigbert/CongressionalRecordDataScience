 The following essays were selected as ``Honorable Mentions.''  The Statements follow.    Hannah Apfelbaum, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable                                 Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       America is not living up to its full potential. We have one      of the highest child poverty rates in the Western world, a      high unemployment rate, and test very low in math and science      compared to other developed countries. And that's not all--we      also face environmental challenges and the decline of the      middle class. We must use our differences to unite us by      tackling all aspects of the issues we face. But America is      asking how, specifically, do we solve these problems?       First, we need to decide what problems not to solve. Iraq      and Afghanistan are not in ideal condition. This does not      mean, however, that we should be pouring all of our money      into military efforts there. Instead, we need to make more      money available for the most pressing issues in our own      country.       One way to make more money available is to stop giving the      wealthiest people the biggest tax cuts. It is understandable      that politicians are concerned about backlash from these      influential citizens, but the majority of people in this      country--the middle class--needs to be taken into account.      With the national debt becoming greater and greater, these      tax cuts simply are not sustainable.       So where should our money go? The first priority should be      education. Successful experiences in the early years of      school make children much less likely to drop out or end up      in prison--an entity that tax dollars pay for, with less than      stellar results. Investment in public elementary schools      benefits both the children and the general public. We also      need to spend money on college financial aid programs. The      most successful students who cannot pay their own tuition      deserve to have this opportunity, and will most likely make a      large contribution to society in their adult lives. All      contributions to education will help make Americans qualified      to obtain jobs that will provide them with comfortable wages,      and stimulate the economy.       We also need to spend money on healthcare. Every American      has the right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of      happiness.'' Life, especially, is very hard to maintain      without adequate healthcare. The right to be safe is      something that needs to be provided     to all citizens. It is simply not acceptable for a child in      need of a treatment such as chemotherapy to not be able to      access it. It is time that we live up to this responsibility.      And in providing safety, a clean environment is also      essential. Clean air helps reduce our risk of cancer, lung      disease and numerous other health issues.       America--now is the time to make choices for the benefit of      our national community. We need to fund education. We need to      fund healthcare. We need to take environmental action. It is      time for each of us to advocate and actively work for these      policies so that America can reach its full potential.                                  ____  Erin Clauss, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       My fellow Americans, as we move into 2012, there are      serious issues that must be resolved. The American middle      class is in crisis. Hard-working Americans are losing their      jobs, and are unable to care for and provide for their      families. This nation is drowning in debt. Americans are      unable to pay for basic needs, like healthcare.       The Occupy Wall Street movement has brought to all of our      attention how important fixing the economy is. As of November      2011, 7.6 million Americans have lost their jobs during this      recession. The unemployment rate is declining, but there is      still much work to be done. These people want to be able to      support themselves. They don't want to be living off food      stamps and have their homes foreclosed on. They want to work.      They want to be able to afford to give their children a      college education. The United States has the most expensive      college tuition in the world, leaving young adults struggling      with debt. They have difficulty paying off that debt when      they are unable to find a decent job after graduation.       Part of the solution must be to raise taxes on America's      wealthiest citizens. This isn't about class warfare. It's      about saving the American economy. Those who can afford to      pay more have the responsibility to do so. To be able to pay      off our debt and bring back the so-called ``American dream,''      we desperately need to raise revenue, and this is the clear      solution.       Due to this recession, many Americans cannot afford to buy      health care. They are uninsured and unprotected. Over 44      million Americans do not have health insurance. This is an      outrage. Health care is a basic right that should be      guaranteed for everyone. If, in the Declaration of      Independence, we, as a nation, claim to guarantee the rights      to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we must do      so. By allowing insurance companies to deny our people      adequate medical care, we are taking away their right to      life. This must be remedied.       What we really need now is compromise. Nothing can or will      be achieved if the leaders of our nation, the representatives      of the people, refuse to compromise and work together towards      the betterment of our country. This crisis is not unsolvable.      We have the tools to fix the situation in our nation today,      but only if both sides are willing to make concessions to      help us move forward into the future as a powerful nation.       Thank you.                                  ____         Yamuna Dahal, Winooski High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       The United States of America is country of opportunity and      success. We believe in our country and our confidence. We      believe that we would eventually succeed overcoming any      obstacles. We never fear to try something new. We are always      trying to show the world our power of unity and diversity. We      got the best entrepreneurs in this country whose continues      hard work and confidence made our country the best among the      world, we do have some issues that need to be fixed.       Our parliament system is based on equality and liberty. Our      democratic governmental system enhances the public voice to      be heard. Anyone, who is capable and willing of leading this      country, could be elected freely regardless of their      ethnicity, race or social background.       For the last decade, our country is facing many problems.      The average income for the American family is falling down.      Many of our American families are losing their jobs because      companies outsourced their jobs to foreign land. Companies      and rich peoples are getting richer whereas the average      income families are falling towards the poverty line. There      are others concerns like illegal immigration, and increasing      crime. There are also issues such as recovery of hurricane      Katrina at New Orleans, Oil spill at the Gulf of Mexico and      California fire. I could go on and on and never finish      mentioning our problems.       However, for our generation increasing college tuition is a      matter of headache. Our parents' incomes are spent paying      their college loans and home mortgages. Today `saving for the      children's college' is rarely heard from average income      family parents. Today, it's very hard to get accepted for      scholarship at colleges and university so the only way to go      to college is to `take a loan.' However, in this economy,      many of our college graduates are jobless and are under the      debt of more than 100K dollars. And the numbers of those      college graduates are increasing along with their debts. Many      students get frosted about their college loans and choose to      go to community college. Universities and research centers      are beyond their imagination. It is decreasing our confidence      and our hope for the better future. As a young high school      student, I myself have to start thinking about college and my      future jobs as early as my eighth grade.       To prevent ruining our future the government should put a      limit for private colleges and universities tuition. There      should be more scholarships available for needy students.      High school students should get opportunity to take college      courses during summer to reduce their semesters when they      actually go to college. They should be properly trained about      money management and time management. The government should      increase and improve community colleges and government state      universities and reduce the price. The number of colleges and      universities should be increased in the remote site of the      country and make it more accessible for everybody.                                  ____Julienne DeVita, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       Dear Fellow Americans: Today, I stand before this great      nation, to speak to the concerned, hardworking Americans,      with the intent of bettering the state of this country. I      would like to bring to your attention three of the most      pressing issues which I feel need to be addressed in 2012 in      order for the United States of America to reach it's full      potential; the environment, our economy, and college      education costs.       This past year, after 10 years of war, and frustration, the      United States Military Forces found and defeated a key leader      of the Al Quaida movement; Osama Bin Laden. This brought      relief and feelings of security back to Iraqi and American      citizens. We ended a war and are bringing our troops back      home. Now however, it is the time for our government to focus      on domestic issues, three important things that need to get      done in our country.       Firstly, fossil Fuels are a finite commodity in our world      today, and whose dwindling supply has lead our country to      face the unavoidable subject of Global Warming. We need to      focus the public's attention not only on the devastating      effects of the environment, but ultimately what will happen      to human life on this planet. There needs to be more public      awareness of the long-term disastrous affects that global      warming will inevitably bring to our world. We need to      commission scientists to create more practical and affordable      solutions to this problem.       Another issue that is of paramount importance is the state      of our economy. We must invest in America; American jobs,      American-made products, and the American people. Companies      need to be rooted in this country so that more jobs can be      made available to the 8.6 percent of unemployed Americans.      Financial incentives must be available for businesses to stay      in the U.S. and employ the American workers.       America needs to close the vast gap between rich and poor      in this country. Actions that progress the wealth down      through the middle and lower class are essential. Since 1978,      the cost of college tuition has increased more than 900      percent. Costs of a college education have to be more      affordable for our young adults who are planning and      investing in their futures.       As we reach towards these goals, our country's leaders have      to come together and put aside their religion, skin color, or      the fact that they are a Democrat or Republican in order to      address these issues and find solutions. We must put aside      our differences and compromise towards the common good.      Individually we are not as strong as when we all work      together.       We are a country rich of talent, knowledge, and resources.      By vowing to work together on the issues of the environment,      our economy, and college education costs, we will be ensuring      a better future for all Americans. Let's make our future one      to look forward to.                                  ____ Alden Fletcher, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       Our union is a union of people, a people who recently have      been vocal about the state in which they find themselves.      From the tea party to Occupy Wall Street, everywhere there is      a movement rising up, demanding similar changes to a broken      system. The people are hurting, they have lost their jobs,      they are dealing with a harsh economic recession and thus far      our government has failed them.       Our government has proven itself incapable of effectively      dealing with the diverse and complicated problems currently      threatening this nation. Our legislative body is crippled by      partisan gridlock, the executive branch has been lenient in      its duty to protect the American people and their rights,      and, the power of common citizens in politics is being      marginalized in favor of the interests of the wealthy. The      need for reform is evident.       First the influence of special interests in government must      be diminished; legislators should be motivated by a desire to      ensure public good, not a job at a lobbying firm. In      addition, the effects of Fec v. Citizens United must be      reversed, and new restrictions must be established that limit      an organization's media power and its access into the      political system.       Second, we must be certain that the federal government is      vigorous in its regulatory capacity. Whistblowers, people who      report     nefarious or negligent activity against the public, must be      protected to the utmost; further initiatives need to be taken      that increase accountability within the government      bureaucracy. This will guarantee that the federal government      does not abuse its power in the same manner as it has with      national security.       Our country is a democracy, and it is the citizens'      prerogative to keep government in check. However, many states      have instituted laws that place unnecessary burdens upon      voting rights. In order for a democracy to function it      requires popular participation and it should be the      imperative of government to encourage all those who are      eligible, to vote. Through the means of a constitutional      amendment, the federal government must be granted increased      jurisdiction over national elections. Thus the government can      create standardized voting requirements, implement automatic      voter registration and facilitate absentee balloting, all of      which are vital steps to giving underrepresented groups, for      instance young people, more of a say in the national debate.       Finally there must be a new a sentiment of cooperation and      compromise in Washington if there is to be progress. A      government that continually threatens to shut down due to      petty disputes does little to serve the people. Changing the      way this nation is governed will allow us to tackle issues      from climate change to inequality, from the rising cost of      college education to promoting human rights across the globe.      However, if no action is taken we can accomplish nothing, and      it is our responsibility to be an educated and vigilant      electorate, to ensure that this does not happen.                                  ____      Jack Du Pre, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       The state of this nation is declining. It has become an age      where men and women of higher education status can't find      work and an age where the natural order of employment has      been shaken by a decline in productivity and availability of      jobs. Teens, like me, cannot find work due to the fact that      many ``white collar'' workers have no choice but to take jobs      that they would normally not consider. At a resort near my      school, the common denominator of the wait staff this summer      was that most held Masters Degrees and two held PhD level      educations. Waiting tables was what they could find for work.       From our youngest days in school we are charged to go to      college and further our education. We are taught that the      American dream is alive, well and available for those      diligent and hard working. The present realities make that      seem more like a fairy tale and the realities of the current      economic situation more of a harsh reality. America is in      need of a direct approach to stimulate the economy. The      answer is not pouring more money into the economy, but      deciding what will be made here and made with precision,      passion and pride. The economy is stagnant because of lack of      direction and focus.       In conclusion, the mending needs to come from three places.      It needs to come from a Congress joined by a common      interest--America and not divided by partisan rhetoric and a      current state of blaming the other side. It needs to come      from American corporations who decide to invest in America      and in American ingenuity. Lastly, it needs to come from the      people who are mired in frustration and apathy. If all three      forces face the future and address the issue of what America      truly needs, then the country can begin to live as it has in      the past, as a beacon for other countries as a place where      dreams can come true.                                  ____ Emma Hamilton, Champlain Valley Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       At the dawn of 2012, the United States is facing a      multitude of pressing issues. Currently, the U.S. poverty      rate is 15.1 percent, the highest since 1993; the      unemployment rate is 8.6 percent; and an unprecedented string      of natural disasters has overcome our country in 2011.      Compounding all these problems is our divided Congress, which      has proven to be largely ineffective in addressing these      daunting issues in a concerted and resolute manner. In this      critical time, it is imperative that change comes soon.       The root of many of our country's problems originates with      our degraded education system. There is a great gap in      opportunities for early education, which is in large measure      based on income. Studies have proven that a quality early      education is essential for a successful future. Re-building      and strengthening our early education system must become a      top priority if the country wants to see future positive      change.       When American children are born, they are told that if they      follow the rules: go to school, work hard, and attend      college, then they will be rewarded with a promising future.      Nowadays, graduates fresh out of college find that even      though they followed the rules, they struggle to find the      promising future that they were led to believe would be      there. America needs to find a way to put our educated people      back to work with jobs that will build our economy,      community, and country.       This past year extreme tornadoes ripped through the      southeast. Hurricanes and tropical storms flooded communities      along the eastern seaboard. Furthermore, the summer of 2011      was the hottest ever in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma,      causing heat waves and record droughts. This extreme weather      has cost our country over $35 billion dollars. Most can agree      that the climate is drastically changing at unprecedented      rates. The time has come that the human race faces the      effects it has on Mother Earth. The United States emits more      than 5,425 million tons of carbon dioxide every year, ranking      it second highest worldwide. We must join together as a      nation to find quick solutions to this ever-growing problem      before it is too late.       In 2011, Congress proved to be one of the most divided and      uncompromising Congresses the American public has ever seen.      In a time of crisis, America needs congressional leadership      with creative solutions and a willingness to work together to      get things done. It is vital that Congress moves forward      without partisan bickering and focuses on making positive      change.       During a time of high unemployment, living with a degrading      education system, and increasing environmental catastrophes,      our country cannot afford to wait anymore. The time has come      for Americans to come together to solve the problems we are      facing. Although we are confronted with many issues, there is      hope for a brighter future. America has repeatedly shown it      is strong and can and will restore itself to become the      thriving and great nation it is capable of being.                                  ____  Zach Holman, Champlain Valley Union High School, (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       I stand before our great nation to address the current      state of the nation. 2011 was a struggle for many people,      students were ending college carriers thousands of dollars in      debt, scraping every last penny to cover medical bills      because health insurance is too costly, or many were just not      able to find a job whether he or she was an adult or      teenager. 2011 is behind us and 2012 is here, things will      improve. For this year there are three crucial changes our      government must make to make America truly great again and      fully prosperous we must get people working, enact a one-     payer healthcare system that ensures coverage to all, and a      higher education program that makes college affordable for      levels of income and status.       The past few years have led to the demise of the middle      class. This is due to the fact higher paying positions do not      exist and no one is hiring. Everyone from the age of 16 to 65      is under pressure to find work and yet most cannot. This      year, 2012, it will change. At the end of the 2011 the      unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent, an improvement, not      a solution. We must make it so those able to and willing to      work can. My plan is to start programs that train a work      force for different skilled positions that there is a demand      for. Then I will make sure that these positions are      available. If this means subsidizing certain industries to      increase demand and promote hiring, I see that it happens. It      is time to get America working again whether you are a      teenager or elderly adult jobs will be available.       This country has attempted to tackle the healthcare      problem, and each time it does not succeed in the way most      hope. It is time to throw away the old system and start new;      it is a new year and a time for new ideas. The only way to      bring quality healthcare to all Americans is through a one-     payer system. A system that makes sure no citizen goes      uncared for. To make this possible we must de-privatize      insurance companies and give coverage to all. Life is not a      luxury only people of certain socioeconomic statuses deserve,      it is a basic human right and a one-payer system is the only      way to make it possible.       Education is my last topic for the night. Today only      students in dire need of financial aid receive it to attend      college. This is not right and does not work. Middle class      families barely can afford the outrageous price of tuition      for one child let alone two or more. We must enact new forms      of aid that make college affordable for all and give everyone      an equal opportunity.       The country needs help, but with a few small changes      success is possible. God bless you and God bless the United      States of America.                                  ____     Katie Leavitt, Woodstock Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       Crises encourage friendships. They force people to act as a      community and work together, especially when they involve      those that they care about. They create situations that bring      out the good in people who would otherwise never step up to      lend a hand.       The town of Woodstock has lived through a crisis this past      fall: Hurricane Irene. In the months and weeks afterward, the      town saw first hand that people come together and do the      right thing when they need to. Community members recognized      that friends and relatives who were dear to them were in      trouble, so they stepped up to help make a change, because in      light of a crisis, they cared. When a tree lay across my road      after taking out a power line, everyone in my neighborhood      helped those who weren't able to get to their homes by      providing them with food, showers, and shelter. My family      even created a path through our field to allow people to      drive through to the other side. Crises involving family,      friends, and neighbors force people into action, and they      create a better environment through a sense of urgency and      caring.       A major issue in our country today is the poverty crisis.      One cannot enter a city without passing someone with all      their belongings in a bag, asking for any money to help      alleviate their situation. The majority will walk by and do      nothing. The whole country begs for change: an end to      poverty, yet they walk right by when a person in need asks      for help. The only feeling in walking by is guilt that you      have more than they, and can relieve the guilt by handing      them a dollar or two. However, this does nothing to solve the      problem as a whole; it only gives one temporary peace of      mind. They do nothing to truly help because there is no      intrinsic pull to help them, just a sudden guilt. They feel      no real sense of urgency to do anything, as they have no      connection to the person. It is the sense of caring for this      person and the urgency to alleviate their situation that they      lack.       The solution to the crisis of poverty is to replicate this      feeling. To find a way to make people truly care about those      that they walk by in the street everyday to get to work.      Organize committees to issue government grants to motivated      groups of people who will find a way to engender the feeling      of community in their own hometowns and cities. Grant them      the money for them to create ways for the poor and wealthy      alike to become friends, and begin to form a community.      That's all it takes: when you know someone, and you realize      they are having a crisis, you go out of your way to help fix      the problem, because that's the way it always works: absolute      neediness from people you care about brings everyone      together. The wealthier people will begin to look around and      realize that their new friends are deep in the middle of a      crisis, and they will do something about it. Trust me. I've      seen it.                                  ____    Theophila Lee, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       As a nation, the most pressing concern we currently face is      our current education system. An issue of vital important to      the next generation of this country, and therefore to the      nation itself, I am dismayed by the lack of progress our      nation seems to be making in this area. Instead of further      sensationalizing the statistics of the abysmal standards of      U.S. students in comparison with their international cohorts,      I have decided instead to give some practical suggestions.       The change has to come from all levels--from the students,      the teachers, the schools, and the communities. At the basic      levels, subjects should be taught in a more integrated way.      History, literature, and art should be interwoven and studied      together. This ability to reach across traditional      disciplines and explore their relationships will develop      increasing well-roundedness in student. It will force pupils      to make interdisciplinary connections, an educational      experience that I believe ultimately makes a better informed,      creative, and open-minded student. Collaboration should be      encouraged more often. For teachers, teaching skills should      be continually sharpened, with time to take courses, attend      conferences, and share lessons and tips with other teachers,      online and in person. Should school districts want to explore      the option of merit pay, they should base it on the above      criteria, certainly not test scores of a teacher's students.      Additionally, schools (with the assistance of the community      at large) should require that students complete various      internships with businesses, government agencies, etc. This      allows students to explore their passions and expose them to      the world of work through school-to-career programs and      internships.       Finally, I find it appalling that lowering the cost of      college tuition while still maintaining the quality of our      higher education system is still not a high enough priority.       Our higher education system is something America should be      proud of; every year, the Ivy League and top liberal arts      colleges receive an increasing number of international      applicants, all who recognize the superiority of a U.S.      education. However, the price tag is an entirely different      issue. While it's understandable that cutting costs will      inevitably create conflict, couldn't college presidents be      held more accountable for the rising costs? This previous      semester, a Stanford professor tried an experiment where he      opened up his class to anyone online--for free. Expecting to      get only 10,000 people, he instead found that by the end of      his course, 140,000 pupils from all around the world had      enrolled. Perhaps the government should encourage top      colleges to explore technology in higher education through      government subsidies. More paying students would lead to      lower prices. It would also reduce the frenzy of high-school      seniors as we find ourselves competing with as many as 10      other students for a place in our top choice college. I      believe this would be a win-win situation for both parties      involved.                                  ____       Giovanina Mier, St. Johnsbury Academy (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       In the eternal words of our country's Preamble of the      Constitution, it is stated that the purpose of the United      States is ``to form a more perfect union, establish justice,      insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,      promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of      liberty for all''. Today, over 224 years later, these words      may seem distant and unreachable. However, they still remain      the foundation of our government and ideals that we, as the      American people, should strive to achieve.       In recent years, our government and political systems have      become increasingly polarized and radical. While this is not      inherently unfortunate, it has led to the inability of groups      of differing opinions to compromise. Without compromise,      democracy cannot function. In order for the people to      exercise their sovereignty in such a way as to spark change      and improvement in both our country and the world, we must      first be able to express the will of the majority. With two      equally unbending political parties pitted against each      other, our government has become stagnant. This effects even      minor problems, but is especially crucial in the economic      recovery that is the desire of every American. With the      inability to come to agreements on smaller negotiations, how      can we expect to solve the larger problems of our staggering      debt, unemployment, and inflation? The economic recession has      injured every American, from the college student unable to      find a job with a Master's degree in their field to the small      business that must close its doors.       These problems facing the American people cannot be solved      by simply holding fast to one's beliefs. While it is valuable      to have those in government that adequately and accurately      represent the ideas, morals, and beliefs of the American      public, compromise does not mean that one has to entirely      renounce everything they hold to be right and true. Instead,      compromise asks that we come to a place at which both parties      can agree upon one idea or principle. Does that seem so much      to ask? Of course, compromise in practice is more difficult      than in theory, but by striving for this ideal, we can create      a foundation upon which compromise becomes possible. The      intensive media coverage extended to the extreme ends of the      political spectrum drowns out the rest of the American      public; yet listening to the less heard voices of the      moderate American people is one of many ways in which we can      begin to meet the challenges of compromise.       To restore our country to prosperity and success that will      extend to all Americans, we must listen to both the minority      and majority. We must not allow the media to create      entertainment and triviality out of such serious matters of      government and politics that affect all of us so greatly. We      must overcome our differences and disparities to become a      more unified nation truly built upon compromise, and achieve      the dreams articulated in the Preamble of our Constitution.                                  ____   Travis Kent Reed, Vergennes Union High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       In the past our country has been a world leader in freedom      and democracy, but this unfortunately is no longer true. When      I was little, I remember my father explaining to me that in      places like Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany if people were      suspected of opposing the government or expressing a      divergent viewpoint, they would simply disappear. Today the      United States government has made moves toward emulating its      past enemies and even such fictional totalitarian states as      ``The Party'' from the book 1984, by passing bills that      designates the world as a battlefield and allowing the      indefinite detention of any person suspected of terrorism,      including American citizens, without trial or other      Constitutional rights.       Recently Occupy Wall Street protestors have been labeled in      the same vein as domestic terrorists and the United States      military has been mobilized to stop these protestors who are      being attacked and brutalized for attempting to carry out      their rights to peaceable assembly guaranteed in the Bill of      Rights. Just recently a bill was sent to committee to be      discussed. Called ``Stop Online Piracy Act'', it was      introduced by Representative Lamar Smith of Texas. This bill      is one that would seriously engender freedom of speech on the      Internet by allowing for copyright holders to take down any      website with a copyright claim against it. For sites like      YouTube, and Reddit that had previously been protected by the      Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1996, this would mean      death. What is the terrifying thing about this bill is that      it isn't the only one like it. In the Senate there is a bill      called Protect IP ACT, introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy      which will perform the same function as the SOPA. These bills      have been introduced into a nation that has long criticized      countries like China for censorship and the suppression of      human rights.       Our nation has long prided itself on how it treats its      citizens and how the rights of the individual are the      backbone of our democracy. It seems today our country is      going away from this model and the value placed on the      citizen is less and less important. While the wars of      terrorism are being fought, a greater threat is looming, and      the rights of the American people are slipping away, quietly      and with deliberate purpose.                                  ____    Dahlia Somers, South Burlington High School (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       America has been able to spread her objectives of freedom      and democracy throughout the world. Together we have overcome      one difficulty after another and now we face a new challenge:      to create an even greater and more progressive America. To      remain a world leader change is inevitable: otherwise our      country will take a back burner to rising super powers. We      will always be a great nation, but to remain an important one      the     issues of economy, education, healthcare, and environment      must be addressed.       Currently we are in debt to China for over $15 trillion;      this means our population of roughly 311 million citizens has      a debt share of around $49 thousand each. East Asian      countries and European countries surpass us in education--     especially in the academic subjects of math and science.      Japan has a universal health care system and an average      population life expectancy of 82.25. Germany understands that      our environment has a finite supply of resources and imposes      an environmental tax on its citizens.       Focusing on the economy, we need to generate more jobs and      discontinue outsourcing. It is time for heavy regulation, and      an end to the laissez-faire relationship with big businesses.      This is evident in the Wall Street bailout, the outraged 99      percent, and the unacceptable (though declining) unemployment      rate of 8.5 percent. The warfare against the middle classes      must be addressed, and the lower classes must be bolstered.       Education is success. The focus of education should be      aimed at life achievement rather than standardized tests. The      problem now is that schools don't have a large enough budget:      if teachers had larger salaries more competition would be      created and our children would be taught by the best      qualified. Parents, when they motivate and assist their      children, can become invaluable components in this exciting      process.       Our healthcare system is a painful topic. America has the      most expensive healthcare system without the better results      of less expensive European systems. We should follow the      European models. Well, at least all children, seniors, and      disabled should have assured healthcare. Vermont is an      innovator in healthcare, and if we are successful the rest of      America might follow our example.       The environmental issue is not to be taken lightly. Global      warming is real and we perpetuate the harm caused to our      planet. It is our responsibility to work with other powerful      countries to limit our ecological footprints and conserve the      world's natural resources. Steps must be taken not only on a      political level but on a cultural one as well. It must become      part of our culture to consume less extravagantly and recycle      more diligently.       To make these ideals a reality our government must find      harmony between the Democrats and the Republicans. We need to      remember that this is not an issue of which party is most      correct, but what can be compromised to create a better      America. We still haven't seen all America can be, she is      still growing and we, the present and the future, must guide      her to the best outcome.                                  ____               Kidder Spillane, CVU, (Honorable Mention)                           [January 23, 2012]       Dear Fellow Americans, I am reporting to you as the New      Year is starting I would like to inform the state in which      the country is in and in which subjects we are going to push      our efforts toward.       I believe the most important subject to address first is      our problem with oil. We depend a lot on Middle Eastern      countries for their foreign oil. The oil is running out and      we need to put a lot of our efforts into alternative energy      sources including solar, wind and even hydroelectricity. We      can't just make this happen overnight it's going to take a      lot of time and effort; this can be looked upon as a      positive. This brings me to my next subject, if we create      more alternative energy productions this will open a lot more      opportunities for job creation. In November of 2011 the      unemployment rate dropped to 8.4 percent from 9 percent.      There are still over 13 million American without a job, and      these alternative energy products can reduce that number      significantly.       The next subject I would like to address is healthcare.      Healthcare is a necessity that I feel every American should      be able to have with no cost. Healthcare shouldn't be      something people have to worry about, our country should      provide universal healthcare across the nation it is our      right to get the treatment they need to survive.       The country is in debt, that's the truth we are in a      deficit of $1.48 trillion. This is a cause of overspending by      the U.S. simply just raising the taxes for everyone is not      the answer. I believe the way people should be taxed is the      answer if a wealthier individual has the money to be able to      pay more in taxes than he is doing than he should be paying      more than somebody who is working a middle class job living      in the suburbs. There needs to be a higher minimum tax      payment on the less wealthy citizens. Not just a low      percentage of somebody's income.       I also believe we need to support student loan reforms. In      the future almost 60 percent of future jobs will require more      than a high school diploma. We want every American to have      the opportunity, and the ability to get a college diploma.      People shouldn't have to be in so much debt from their loans.      We need to help the people that aren't able to pay for      college by themselves. The interest rate on student loans      will be lowered.       Thank you fellow Americans. It is not just congresses job      to make this happen we need to unite as a nation everybody      needs to be a part of the action of strengthening our nation.      This is a tough time right now with the economy it's going to      take effort from all Americans. Thank you for your time      America. God bless you and may god bless the United States of      America.                          ____________________
