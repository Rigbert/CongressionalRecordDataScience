 I think the Senate has a clear choice this morning. A vote for cloture strengthens this Nation's greatest freedom--the right to vote. A vote against cloture weakens that freedom and it weakens a freedom that is critical for this country and leaves that freedom unprotected.  I believe this morning's vote is a choice between affirming the pioneering spirit of this country--the spirit that led my State of Oregon to champion new voting reforms, such as vote by mail, motor voter laws--and stamping out that spirit with what could end up to be repressive antivoting rules.  So the choice is between election reform and gridlock. I want to be fair with the Senator from Connecticut and we are going to continue to work nonstop, relentlessly, to find a bipartisan approach to this issue. We want to blaze a real trail in meaningful election reform and get this bill on the President's desk.  So I urge my colleagues on both sides to continue to work on this critical effort, to join the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky in an effort to get a bipartisan solution.  I don't want to see this bill derailed. S. 565 is the vehicle that can enfranchise the thousands, perhaps millions of voters who will cast their ballots in every election. But we also need to make sure that there is a fix to S. 565.
