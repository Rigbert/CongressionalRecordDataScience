They continue as currently required under chapter 7. They do not have to go through and prepare and file this means test which is required here because they are not required to.  Page 18 of the bill, no one can challenge a person if in the case of a debtor in a household of one person, the median family income of the applicable State is applicable. So this is the point that has been made over and over, again that having filed the basic documents in bankruptcy, if it is then established that one is below the median income, end of the story. This bill does not apply. That is the way I understood it.  My amendment is trying to clarify it to make sure that is the way the Senator understands it. In other words, if I have done all of the basic filing and I disclose my monthly income and I am below median income, then I do not have to fill out the forms for the means test; it does not apply to me.  I quoted the Senator earlier, Senator Frist, and Senator Hatch, who have all said that on the Senate floor. My amendment clarifies that and says that unequivocally, after someone has filed their basic documents, if they demonstrate their monthly income is below the median income, they do not have to fill out the forms for the means test as to what they can pay over the next 10 years. They are not covered by that.  Is that the Senator's understanding of what this law says?
