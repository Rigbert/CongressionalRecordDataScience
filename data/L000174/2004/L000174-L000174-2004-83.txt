President, I have an amendment No. 3913, which I will soon withdraw. It is on the subpoena powers of the civil liberties board created in this bill.  We have worked hard to strengthen the powers of the board both at the committee level and then here on the floor, and I believe we have made great progress. We added teeth to this oversight body and fought against efforts to weaken it.  I think the goal of this amendment, which is to give the board enforcement power for its subpoena authority, is an important one. However, in order to expedite the passage of this bill, I will withdraw the amendment now. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue next year. But I also understand the need to expeditethe passage of this bill. There may be another time to bring this up. I will withdraw the amendment now, though I look forward to working with my colleagues on the issue next year.  I withdraw the amendment.
