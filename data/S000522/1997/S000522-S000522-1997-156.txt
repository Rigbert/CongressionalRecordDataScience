Mr. Chairman, this amendment--which I believe should have and will get the support of a very large, bipartisan number of Members of this House--would boost the amount of money for Radio Free Asia by $40 million to provide for 24-hour broadcasting. That is the hope here.  We will soon be voting on the very contentious issue of most-favored-nation status for China.
