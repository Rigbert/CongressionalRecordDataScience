 President, later this month, one of Louisville'sfinest broadcast journalists, Scott Reynolds, will be signing off the air at Wave 3 News for the last time. For more than 20 years, Scott has brought his passion for Louisville and commitment to professionalism to our local NBC affiliate. Along the way, he has won awards, built friendships, and earned the respect of his viewers. As he prepares to leave Wave 3, I would like to take a moment to honor his career of accomplishment in Kentucky.  Scott grew up on a dairy farm an hour outside of Minneapolis, MN. A fierce competitor, he loved playing baseball and watching the professionals on television. Later in his life, Scott would bring that same competitive nature to his work on the other side of the camera as a broadcaster. After graduating college, he moved to northern Idaho to work for a local radio station. Throughout his career, Scott has worked in several markets, including Cedar Rapids, IA, Las Vegas, NV, and eventually back near his home in Minneapolis.  It's from there that Wave 3 convinced Scott to accept a new adventure in Louisville in 1996. He was ready for the intense market, even describing a constant ``news war'' in local television. He is clearly thriving in the competition. Now the anchor of the 5, 6, and 11 pm newscasts, Scott was even recognized among his peers in 2016 winning an Emmy.  Although he has earned his seat behind the anchor's desk, that doesn't mean Scott necessary stays there. In fact, I have heard some of his favorite segments have come from the field, including his coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 and his trip to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  I have enjoyed the many times have gotten to speak with Scott about my work in the U.S. Senate. Discussing a broad range of topics important to Kentuckians throughout the years, I am grateful for his balanced demeanor and commitment to integrity. Every time he interviewed me, it was clear I was talking to one of the best in the business.  Although broadcast journalism is a fast-paced, time-consuming job, Scott still finds time for his many hobbies, including charity work with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the American Red Cross. The rest of his time is devoted to his wife and five children: Haley, Connor, Tyler, and twins Matthew and Logan. I would like to extend my warmest wishes to Scott with gratitude for his work at Wave 3 News. I know his drive and talent will be missed. I would like to ask my Senate colleague to join me in congratulating Scott Reynolds on a job well done.                          ____________________
