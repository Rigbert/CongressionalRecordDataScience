Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the gentleman.  I will say, though, that all of these instances that have been referred to have not happened under State management. I suggest, respectfully, that the Fish and Wildlife is no longer a manager of fish and wildlife. They have become people who prohibit activity on the refuges. That was not why these refuges were made. They were made by the people who hunt and fish, and now we are having other groups that say this is inhumane, which has nothing to do with it.  I am a little bit shocked that we are reading the thing from the Humane Society, PETA, and all of these other groups. Those are not the true facts. I ask the gentleman to, please, look at the true facts.  Management is crucial to the State of Alaska. As I mentioned before, we ought to really think about, maybe, management by the native corporations on their lands, too; but in having the Federal Government manage, it has done a miserable job of the management of game. Their idea of management is to just leave them walking around and to let nature take care of it. I happen to know a little bit about nature, and it doesn't take care of it. We are just talking about management, and the State has that right under its constitution; so I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chairman, this amendment circumvents the established rulemaking process, which solicits public input and uses the best available science to reach a decision. Alaska's aggressive predatory control practices and disregard for science-based management in the approach of the Service would negatively impact the stability of the ecosystems and wildlife throughout the region.  Thirty-one biologists and scientists stated on March 28, 2016, in a letter to Interior Secretary Jewell and Service Director Ash:       The most current and best available science is clear that      predator control measures that are intended to restore the      herd, such as moose and caribou, are doomed to failure      because the herds need to access nutrition. Their main      limiting factor is Alaska's intensive management scheme,      which is the wrong approach to conserving natural systems.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The amendment was agreed to.            Amendment No. 92 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 92 printed in House Report 114-683.
