President, today I am introducing the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1999. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Roth, Grassley, and Bond, who have demonstrated unparalleled leadership on IG issues in the Senate. Indeed, Senator Roth is one of the architects of the inspector general law, having advocated its creation in 1978 and, in 1982, having introduced legislation that created IGs in the Departments of Defense, Justice, and the Treasury. In such distinguished company, I am confident that my legislation hits the mark of improving an already invaluable program.  As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of my top priorities since coming to the Senate has been the seemingly never-ending fight against waste, fraud, and abuse. We have all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The waste of scarce Federal resources not only picks the pockets of taxpayers, but also places severe financial pressures on already overburdened programs, in some cases forcing cutbacks in the delivery of vital Government services.  Over the past 2 years in my capacity as the subcommittee's chairman, I have seen disturbing fraud and waste firsthand in a wide variety of programs. Last year, for example, the subcommittee held several hearings to shine a spotlight on the massive fraud in the Medicare Program. To cite just one example of the subcommittee's findings, our investigation revealed that the Federal Government had been sending Medicare checks to 14 fraudulent health care companies. These companies provided absolutely no services to our senior citizens at all. Indeed, the address listed by one such company did not even exist, and if it had existed, it would have been located in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport.  The fraud we uncovered was stunning. It costs taxpayers millions of dollars each year, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and legitimate health care providers in a program already under enormous financial strain.  The Medicare fraud investigation and others like it were undertaken by my subcommittee working hand in hand with the inspectors general for a variety of Federal agencies. The inspectors general are charged with identifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs administered by the agencies they monitor.  Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the IG Act, the law that Congress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we recognize this important milestone, it is important for Congress to take a close look at the IG system. We must build on its strengths and remedy its weaknesses.  Over the past 21 years, the inspector general community has grown from 12 in 1978 to 58 inspectors general today. Offices of Inspectors General receive more than a billion dollars in annual funding and employ over 12,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support personnel. Each Office of Inspector General shoulders tremendous responsibilities and is given considerable power to uncover waste, fraud, and abuse within Federal programs.  By and large, the IG community has performed in an outstanding manner. IGs have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, ultimately saving taxpayers billions of dollars. Inspectors general have conducted investigations that have resulted in the recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars from companies and individuals who have defrauded the Federal Government.  The inspectors general have a demonstrated record of success over the past 20 years. But as with all Government entities, we must ensure that the IG community is as well-managed, accountable, and effective as possible. IGs are public watchdogs, but they, too, must be watched. With these principles in mind and drawing on my extensive work with the inspectors general over the past 2 years, I am today introducing legislation to improve the accountability, independence, and efficiency of the inspectors general program.  The legislation I am introducing is designed to increase the accountability of inspectors general while retaining and, in some aspects, strengthening the provisions in law that guarantee their independence from the agencies they oversee.  My bill establishes a renewable 9-year term of office for each of the inspectors general who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Currently, Presidential IGs serve for an indeterminate term.  The IG community has testified that having a fixed term of office would provide them with the assurances they need to be able to perform their vital but, in some cases, unpopular oversight responsibilities in a more independent environment.  The 9-year term also would enhance IG autonomy because it would extend beyond two Presidential administrations.  There has been considerable turnover in some of the IG positions, and the establishment of a fixed term would also encourage inspectors general to serve for longer periods of time, thus, adding experience to the IG community. Finally, by providing a defined term of service, an appropriate framework is provided for the evaluation of the performance of each IG to determine if re-appointment is warranted. Thus, Mr. President, the 9-year term I am proposing would both enhance the independence of the IGs while improving their accountability.  My legislation also takes steps to streamline the IG offices themselves, making them more efficient and flexible, by consolidating existing offices and by reducing the frequency with which IGs must prepare and file resource-intensive reports.  Some of the IGs' offices that exist today are very small, with just a handful of employees. They could be made more efficient and effective by transferring their functions to larger IG offices that oversee similar programs.  For example, my legislation consolidates the current stand-alone office of the Federal Labor Relations Authority IG, which has just one employee, into the Office of Personnel Management, thus eliminating unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing the vital audit and oversight capacity of both agencies. In total, three existing small IGs' offices would be consolidated into the IG offices of major departments and two smaller IG offices would be consolidated into one office.  Currently, Mr. President, the Offices of Inspectors General are required by law to provide semiannual reports to Congress. To increase the value of these reports, I am reducing this requirement to a single annual report and streamlining the information presented. In this way, Congress can focus on high-risk areas before they get worse and before the problems become more difficult to solve.  Mr. President, the inspectors general have made very valuable contributions to the efficient operation of the Federal Government. Their record, however, is not without blemish. For example, the community's record was tarnished by the activities of the inspector general at the Department of Treasury. After an extensive investigation, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found this particular IG violated Federal contract laws in her award of two noncompetitive, sole source contracts.  These actions not only wasted thousands of dollars but also shook the confidence of Congress, the agency, and the public in the IG's ability to operate with the highest degree of integrity. It was extremely disturbing to find that this inspector general was herself guilty of wasting resources and abusing the public trust. At the conclusion of our investigation, one could not help but wonder, who is watching the watchdogs?  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that in my view, problems like the ones we uncovered in the Treasury Department are very unusual. They are not characteristic of the IG community. They are not widespread. However, because the inspectors general are the very officials in the Government responsible for combating waste, fraud, and abuse, they should be heldto the very highest ethical standards. Even one example of impropriety is cause for concern.  To increase accountability, my legislation requires independent external reviews of each IG office every 3 years. It gives each office the flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it does require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a qualified third party. This provision is intended to help ensure public confidence in the management and the efficiency of the IG offices and will provide valuable guidance to Congress in fulfilling our oversight responsibilities.  Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the National Commission on the Separation of Powers has endorsed my recommendation that such an independent, external review be conducted of each IG office. The Commission is a bipartisan committee sponsored by the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, and includes among its members former Senator Howard Baker, former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, former U.S. Attorney William Barr, former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and former Director of Central Intelligence William Webster. I am very proud that my proposal has been endorsed by such an esteemed organization.  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today represents a major step toward improving the effectiveness, the independence, and the accountability of the inspectors general program. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the inspectors general program as we approach the next century.  Thank you, Mr. President.                                 ______                                       By
