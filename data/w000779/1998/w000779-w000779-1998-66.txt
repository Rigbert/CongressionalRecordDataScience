President, I am today, along with Congressman Blumenauer in the U.S. House, introducing legislation to make sure that in the next century the children of Portland can go to their kitchen faucet and take a glass of drinking water that is as safe and pure as any that the pioneers found when they got here.  Why protect the Little Sandy? The answer is as clear as the water in that stream. Essentially, what we are proposing is to finish the job begun two years ago with passage of the Oregon Resources and Conservation Act of1996, which brought statutory protection to the Bull Run Watershed.  Portland's city fathers acted in 1890 to protect Bull Run, and it is fitting that we continue that effort today. More than one-third of the Little Sandy watershed has already been logged; clearly, this drainage has already been pushed, and pushed hard, in terms of past timber harvest.  The protection our bill would offer will not only affect clean drinking water, but salmon recovery as well. I am hopeful that this legislation will become an important part of our region's approach to restoring steelhead habitat.  Finally, I want to commend the leadership of Mayor Vera Katz, Commissioner Erik Sten, and former Commissioner Mike Lindberg, whose vision for Portland's future laid the foundation for the introduction of this bill.  I first introduced legislation to protect the Little Sandy when I was in the House. In passing the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996, I made a compromise with Senator Hatfield in which we would designate the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit as a protected area that is off limits to commercial timber harvest, and designate the Little Sandy as a study area. I am now asking the Congress to approve the addition of the Little Sandy study area to the Bull Run Management Unit, and to be subject to the management prescriptions which were established under the ORCA governing the Bull Run.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2509       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
