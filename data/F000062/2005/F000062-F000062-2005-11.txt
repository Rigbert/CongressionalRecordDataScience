 President, I thank the Senator from Washington, and I thank the Chair.  ANWR is an issue that arouses great passion on both sides of this issue, but there are strong arguments that underlie the belief that the opening of these critical 1\1/2\ million acres of pristine wilderness is small, from an oil production perspective, and very damaging environmentally.  First, the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain, where the drilling would occur, is the ecological heart of the Refuge. It is the center of wildlife activity. If ANWR were opened for drilling, the wilderness would be crisscrossed by roads, pipelines, powerplants, and other infrastructure.
