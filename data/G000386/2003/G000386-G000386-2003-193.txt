 President, the Federal Bureau of Investigation faces tremendous challenges in the war on terrorism, particularly with its internal operations, where a culture of fear, retaliation, and coverup demoralize agents and weaken the organizations.  Director Mueller has taken at least two important steps to address this culture. First, he has recognized it, making him one of the first Directors in recent memory to acknowledge the problem. His appointment of Judge Griffin Bell and Dr. Lee Colwell to study the Office of Professional Responsibility, OPR, is an excellent example of his recognizing the seriousness of the problem.  Second, Director Mueller has translated this attitude into action. For example, earlier this year, he justly and fairly punished a senior manager, which was especially noteworthy because he had been handpicked by the Director for the job. Just a few years ago, I could not have imagined an FBI Director taking action against a top official the way he did with Robert Jordan, the Assistant Director of OPR. By implementing the recommended punishment of the Justice Department Inspector General (DOJ OIG), Director Mueller fairly applied high standards to a senior-level FBI official.  I commend the Director for these positive developments, and that is why I feel the following issues are important.  Specifically, I am concerned about the FBI recently awarding contracts to several former senior officials involved in wrongdoing during their careers. The former top officials are Charles Mathews III, who recently retired from the position of Special Agent in Charge of the Portland, OR, Division; Thomas Coyle, who held the position of Assistant Director, Personnel Division; and Special Agent in Charge of the Buffalo, NY, Division; and Joseph Wolfinger, who retired in the late 1990s from the position of Assistant Director of the Training Division in Quantico, VA.  First, it is my understanding that Mr. Mathews recently was selected to accompany several current FBI officials on a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, to conduct training for law enforcement and security officials.  Second, it is my understanding that MPRI, an Alexandria VA, defense and security contracting company, was awarded a contract worth between $500,000 and $1.5 million to conduct counter-intelligence training for FBI agents. Mr. Wolfinger, who holds the title of Senior Vice President and General Manager, heads MPRI's ``Alexandria Group,'' which ``will provide the highest quality education, training, and organizational expertise, to law enforcement and corporations around the world,'' according to the company's Web site. Mr. Coyle is listed as ``Senior Law Enforcement Affiliate'' for the company.  One reason I have questions about these former officials and/or their companies obtaining contracts is that they were involved in the Ruby Ridge scandal (Mathews) and the ``Pottsgate'' scandal (Wolfinger). Mr. Coyle was involved with both Ruby Ridge and Pottsgate.  Ruby Ridge refers not only the deadly 1992 standoff at the Idaho home of Randall Weaver, but also the ensuring coverups of misconduct and lying by senior FBI officials. The Pottsgate scandal refers to the sham conference held in 1997 so friends and co-workers of then-Deputy Director Larry Potts could fly to Washington for his retirement party on the taxpayers' dime, rather than their own personal money.  It is not worth repeating the long and sorry history of the misconduct of all the senior-level officials involved in the Ruby Ridge standoff; Pottsgate; the ensuing investigations, re-investigations, and reviews of investigations; and the failure to take appropriate disciplinary action in both matters. A full recounting covering more than a dozen officials who were involved in wrongdoing would take hundreds of pages.  The most comprehensive, public details of these two scandals are outlined in the DOJ OIG's report, entitled ``A Review of Allegations of a Double Standard of Discipline at the FBI,'' issued in November 2002.  The FBI's reputation and integrity suffered enough when these men escaped any appropriate discipline for wrongdoing during their careers. Not only did they avoid accountability, but recent developments indicate that their former colleagues and friends are rewarding them with lucrative contracts. I am sure this is not the lesson Director Mueller wants agents and the public to learn about the FBI and the way it handles misconduct in its top ranks.  Before I explain my other concerns about Mr. Mathews, Mr. Wolfinger/MPRI, and Mr. Coyle/MPRI profiting--either directly of indirectly--from these contracts, a brief explanation of their involvement in misconduct is necessary. The following is based on the DOJ OIG's report on the double standard in discipline.  Mr. Mathews, in June 1994, led an internal inquiry into the findings of a previous criminal investigation regarding allegations of FBI misconduct during the Ruby Ridge standoff. Danny Coulson, for whom Mr. Mathews worked from 1988 to 1990 in Portand, OR, was one subject of the criminal probes and Mr. Mathews' inquiry.  Mr. Mathews' probe led to discipline for several agents and officials at the scene of the standoff, but not for any headquarters officials--including Mr. Coulson and his boss, Mr. Potts. Later, the Justice Department, DOJ, conducted criminal and administrative investigations into new allegations, including that Mr. Mathews and his investigation covered up misconduct. While under investigation for those issues, Mr. Mathews was promoted twice, and shortly after that DOJ investigation ended in 2001, he was promoted a third time to head the Portland, OR, Division. After contradictory conclusions at the senior levels of the DOJ under former Attorney General Janet Reno, Mr. Mathews, like other senior officials, escaped any discipline.  However, the November 2002 DOJ OIG report later determined that:       Mathews should have been disciplined for failure to carry      out [his] assigned duties--completing thorough and impartial      inquiries--regardless of whether there was evidence of      improper motivation. Moreover,     like DOJ OPR, we believe that there was sufficient evidence      in the record to sustain a finding that [Mathews] acted with      an improper purpose. (Page 64)  The DOJ OIG report also stated:       We also believe that Mathews' failure to rescue himself      despite his relationship with Coulson, taken together with      his statements and the unsubstantiated findings in his report      regarding approval of the rules of engagement, established by      a preponderance of the evidence that Mathews conducted an      inadequate investigation. (Page 64)  The Pottsgate scandal refers to the allegation, among others, that Mr. Wolfinger, in October of 1997, arranged a conference to justify official business travel to Washington, DC, of senior officials so they could attend the retirement party of Mr. Potts, who was Deputy Director of the FBI at the time. The investigation focused on whether: the ``conference'' was a sham; it was used to justify the personal travel of officials to Washington for the party; those officials misrepresented their actions on travel forms and other government documents; and the officials were less than honest to investigators about their actions.  Mr. Wolfinger, the Assistant Director of the Training Division in Quantico, VA, was the organizer of the Thursday, October 9, 1997, retirement party for Mr. Potts. Just 7 days before the party, Mr. Wolfinger ordered a subordinate to send out a communication to the field announcing a conference for Special agents in charge, SACs, on Friday, October 10, 1997, the day after the party.  This ``conference'' was unusual in several ways, as the DOJ OIG November 2002 report points out. The conference--     announcement did not contain a conference schedule, a      starting or concluding time, a training identification      number, or travel instructions. The conference was scheduled      for a Friday, normally a travel day for FBI employees      following the conclusion of conferences. (Page 17)  The DOJ OIG report identifies other unusual characteristics of the ``conference.'' Only five people attended: Mr. Wolfinger, the subordinate he ordered to organize it, two SACs, and another individual. The agent who was ordered to give a presentation was told of the conference only 3 days before, on October 7, 1997. The conference had no formal agenda, and it lasted between 45 minutes and 90 minutes, rather than all day.  Despite the damning evidence, a disciplinary board of Senior Executive Service, SES, officials decided the ``conference'' was not a sham, though the board did conclude ``the planners exercised poor judgment in not properly preparing for it.'' (Page 26)  The DOJ OIG report notes that it is unclear exactly what action, if any, the board during two meetings decided to take against Mr. Wolfinger, who retired shortly after the board's meetings. Ultimately, however, it appears that Mr. Wolfinger was not punished. Michael Defeo, the Assistant Director of FBI OPR at the time, told the DOJ OIG that ``no recommendation as to Wolfinger was ultimately made . . .'' (Page 28)  Mr. Coyle, a coworker of Mr. Wolfinger at MPRI, was one member of the disciplinary board in the Pottsgate matter. The DOJ OIG concluded:       Coyle should not have participated because, at a minimum,      an appearance of a conflict of interest existed, if not an      actual conflict of interest. (Page 30)  As the DOJ OIG report notes, at the time of the board's decisions, Mr. Coyle and Mr. Potts were subjects of the Ruby Ridge investigation. The DOJ OIG wrote:       It was well known that many people wanted to attend the      Potts retirement party to show support for him because of the      Ruby Ridge investigation. That attitude was likely to be      especially strong for someone like Coyle who also was a Ruby      Ridge subject. We believe that Coyle should have recused      himself or been removed from these Board proceedings. (Page      30)  The actions of these officials during their careers at the FBI are troubling. That is why I sent Director Mueller a letter today asking questions about the contracts these men were awarded. I asked for a response by Wednesday, August 27, 2003.  Mr. Chairman, I also ask that the letter, dated today, July 22, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 22, 2003.     Hon. Robert Mueller,     Federal Bureau of Investigation,     Washington, DC.       Dear Director Mueller: The purpose of this letter is to      inquire about the FBI recently awarding contracts to several      former senior officials. The former top officials are Charles      Mathews III, who recently retired from the position of      Special Agent in Charge of the Portland, Oregon Division;      Thomas Coyle, who held the position of Assistant Director,      Personnel Division, and Special Agent in Charge of the      Buffalo, New York Division; and Joseph Wolfinger, who retired      in the later 1990s from the position of Assistant Director of      the Training Division in Quanticao, Virginia.       First, it is my understanding that Mr. Methews recently was      selected to accompany several current FBI officials on a trip      to Jakarta, Indonesia, to conduct training for law      enforcement and security officials.       Second, it is my understanding that MPRI, an Alexandria,      Virginia defense and security contracting company, was      awarded a contract worth between $500,000 and $1.5 million to      conduct counter-intelligence training for FBI agents. Mr.      Wolfinger, who holds the title of Senior Vice President and      General Manager, heads MPRI's ``Alexandria Group,'' which      ``will provide the highest quality education, training and      organizational expertise, to law enforcement and corporations      around the world,'' according to the company's Web site.
