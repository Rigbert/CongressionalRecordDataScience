President, last month, the Senate came together and passed the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012. Our legislation takes some much needed steps to help the most vulnerable victims of domestic and sexual violence, and it was passed with significant bipartisan support. The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act was an example of what we accomplish when we put politics aside and work to find real solutions to real problems facing real Americans.  Few laws have had a greater impact on the lives of women in this country than the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). By shining a light on the insidious crimes of domestic and sexual violence, this law(s initial passage nearly 20 years ago sent a powerful message that violence against women would no longer be tolerated. The days of dismissing these crimes with a joke or a shrug were over. The resources, training and law enforcement tools provided by VAWA transformed the criminal justice and community-based response to abuse. It gave support and protection to the victims who for generations had been blamed, humiliated and ignored.  With each reauthorization of this landmark law, Congress has repeatedly shown its bipartisan commitment to ending domestic and sexual violence by building on the protections in the initial legislation and expanding the reach of VAWA to meet the remaining unmet needs of victims.  The bill that I introduced with Senator Crapo, and which passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority just last month, is based on the successful tradition of preserving and enhancing protections. It is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, and law enforcement officers from all across the country and from across the political spectrum. We purposely avoided proposals that were extreme or divisive and selected only those proposals that law enforcement and survivors and the professionals who work with crime victims every day told us were essential. That is why the provisions in the Senate bill have such widespread support. More than 1,000 Federal, state, and local organizations have endorsed it, including service providers, law enforcement, religious organizations and many, many more.  The inclusive, open process of drafting this legislation is also why the Senate bill always had strong bipartisan support. It was a bipartisan effort from the beginning with eight Republican Senators cosponsoring the bill and seven more joining Democratic and Independent Senators in voting to pass the bill. We were able to move able to move to the bill without a filibuster, to consider amendments, which were rejected, and to pass the bill with almost 70 votes. We adopted a bill of which the Senate can be proud, because it serves the interests of the American people while improving support and protection for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  I am alarmed the other body--the House--has chosen a different path. Instead of building on the broad bipartisan support for the Senate-passed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee last week took up a bill, H.R.4970, that they crafted in back rooms without the input of those who dedicate their lives to helping victims. This afternoon the House Republican leadership brought that same bill to the floor, with only minor modifications that do little to respond to the urgent concerns of victims, and is forcing an up or down vote while blocking any attempts to modify the legislation in response to the concerns raised by victims and service providers around the country. Their legislation not only fails to include the critical improvements in the Senate bill that would increase protections for Native-American women, gay and lesbian victims, battered immigrant women, and victims on college campuses or victims in subsidized housing, it actually rolls back existing protections leaving many victims more vulnerable to sexual and domestic abuse. Among the most troubling provisions are those that drastically undercut important, longstanding protections that are vital to the safety and protection of battered immigrant victims.  As a result of this misguided effort, the House bill is strongly opposed by many of the leading organizations that know these issues best, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the American Bar Association, the YWCA, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and many, many more.  The thousands of local advocates and service providers around the country that make up the National Network to End Domestic Violence warned in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee that H.R. 4970 would (weaken, rather than enhance, protections for victims of domestic violence.( Sue Else, the President of that organization, lamented:       This is an unprecedented departure from this effective      law(s original intent. Thousands of victim advocates across      the country recommended substantial improvements for the      latest reauthorization, and the U.S. Senate accepted those      recommendations in a bipartisan way. It is alarming that the      House Judiciary Committee has not done the same.  The American Bar Association has stated:       Unlike the recently passed Senate bill (S. 1925), which      reflects discussions with more than 2,000 advocates and      experts across the country, H.R. 4970 represents a retreat      from the fight against domestic and sexual violence. It fails      to add critical improvements to address the needs of      underserved populations, like victims who are members of      faith communities and those who are denied services because      of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and strips      critical protections from existing law.  The YWCA, the largest provider of services for battered women in the country, calls the House bill a ``dangerous bill that puts the lives of millions of women across the nation at risk.'' These organizations represent those on the front lines against domestic and sexual violence. They are motivated by their desire to see all victims get the help they need.  Likewise, a number of faith-based organizations, such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of Evangelicals, and nearly 20 other religious institutions have joined a letter stating that they are ``deeply troubled'' by the ``many provisions [in the House bill] that actually would roll back protections in current law for battered non-citizens, making them more vulnerable and, in some cases, endangering their lives.''  House Republicans are headed down the wrong path. In fact, when the Senate rejected their alternative to our bipartisan bill last month by a strong bipartisan vote of only 37 in favor and 62 opposed, I had hoped that would end the partisanship and the gamesmanship and we would be able to move forward together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. I was encouraged to see the lead sponsor of the Republican alternative, the distinguished senior Senator from Texas, do just that and join with us to support the bipartisan Senate bill upon final passage. I commended Senator Hutchison for doing so. Likewise, we were buoyed by the support on final passage by the Senior Senator from Arizona, the Senators from Tennessee, Senator Coates of Indiana, Senator Hoeven of North Dakota, Senator Portman of Ohio and Senator Vitter of Louisiana.  Despite all this, House Republicans seem determined to destroy this bipartisan effort. As evidenced by the vote they are forcing today, they are intent on proceeding with their bill to roll back victim protections and insistent that it be done without the opportunity to consider the better, Senate-passed bill or, for that matter, any other amendments to their ill-conceived effort to undercut the Violence Against Women Act.  The House Republican bill not only fails to protect more victims, but actually weakens existing protections. I fear that it puts more lives at risk.  In its Statement of Administration Policy, the Obama administration correctly opposes the House bill, H.R. 4970, as a measure that ``would undermine the core principles of the Violence Against Women Act.'' It notes the House Republican bill ``retreats'' from the progress represented by the protections included in the bipartisan Senate-passed bill and ``weakens'' critical protections for victims. The House provisions ``senselessly remove existing legal protections, undermine VAWA's core purpose of protecting victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, frustrate important law enforcement objectives, and jeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm's way.'' It concludes with a threatened veto recommendation since the House measure ``rolls back existing law and removes long-standing protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.'' Never before, in either Republican or Democratic administrations, Republican- or Democrat-controlled Houses or Senates, has the Violence Against Women Act been used to increase the dangers to women and so consciously disregard the unmet needs of our most vulnerable victims. Never before.  Last week the White House Advisor on Violence Against Women noted that the House Republican bill ``adds burdensome, counter-productive requirements that compromise the ability of service providers to reach victims, fails to adequately protect Tribal victims, lacks important protection and services for LGBT victims, weakens resources for victims living in subsidized housing, and eliminates important improvements to address dating violence and sexual assault on college campuses.'' She is right.  The closed process by which the House Republican leadership insistedits ill-conceived bill be rubberstamped breaks House Republican promises to allow amendments and proceed by an open amendment process. The House Republican bill's roll back of protections breaks the promise of the Violence Against Women Act to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Never before has the Violence Against Women Act been used to increase the dangers to women and so consciously disregarded the unmet needs of our most vulnerable victims.  A recent New York Times editorial entitled ``Backwards on Domestic Violence'' had it right: ``House members on both sides of the aisle who are serious about combating domestic violence must work to defeat this atrocious bill.'' That sentiment was reinforced by a recent Los Angeles Times editorial which stated: ``Republicans in the House should drop their attempts to undermine the Violence Against Women Act and instead move swiftly to reauthorize and strengthen the existing program, as the Senate has already done.''  Today The Washington Post reports on another study by Human Rights Watch documenting sexual violence and harassment of female farmworkers. Congress should not be turning its backs to these battered and abused women. We should be moving forward promptly to adopt the provisions of the Senate-passed bill to protect the most vulnerable among us, women who are doubly victimized by abusers and by the fear that they have no recourse.  I thank Senators Murray, Menendez and Shaheen for their strong statements in support of the Senate-passed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act yesterday. I am disheartened by the decision of the House Republican leadership to try to push through their destructive bill over the clear objections of those very victims it is supposed to serve. I urge the supporters of the bipartisan Senate bill to continue our efforts to see that this carefully crafted legislation that meets the needs of so many people is finally passed into law.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement of Administrative Policy, the editorials from the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, and the letters to which I have referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 4970--Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012          (Rep. Adams, R FL, and 40 cosponsors, May 15, 2012)       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4970, a bill that      would undermine the core principles of the Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA). VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation      that first passed the Congress in 1994 and has twice been      reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan support, each time      with important improvements to strengthen VAWA. The Act      transformed the Nation's response to violence against women      and brought critically needed resources to States and local      communities to address these crimes.       H.R. 4970 retreats from this forward progress by failing to      include several critical provisions that are part of the      Senate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill. For instance, H.R.      4970 fails to provide for concurrent special domestic      violence criminal jurisdiction by tribal authorities over      non-Indians, and omits clarification of tribal courts' full      civil jurisdiction regarding certain protection orders over      non-Indians. Given that three out of five Native American      women experience domestic violence in their lifetime, these      omissions in H.R. 4970 are unacceptable. The bill also fails      to include language that would prohibit discrimination      against LGBT victims in VAWA grant programs. No sexual      assault or domestic violence victim should be beaten, hurt,      or killed because they could not access needed support,      assistance, and protection. In addition, H.R. 4970 does not      include important improvements to the Clery Act found in the      Senate-passed bill that would address the high rates of      dating violence and sexual assault experienced by young      people in college and other higher education institutions.      The bill also weakens critical new provisions in the Senate-     passed bill that would improve safety for victims living in      subsidized housing.       H.R. 4970 also takes direct aim at immigrant victims of      domestic violence and sexual assault by removing critical      protections currently in law. H.R. 4970 allows abusers to be      notified when a victim files a VAWA self-petition for relief,      and it eliminates the path to citizenship for U visa      holders--victims of serious crimes such as torture, rape, and      domestic violence--who are cooperating with law enforcement      in the investigation or prosecution of these crimes. These      proposals senselessly remove existing legal protections,      undermine VAWA's core purpose of protecting victims of sexual      assault and domestic violence, frustrate important law      enforcement objectives, and jeopardize victims by placing      them directly in harm's way.       The Administration urges the House to find common ground      with the bipartisan Senate-passed bill and consider and pass      legislation that will protect all victims. H.R. 4970 rolls      back existing law and removes long-standing protections for      victims of domestic violence and sexual assault--crimes that      predominately affect women. If the President is presented      with H.R. 4970, his senior advisors would recommend that he      veto the bill.                                  ____                                           National Network To End                                            Domestic Violence,                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2012.     Hon. Lamar Smith,     House Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.     Hon. John Conyers,     Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: The      National Network to End Domestic Violence, which represents      all of our nation's state and territorial domestic violence      and dual domestic violence-sexual assault coalitions, their      2,000 member programs and the millions of victims they serve      every year, opposes HR 4970, a bill introduced by      Representatives Sandy Adams (R FL) and Eric Cantor (R VA) to      reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).       VAWA was initially passed in 1994 and subsequently      reauthorized in 2000 and 2005 to meet the needs of victims.      HR 4970 fails to meet, and in fact, weakens, rather than      enhances, protections for victims of domestic violence. The      network of survivors and advocates who work on a daily basis      with courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, shelters, academic      and medical institutions need VAWA's tools--its laws and      programs--to help keep victims safe. All of us are alarmed      that HR 4970 takes the wrong direction and will be dangerous      for victims.       We are particularly concerned with provisions that erode      critical safety measures for immigrant victims seeking safety      and justice, fail to fix a jurisdictional issue for victims      on tribal lands who are beaten by non-tribal perpetrators      with near impunity, and turn a blind eye to lesbian, gay and      other marginalized communities. If enacted, this bill would      jeopardize victims' lives and embolden perpetrators of      violence. HR 4970 also wrongly grows bureaucracy through the      costly and excessive auditing of small nonprofits. Resources      would be better spent training and supporting those important      organizations that provide these lifesaving services and      advocacy. And finally, the emergency housing transfer section      in this bill, which is intended to help victims flee violent,      dangerous perpetrators without becoming homeless, is weakened      by allowing the adoption of transfer policies to be      ``voluntary'' by owners, managers and public housing      agencies.       The U.S. House of Representatives has the opportunity to      develop and pass a bipartisan VAWA that meets the needs of      victims. HR 4970 is not such a bill. We look forward to      working with the House Judiciary Committee and all Members of      Congress to develop a bill that is reflective of the needs of      all victims. Please contact Paulette Sullivan Moore, NNEDV's      Vice President of Policy, at [email protected] with any      questions.           Sincerely,                                                         Sue Else,     President.                                  ____                                                      May 7, 2012.     Hon. Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Conyers,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: On behalf      of the undersigned faith leaders and faith-based      organizations concerned about victims of domestic violence,      human trafficking, sexual assault, and other forms of      violence, we write to express our concerns about Title VIII      of H.R. 4970, legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA), which we understand the House Committee on      the Judiciary plans to mark up tomorrow.       Faith communities are on the front lines, identifying      victims, providing refuge, referring victims and their      families for services, and offering hope and healing. In      times of crisis, victims often turn to faith communities and      leaders for support and moral guidance because they see      places of worship as a sanctuary from the horrors they have      experienced. Through our ministry with victims, we have      learned that abusers often exploit a victim's immigration      status, leaving individuals extremely vulnerable and afraid      to report the abuse to law enforcement, assist in the      prosecution of crimes, and seek services.       Congress created VAWA in 1994, and it has voted twice since      then to reauthorize the law, each time with broad bipartisan      support. However, we are deeply troubled by Title VIII of      H.R. 4970, as introduced. Title VIII contains many provisions      that actually would roll back protections in current law for      battered non-citizens, making them more vulnerable and, in      some cases, endangering their lives. We urge you to strike      these provisions from the bill before the measure is brought      before the full House of Representatives for a vote.       VAWA is an effective tool in combatting the devastating      crimes of domestic violence and providing lifesaving programs      and services. We urge Congress to preserve and improve      protections for vulnerable immigrant victims.           Sincerely,       Noel Castellanos, CEO, Christian Community Development      Association; Rev. John L. McCullough, Executive Director and      CEO, Church World Service; Wendy Tarr, Director, Clergy and      Laity United for Economic Justice; Alex Baumgarten, Director      of Government Relations, The Episcopal Church; Luis Cortes,      President, Esperanza; Alexia Salvatierra, Director of Justice      Ministries, Southwest California Synod Evangelical Lutheran      Church in America; Patrick Carolan, Executive Director,      Franciscan Action Network; Gideon Aronoff, President and CEO,      Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; Orlando Crespo, National      Director, La Fe Multi-Ethnic Ministries, Intervarsity      Christian Fellowship/USA; Janet Mock, CSJ, Executive      Director, Leadership Conference of Women Religious.

Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Bar      Association, with nearly 400,000 members, I write to express      our opposition to H.R. 4970, the Violence Against Women Act      reauthorization bill introduced by Rep. Sandy Adams (R-FL),      which is scheduled to be considered by the House Judiciary      Committee on May 8, 2012. We urge members of the committee to      oppose the bill.       VAWA has been the single most effective federal effort to      respond to the epidemic of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault and stalking in this country. The      act has ensured that legal and social services are available      to survivors, and that law enforcement, prosecutors, judges,      attorneys and advocates are well-trained and equipped with      cutting-edge resources to effectively address these crimes in      their own communities.       Reauthorization of VAWA is critical, providing Congress      with the opportunity to amend the act in order to combat      domestic and sexual violence more effectively. For example,      in 2000, Congress created the Legal Assistance to Victims      grant program. It also created the U visa for immigrants who      are victims of serious crimes and who have cooperated with      authorities in the prosecution of the perpetrator, and it      authorized funding for increased protection of older      individuals and individuals with disabilities. And in 2005,      it became unlawful to deny an individual housing assistance      simply because the individual is a victim of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking.      Congress also created a new grant program to improve court      responses to these crimes.       H.R. 4970 does not continue this tradition of improvement.      Unlike the recently passed Senate bill (S. 1925), which      reflects discussions with more than 2,000 advocates and      experts across the country, H.R. 4970 represents a retreat      from the fight against domestic and sexual violence. It fails      to add critical improvements to address the needs of      underserved populations, like victims who are members of      faith communities and those who are denied services because      of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and strips      critical protections from existing law.       The provisions of H.R. 4970 that significantly undermine      protections available to vulnerable immigrant victims of      violence are of particular concern. Before enactment of VAWA,      abusive U.S. Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs)      were able to use the immigration laws as a mechanism to      further abuse and control their immigrant spouses and      children. Perpetrators of domestic violence routinely would      thwart, or threaten to thwart, the visa petitioning process.      In creating a special application process for battered      spouses and children of U.S. Citizens and LPRs, lawmakers      recognized that many victims of domestic abuse were      unwittingly victimized by the immigration system as well.       The current VAWA green card application process involves a      ``self-petition,'' so that the abuser is not involved at all      in the process and prohibits the government from releasing      information about the existence of a VAWA immigration case to      the abuser or others. H.R. 4970 removes those critical      protections. A forced choice between deportation or safety      from an abusive spouse or trafficker is the precise evil that      the original self-petitioning provisions of the VAWA were      intended to eliminate. H.R. 4970 creates obstacles for      immigrant victims seeking to report crimes and increases the      danger to victims by eliminating important confidentiality      provisions.       Because it fails to improve upon our nation's response to      domestic violence and sexual assault by ensuring that all      populations are protected and in fact rolls back critical      protections in existing law, the ABA urges you to oppose H.R.      4970. VAWA is a critical tool in the arsenal to address      domestic and sexual violence, and it must be improved during      this reauthorization process to address the needs of all      victims and hold more offenders accountable.           Sincerely,                                                 Thomas M. Susman,     Director, Governmental Affairs Office.                                  ____                                                      May 7, 2012.       Dear Representative: As the largest provider of battered      women's services in the United States, with over 1300      locations in 47 states, the YWCA is deeply invested in the      safety and health of all women. The YWCA serves over half a      million women each year through its anti-violence programs,      providing much needed access for victims of violence to 24-     hour crisis hotlines, emergency shelter, counseling services,      legal assistance, child care, economic empowerment programs      and transitional housing. The YWCA strongly opposes any      legislation that puts victims' lives at risk, and as such,      opposes H.R. 4970 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women      Act (VAWA) introduced by Rep. Sandy Adams (R-FL).       For nearly 18 years, VAWA has provided a national,      streamlined response to address domestic violence, sexual      assault, dating violence and stalking. H.R. 4970 cuts back on      critical provisions outlined in S. 1925, passed last month,      that protect some of the most vulnerable women in our      communities, and as a result, is a dangerous bill that puts      the lives of millions of women across the nation at risk.       Under H.R. 4970, immigrant women will be required to      conduct interviews for U-visa petitions in person, which does      not take into consideration the unfortunate reality of many      victims of violence where their movement is strictly limited      or closely monitored by their abusers. In addition, H.R. 4970      would eliminate key confidentially measures by allowing USCIS      officers to notify and interview the abusers. Not only will      this keep immigrant victims from reporting abuse, but it will      put their lives at risk if they do proceed to apply for a U-     visa. Studies indicate that the two most heightened periods      of danger for victims of abuse are when they are pregnant and      when they decide to leave an abusive situation--disregarding      the importance of confidentiality and informing the abuser of      the victims' intent to leave will undoubtedly lead to greater      danger for the very people that this bill purports to assist.       H.R. 4970 disregards the epidemic rates of violence in      Indian Country by allowing batterers to avoid prosecution on      Tribal lands. By doing so, the bill fails to hold      perpetrators of violence accountable for their actions and      sends a clear message to Native victims of violence to remain      silent and endure abuse. Without explicitly addressing the      issue of accountability, Native victims will continue to      remain fearful of reporting crimes of abuse. H.R. 4970 also      strips all support for LGBT victims of abuse, claiming that      they are not the `right' victims. The YWCA supports all women      and victims of abuse regardless of sexual orientation,      immigration status, or race, and does not stand for isolating      entire subsets of the community that face unique barriers to      accessing services. By excluding the LGBT community in the      bill, H.R. 4970 it prevents providers from serving ALL women,      and no one should be denied help based on their sexual      orientation.       H.R. 4970 fails to provide inclusive provisions that      address the unique needs of underserved communities, which      would in turn endanger the lives of millions of women across      the nation. The YWCA supports legislation that is trauma      informed, victim centered, and evidence based, and is opposed      to any provisions that force victims to negotiate their      safety when seeking assistance from abusive situations.       In short, we urge you to oppose H.R. 4970.       Please contact Desiree Hoffman, Director of Advocacy and      Policy at [email protected] or Qudsia Jafree, Field and      Policy Coordinator at [email protected] should you have      questions.           Sincerely,                                                  Desiree Hoffman,     YWCA USA, Director of Advocacy and Policy.                                  ____                       [From the New York Times]                     Backward on Domestic Violence       In an all-too-rare show of bipartisanship, 15 Senate      Republicans joined with the Democratic majority last month to      reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, the landmark 1994      law that is key to efforts against domestic violence, sexual      assault and stalking.       Unfortunately, the lopsided 68-to-31 Senate vote halted      G.O.P. opponents only temporarily. The House Judiciary      Committee last week approved its version of the      reauthorization bill, which not only omits improvements the      Senate bill made to the law but also removes existing      protections for immigrant women, putting them at greater risk      of domestic and sexual abuse.       The Senate's measure ensures that victims are not denied      services because they are gay or transgender. It also strives      to ensure that domestic violence crimes committed by non-     Indian men in tribal communities are prosecuted. The Senate      bill also would modestly     expand the availability of special U-visas for undocumented      immigrants who are victims of domestic violence. That move      was supported by law enforcement to encourage victims to come      forward and testify against their abusers.       The regressive House alternative removes these and other      improvements, including new protections for students on      college campuses. The House measure would eliminate a      confidentiality requirement in current law that protects the      identity of immigrant women who file domestic violence      complaints against a spouse who is a citizen or legal      resident and allows the women to apply for legal status on      their own.       House Republicans claim there is a big fraud problem in      this area, but there is no hard evidence of that. And their      plan to end the centralized handling of these issues by a      Vermont-based office would undermine the government's ability      to detect untruthful stories.       House members on both sides of the aisle who are serious      about combating domestic violence must work to defeat this      atrocious bill. If that fails, the Senate will need to insist      on fixing it during the reconciliation process.                                  ____                    [From latimes.com, May 15, 2012]            Partisanship and the Violence Against Women Act       The House needs to reauthorize the law, without limits, as      it has in the past, so Republicans can demonstrate that      helping battered women is more important than political      games.       The political climate in Congress is so noxious these days      that even a law that originally passed with overwhelming      bipartisan support because it provided much-needed help to      abused women is now a partisan issue. That's shameful.      Republicans in the House should drop their attempts to      undermine the Violence Against Women Act and instead move      swiftly to reauthorize and strengthen the existing program,      as the Senate has already done.       First enacted in 1994, the law has been renewed twice      without a fight. Last week, however, some of the same GOP      lawmakers who once endorsed the law retreated, voting in      committee to strip out provisions designed to protect      immigrants. Under VAWA as it has long existed, if an      immigrant married to a U.S. citizen or a green-card holder--     and therefore eligible to stay in the country permanently--     can show evidence of abuse, he or she may file independently      without having to rely on the abusive spouse. VAWA's gender-     neutral protections apply to legal and illegal immigrants and      allow the victim to file confidentially.       Confidentiality is crucial. As the Republican-led House      Judiciary Committee noted in its 2005 report to reauthorize      VAWA and expand protections, without such guarantees, an      abuser could try to derail a spouse's green-card application      or push to have him or her deported. A battered woman whose      application depends on her abusive husband certainly might      think twice about filing if she knew her abuser would be      notified that she was seeking help without him.       Eliminating the confidentiality provision is one of several      changes House Republicans would like to make to weaken the      law. They argue that the changes are necessary to combat      fraud, in which immigrants falsely claim to have been abused      in order to obtain visas. But where are the data and studies      that fraud is a problem? Immigrant victims who petition for      visas under VAWA are already required to supply ample      evidence of abuse, such as police reports or medical records.      And applications undergo intense scrutiny. In fiscal 2011,      immigration officials denied nearly a third of those      petitions.       The House reauthorization bill also seeks to undercut a      provision that allows undocumented immigrants who assist in      prosecutions of serious crime for U visas, and ultimately      obtain green cards. The proposed changes would allow victims      to obtain temporary visas only. Surely, even those lawmakers      who embrace anti-immigrant legislation can appreciate that U      visas help protect American citizens too, by encouraging      witnesses to step forward without fear of deportation. That's      why the program enjoys the backing of many law enforcement      groups.       The House will vote on Wednesday. It should reauthorize      VAWA without limits, as it has in the past, and demonstrate      that helping battered women, those who are immigrants, isn't      a partisan issue.                          ____________________
