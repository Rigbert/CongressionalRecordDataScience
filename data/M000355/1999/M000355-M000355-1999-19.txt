 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be granted permission to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, October 19, for purposes of conducting a joint committee hearing with the Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. The purpose of this oversight hearing is to receive testimony on the Department of Energy's implementation of provisions of the Department of Defense Authorization Act which create the National Nuclear Security Administration.
