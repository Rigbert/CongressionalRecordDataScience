I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) for his leadership on this and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) for his leadership on this as well.  This is the right thing to do. The good news is that we are healthier for longer periods of time, more able to do vigorous things. Obviously, our first responders, our firefighters and emergency response teams, whether they be career or volunteer, are critical components of our society. They are professionals in every sense of the word, whether paid or volunteer; well trained. What this will do will allow us for another 2 years to avail ourselves of that training, that expertise, that commitment, and that courage.                              {time}  1800  That is a very important thing for us to do. Some may or may not know that there are some 10,000-plus firefighters in the Federal service, as well as, of course, thousands and thousands across this Nation, both paid and volunteer.  Firefighting is one of the most dangerous enterprises, and because it is so, it requires people who have experience. I think this bill will go a long way towards providing us the ability when the firefighter chooses to allow them to continue in service until 57. As has been, I am sure, observed on the floor of this House, this will make parity between our law enforcement personnel and our firefighting personnel; a very appropriate step for us to take.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and, like all of my colleagues, are in grateful recognition of the critical contribution that firefighters and emergency response personnel throughout this country make to our communities. As evidence of that, those of my colleagues who are new, I would urge my colleagues to join the Fire Service Caucus. It is the largest caucus in the Congress of the United States, bipartisan, led by and founded by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), himself a former fire chief and probably is the most knowledgeable person we have in this country on fire issues.  I note on the floor, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who was a leader on an effort for the first time last year in this Congress, with the leadership on the majority side and on the minority side, in a bipartisan way, to appropriate $100 million for firefighters and emergency responders throughout this country.  Madam Speaker, this is an appropriate step, and I am pleased to join my colleagues in seeing its overwhelming support.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), one of the most respected Members of the House.  (
