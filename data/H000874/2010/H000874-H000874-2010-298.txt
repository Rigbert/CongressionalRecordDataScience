Elizabeth (Liz) Smith, who retired last week from the American Federation of Teachers, AFT.  Bringing opportunity and respect to working men and women across America was the driving force in Liz's more than 4 decades of public service. And this commitment never waned. Workers fighting for fair wages, high-quality healthcare and a secure retirement always had a strong ally in Liz Smith. She fought for them every day.  Liz began her professional career working for two of my colleagues in the House of Representatives. She served as chief of staff to Representative James O'Hara of Michigan, and later as legislative director to Representative Dale Kildee of Michigan; both benefited greatly from her energy and commitment. In those positions, Liz worked tirelessly to ensure that the voices of constituents were heard inWashington and that the federal government responded to their needs.  Deciding to leave the Congress she loved was a tough choice for Liz. But it was a natural progression to join the labor movement. She knew that her next assignment as legislative and political director at the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union was in keeping with her values and unwavering commitment to the men and women of the American labor movement. In this position, Liz worked with passion and moved with dispatch to ensure that the interests of the country's clothing and textile workers were fully represented not only before the U.S. Congress and Executive Branch, but internationally as well.  In 1995, Liz accepted a position as political director at the American Federation of Teachers in what would become the final and perhaps most important stop in her accomplished career. During her 15 years there, Liz's work on behalf of the more than 1.4 million members of the AFT included many accomplishments and milestones. She carried with her an intimate knowledge of the important work performed by AFT members and an ability to advance with unmatched skill and grace the causes she cared about most.  Liz is a true leader, always doing the right thing in a manner that is respectful of others and in turn earning others' respect. She is a wonderful woman and will be missed dearly by all of us who have had the pleasure of working with her. I wish Liz all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
