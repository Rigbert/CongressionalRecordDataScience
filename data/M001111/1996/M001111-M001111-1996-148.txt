 President, I am honored and proud to recognize the Boeing Co. from my home State of Washington as the 1996 winner of the prestigious Collier Trophy presented by the National Aeronautic Association. The Collier Trophy, the industry's highest honor for aeronautics achievement, will be presented to the Boeing 777 team this evening here in the Nation's capital.  According to the National Aeronautic Association, Boeing was cited for, ``designing, manufacturing and placing into service the world's most technologically advanced airline transport.'' These words are high praise, yet they only begin to describe the awesome innovations achieved by the 777team. The 777 was developed under the theme ``Working Together'' and represents the work of thousands of Boeing employees, Boeing customers and program partners, thousands of suppliers, regulatory authorities, passengers, pilots, and flight attendants. The Working Together concept and process will be a model for future research and development efforts for U.S. industry.  The 777, with approximately 300 aircraft on order, positions the Boeing Co. and its family of aircraft to compete and succeed in the competitive global market for years to come. The 777 is the fourth Boeing Co. Collier Trophy winner; the B-52, the 747 and the 757-767 programs also received this coveted award.  The Boeing 777 is the first commercial jetliner designed and preassembled entirely by computer simulation. More than 235 design-build teams, linked electronically through advanced computers, worked together to create the airplane's parts and systems and to evaluate the aircraft from every perspective. This new and innovative development process enabled the 777 program to exceed its goal of reducing change, error, and rework by 50 percent. Importantly, Boeing plans to apply this new development model for maximum efficiency to other airplane programs.  The most exhaustive flight test program in commercial jetliner history helped the 777 earn simultaneous certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Joint Aviation Authorities. The 777 is the first airplane in aviation history to earn FAA approval to fly extended-range twin-engine operations routes at service entry. This allowed airlines to offer the most direct routes between transoceanic cities beginning on the aircraft's first day of service. Before entering into service, the 777 set National Aeronautic Association-certified speed records between Seattle, Washington and cities in Sweden, Thailand, France, Germany, and Switzerland.  The 777 contains numerous other technological aircraft advancements. The fuselage is wider in cross-section than any other jetliner with similar seating capacity. Advanced composite materials have lowered direct operating costs, improved aircraft safety, and created new cargo opportunities for airlines. More than 7,000 hours of flight deck pilot simulation will provide more reliability, longer service life and better visibility for pilots. The landing gear features better weight distribution on runways while reducing weight and maintenance costs. The 777 will carry approximately 100 more passengers and has a noise footprint less than half that of the older jets it is designed to replace.  On May 15, 1995, United Airlines took delivery of the very first Boeing 777. This momentous occasion was marked by a special ceremony at the Seattle Museum of Flight. On June 7, 1995, the 777 entered commercial service with United as Flight No. 921, traveling from London's Heathrow Airport to Dulles Airport in Washington, DC.  More than 20 airlines have signed orders to purchase and fly the Boeing 777. Importantly, virtually all of the airlines are foreign customers including British Airways, China Southern, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air Lines, Thai Airways, Japan Airlines, South Africa Airways, and Saudi Arabia Airlines. This ensures that the Boeing Co. will remain one of America's premier exporters. I want to stress to my colleagues that this international aircraft is a job generator for my home State as well as Americans in virtually every State.  Congratulations to the 777 team, the Boeing Co., and the thousands of individual Washingtonians who labored to design and build this historic aircraft.                          ____________________
