 President, based on comments we have heard from some of our colleagues on the other side over the last 2 days, there is some genuine concern that the bipartisan immigration compromise that Members and staff have been working on so diligently over the last 2 months might be brushed aside in favor of last year's unsuccessful bill. I strongly urge all of our colleagues to reconsider this approach, if, indeed, it is the one they plan to take.  This exercise needs to be a bipartisan one or it will not--it will not--succeed. That is an indisputable fact. Any effort to move legislation on this issue that isn't the result of an ongoing bipartisan discussion would be a clear signal from the Democrats they are not yet serious about immigration reform.  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stay at the table. Let this bipartisan working group finish its work so we can achieve immigration reform this year. Scrapping their work now will only end in frustration and defeat for both sides.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
