President, I want my colleagues from Michigan, Ohio, and the many other donor States to know that I am committed to improving the return to donor States. It is my intention that any comprehensive 6-year reauthorization bill considered by the Senate include a provision that guarantees all donor States get to a 95 percent minimum rate of return at the end of the life of the bill without harming the opportunity for all States to grow. However, Members need to understand that this is only possible if we are able to fund the bill at $255 billion which means we must identify additional revenue.  I also want to further assure my donor State colleagues that the next highway bill I plan to mark up is a 6-year bill.
