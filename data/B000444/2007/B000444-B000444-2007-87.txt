 Lugar, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Harkin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 276       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people have died and      approximately 2,500,000 people have been displaced in Darfur,      Sudan since 2003;       Whereas Congress declared on July 22, 2004 that the      atrocities in Darfur were genocide;       Whereas President George W. Bush has repeatedly decried the      genocide in Darfur, stating, for example, on April 18, 2007,      ``that genocide is the only word for what is happening in      Darfur--and that we have a moral obligation to stop it'';       Whereas the crisis in Darfur and the surrounding region      continues and has in fact in some ways worsened despite the      efforts of the United States, the United Nations, the African      Union, and the international community;       Whereas on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security      Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution      1706 providing that the existing United Nations Mission in      Sudan (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [the African Mission in      Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the      implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the      expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31      December 2006'', and that UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up      to 17,300 military personnel . . . up to 3,300 civilian      police personnel'', which ``shall begin to be deployed no      later than 1 October 2006'';       Whereas the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir rejected      United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 and refused      to allow the United Nations to deploy a peacekeeping force to      Darfur;       Whereas Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United      Nations, and Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African      Union, led efforts to reach a compromise with President al-     Bashir by convening a summit of interested governments and      international bodies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on November 16,      2006;       Whereas as a result of the Addis Ababa summit an agreement      was reached by all parties, including the United Nations, the      African Union, the European Union, the Government of Sudan,      the United States, and China, which called for a three-phased      deployment of a hybrid United Nations-African Union      peacekeeping force to Darfur of no less than 17,000 military      troops and 3,000 civilian police, with a primarily African      character, but open to non-African troop and police      contributors;       Whereas the agreement stated that the United Nations-     African Union hybrid force would have a strong mandate to      protect civilians and that the peacekeeping force must be      logistically and financially sustainable, with support from      the United Nations;       Whereas President al-Bashir has repeatedly obstructed the      Addis Ababa agreement since its signing by reneging on and      redefining the terms of his commitment to allow the      deployment of the full hybrid United Nations-African Union      force;       Whereas on June 11, 2007, President al-Bashir pledged to      accept unconditionally the full United Nations-African Union      hybrid deployment;       Whereas some subsequent speeches and statements by      President al-Bashir have contradicted that claim of      acceptance while others have reinforced it;       Whereas diplomatic efforts to secure President al-Bashir's      genuine acceptance and facilitation of the full United      Nations-African Union hybrid force must not lead to weakening      of the structure, capacities, or mandate of that force in      exchange for President al-Bashir's full compliance;       Whereas history has repeatedly demonstrated that the      ultimate success or failure of any peacekeeping force depends      significantly on its size, resources, mandate, mobility, and      command structure;       Whereas to establish conditions of peace and security, the      peacekeeping mission must be accompanied by a peace-building      process among the parties to the conflict;       Whereas such a process will require a sustained,      coordinated, and high-level diplomatic attempt to unify the      rebel groups in the region and engagement with the rebels and      the Sudanese government in order to forge a comprehensive      political settlement;       Whereas under the international humanitarian law of the      Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian      Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST      3516) and the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions      of 12 August 1949, done at Geneva June 8, 1977, all parties      to the conflict in Darfur are required to refrain from      attacks on civilians and on medical and other humanitarian      personnel, and all perpetrators should be held accountable      for violations of international humanitarian law; and       Whereas failure on the part of the international community      to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy, and maintain      an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping      force will result in the continued loss of life and further      degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in Darfur: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) urges the President of the United States to--       (A) work with members of the United Nations Security      Council and the African Union to ensure the expeditious      deployment of the United Nations-African Union hybrid      peacekeeping force under Chapter VII of the United Nations      Charter and operating under United Nations guidelines and      procedures for command and control with a mandate affirming      that civilian protection is a primary mission objective;       (B) strongly encourage the member states of the United      Nations that have the capabilities to do so, to contribute      collectively approximately 19,500 military personnel and up      to 6,500 police to implement the mandate, as is currently      under discussion in the United Nations Security Council;       (C) work bilaterally and with member states of the North      Atlantic Trade Organization, the United Nations, the European      Union, the African Union, and other capable partners to--       (i) rapidly implement pre-deployment programs and provide      equipment to United Nations standards, with a special focus      on African peacekeepers, in order to ensure that a full      complement of peacekeepers can be deployed, sustained, and      rotated as necessary; and       (ii) provide the United Nations-African Union hybrid force      with--       (I) sufficient logistical support and airlift capacity;       (II) necessary vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and      helicopters for tactical reconnaissance and armed deterrence;      and       (III) other equipment;       (D) work with members of the United Nations and the African      Union to--       (i) ensure that substantive civilian mission components are      rapidly established and able to capitalize on any      opportunities to advance the political and peace processes      which the successful deployment of the United Nations-African      Union hybrid force may create;       (ii) reinitiate a peace-building process among the parties      to the conflict as part of a sustained, coordinated, high-     level diplomatic effort to forge a comprehensive political      settlement; and       (iii) ensure the security, maintenance, and expansion of      humanitarian access to those in need and promote a return to      the rule of law in the region;       (E) work with members of the United Nations, the African      Union, the European Union, and other donor nations to ensure      that adequate financial support is provided to peacekeepers      serving in the current African Mission in Sudan, and the      planned hybrid United Nations-African Union force; and       (F) work with Congress to ensure robust funding for the      hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in      Darfur;       (2) urges the Secretary-General of the United Nations and      the Chairperson of the African Union to make every effort to      expedite the urgent generation, rapid deployment, and      effective administration of the full United Nations-African      Union hybrid force;       (3) urges Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and the      Government of Sudan to abide by the agreement of President      al-Bashir to fully accept and facilitate the deployment of      the United Nations-African Union hybrid force without      condition;       (4) urges the President's Special Envoy to Sudan to      continue his legislative outreach, including offering to      brief Congress every 60 days on the status of deployment of      the United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping force      and parallel measures to enable peace in Darfur through an      inclusive political process; and       (5) urges President George W. Bush, the United Nations      Security Council, the African Union, the European Union, the      League of     Arab States, nations in the region, and individual nations      with significant economic or political influence over Sudan      to--       (A) hold President al-Bashir and the Government of Sudan      accountable for any failure through neglect or obstruction to      fully facilitate the deployment of the full United Nations-     African Union hybrid force for Darfur; and       (B) be prepared to implement meaningful measures, including      the imposition of multilateral sanctions, an arms embargo,      and a no fly zone for Sudanese military flights over Darfur,      if the Government of Sudan obstructs deployment of the agreed      upon peacekeeping mission.
