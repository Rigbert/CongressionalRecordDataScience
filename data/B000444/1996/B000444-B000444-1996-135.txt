 President, few of us are ever called upon by our genes to bear a burden comparable to that which is borne by those in lifelong contention with the condition known as hemophilia. Even fewer of us, I believe, whatever physical burdens we may be obliged to bear, ever encounter a physician such as my friend and neighbor in Delaware, Dr. Philip M. Blatt, a hematologist who treats many patients suffering from hemophilia.  On Wednesday, May 15, Dr. Blatt will be honored by the Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Hemophilia Foundation, not merely for applying his medical skills to helping his patients survive, but especially for the warm, human, caring manner in which he does so.  Hemophilia, which affects the ability of the blood to coagulate and thus can make even a minor injury into a major threat from the uncontrollable loss of blood, tends, in a sense, to isolate its victims. They know that they must manage their lives with an uncommon degree of caution and avoidance. They know that what might be a negligible scratch for someone else can, in their case, become a life-threatening wound. And because of the fragility of their blood, they must often undergo constant treatment--and that necessity, in the years before the effect of the AIDS virus was known, placed many of them innocently at risk to that deadly disease.  It would be very easy, Mr. President, for any victims of hemophilia to suffer as much from the psychic as from the physical effects of their condition--to perceive themselves as put upon through no fault of their own, to think of themselves as the outcast victims of a genetic condition totally beyond their control--but not so easy if they are Philip Blatt's patients.  Dr. Blatt knows that his hemophilia patients suffer from a condition that has an almost all-consuming effect on their lives, but goes to great lengths to make sure it does not consume their spirits. He knows that their hemophilia makes them relative rarities among the general run of people, but he never forgets that they are--first, foremost, and always--people, with the same general inheritance of strengths and deficiencies we all share, with the same rights and responsibilities, with the same dreams and aspirations.  Philip Blatt is not a doctor who simply treats his patients' frailties, but a physician in the classic tradition who treats them as whole persons, and who cares not only about saving their lives but also about helping them keep their lives whole and rewarding. He practices medicine in its finest sense, and it is that quality, Mr. President, for which the Delaware Chapter of the National Hemophilia Society will honor him this week, as I do today here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
