Ms. Keating will be retiring in April 2010 after 38 years of service to this country.  Former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. They are people who say, ``This is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.'' Jane Keating truly is a hero, for she has devoted much of her life to making the United States and her community better.  Jane Keating began her career with the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, in 1972 as a tax auditor in Los Angeles. Jane held successively responsible managerial positions with the IRS before coming to my home State of Oregon in 1985 as chief of the Taxpayer Service Division.  Because of Jane's outstanding service to the taxpayers, she was selected as the Taxpayer Advocate in August 1996. Jane has led this office with professionalism, integrity, and a sense of dedication to the taxpayers she serves. Her colleagues, her employees, and the public respect Jane for the excellent service she provided for so many years.  It is an honor for me to recognize Ms. Jane Keating for her service to this country and to her community. She is indeed a true Oregon hero.                          ____________________
