 I share his concern. I am personally working with all parties involved in the agreement in an effort to substantially reduce the federal share of the purchase price.  I am concerned, however, that by providing no funding in the fiscal year 2002 Interior appropriations bill, the seller will be forced to seek other buyers. This would be a lost opportunity of historic proportions. It would be my intention to secure a small amount of funding in the Senate bill to keep the project alive as we move forward in appropriations process with the goal of increasing the project's appropriation should a more realistic price be negotiated.
