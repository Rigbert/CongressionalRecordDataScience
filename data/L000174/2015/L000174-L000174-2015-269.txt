President, I hate to see this held up over just the Hyde amendment. In somewhat similar legislation, the Republican House of Representatives was wise enough not to create this illusory ``special assessment fund.'' The House-passed bill is an authorizing bill and does not contain the Hyde amendment.  I will yield the floor in a moment, but first I wish to quote from a statement by ATEST, Alliance To End Slavery and Trafficking. They urged the Senate, as I have, to reach a bipartisan compromise on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.       For well over a decade, the work to combat modern slavery      and human trafficking has been an example of Congress's      ability to put partisanship aside in the interest of tackling      a difficult and seemingly intractable problem. That      willingness to be thoughtful, practical, and balanced in      approach has proven successful in this work, and made      tremendous contributions to the fight against this heinous      crime. The debate that is emerging over the Justice for      Victims of Trafficking Act, S. 178, and the application of      the Hyde amendment to funds collected from perpetrators of      human trafficking jeopardize this pragmatic balance in favor      of a partisan confrontation that undermines the achievement      of our joint goal of ending modern slavery in the United      States and around the world.       For these reasons, we urge all members of the Senate to      turn away from this divisive     debate and find a bipartisan approach to this new initiative      to protect and serve the needs of survivors.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                       Alliance to                                  End Slavery and Trafficking,                                                   Washington, DC.
