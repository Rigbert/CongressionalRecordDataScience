 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Mary Copper, who passed away February 22, at the age of 55 in Wilmington, DE. A mother, wife, sister, activist, trailblazer, and trusted friend, Mary will be missed by the countless people whose lives she touched before her time on this Earth was cut short.  Mary graduated from Wellesley College and the Boston University School of Law, and almost immediately began a rapid ascent that took her to the pinnacle of the legal field. Through her hard work and keen instincts, she quickly made herself known across Delaware as one of the hardest working and brightest female attorneys in the State's history. She dedicated 8 years to the DuPont Company before becoming the first female partner at Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, where she was beloved by clients and coworkers alike.  But perhaps the most indelible image of Mary is that of a philanthropist with an enormous heart. She never shied away from the opportunity to help others, and devoted countless hours to numerous charitable organizations throughout the State, volunteering, serving on boards, and giving every ounce of her being to the people who needed it the most.  She was a founding member and past chair of the Advisory Committee of the Fund for Women of the Delaware Community Foundation. She also served as an enthusiastic member of the Delaware Bar Foundation and a helpful supporter of the Democratic Party within Delaware. Her absence will be sorely felt by all who knew her, but the vast reach of her acts of charity and kindness will continue to touch people's lives for years to come.  My thoughts and prayers are with Mary's family, her husband William, and daughters Mary (Lucy) and Ellen.                           ____________________
