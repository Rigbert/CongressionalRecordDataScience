Whether others within al-Qaida will quickly fill Mr. Mohammed's shoes remains to be seen, but the fact that the U.S. Government and other governments are methodically tracking these people down sends an important message and should give some comfort to the American people. This is encouraging. Let's hope we can soon celebrate the capture of Osama bin Laden, because capturing the leaders of al-Qaida should be our highest priority.  But the world is increasingly apprehensive as the United States appears to be marching inexorably towards war with Iraq. Today, there are more than 250,000 American men and women in uniform in the Persian Gulf preparing for the order to attack. We hear that the decision must be made within a matter of days because it is too costly to keep so many troops deployed overseas. In other words, now that we have spent billions of dollars to ship all those soldiers over there, we need to use them because we cannot back down now, as I have heard some people say. Frankly, this is one of the worst reasons possible to rush into war.  We should not back down. Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. Doing nothing--I agree with the President about this--would mean the United Nations is unwilling to enforce its own resolutions concerning perhaps the most serious threat the world faces today, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That would be unacceptable. The U.N. Security Council ordered Iraq to fully disclose its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has not yet done so.  I agree with those who say the only reason Saddam Hussein is even grudgingly cooperating with the U.N. inspectors is the buildup of U.S. troops on Iraq's border. I have commended the President for refocusing the world's attention on Saddam Hussein's failure to disarm. I also recognize the time may come when the use of force to enforce the U.N. Security Council resolution is the only option. But are proposals to give the U.N. inspectors more time unreasonable, when it could solidify support for the use of force if that becomes the only option?  Despite the President's assertion that Iraq poses an imminent threat to the United States, that assertion begs credulity when the U.N. inspectors are making some progress and a quarter of a million American soldiers are poised on Iraq's border. Absent a credible, imminent threat, a decision to enforce Resolution 1441 should only be made by the Security Council--not by the United States or any other government alone.  The President says war is a last resort. If he feels that way, why do he and his advisors want so desperately to short-circuit the inspection process?  Why is he so anxious to spend billions of dollars to buy the cooperation of other countries, other countries that do not yet believe war is necessary?  Why is he so unconcerned about the predictably hostile reaction in the Muslim world to the occupation of Iraq, perhaps for years, by the United States military?  Why is the President so determined to run roughshod over our traditional alliances and partnerships which have served us well and whose support we need both today and in the future?  I cannot pretend to understand the thinking of those in the administration who for months or even longer have seemed possessed with a kind of messianic zeal in favor of war. A preemptive, U.S. attack against Iraq without a declaration of war by Congress or the U.N. Security Council's support may be easy to win, but it could violate international law and cause lasting damage to our alliances and to our ability to obtain the cooperation of other nations in meeting so many other global challenges.  Just recently, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned that a war with Iraq could bring more threats and more terrorist attacks within the United States. The CIA Director has testified that Saddam Hussein is more likely to use chemical or biological weapons if he is attacked. Yet we are marching ahead as though these warnings don't matter.  I have said before, this war is not inevitable. I still believe it can be avoided. But I fear that the President, despite opposition among the American people, in the U.N., and around the world, is no longer listening to anyone except those within his inner circle who are eager to fight.  The President says we must overthrow Saddam Hussein to protect the American people. Saddam Hussein is a threat, but North Korea, on the verge of acquiring half a dozen nuclear weapons, poses a far more serious and immediate threat to the United States and the world. Yet the administration is too preoccupied with Saddam Hussein to be distracted by North Korea, even though North Korea has shown no qualms about selling ballistic missiles and anything else that will earn them money. It makes no sense.  I hope the Iraqi government comes to its senses. I hope we do not walk away from the U.N. I hope we don't decide that just because our troops are there, we cannot afford to wait.                               Exhibit 1                                                February 27, 2003.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my      resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and      from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy      Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart.       The baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to      give something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat      was a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages      and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars      and journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and      theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and      its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic      arsenal.       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State      Department I would become     more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and selfish      bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies.      Human nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted      for understanding human nature. But until this Administration      it had been possible to believe that by upholding the      policies of my president I was also upholding the interests      of the American people and the world. I believe it no longer.       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible      not only with American values but also with American      interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us      to squander the international legitimacy that has been      America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense      since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle      the largest and most effective web of international      relationships the world has ever known. Our current course      will bring instability and danger, not security.       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and      to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is      certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not      seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such      systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in      Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than      before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to      cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the      threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those      successes and build on them, this Administration has chosen      to make terrorism a domestic political tool, enlisting a      scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as its bureaucratic      ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion in the      public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of      terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to      justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to      the military and to weaken the safeguards that protect      American citizens from the heavy hand of government.      September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of      American society as we seem determined to do to ourselves.      Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a      selfish, superstitious empire thrashing toward self-     destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more      of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over      the past two years done too much to asset to our world      partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override      the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims      were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model      of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what      basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image      and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is      blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied      Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military      power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of      post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it      will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to      follow where we lead.       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many      of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral      capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are      persuaded less that was is justified than that it would be      perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism.      Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone      the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and      allies this Administration is fostering, including among its      most senior officials. Has oderint dum metuant [Ed. note:      Latin for ``Let them hate so long as they fear,'' thought to      be a favorite saying of Caligula] really become our motto?       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world.      Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the      American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when      they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the      world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a      strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close      partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than      for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who      will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it      was, a beacon of liberty, security and justice for the      planet?       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character      and ability. You have preserved more international      credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged      something positive from the excesses of an ideological and      self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the      President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an      international system we built with such toil and treasure, a      web of laws, treaties, organizations and shared values that      sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever      constrained America's ability to defend its interests.       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile      my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S.      Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process      if ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I      can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better      serve the security and prosperity of the American people and      the world we share.
