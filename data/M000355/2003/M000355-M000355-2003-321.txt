 President, I am pleased to offer an amendment--cosponsored by the ranking member of the subcommittee--that provides $2 million for the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development in Egypt.  The Center is directed by Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a vocal champion of human rights and democracy in Egypt. My colleagues may remember that Dr. Ibrahim was arrested on June 30, 2000, on charges that included defaming the country's image. Many in Cairo and abroad believe that Dr. Ibrahim's arrest was a direct response by the Egyptian Government to his investigations into discrimination against the country's Coptic Christian minority and parliamentary fraud.  Dr. Ibrahim spent several years in jail and was finally acquitted this spring after a second retrial. However, imprisonment neither dulled his desire for democracy, justice or human rights in Egypt nor his passion for pursuing these fundamental rights in the face of repression from the authoritarian Egyptian government.  In fact, when my staff visited Dr. Ibrahim in prison almost 2 years ago he was just as feisty in support of democracy for Egypt as when he passed through Washington a few short months ago.  Given Dr. Ibrahim's noble cause, the amendment provides funding for the center for core support and programmatic activities that promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights in Egypt.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which underscores that an important front in the war on terrorism includes the pursuit of freedom, democratic institutions, the rule of law and human rights in countries throughout the Middle East.
