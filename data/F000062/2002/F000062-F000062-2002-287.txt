 President, today Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, a wonderful organization that exemplifies a spirit of volunteerism and commitment to others is celebrating their 90th anniversary. With more than 300,000 members nationwide, Hadassah is one of the largest women's and the largest Jewish membership organization in America.  Hadassah was founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold as a group of women ``interested in the promotion of Jewish institutions and enterprises in Palestine.'' What began as an attempt to provide health and social services to both Jews and Arabs in Palestine has grown into myriad undertakings.  Today, Hadassah's major activities in Israel and in the United States span the arenas of health, education, social services, and environmental preservation. For instance, the Hadassah Medical Organization supplies quality medical care to individuals in the Middle East, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. The Youth Aliya Program provides housing and support for disadvantaged and immigrant youth in Israel.  Additionally, the Jewish National Fund helps to build parks and preserve Israel's natural resources, while Young Judea helps U.S. teenagers build connections to Israel and Jewish life. In all of its endeavors, Hadassah has fulfilled its mission to promote a peaceful and prosperous Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, pursue social justice, and provide for the health, education, and well-being of individuals both in Israel and in America.  Over its 90 years of existence, Hadassah has touched the lives of millions of individuals in a tangible manner. In a time when the Middle East remains embroiled in controversy and violence, it is comforting to find a group whose commitment has not changed over time. Even today, Hadassah provides lessons that we can all learn from. I am proud my home state of California boasts more than 25,000 members, people devoted to improving the world around them. As a lifetime member, I would like to thank Hadassah for its efforts, and look forward to celebrating future milestones with them.                          ____________________
