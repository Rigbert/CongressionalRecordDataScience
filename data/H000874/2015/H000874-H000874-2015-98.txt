 We are coming now to the end of the scheduled work period, and we will be going into the August break. We just passed a bill, Mr. Leader, which dealt with a tragedy--or purportedly dealt with a tragedy--that occurred in San Francisco.  Every Member of this House believes, I think, that a mistake was made by the sheriff in San Francisco in releasing this individual who had been convicted of numerous felonies.  We also believe, if we had passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill similar to the one the Senate passed in the last Congress, that this problem itself would not be solved--because we believe that the sheriff should not have released this individual irrespective of the status of immigration reform--but we believe this would go a long way towards enhancing the ability of both law enforcement and of communities to deal with the immigration issue as well as giving confidence to people of their status.  Does the gentleman believe that there is any possibility of a comprehensive immigration bill being considered in the next work period?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.  What happened in San Francisco was not just a mistake. This individual had seven felonies. It is not miscommunication. Kate lost her life and should not had to have.  Sanctuary cities are made up of individuals who believe they can make their own law and disregard the law of the Federal Government.  I think today's bill was a good first start. I do look forward to continuing the conversations on both sides of the aisle on immigration reform, but I have nothing scheduled at this time.
