Speaker, the will of the majority is being thwarted in this House, the people's House. Mr. Boehner, our Speaker, said when he took his office as Speaker that the House worked best when the House was allowed to work its will. Mr. Speaker, let the House work its will.                              {time}  1300  We are about to take a vote on whether this House should move to reopen the Export-Import Bank and save thousands--thousands--of jobs that Speaker Boehner has admitted will be lost without our action.  The Export-Import Bank is a critical tool that supports job creation here in America by helping American businesses compete in foreign markets--in other words, making goods here with American workers and selling them abroad. That is what we need to be doing. The Export-Import Bank facilitates that happening. It has over 300 votes out of 435 on this floor, but we cannot vote if it is not brought to the floor.  When the Speaker and majority leader allowed the Bank's authorization to expire in June, they did so with the full knowledge that a reauthorization has the votes to pass and will pass with strong, bipartisan support if brought to the floor. Now, we have a chance to defeat the previous question and bring that bill to the floor today.  Now, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to some of my colleagues who may be new, that voting down this rule, defeating the previous question is a vote to open the Export-Import Bank.  Now, I know some of you will say: Well, it is a procedural vote. My party makes me do this.  Well, if you have that answer, look in the eye those who are losing their jobs and say: I had to do this for my party, not my country, not the competitiveness of America, not for American jobs, not for American businesses, but I voted for the previous question for my party.  Sometimes, my friends, party demands too much. When you raise your hand, it is to defend the Constitution and laws thereof, but in a real sense, it is to defend and make America better.  Let's refuse to engage in what Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue today called a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of other governments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''  Let me repeat that. That is Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce. The Republican Party used to be a party of business, the party that wanted to grow jobs. We talk about that all the time.  Well, my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, you have an opportunity to do that on this upcoming vote. Don't do as Tom Donohue today said you might do, a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of other governments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''  Last week, General Electric announced it would be moving 500 jobs from New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Maine to Europe and China because of the failure of this Congress topass the Export-Import Bank reauthorization. There are over 300 votes for that on this floor.  The American people think we are dysfunctional. They are right. They don't trust us because they don't think their board of directors is doing the job they sent us here to do. They are right. They are angry. They are anxious.  Let us for once, this day--we haven't funded the government yet; hopefully, we will get that done--but at least this day, given the opportunity on this previous question, say that we are going to make America competitive and we are not going to unilaterally disarm.  This is something the Business Roundtable wants us to do. It is something the Chamber of Commerce wants us to do. It is something the National Association of Manufacturers wants us to do. It is something that organized labor wants us to do.  In the face of unity of purpose, in the face of a majority of votes on this floor, party regularity still says: Tough. Tough. Yes, there may be 300 votes on this bill, but we are not going to allow it to come to the floor.  Ladies and gentlemen in your offices or on this floor, America expects you to do better. America expects you to be responsible. America does not want you to be simply partisan. America does not want you to be cowed by a small minority of this House and by radical groups outside this House who threaten Members they will spend a million or $2 million or $3 million to defeat them in a primary.  America wants us to do the right thing. America wants us to have the courage of our convictions. America expects this House to reflect the majority opinion, not be dictated to by a small minority.  Mr. Speaker, allow your Members to vote against the previous question. If you do so, we will bring to this floor the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank; and, ladies and gentlemen of this House--and all Americans ought to know as well--it will pass.  Bring the Export-Import Bank bill reauthorization to this floor so America can continue to be competitive and create jobs here in America. That is what our constituents want us to do.  Vote against the previous question.  Mr. Speaker, we are about to take a vote on whether this house should move to reopen the Export-Import Bank and save thousands of jobs that even Speaker Boehner has admitted will be lost without our action.  The Export-Import Bank is a critical tool that supports job creation here in America by helping American businesses compete in foreign markets.  When the speaker and majority leader allowed the bank's authorization to expire in June, they did so with the full knowledge that a reauthorization has the votes to pass--and will pass with strong bipartisan support--if brought to the floor.  Now we have a chance to defeat the previous question and bring that bill to the floor today.  Let's end the uncertainty that has already caused businesses to hold back investment in job creation and to move American jobs overseas.  Let's refuse to engage in what Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue today called a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of other governments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''  Last week, general electric announced that it would be moving 500 jobs from New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Maine to Europe and China because of the failure to keep the export-import bank open.  Congress has a responsibility to help grow jobs here--not send them overseas.  It's time to reopen the export-import bank.  Defeat this previous question.  Bring the export-import bank up for a vote.  And let's complete the task that America's workers and their employers have asked us to do for months.
