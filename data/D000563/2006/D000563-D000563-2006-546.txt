President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts here. I will speak briefly.  What the Senator from Louisiana understands, and I think will concede, is that this is the third version of this amendment. It has been written and rewritten and rewritten again. What you have heard described may reflect an earlier version, but it doesn't reflect what is before us, I say to the Senator from Idaho. I respect him and I know he has a good understanding of the Constitution and the laws.  Let me read the words in the amendment before us:       None of the funds appropriated by this act shall be used      for the seizure of a firearm based on the existence of a      declaration of a state of emergency.  Did you hear a reference to existing State and local law exemption, which both the Senator from Louisiana and Idaho referred to? No.
