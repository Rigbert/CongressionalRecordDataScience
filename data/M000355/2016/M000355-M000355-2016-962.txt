 President, moving forward, the Republican-led Senate will have another opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation--legislation aimed at modernizing America's energy policies. The Energy Policy Modernization Act is the result of more than a year's worth of work by our Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair Senator Murkowski, and ranking member Senator Cantwell. These Senators know it has been nearly a decade since the Senate considered major energy legislation, so they worked to do something about it. They also know that good policy results from good process, as this bill certainly demonstrates. It has meant working through countless listening sessions and oversight hearings; it has meant working through numerous amendment votes and debate hours; it has meant working to move this bipartisan Energy bill to final passage.  The Energy Policy Modernization Act aims to bring our energy policies in line with the demands of today and to position us to benefit from the energy opportunities of tomorrow. Here is how it can help achieve that goal: It expands domestic supply and improves efficiency. It addresses aging infrastructure and enhances safeguards. It promotes accountability and cuts through needless redtape. This broad, bipartisan bill does all these things. It builds on technological progress in order to strengthen and sustain America's energy advances. It protects our environment at the same time. It does all of this without raising taxes or adding a dime to the deficit.  Here is what that means for our country: It will help Americans save energy. It will help Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. And, like the airport security legislation I mentioned earlier, the Energy Policy Modernization Act will help keep Americans safe.It includes provisions to bolster our national security by strengthening our cyber security defense mechanisms.  This legislation will make significant strides for American energy policies, and it wouldn't have been possible without the bill managers' leadership and dedication. So I want to thank them again for their diligence in advancing this critical legislation closer to passage.                          ____________________
