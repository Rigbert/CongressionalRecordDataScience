Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma and the gentlewoman from Indiana for cosponsoring this resolution which expresses, I think, profound thoughts. We do not often express profound thoughts on the floor of this House.  Sunday will be Father's Day, and I will be blessed on Sunday. On Sunday two of my daughters, two of my granddaughters, and one of my grandsons will be at my house, and we are going to have a wonderful time. They are coming on Saturday. They will spend the night there. We will have a good time Saturday night and have dinner together.  My oldest daughter, who lives in Illinois, will not be there, but we will talk on Sunday. She will call and she will say, ``Dad, I love you, and I wish you a happy Father's Day,'' and nothing better will happen to me that day or any day. We lost Mom 5 years ago. Mother's Day was a special day at our house as well.  This resolution, as I say, articulates profound thoughts. As I was in the cloakroom, I heard the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Osborne) speaking. Tom Osborne is a special person in this body. Few of us, perhaps maybe none, have had the opportunity to be a father figure, not necessarily a biological father, obviously, but a father figure, someone to whom young men looked for guidance, for discipline, for direction, and for a sense of responsibility.  Tom Osborne, as all of us know, is one of the great football coaches in the history of America. So it was appropriate that he spoke and leads the effort on this resolution, because I know an awful lot of young men who perhaps did not have a dad at home, or did not have a dad that cared as much about them as we would have hoped he would have, looked to Tom Osborne for the growing of character that a father ought to give a son or a daughter.                              {time}  2030  So I congratulate the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Osborne) for the literally scores, hundreds, of young men, whose lives you have made a difference in.  Mr. Speaker, on page 2 of this resolution it says something very important: ``Whereas, the promotion of responsible fatherhood should not, 1, denigrate the standing and parenting efforts of single mothers whose efforts are heroic.''  That is so true. I know the gentlewoman from Indiana knows that to be the case. Young women, middle-aged women whose partners, in producing the greatest blessing of life, a child, do not participate in the raising of that child. This resolution says that not only is that good for the fathers, but it is absolutely critical for the children. Study after study shows us that there is nothing better for a child in the world than a stable family, than twoparents caring for that child and giving that child direction.  It goes on to say that ``this does not in any way lessen the protection of children from abusive parents.'' What a tragedy, that God gives to some a child, and they abuse that child and abuse that gift. ``Or cause women to remain in or enter into abusive relationships.'' Some of us know about that, and it is appropriate that we say that, that certainly a two-parent family that creates an abusive relationship is not a relationship in which children ought to be raised. It is a serious problem confronting our society; and as we consider this resolution, we look to the ``responsible'' in the reference to ``fatherhood,'' responsible towards the child and responsible towards the mom.  Lastly, it says that ``we do not want to compromise the health and safety of a custodial parent.''  I rise in support of this resolution because of its importance. We can appropriate all the money we want; we can have all the programs we want; we can have Head Start, we can have Chapter 1; we can have the CHIP program for child health; we can do all of those things, and nothing, nothing, nothing will be important, as important as two parents caring for that child they brought into this world.  I doubt, and I hope there is not a parent in this body or in this country that can hear the ballad that is so poignant, so compelling, the ``Cats in the Cradle.'' Those of my colleagues who remember the ``Cats in the Cradle'' song about the young man, the young man who asked dad to go out and play ball, the young man who asked dad to read the book, the young man who asked dad to spend a little bit of time with him. Dad is too busy. Dad is probably like some of us. He thinks things are too important, and he will be with his son a little later. And of course as that song continues, as my colleagues will recall, the dad gets older, the son gets older, and the dad says to the son, son, let us spend some time together. Of course by that time the son, like his dad when he was his age, has become preoccupied.  For those of us who have lived for some period of time who were very active when our children were young, who thought our lives were very important then, we perhaps look back and lament that we did not spend the time with our children that we should have. It is important not only that all of us urge fathers to be responsible, urge them to be engaged, but as well to urge ourselves to be the best possible parents we can, for nothing, nothing can be more positive for this country than that.  Mr. Speaker, I stand here tonight in support of House Resolution 442 which calls upon fathers around the country to use this Father's Day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their childrens' lives.  This coming Sunday, June 16th, 2002, millions of Americans will celebrate Father's Day.  As a nation we set aside this day to recognize the tremendous impact that fathers have on the lives of children, as well as the stability of families.  As the father of three lovely and intelligent women, I know first hand the remarkable challenge, work and dedication it requires to be a good father.  It is through fatherhood that I live my most valued, joyful and reward moments.  On Father's Day, I would like to commend those who have fulfilled their responsibility as a father by providing materially for their families, as well as playing vital roles in the lives of their children, such as nurturer, moral instructor and mentor.  However, it is important for our society to take note that many children will face a void on Father's Day because they have no one with which to celebrate the occasion.  Today, an estimated 17 million children are living in households without a father. This makes the United States the world leader in fatherless families.  Children, on average, achieve more when they have involved, responsible, and committed fathers. A study released in May 2001, by the U.S. Department of Education, clearly shows how a father's active involvement in their child's education is particularly important for academic achievement, as measured by receiving mostly A grades and not having to repeat a grade.  In fact, research shows that children with absentee fathers are twice as likely to drop out of school, to commit a crime and to abuse alcohol and drugs. And, they have a five times greater chance of living in poverty and are more likely to become pregnant as a teenager.  The social implications of this reality are staggering. Action is needed to stop these vicious cycles of poverty and teen pregnancy.  I believe it is important to reinforce the values that all Americans share: hard work, self-discipline, and personal and family responsibility.  I support meaningful legislation that will help make both parents responsible for taking care of their children, such as improvements to the interstate enforcement of child support, as well as media awareness campaigns to promote responsible fatherhood skills.  It is important for society to send a clear and strong message to parents--especially teenage parents--that they must be responsible for their children--and I will continue to support and promote such initiatives.  It is my great pleasure to stand here tonight with my colleagues to reinforce the importance of responsible parenting and to commend fathers who have had a positive and lasting influence on the lives of their children.
