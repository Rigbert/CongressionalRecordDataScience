I passed that bill by five votes. And since that bill passed, in the 11 years since, I have had any number of Members who came up to me and said, ``I voted against you that day, Congressman Durbin, but I was wrong. And I realize I was wrong. I was on the wrong side of history.''  I want to tell you, the folks today who are killing this tobacco bill on the floor are on the wrong side of history. In defending the tobacco companies, they are defending the indefensible. In refusing to protect our children, they are attacking the vulnerable.  We can talk about all the procedural votes that we want to. We can talk about filing motions and voting against them, points of order, and all the rest. The bottom line is, for almost 4 weeks now we have endured countless amendments from those who have no use whatever for this bill, most of which have been adopted, and now the people who offer the amendments successfully are telling us, let's walk away from this, we don't like it after all.  I think the American people will see through this. Although the procedural battle may be won today, ultimately the folks who opposed this tobacco legislation are on the wrong side of history.
