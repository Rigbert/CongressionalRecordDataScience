President, it was a week ago today when the Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, made a motion that the Senate move into closed session under rule XXI. It is a rule that is rarely used, but I was glad it was used that day because the purpose was absolutely essential for America to learn the truth about what happened before the invasion of Iraq.  Senator Reid made that motion in order to make certain that the Senate Intelligence Committee keeps its word to the American people. Some 20 months ago, the Senate Intelligence Committee promised they would have a thorough professional investigation of several major elements relative to intelligence. One of the most important is whether any elected official or member of this administration in any way used intelligence or made statements that were not substantiated. In other words, were we misled, purposely or deliberately, by any elected official or member of the administration before the invasion of Iraq. It is an absolutely critical question.  I am glad the Senate Intelligence Committee made a commitment to initiate this investigation. We found, after waiting 20 months, little or nothing was happening. Fifteen months ago, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, called this phase II investigation a top priority. Yet, on March 11 of this year, speaking to the Woodrow Wilson Center, Senator Roberts said this investigation was ``on the back burner.''
