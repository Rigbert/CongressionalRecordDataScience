 President, I rise today to state before this body that I object to proceeding to the consideration of Daniel Bryant, executive nominee to the Department of Justice. Mr. Bryant is nominated to be Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Policy at DOJ. I have placed a hold on this individual because I have numerous outstanding issues that have yet to be resolved by the Department of Justice. More specifically, I have several outstanding written requests before the Department of Justice. Some of these requests are more that 6 months overdue. In addition, I am presently working with the Department of Justice to overcome a number of procedural issues directly affecting my ability, as a member of the Judiciary Committee to, among other things, conduct oversight of the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.                          ____________________
