Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp), my friend, for yielding the time to me.  Mr. Speaker, all of the arguments in favor of this extraordinarily good legislation have been stated. I just want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DeMint) for his sponsorship of the legislation, for working overtime to garner the number of cosponsors that he did from both sides of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, when I look around at the speakers today, who really have been the movers and shakers, it reminds me of that famous statement out of Casablanca: Round up the usual suspects. And you have got the same key players, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and so many others, who are always there trying to advance the ball and advance the cause of adoption and to provide a loving option to a mother who may find herself in a very difficult situation.  I want to commend all of those who have made this legislation possible. The $5,000 credit certainly has had a laudable impact on adoption and I am pleased to be an original sponsor of that. This legislation now doubles the tax credit, which I think is very generous, and hopefully not the end of our efforts to help those who would like to make an adoption plan and bring a child or children into their home.  This is a great bill. I urge everyone's support for it.
