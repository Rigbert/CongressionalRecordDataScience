Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information.  Mr. Leader, you have listed for next week legislation regarding the 10 percent tax bracket expansion. Is it safe to assume the bill will not be considered in the Committee on Ways and Means, but will come directly to the floor instead, just as was the case with the AMT bill last week and the marriage penalty bill the week before that?  Mr. DeLAY. That is correct.
