Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, listening to the opponents of this bill, one would be led to believe if this bill passes, prisoners are not going to have anything to do and there will be nothing but prison riots. And when they get out of prison, they will go back to a life of crime because they do not have the skills. That is not true.  This bill authorizes $75 million a year for rehabilitation and training, vocational training so when they get out of the prisons, they will be equipped to compete in the job market.  The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) said it correctly, the question is here who pays for the rehabilitation of prisoners, and who pays for giving them vocational training. Vote this bill down, and it is on the back of the small business owners and the people who work and pay taxes to try to compete in Federal Government procurement. Pass this bill, and the taxpayers will pay for it, which they ought to.
