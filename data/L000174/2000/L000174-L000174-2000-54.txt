President, I rise today to offer my support for the Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000. This bill takes a much needed step toward reestablishing the federal government's commitment to quality affordable housing in rural areas and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.  The need for a new federal matching grant program to encourage the production, rehabilitation and acquisition of rural rental housing has never been more evident than it is today. Families across the country in small towns, where property is often high and resources scarce, are finding themselves with fewer and fewer options for a safe and affordable place to live. In my home state of Vermont, like many other states across the country, we are in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. Housing costs are soaring and rental vacancy rates are alarmingly low. For those fortunate enough to find an apartment it is increasingly difficult to afford the rent that the market demands. Recent studies suggest that while the need for rental units continues to grow in Vermont, estimated production levels are drastically inadequate to meet demand.  Despite this trend, the federal government has consistently scaled back their commitment to production and rehabilitation of rental housing. Rural rental production has dropped nearly 88% since 1990, and the funding for subsidized housing has fallen by 73% since 1994. This decline has made it difficult to produce new housing and maintain the current obligations and existing stock. In Vermont roughly 4,091 rental units were produced with federal assistance between 1976 and 1985, but during the next ten years this number fell to under two thousand--nearly half of what was produced the decade before, despite the rising need.  Nationally it is estimated that 2.6 million households live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity. Unfortunately, rural areas often have less appeal for investment from financial institutions and are often isolated from social services that are more accessible in urban areas to help address these problems.  The Rural Rental Housing Act will provide $250 million dollars for a matching federal grant program to be administered by the United States Department of Agriculture to address this situation. These funds will complement existing programs run by the Rural Housing Service at USDA and will be used in a variety of ways to increase the supply, the affordability, and the quality of housing for the most needy residents, the lowest income families and the elderly. Most importantly the program is designed to be administered at the state and local level and to encourage public-private partnerships to best address the unique needs of each state.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and am committed to work with Senator Edwards to reintroduce this bill in the 107th Congress.                                 ______
