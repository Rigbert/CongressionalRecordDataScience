President, this amendment is a result of a tragic accident in my home State of Rhode Island where a young worker on a farm was killed accidentally.  The police came immediately and determined that there was no foul play and concluded their investigation. But the parents were deeply concerned because no one could explain to them what happened.  As we looked into the matter for them, we discovered that for many years, because of a rider on this appropriations bill, OSHA has been prohibited from investigating deaths on farms that employ 10 or fewer workers.  If this terrible, tragic accident had taken place in a McDonald's, OSHA would be there. There would be an investigation. They would discover the cause. They would suggest remedies. They would do what most Americans expect should be done when an accident takes place in the workplace. But because of this small farm rider, OSHA is powerless to investigate.  I think it is wrong. I think it is wrong not only because these parents don't know what circumstances took the life of their child, but they also regret that it might happen again because there might be some type of systematic flaw or some type of problematic process on the farm that could also claim the life of another youngster.
