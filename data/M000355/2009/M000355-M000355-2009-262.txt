 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the accomplishments of the Simpson County Historical Society, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary in September, making it one of the oldest continuously operating historical societies in Kentucky.  The society's half century of promoting research and knowledge of history makes it one of south-central Kentucky's treasures. At the society's very first meeting in 1959, 37 individuals met in a private home to discuss the creation of the organization.  For many years the society maintained a small collection at the Goodnight Library until members convinced the county to let them use the old county jail and jailer's house as a headquarters. The facility now serves as the Simpson County Archives and Museum. Their collection contains thousands of items, including books, manuscripts, original documents and papers, pictures, county records, tapes, CDs, microfilm, microfiche, computers, and more.  The research materials, librarians and volunteers at the archives have helped thousands of visitors connect to their past and learn about their genealogy.  The dedicated staff and volunteers at the society have made it very successful. In 2006, Mary Garrett, Nancy Neely, Sarah Richardson, Sarah Smith, Beatrice Snider, Margaret Snider, and Dorothy Steers received the Lifetime Presidential Volunteer Service Awards for over 4,000 hours of volunteer service.  The group not only preserves history, but gives much to the community, for instance by supporting several historical markers in Simpson County and providing grants for schools and groups interested in preserving history. They also offer scholarships for students who want to study history.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring, as listed below, the society and their officers for their hard work and dedication to the preservation and research of Kentucky's and Simpson County's history over the past 50 years and for many more years to come:            Simpson County Historical Society Officers--2009       President Dr. James Henry Snider, Vice-President Jean      Almand, Secretary Jason Herring, Assistant Secretary Bonnye      Moody, Treasurer Commie Jo Hall, Librarian Kenny Lynn Scott,      Directors Katherine McCutchen, Emily Mayes, Sarah Jernigan,      Past President and Business Manager Sarah Jo Cardwell.
