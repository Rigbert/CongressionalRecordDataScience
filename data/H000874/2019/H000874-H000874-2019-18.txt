SCALISE. Through the Department of Justice, he said there was no obstruction. There was no obstruction. That is what the Department of Justice said.  Again, if there was, you would have put those findings from the Mueller report in this document. And there is nothing in there, no mention of the Mueller report.  Then the gentleman opened up by saying the rules have been followed. The rules have been followed. That is what the gentleman from Maryland said. The only problem is, just today, yet another rule has been broken.  House rules, clause 2(j)(1) of rule 11, provides that, once the demand is made for a minority day of hearing, minority members shall be entitled--``shall'' means it has to happen--to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to the measure or matter during at least one day of hearing thereon.  Well, guess what? That didn't happen. We requested it multiple times, and the rules that the gentleman said ``the rules have been followed''--the only problem is the rule has been broken.  ``Shall be entitled to a hearing,'' and it has been denied. The chairman denied it again today in committee.  So you can't say the rules have been followed when, just today, that very committee broke the rules of the House allowing us to have the opportunity to present the alternative case.  You want to talk about abuse of power. What is going on in that Judiciary Committee right now is an abuse of power: denying the minority the ability to even present the other side of an argument. You have got two sides of any argument, and maybe you think you made a strong case if you only present yours.  You look at what is going on across the country when only one side has been presented. The country still thinks this is a waste of time, not going after a President because he broke the law but going after a President because you don't like him, you are unhappy that he got elected in 2016, and you are afraid that he might get elected again in 2020.  I trust the people of this country to make that decision again next year, and they will--not Members of Congress who have expressed that they wanted him impeached before he took the oath of office, Members of Congress on your side who said impeachable offenses aren't required to impeach a President.  So, when we talk of abuse of power, absolutely, that is an abuse of power.  The gentleman expresses concern for the people of Ukraine, maybe expresses that the President of Ukraine himself might be afraid to speak candidly. I have more confidence in the President of Ukraine that, if he says something, I believe it. We have worked with him on a number of things: cleaning up corruption. He is actually delivering on his promise, like this President has been delivering on his promise.  But let's talk about all the disdain, the concern for the people of Ukraine not having the tools to defend themselves. I am curious: Where was that disdain when President Obama and Joe Biden were in office and not one single time did they heed Ukraine's request to sell them Javelin missiles? Not one of them. They didn't sell one.  And Ukraine asked multiple times: Please allow us to defend ourselves against Russia. President Obama and Vice President Biden said no. I never heard anybody on that side expressing concern about the ability of the people of Ukraine to defend themselves then.  Good thing, when President Trump was asked that question, he said yes. No quid pro quo, just yes: Here are 360 Javelin missiles sold, so that they can push back Russia. And I am glad they are doing it. I am glad they are able to defend themselves.  Then you look at something equally alarming that has come out that deserves real attention in this Congress, and that is the Horowitz report: 17 listed abuses of the FISA process.  The gentleman knows, I supported the FISA process to allow us to combat terrorists. It is a controversial program, a program that has got a very narrow scope to allow the United States to protect our national security, but it also has a very strict requirement from our intelligence agencies. The FBI and the CIA have the ability to go unfettered and ask the judge for the ability to surveil people.                              {time}  1500  The judge trusts that they are giving him the full information. And we saw abuses listed in the Horowitz report of the FISA process. Even more, Mr. Durham is initiating and conducting his own criminal investigation.  And what the Attorney General talked about this week is that they know that there are people in those intelligence agencies who were spying on the Trump campaign. I mean, imagine Federal agencies--FBI, CIA--spying on the campaign of a candidate for President.  Republican or Democrat, we should equally be alarmed that that happened. I hope it gets rooted out. I hope whoever did that and abused their power goes to jail. But it happened, and it is being investigated in a criminal way.  But Horowitz, himself, pointed out where there were abuses of the FISA process. And you know what, that is coming back up to this Congress early next year for renewal. Parts of that program are going to come back up again, important tools to combat terrorism, but tools that now have been identified to have been abused. We need to work together to clean that up so that doesn't happen again. But that happened, and it was used against the Trump campaign.  I haven't heard the disdain and outrage from both sides. I am surely outraged. Our side is surely outraged. I would hope that we are all outraged that that happened.  But when we talk about those reports, again, if there were all of those things that the gentleman asserts in the Mueller investigation and, ultimately, report, I am curious that not one of those--there is not any mention of the Mueller report in these Articles of Impeachment that we will be facing on the House floor next week.  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
