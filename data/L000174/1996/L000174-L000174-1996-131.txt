 Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont, as soon as Senator Murkowski's amendment is disposed of, we could set votes on the Smith amendment and the Helms amendment.  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to two rollcall votes, the Helms amendment and the Smithamendment, with no second-degree amendments in order, at the conclusion of the disposition of the Murkowski amendment.
