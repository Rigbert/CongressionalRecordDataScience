President, today I introduced legislation that will exempt fishing guides and other operators of uninspected vessels on Lake Texoma from Coast Guard regulation. After weeks of discussion with the Coast Guard and thoughtful consideration, many in the Oklahoma delegation have decided that this is the course of action that will best protect an industry that is extremely important to the people of southern Oklahoma.  While the waters on Lake Texoma are considered ``navigable'' and currently subject to Federal regulation, this is inherently a state function and should be regulated at that level. This legislation will cede authority to conduct the licensing of fishing guides to the proper governing entity, which is the State of Oklahoma and not the Federal Government. I applaud Congressman Boren for introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives, and thank Senator Coburn for his cosponsorship of this measure.  At the end of the day this is about two things: preserving the fishing guide industry and, most importantly, ensuring safety on Lake Texoma. The State of Oklahoma is better positioned to accomplish both. The Coast Guard has not had an active presence at the lake until recently, whereas the State of Oklahoma's Department of Public Safety has a long history of ensuring safe boating activity there. Day in and day out, the State of Oklahoma will be better able to provide for the safety of individuals at the lake. Federal interference in the daily lives of Oklahomans is ever-increasing, and I believe it is important that we preserve state jurisdiction over activities such as this. This legislation accomplishes that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1205       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Exemption.--       (1) Exemption of state licensees from coast guard      regulation.--Residents or non-residents who assist,      accompany, transport, guide, or aid persons in the taking of      fish for monetary compensation or other consideration on Lake      Texoma who are licensed by the State in which they are      operating shall not be subject to any requirement established      or administered by the Coast Guard with respect to that      operation.       (2) Exemption of coast guard licensees from state      regulation.--Residents or non-residents who assist,      accompany, transport, guide, or aid persons in the taking of      fish for monetary compensation or other consideration on Lake      Texoma who are currently licensed by the Coast Guard to      conduct such activities shall not be subject to State      regulation for as long as the Coast Guard license for such      activities remains valid.       (b) State Requirements Not Affected.--Except as provided in      subsection (a)(2), this section does not affect any      requirement under State law or under any license issued under      State law.
