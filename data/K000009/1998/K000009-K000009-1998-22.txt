Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct conferees.  The Clerk read as follows:       Ms. Kaptur moves that in resolving the differences between      the House and Senate, the managers on the part of the House      at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses      on the bill H.R. 4101, be instructed to agree with the      provisions of the Senate amendment which provide funding for      agricultural disaster assistance and reserve inventories,      including the designation of such funds as an emergency      requirement under section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget      and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and with no      offsetting reductions as provided in the Senate amendment.
