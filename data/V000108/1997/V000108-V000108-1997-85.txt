Speaker, it is my honor to commend Saul Ruman, an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District. On Thursday, April 3, 1997, Saul was presented with the 1997 Lifetime Achievement Award by the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association. He received this award during a luncheon at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Indianapolis, IN.  Saul, a resident of Munster, founded the firm Ruman, Clements, Tobin S. Holub shortly after his graduation from the Indiana University School of Law in 1952. From the time of its inception, the firm has concentrated in the areas of personal injury and wrongful death litigation and, over the years, has successfully attracted clients from across the United States. During his distinguished career, Saul has been counsel in over 100 Federal and State appellate cases. He represented Senator Robert Kennedy during his candidacy for President of the United States, several justices on the Indiana Supreme Court, and has litigated numerous cases of significant importance and public interest during his years of trial and appellate practice.  Not only has Saul excelled in his professional life, but he has been a great asset to the Indiana legal community as well. Saul has impacted the judicial process in the State of Indiana through hi appointments to the Indiana Supreme Court Character and Fitness Committee on the Board of Law Examiners, the Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission, and the Indiana Supreme Court Committee on Rules. In addition, Saul has secured membership in a variety of professional organizations, including the American Board of Trial Advocates, the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, the National Institute for Trial Advocacy, the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association, and the Trial Lawyers Section of the Indiana State Bar Association. Saul has also devoted much of his time as a member of the board of visitors to the Indiana University School of Law.  Along with being bestowed the ninth annual Lifetime Achievement Award, Saul has earned recognition in the publication ``Best Lawyers in America'' in 1993 and 1997. Those listed in this publication are selected by their peers on the basis of professional performance and ability.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other esteemed colleague to join me in congratulating Saul on his receipt of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Associations' Lifetime Achievement Award. His wife, Beverlee, and their children, Loral, Melissa, and Elizabeth, can be proud of Saul's exceptional accomplishments. His endeavors within the legal profession are certainly admirable and his outstanding dedication and leadership are a model and inspiration to each and every one of us.                          ____________________
