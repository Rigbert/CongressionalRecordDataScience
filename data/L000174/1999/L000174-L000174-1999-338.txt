President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Maryland would have an objection on a time agreement. Maybe we should start on our debate and urge people to be as brief as we can because I still think we could and should vote on all these.  Mr. McCONNELL. The objection of the Senator from Maryland is to the Brownback amendment, I gather?
