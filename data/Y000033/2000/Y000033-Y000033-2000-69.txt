Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 1509, the Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act Amendments of 2000. This bill will demonstrate our Indian tribal governments can integrate their employment, training, and related services they provide.  This legislation is important to all tribal governments, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
