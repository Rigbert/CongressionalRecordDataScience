 President, let me thank my friend the majority leader for confirming that he intends to keep his word.  With regard to judicial nominations, the facts are not irrelevant. Of the 33 nominations in the Senate we have acted on this year--this calendar year--cloture has been required on three: Brennan, Hagel, and Halligan, and cloture was not invoked on only one. We have confirmed 33 boards--actually judges, agencies--33 nominations confirmed this year. Cloture was required on only three, and cloture was not invoked on only one.  My only point to my friend the majority leader is, the math is hard to dispute. We have made a major effort here to move the Senate back in the direction that I know the majority leader and I agree on, the way the Senate ought to operate. We have made major progress. I think that progress needs to be recognized. My friend the majority leader said it on various occasions this year in connection with bills we have processed in a fair and open way with plenty of amendments and an opportunity for everybody to be involved. So let's tone down the rhetoric.  I want to say again I appreciate the majority leader's commitment to keep his word. It is important around here. It has a lot to do with how we go forward. I think the conversation this morning has been constructive, and I thank him. I am sorry he feels we can't wait 10 days to do this nominee, particularly since there are circuit judges, I believe, and maybe district judges as well, already on the calendar.
