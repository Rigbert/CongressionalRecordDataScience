 President, with all due respect to my friend from Nevada, the motion to adjourn will have absolutely nothing to do with unemployment benefits. It is simply, in the judgment of this Senator, an ill-advised attempt to disrupt what is typically a ceremonial day. We have Members of the Senate who were sworn in today--some of them brand new, some of them for the second and third and fourth and fifth terms--who have family in town.
