Speaker, well, here it is. It is the 109th workday of this Congress in Washington D.C. Thank God we were in session all weekend, although most Members of Congress have not been here. The leadership has not been evident. But that brings the Congress up to a grand total of 109 days.  Now, the average American holding only one job, and I have a lot of American families in my district holding two or three jobs trying to make ends meet, but those who are just holding down one job have worked 200 days so far this year.  No wonder the Congress' work remains undone. Congress, under the Republican leadership, has worked in Washington, D.C. 109 days. Many of those partial days, like the day that we adjourned at 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a Wednesday because the Republicans had a huge fund-raiser in New York and they had the corporate jets waiting for them out at National Airport, and they all had to jet up to New York and hold this gala event to rake in a few tens of millions of dollars from their corporate sponsors, the same corporate sponsors who wanted them to kill any attempts to curtail teenage smoking and go after the tobacco industry, and the Republican leaders delivered. There is no legislation coming out of this Congress to curtail that, and the rate of teenage smoking is skyrocketing with all the tragic consequences down the road.  Then the insurance industry. They provided quite a few jets that afternoon because they had a real big one they wanted to kill. Tens of millions of Americans are in what are called HMOs, health maintenance organizations. What we found out about these HMOs is that they save money by denying Americans and their families and loved ones needed care. The insurance bureaucrats will deny your doctor, will deny you a referral to a specialist, so that they can fatten their bottom line.  Tens of millions of Americans were demanding patients' rights. Even the AMA weighed in. They wanted providers' rights. The doctors are fed up with this too. They want to be able to refer their patients for needed tests. But, guess what? The insurance industry is capable of delivering tens of millions of dollars to the Republican leadership, and, behind closed doors, they decided to kill that legislation. There will be no HMO insurance industry Patients and Providers Bill of Rights in this Congress because of special interest money.  Now, the chairman of the Committee on Rules rose the other day and said it does not matter that we didn't do HMO reform or anything about teenage smoking. It does not matter that we have not passed the education package to decrease class size, to increase the number of teachers and rebuild our crumbling schools, because we did one big thing in this Congress, we passed a tax cut.  Well, let us look at the statistics for the tax cut that was passed by the Republican majority. The families earning less than $59,000, I hope they would all look at their tax return for this year, the 1997 tax year, and compare it to the 1996 tax year and see how much the savings were. Those who got it, about one family in five earning less than $59,000, they got $6. $6. Very generous of the Republican leadership.  Now, families between $59,000 and $112,000, they did a little better. They got $81. That is, those of them who got it. That is 20 percent of the families in that tax bracket.  But, ah ha, thank God some people really got relief under this bill. Two-thirds of the small number of families in this country earning over $112,000 a year, those whose incomes average $660,000 a year, well, they got a tax cut of $7,135. Very nice. Very nice. It could help pay one year's cost for a kid to go to a state institution of higher learning.  Of course, their kids are not going to the state institutions of higher learning. But it could pay for that from one of those other families. The families earning less than $59,000 will get $6 to put toward that education, and those between $59,000 and $112,000 will get $81.  So that is the grand accomplishment of this Congress. That is reason enough not to have done anything for education, for class size, for more teachersfor the crumbling schools. That is reason enough for the Republican leadership to have denied tens of millions of Americans patients rights when they need a referral to a specialist, when they need a test, when they need treatment. They are denied, with no appeal, and the Republicans have denied them legislation to fix that. It was within the power of this Congress, but the big money spoke louder than the millions of Americans who needed help.  Then the teenagers getting hooked on tobacco, well, too bad for them too, according to the Republican leadership. There was not time to take care of that problem.                          ____________________
