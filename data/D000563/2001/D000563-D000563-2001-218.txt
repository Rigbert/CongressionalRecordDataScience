DORGAN. Do you want yourself, your families, your friends, your neighbors looking in the rearview mirror to see an 80,000-pound vehicle coming behind you with a driver who has not slept in 24 hours, who has brakes that may not work, and who has come across the border and has not been inspected? Is that what you want for yourself or your family? I do not.  Let me just say again, there is not a ghost of a chance by January 1, when President Bush wants to allow these trucks in, that the inspectors necessary to assure the protection of American drivers on America's roads will be in place. How do I know that? Because the Department of Transportation's Inspector General testified before the Commerce Committee and said the administration is short of inspectors. Even the plan they are proposing will not allow the inspectors to be present to make sure these trucks coming into our country are safe.  I will be happy to yield.
