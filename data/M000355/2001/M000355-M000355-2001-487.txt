 President, let me say, having been involved in this debate over the years, I have frequently heard the words, ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' My friend from Utah recalls that we hear that from time to time.  I have taken a look at when that comes up, ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,'' and every single time those words come up--``don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good''--is in relation to an amendment that might have some impact on organized labor--some impact.  I have watched this carefully now for some 10 or 12 years, and every time the words ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good'' are expressed, it is because there is an amendment pending that might have some impact--ever so tiny--on organized labor.  Now, the Bennett amendment is very evenhanded. It is not targeted at organized labor, by any means?
