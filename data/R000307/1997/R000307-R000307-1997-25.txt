President, today the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. Senators who have any additional amendments to this legislation are encouraged to contact the managers and come to the floor this morning so that we can continue to make real progress on this bill.  At 10:45 this morning, the Senate will begin 15 minutes of debate on H.R. 2016, the military construction appropriations conference report. A vote will occur at approximately 11 o'clock on the MilCon conference report. Following disposition of that report, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill with the intention of completing that measure today.
