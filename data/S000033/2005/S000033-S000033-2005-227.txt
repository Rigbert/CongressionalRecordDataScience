 Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to inform this body that Eugene Jarecki, a filmmaker in Waitsfield, Vermont, has been awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. Mr. Jarecki won this prestigious award for his documentary, Why We Fight.  Mr. Jarecki provides a balanced view of what President Eisenhower warned was a danger to democracy: the ``military-industrial complex.'' He interviews, for instance, supporters of the current war in Iraq such as Weekly Standard editor William Kristol and Richard Perle, Chairman of the Defense Policy Board; he also interviews those who warn of dangers which may emerge from the prosecution of that war, talking with Senator John McCain, news anchor Dan Rather, and USAF Lt. Col. (Ret.) Karen Kwiatkowski.  Sundance describes his film succinctly and accurately: ``Why We Fight is an inside look at the anatomy of the American war machine, examining how a force so potentially counter to the balance of a democratic society influences American life. Amid the upheaval of the Iraq War, the film follows the personal stories of a group of characters in America's military family.  ``Why does America fight? Time and again, why does she seem inclined toward war against an ever changing array of enemies? What are the forces--economic, political, ideological--that shape and propel American militarism? Where do they meet? And what role does the individual play?''  Writing in the New York Times this week in honor of the recently deceased Arthur Miller, fellow playright (and Vermont resident) David Mamet wrote, ``Bad drama reinforces our prejudices. It informs us of what we knew when we came into the theater. Good drama survives because it appeals not to the fashion of the moment, but to the problems both universal and eternal, as they are insoluble.'' Eugene Jarecki makes good films.  The balance in his film, along with the craft and care with which it was made, propelled Jarecki's work to its Sundance Award. As Vermont filmmaker Jay Craven noted, Jarecki's ``film emerged as a top Sundance hit precisely because it articulates a view that goes far beyond the seasonal politics of elections to pose larger and enduring questions.''  In this era when too often political ``spin'' substitutes for reasoned analysis and the study of history, Eugene Jarecki has shown us that the media have a vital role to play in educating us about our political and economic past, and about our future. Vermont is as proud of him as the judges at Sundance were; and we are happy that he is once again en route to sharing his cinematic work with the entire nation.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E311]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      A VERMONT FILMMAKER OF NOTE                                 ______                                                           HON.
