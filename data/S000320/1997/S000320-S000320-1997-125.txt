 President, I will be brief on the Wellstone amendment.  I think just about everybody in the Senate would agree that whatever tax bill we enact this year should meet a standard of fairness in the distributional impact on all Americans, on upper, middle and lower taxpayers, as he is talking about. I have no quarrel with the amendment, the Wellstone amendment. I do not believe it belongs on the Senate authorization bill dealing with intelligence activities, but I have no opposition to the content of it or the substance of it.
