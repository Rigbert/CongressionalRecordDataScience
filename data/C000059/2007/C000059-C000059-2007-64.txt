 I would have voted as follows on today's recorded votes: rollcall No. 27--Yea--H. Con. Res. 31--Honoring the Mare Island Original 21ers for their efforts to increase equal employment opportunities in the military, rollcall No. 28--Yea--H.R. 434--Short Term Extension of the Small Business Administration, rollcall No. 29--Nay--Ordering the Previous Question on the Rule for H.R. 5, rollcall No. 30--Nay--Adoption of the Rule for H.R. 5, rollcall No. 31--Yea--Republican Motion to Recommit for H.R. 5, and rollcall No. 32--Nay--Final Passage of H.R. 5.  H.R. 5 which is being considered without regular order or Republican input, falls far short of their original proposal to cut all student loan interest rates in half, increase Pell grants and increase tax deductions for parents of college students. This legislation is not part of a comprehensive approach which provides accountability and transparency for escalating tuition costs. A temporary interest rate decrease for college graduates is only part of the solution. The reduced interest rate does not apply to PLUS loans, consolidation loans, or unsubsidized Stafford loans.  Rollcall No. 33--Yea--H. Res. 58--To Honor Muhammad Ali, global humanitarian, on the occasion of his 65th birthday.                          ____________________
