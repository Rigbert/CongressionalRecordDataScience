John McCaskey, Erin Kinsella and Mark Pendleton have initiated a unique program to raise awareness among young adults about organ donation.  Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton works in partnership with the National Football League, NFL, to urge students to become organ donors. Informational school forums will acquaint students with the issue and those who decide to sign an organ donor card will receive an autograph from an NFL player. Program organizers call it ``an autograph for an autograph,'' and to date, they have enlisted the help of players, coaches and alumni from every NFL team.  The program honors Walter Payton, the Illinois football star who brought to the Nation's attention the difficulties patients face while on the waiting list for a donated organ. The NFL's all-time rushing leader, Payton died two years ago while waiting for a liver transplant at age 46.  Walter Payton broke Jim Brown's all-time rushing record on October 7, 1984, and the Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program organizers have decided to launch their efforts on October 9, 2001 to commemorate this accomplishment. While his record-breaking performance on the football field as a Chicago Bear set him apart from his competitors, his struggle to find a suitable organ donor is all too common.  More than 2,300 individuals suffering from a condition serious enough to place them on the waiting list for an organ or tissue transplant are under the age of 18. Last year, 641 of those patients were between the ages of 11 and 17. The Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program highlights the fact that Americans of all ages need organ and tissue transplants. Many factors influence whether or not a transplant will be successful, and matching donor and recipient age is one way to improve surgery outcomes. Anyone can become an organ and tissue donor, and I would also like to emphasize how important it is that young people both learn about organ and tissue donation and share that knowledge with their families.  I am submitting a resolution that will support the purposes and objectives of the Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program and encourage more young people to learn about organ and tissue donation. I am pleased that Senators Allen, Kennedy and Frist have joined me in cosponsoring this resolution. In the House of Representatives, Representative Brown of Ohio and Representative Largent of Oklahoma have also chosen to lend their support to this program.  My colleagues know how far we have come in this field of medicine, especially Senator Frist, himself a transplant surgeon. The first successful transplant was the result of a kidney donation from one identical twin to another. It occurred 47 years ago, without the use of any anti-rejection medication. The first liver and heart transplants followed, and progress has continued at breakneck speed. Today, transplant procedures are more common, successful and safe. Patients suffering from kidney failure, diabetes, heart disease and hepatitis C are just some of the individuals whose lives have been saved or vastly improved by advances in heart, liver, lung and tissue transplant science.  In addition to expanding the list of disorders treatable or curable with an organ or tissue transplant, doctors and scientists have improved the success and safety of transplant surgery. Organ and tissue recipients survive and thrive today because investments in biomedical research have broadened our understanding of the immunological factors that can enhance donor and recipient compatibility. Work in the laboratory has led to the discovery of various immunosuppressive drugs that decrease the likelihood of organ and tissue rejection. Increased rates of success have inspired more and more insurers to include transplant procedures and medication as part of the coverage they offer. Yet we continue to neglect an important part of the equation for saving and improving the lives of those patients waiting list for an organ or tissue transplant: Identifying and referring potential donors.  Progress in the field of transplant science is truly remarkable. This progress is why I vote time and time again to invest in medical research. This progress is also why I stand before my colleagues once again to emphasize the critical role played by groups like Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton.  The number of registered organ and tissue donors remains woefully inadequate. Every 14 minutes another individual joins the waiting list for an organ or tissue donation. Identifying more donors and encouraging them to discuss consent with their next-of-kin is a part of the battle against disease that we are not winning. We cannot afford to neglect the important work of groups that raise awareness about organ and tissue donation. Increasing knowledge about and inspiring interest in this issue is the only way we can ensure that innovations in the laboratory and increased proficiency among medical providers make a difference in the lives of those patients waiting for a transplant. The need for more donors is acute, and without groups like Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton, the number of patients who die while waiting for a transplant will only increase.  I introduced my ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' resolution in 1999, which emphasized the importance of discussing organ and tissue donation with family members to ensure that the desire to donate would be honored. At that time, there were 66,000 patients waiting for transplants. 76,000 individuals are waiting today. Of the 16,000 potential donors each year, less than half will actually result in a donation of an organ or tissue, because too many potential donors fail to discuss their desire to donate with family members.  For those 76,000 Americans who are on the waiting list for an organ or tissue donation, identifying and referring more donors is a matter of life or death. Once the decision to become a donor is made, family members must be made aware of the donor's intention. Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton is a commendable program because it tackles both of these barriers to linking organ and tissue donors with patients in need. Not only does the program encourage more individuals to become donors, it also recognizes that young people can take a leading role in initiating family discussion about intentions to be an organ and tissue donor.  This resolution affirms the goals and ideas of the Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program, andurges young people to learn more about the value of organ and tissue donation and share that information with family members. I commend the program's founders for all the good work they have done thus far, and ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing their efforts.                          ____________________
