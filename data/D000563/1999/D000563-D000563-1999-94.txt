When we use terms such as ``fill the tree,'' which we are talking about, we are basically talking about a gag rule here which says Members of the Senate can't offer amendments.  Some critics say: We know what you mean; the old Senate filibuster. You want to go on forever offering amendment after amendment after amendment so you can never get anything done around here.  Can the leader on the Democratic side tell us, have we offered to the Republican side to limit the debate on the amendments, to limit the number of amendments, to require they be published in the Record so we know the parameters of the debate and so we know it will come to an end at a certain time, we know there will be an up-or-down vote? Has that been part of the bargaining?
