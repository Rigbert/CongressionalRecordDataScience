  Mr. DeFAZIO. Get ready. You're going to hear a lot of fuzzy math, obfuscation and general BS here on the floor today; but there has never been a more clear choice between Main Street and Wall Street America.  On one side, tax relief for 22 million American families, 247,000 families in Oregon, 39,000 in my district, relief from the onerous alternative minimum tax.  On the other side, 50,000 millionaires and billionaires who manage private investment funds and exploit a tax loophole to pay a rate of taxes less than that paid by a teacher or a cop walking the beat. The bill would ask those 50,000 millionaire and billionaire investors to pay their fair share so that 22 million middle-income families can get relief from the alternative minimum tax, a tax originally designed to get at the millionaires and billionaires.  There will be gnashing of teeth because the millionaires and billionaires are very generous come campaign time. But you can't dodge this vote; Main Street or Wall Street?                          ____________________
