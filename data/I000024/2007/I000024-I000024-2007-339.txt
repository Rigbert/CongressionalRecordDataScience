President, last session of the Congress, I introduced a bill, along with 30 other Senators, to prevent the imposition of global taxes on the United States. The bill would withhold 20 percent of our contributions to the United Nations' budget should the organization continue in advancing its global tax goals.  There are a lot of things they do. I know this body is divided in support of the United Nations. I, frankly, don't see a lot of good that they do. In fact, many of the things I find offensive all get started in the United Nations. But the fact is, there is an effort to get out from under any type of supervision from any of the member states of the United Nations.  The current efforts of the United Nations--and we are talking about organizations which are trying to replace the dues system so that we can no longer threaten to withhold 20 percent of our dues and come up with some type of a global tax independent funding system so they don't have to answer to anyone. The current efforts of the United Nations and other international organizations to develop, advocate, endorse, promote, and publicize proposals to raise revenue by instituting international taxes are unacceptable.  Last year, United Nations Ambassador John Bolton summarized the U.S. position in stating that although the U.S. fully supports increased development assistance, ``the U.S. does not accept global aid targets or global taxes.''  My bill is the latest development in a decade-long struggle against the desire of the United Nations to implement a global tax regime.  First, to articulate openly the U.N.'s movement toward global taxes was none other than Boutros-Boutros Ghali, and that was in 1996 in a speech he made at Oxford University in which he hopefully embraced the consent of global taxes and authoritarian world government. The then-Secretary General expressed the U.N.'s desire not to ``be under the daily financial will of member states.'' Now, what he is talking about is the United States.  This statement warranted and resulted in congressional action, and I cosponsored Senator Dole's bill at that time--this is 1996--to prevent U.N. global taxes, which passed both Houses of Congress and became law.  Our efforts were met with continued resistance and arrogance on the part of the United Nations. In that same year, the concept of global taxes was fully debated. That was after we passed our legislation.  A little later, the U.N. Development Programme Research Project resulted in a push for the Tobin Tax, which is a tax on international monetary transactions to go directly to the United Nations. This tax would net trillions of dollars annually.  The 2001 Zedillo report concluded that ``there is a genuine need to establish, by international consensus, stable and contractual new sources of multilateral finance''--world taxes.  Over the next few years, the U.N. pushed for a tax on international arms sales and military expenditures, taxes on international airline tickets, taxes on international trade through an ocean freight tax, a global environmental levy, and all other types of global taxes.  The list goes on and on, but here are just the most recent examples of this movement: A 2004 United Nations University study on global taxation; the U.N.'s 2005 book called ``New Sources of Development Finance'' edited by A.B. Atkinson; a September 2005, United Nations ``Millennium Development Goals'' meeting addresses international airline ticket tax; Peter Wahl of the German organization, WEED, says international currency transactions taxes are ``ready,''; and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which is an affiliation of the AFL-CIO, supports international taxes. The Clinton, Ford, and Gates Foundations participated in U.N. conferences pushing global taxes. George Soros's Open Society Institute and Oxfam America met at the ``New Rules for Global Finance Coalition.''  The U.N. is fascinated with these global tax schemes. It would be an unprecedented accumulation of power for the United Nations. We cannot concede any ground on this issue. Conceding on even one of these initiatives will only embolden the United Nations to go for more.  The same rules that apply to bureaucracies in the United States--gradual accumulation of more and more power and resources and coercive ability--apply to the United Nations in an even more dramatic manner. The IRS is a model of confidence, moderation, and responsibility when compared to the United Nations.  Unfortunately, the United Nations enjoys support from another international bureaucracy which has endorsed global tax efforts. It is the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In addition to its support of U.N. global tax schemes, the OECD, which receives 25 percent of its budget from the UnitedStates, has used U.S. taxpayer money in turn to encourage and support higher taxes on U.S. taxpayers.  Now, keep in mind, this is something we are supporting, to encourage increasing U.S. taxes. For these reasons, I had the following language included in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill:       None of the funds made available in this act may be used to      fund activities or projects undertaken by the Organization      for Economic Cooperation and Development that are designed to      hinder the flow of capital and jobs from high-tax      jurisdictions to low-tax jurisdictions, or to infringe on the      sovereign right of jurisdictions to determine their own      domestic policies.  Of course, we know what has happened to the appropriations bills currently. It is very simple and straightforward. If you want to advocate for higher taxes and global taxes on U.S. taxpayers, U.S. taxpayers would not be forced to foot the bill.  Let's quickly look at some of the reasons for this language and the case against the OECD. The OECD has endorsed and encouraged higher taxes, new taxes, and global taxes no fewer than 24 times in reports with titles such as ``Toward Global Tax Cooperation'' in which the OECD identifies 35 nations guilty of harmful tax competition. I am quoting there: ``Guilty of harmful tax competition.''  In other words, they want us to have taxes as high as any of the other countries have.  They have advocated that the U.S. adopt a costly and bureaucratic value added tax, a 40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a fertilizer tax, ending the deductibility of state and local taxes from federal taxes, new taxes at the state level, and a host of other new and innovative taxes on U.S. citizens.  It's not only the recommending of higher taxes which concerns us; the ultimate concern is the movement towards undermining U.S. sovereignty. Ecogroups such as the Friends of the Earth want the OECD to declare that dam building for flood control and electronic power is unacceptable as sustainable energy. In May 2005, the OECD ministers endorsed a proposal at the UN to create a system of global taxes.  The OECD has stated explicitly that low-tax policies unfairly erode the tax bases of other countries and distort the location of capital and services.  What we have here are Paris-based bureaucrats seeking to protect high tax welfare states from the free market.  That's why the OECD goes on to say that free-market tax competition may hamper the application of progressive tax rates and the achievement of redistributive goals. Clearly, free market tax competition makes it harder to implement socialistic welfare states. The free market evidently hasn't been fair to socialistic welfare states. Well, it is a good thing that they have the OECD and nearly $100 million in U.S. taxpayer money to protect them.  Noted economist Walter Williams clearly sees the direction in which this is headed when he says that the bottom line agenda for the OECD is to establish a tax cartel where nations get together and collude on taxes.  Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill seconded that when he said that he was troubled by the underlying premise that low tax rates are somehow suspect and by the notion that any country . . . should interfere in any other country's tax policy.  And John Bolton argued that the OECD represents a kind of worldwide centralization of governments and interest groups. Who do you think bears the costs for all this? Mr. Bolton answers and you probably guessed it--the United States.  America's proud history of independence was driven in no small part by the desire for sovereignty over taxation powers. In this context, it makes no sense to relegate our sovereignty over tax policy, in any way, to international bureaucrats.  It's very simple. U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund a bunch of international bureaucrats who write, speak, organize, and advocate in support of higher taxes, global taxes, and the gradual erosion of American sovereignty over its domestic fiscal policies.  If individual Americans want to give their money to an organization which is dedicated to raising taxes, they can. It is called the Democratic Party. But most Americans would be outraged to learn that they are forced to subsidize these types of activities with their tax dollars.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).
