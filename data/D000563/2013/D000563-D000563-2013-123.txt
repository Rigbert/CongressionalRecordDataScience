President, the Senate family was stunned yesterday with the news that our colleague Jim Inhofe lost his son Perry in a plane crash in Oklahoma. I extend my condolences to Jim, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, and his wife Kay and their family on the loss of their son.  Each year, I always look forward to their Christmas card. It is an amazing gathering which grows by the year. Clearly, it is a strong, large family which takes great comfort in one another's strength. At this moment they will need it having lost one of their own.  I extend my condolences along with those of the Senate family to all of their extended family. I pray that they will have the strength--and I am confident they will--to face this personal and family tragedy.                          ____________________
