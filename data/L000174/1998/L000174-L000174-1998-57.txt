President, as is the Chairman, I am a member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. He knows my personal concern about the situation facing our veterans in New England. The Appropriations Committee added $278 million in this conference report for veterans medical care, a significant increase over the President's budget request. It was my understanding that a portion of this increase will go to New England. Am I correct in that assumption?
