Speaker, Dorothy Biddle is a very special lady in the hearts of the residents of Fulton County, Ohio and her hometown of Wauseon. Proud to call her friend myself, I am pleased to note an action recently taken by this gracious centenarian, a wonderful and lasting gift she gave to her community.  For many years, Wauseon has been working to establish a ballpark. The ``Field of Dreams'' has been a goal of the community and special project of the Wauseon Rotary. Mrs. Biddle's husband, Clark, was a Rotarian until his passing, and she has remained in touch with the group's activities. In her 105th year, Dorothy Biddle decided to offer a bequest to the Wauseon Rotary in order to fulfill this 14 yearlong dream. Long a supporter of youth activities and opportunities, Mrs. Biddle is donating the astounding sum of $1,254,000.00 for the completion of the park. This gift numbers among the largest ever received by any Rotary organization.  Now the park, which will feature baseball diamonds, soccer fields, and walking trails on 73 acres of land will bear the name of Wauseon's most treasured citizen, who though she has traveled around the world still considers her hometown to be ``the best place in the world to live.'' Children of the future will see by her example what one person can do for her community when the Dorothy B. Biddle Park remains as a living testament to a truly remarkable lady. Thank you, Dorothy, for your beneficence and civic-minded patriotism.                          ____________________
