Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Scott A. Bailey, an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Moreno Valley, California are exceptional. Moreno Valley has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated people who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Scott Bailey is one of these individuals.  After graduating from Moreno Valley High School as an Eagle Scout, Scott married his wife Beverly and started working as an electrician in 1981. The couple had three children, bought a home in Moreno Valley, and had humble, yet unselfishly universal dreams about putting their children through college and saving enough to retire easily. Living in the economy of the early nineties, Scott and Beverly brainstormed about the best options to keep her from returning to her job in real estate and decided to start their own electrical contracting business out of their own home.  The Baileys had a remarkable vision to create a construction company based on an unwavering commitment to quality and not only did they achieve this goal, but by doing so, everything else seemed to fall into line. Stronghold Engineering built a solid reputation as the go to contractor for civil, design/build, and high voltage electrical projects on both a national and international level. This allowed the company to become ranked and win several awards.  Scott is responsible for day-to-day operations as the Chief Operating Officer and supports all Stronghold Engineering field personnel, resources, and projects. Over the course of the company's 23-year history, he has managed and directed over 450 projects, with the average project sizes ranging from $500,000 to well over $100,000,000.  Scott has always been a hands-on manager making visits to each project site ensuring only the best quality and safety standards are met whether he's making trips to Europe, South Africa, Russia, Canada, or Mexico, he remains humble and true to his roots by giving back to the world community as well as his own. Scott has chaired the ABC Craft Championships Committee, has helped in the rebuilding efforts in devastated New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and in Mexico, helped to build an orphanage for at risk children. Stronghold recently donated all labor in helping two local Riverside churches switch to solar energy.  In light of all Scott Bailey has done for the community of Moreno Valley, it is clear that he deserves the Distinguished Citizen Award. Scott's tireless passion for the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of Moreno Valley, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community projects, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
