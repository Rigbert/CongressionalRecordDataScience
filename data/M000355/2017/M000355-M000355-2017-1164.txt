 President, this morning, the Senate continues to send its prayers to all the victims of yesterday's horrific shooting. We know our House colleagues are all thinking about their colleague, Majority Whip Scalise. It has been an immensely difficult 24 hours for all the victims, including Matt Mika, who remains in ICU, Zach Barth, and, of course, Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey. Those officers didn't back down when faced with this threat. Instead, as the Capitol Police always do, they put themselves in harm's way to help protect others. Without them, we know so many more would have been injured.  So we want to continue to express our gratitude to all those who graciously put their lives on the line to keep the Capitol community safe. In doing so, we are also reminded of the bravery of our colleagues on the field yesterday--those who stepped in to help friends who had been injured as they waited for first responders to arrive. I think it says something about the character of those people as well.
