President, I rise today to congratulate Knox College in Galesburg, IL, on the 175th anniversary of its founding.  On February 15, 1837, the Illinois Legislature granted a charter to Knox Manual Labor College. Its founder, the Reverend George Washington Gale, a social reformer from New York, came to the Illinois prairie to found a college emphasizing manual labor that would be open to students regardless of their financial means, gender, or race.  This egalitarianism and the strong anti-slavery beliefs of Reverend Gale and his followers gave Knox and Galesburg a unique place in the history of the abolitionist movement in America. Knox is a nationally recognized part of the Underground Railroad network. Its Old Main was the site of the fifth debate between U.S. Senate candidates Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. It was during the debate at Knox that Lincoln would argue for the first time against slavery on moral grounds.  It seems fitting that President Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, and President Obama, our nation's first African American president, both hold honorary degrees from this institution. Knox was also the alma mater of Barnabas Root, who in 1870 became one of the first African Americans to earn a college degree in Illinois. In that same year, Hiram Revels, who also attended Knox, became the first African American to serve in the United States Senate.  Today, the Knox campus is a vibrant community of world class scholar-teachers, staff, and more than 1,400 students hailing from 48 States and 51 countries. Manual labor may have been dropped from its name and curriculum--much to the relief of its current students to be sure--but Knox's founding commitment to providing a quality education to all persists. Of Knox's students today, more than a quarter are first generation college students, a quarter are U.S. students of color, and nearly one third are low-income students. Approximately two thirds of students receive some form of financial aid, and Knox has been rated by Princeton Review as a ``Best Bang for Your Buck.''  I congratulate President Teresa Amott and the entire Knox community on this milestone in the proud and storied history of Knox College. Knox is truly one of our nation's great liberal arts institutions--its contributions far surpass its relatively small size. So, as we look back in celebration of Knox's preceding 175 years, we also look to the future in anticipation of the continued contributions this small college on the Illinois prairie will make to our State and our country for years to come.                          ____________________
