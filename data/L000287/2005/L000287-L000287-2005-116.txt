Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a progressive disorder that occurs when motor nerve cells in the central nervous system cease functioning and die. Each year, over 5,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with this illness. There are 600 patients in Georgia alone. Sadly, there is no known cause, cure, or means of control in the advanced stages, ALS care can cost up to $200,000 per year, depleting the financial resources of patients and relatives.  In Georgia, families impacted by ALS are blessed to have the support of The ALS Association of Georgia, which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the fight against ALS and the support of patients and their caregivers. Over 80% of all monies raised goes directly to patient services. Services offered include information and referrals, home nursing visits, support groups, coordination of medical care, equipment loan, children's counseling, respite care, public education and awareness, and research support. The suffering of patients and the anguish and struggle of caregivers must be supported and alleviated as much as possible.  I commend The ALS Association of Georgia for all of their good work in serving patients with this devastating disease. During the month of May, which is ALS Awareness Month, I urge all citizens and my colleagues here in Congress to become educated about ALS and to lend their aid to combating this disease.                          ____________________
