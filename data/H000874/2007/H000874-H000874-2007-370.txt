The leader, your leader and I, have spent substantial time together over the last 48 hours discussing this agreement and discussing it with Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis. Clearly we are proceeding in not as a definitive way as we might otherwise have proceeded, and we are proceeding with reliance on the good faith of each to proceed in a manner that we believe accommodates what has been done last year and what we hope will be done this year and, that is, consider these bills with the inclusion of the earmarks in the bills in a manner that facilitates their being passed through this House.
