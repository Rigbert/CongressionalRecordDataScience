Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the Callahan motion. Just let me take a moment to digress.  Some of the leading appropriators in this House never lose the opportunity to admonish and even scold the rest of us and to tell us to look elsewhere when offering terms and conditions on policy. The appropriators just do the money, or so the thinking goes; the authorizers do policy.  All of that sounds neat and tidy, a true division of labor. But appropriations bills are stuffed to the hilt with policy. It may be useful to note that in years past, this ``not on my appropriations bill'' approach has been invoked in attempts to deter the offering of pro-life amendments or, once adopted, to try to strip out the pro-life language on appropriations bills, including the Hyde amendment on the health and human services bill.  The notion of ``do it on the authorizing bill'' has surface appeal. But had pro-lifers heeded that advice, the overwhelming majority of pro-life riders would never have become law, including the Hyde amendment, including the bans on taxpayer funding for abortion under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. I first offered that back in 1983, and everybody was telling me, ``Do not do it on the appropriations bill,'' the D.C. appropriations bill, the Federal prisons ban, and other riders. If pro-lifers had bought into that line, the U.S. Government today would be paying for abortion on demand in most of the programs that we subsidize.                              {time}  1645  In the real world, appropriators are more equal, more essential, if you will, than the rest of us. In the end, their bills must pass, even if those bills are rolled into an omnibus bill or a CR. Authorizers, especially on the Committee on International Relations, are doubly disadvantaged.  First, we bring relatively unpopular bills to the floor, and who here has constituents who are clamoring for more foreign aid? And, second, appropriators often render our work product moot or redundant or superfluous by simply waiving the need for an authorization bill.  The simple fact of the matter is that the White House, be it Democrat or Republican, knows this and needs only to wait until the eleventh hour for the appropriators to waive authorization. The real world consequence of this waiver-of-authorization drill is to closely undermine Members on the authorizing committees in negotiations with the administration on tough issues like population and abortion.  The administration calculates, and I believe wrongly this time, that they can get a better deal by pushing the process to the zero hour, which is why we offered the pro-life Mexico City policy to both the foreign operations bill and the State Department authorization bill, which I would remind my colleagues is the bill that I wrote.  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, the State bill, not the reorganization, which was the part of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], and not some of the other policy considerations, but the State Department bill is my bill, and I chair the subcommittee that oversees it.  We put it on that bill and we also put it on the foreign operations bill. The gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Largent] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], as everyone knows, moved yesterday to instruct the conferees to retain the Mexico City and will hopefully do the same today on the authorizing bill.  This year, the majority of us in the House who recognize the fact that abortion is violence against babies will not give in, nor will we accept bogus compromises like metering, or counterfeits like the Gilman-Pelosi amendment. This year we will simply not allow the approximately $400 million U.S. taxpayer dollars to enrich those who dismember and chemically poison unborn children.  Abortion is violence against children. Abortion is child abuse, and this year we are prepared to zero out U.N. arrearage payments, cut foreign aid and take any action necessary to ensure that the Hyde amendment for foreign aid, which is the Mexico City policy, is enacted.  Yesterday's vote to instruct conferees to insist on the Mexico City policy was no frivolous vote. We simply will not cave, not now, not next week, not the week after, or ever, because millions of children and the well-being of their mothers are at stake.  I can assure the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan] that as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, I will fight any effort to bring the State bill back to the floor without the Mexico City policy. If through some means, and I do not think one exists, my bill lands on the floor without the Mexico City policy, I give my colleagues my vow, I will lead the fight against my own bill on the floor of this House.  I can only ask the same of the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan] on foreign operations. I urge support on the Callahan motion.
