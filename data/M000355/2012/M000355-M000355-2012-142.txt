 Glenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook of London, Kentucky, and his service to both this nation and the State of Kentucky, specifically Laurel County and the surrounding region. Passionate about development of the London community, Mr. Westbrook worked to build the Laurel County economy and strengthen the tourism industry in southeastern Kentucky.  Born in 1930 to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl Westbrook, Buddy Westbrook was raised in London, Kentucky. His nickname, Buddy, stuck when his older sister, Madge, called him Buddy because she could not say Glenn. He began working at an early age when he helped his father separate type for the printing shop the family owned. Buddy enjoyed working because it made him feel grown up. However, like all boys, he enjoyed spending time outdoors, especially at Kidds Pond, and he also had a knack for getting into mischief, such as climbing telephone poles.  Buddy graduated from high school in London but during his sophomore year attended classes at Berea College to study chemistry. After high school he attended Sue Bennett College and worked in his father's gas and LP appliance store. Throughout his life, he was taught that civic duty and serving others was an important part of being a member of a community. In 1950, Buddy joined the U.S. Army and served in Germany during the Korean War.  When he returned to London, Buddy took over his family store. As an active member of the Jaycees, an organization that promotes community development, he was able to attend a conference in Ashland where he met his wife, Jeanne. The couple had eight children. In 1970, Governor Wendell Ford named Buddy to the Kentucky Institute for Children.  In 1975, Buddy was offered a position with the Cumberland Valley Area Development District. His service through this post was especially of benefit to the tourism industry in the region. Not only did Buddy and members of the commission share information about the region at travel shows, but he also organized the first Tourism Industry Development Symposium held in Lexington.  After the death of his wife, Jeanne, and son, Don, in 1983 and 1984, respectively, Buddy understandably endured some difficult times. However, a friend, Susan Mitchell, who later became his wife, helped him through this dark period. After retiring in 1993, Buddy organized Vision 2000 for London, Kentucky, a plan to define goals for the city which ultimately came to fruition during the new millennium.  Buddy Westbrook is truly an outstanding citizen of the London, Kentucky, community. Passionate about the development of Laurel County and the surrounding region, his lifetime commitment to economic and tourism development have proved to be invaluable to southeastern Kentucky. Buddy's dedication to his community is exemplary, and I am privileged today to recognize his many contributions to Kentucky. I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in celebrating Mr. Glenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook. A recent article published in the Sentinel-Echo, a Laurel County-area publication, highlighted his accomplishments. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 2, 2012]           Westbrook: `This Is Most Exciting Time in History'                           (By Tara Kaprowy)       Upon opening the door for his Living Treasures interview,      81-year-old Glenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook announces he just has a      couple of hours to chat; he's going four-wheeling on the Salt      River with a friend and, with the spring morning warm and      clear, time's, as they say, a-wastin'.       But upon stepping into his kitchen, it's clear Westbrook's      interest hasn't completely been kidnapped by the prospect of      ATVing. He's laid out his dining room table with croissants,      marmalade and several types of tea in anticipation of the      impending discussion--and, in his characteristic way, to make      things lovely and enjoyable.       Westbrook was born June 14, 1930, to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl      (Eversole) Westbrook. His mother was born in London and her      maternal grandfather, J.N. Robinson, was the first      photographer and jeweler in town. ``My mother's father was      Roscoe Eversole, and he was the cashier of the First National      Bank in London and was also mayor when they first started      putting in sidewalks and culverts. Before that, it was      boardwalks. And so I grew up with examples of leadership, a      love of London and Laurel County, and an appreciation of the      people.''       His father came from the cotton farms of Georgia and,      together, he and Flo Pearl made a cozy home with their young      family in an apartment above First National Bank. Westbrook's      sister Madge was two years his elder and, unable to pronounce      the name ``Glenn,'' he soon acquired the nickname     ``Buddy,'' a moniker by which he is still known.       Hamp worked at the Corbin Times and later owned a printing      shop in Corbin. From a young age, Westbrook helped his      father, learning ``to separate cold type in a California      box,'' he said.       ``It wasn't done by a-b-c-d-e-f-g,'' he said. ``It was by      the most-used letters, `e' was in the center in the bigger      box. It made me feel grown up.''       After Madge and Westbrook started attending school at Sue      Bennett grade school, Flo Pearl went to work at First      National Bank, a job she kept for the next 50 years.       With the family settling in a home his father built on East      Fifth Street, Westbrook remembers a happy childhood. ``This      was a wonderful place to grow up,'' he said. ``If you made      any mistakes while you were in town, like climbing telephone      poles or things like that, your parents knew by the time you      got home. You got a lecture and often your backside got      warmed.''       London was a friendly place to live, and ``people would      come to town on Saturdays from farms, park their cars, park      their horses and wagons behind the jail on Broad Street, and      they'd come up on Main Street where all the businesses were      located,'' he said. ``It was a time when doctors cared about      you. They knew you, they loved you, and they wanted to heal      you.''       Westbrook also described strict but caring teachers. ``We      learned about patriotism and civic things,'' he said. ``We      started learning at an early age that we were part of a      whole.''       Evenings at the Westbrook house included the family      ``watching the radio'' to listen to the evening news. Flo      Pearl would read to her children from English and American      authors and classic mythology. On warm summer afternoons,      Westbrook said he and his friends would head to a small lake      south of London close to the entrance of Levi Jackson      Wilderness Road State Park.       ``It was Kidds Pond,'' he said. ``They had dressing rooms      and they charged you a quarter to swim all day and sometimes      it was 10 cents. Of course, back then you could get a Coke      for a nickel and hamburgers were a nickel.''       When he was looking for something to do, Westbrook would      head to his grandmother's farm next to where E.C. Porter's      IGA currently stands, where he learned how to ``milk a cow      and how to churn and make butter.''       On December 7, 1941, Westbrook remembers ``playing in the      front yard on his bicycle'' when his parents told him      President Roosevelt had announced the Japanese had attacked      Pearl Harbor. From that moment on, Westbrook's childhood      changed. ``We followed everything about the war,'' he said.      ``I saw the National Guard troops mount up over where the      fire department is now on Dixie Street. They had horses and      stables and they had a drill hall filled with sand with a      roof over it and they would take the horses in there and do      their formations in there. I remember seeing the troops mount      up in the armory after World War II started and march up Main      Street, go down to the depot and get on a train to go off to      war.''       By the time he reached high school, Westbrook had decided      he would become a ``brilliant chemist for Dupont'' and even      went to Berea College in his sophomore year to study      chemistry. He returned to London the following year to      graduate. ``That was a wonderful experience,'' he said.      ``London had a good basketball team, good cheerleaders and      good teachers who cared.''       Following graduation, Westbrook enrolled in Sue Bennett      College. Later, he worked at the appliance and LP gas store      with his father. Westbrook said he was lucky to learn from      his father ``how to build a business, care for customers,      find what they needed, and have it for them.''       But Westbrook was lucky--jobs were scarce and veterans      returning from WWII wanted to be able to live in Laurel      County. That desire was granted when in 1949, London was      chosen to be Kentucky's first ``Test City,'' an experiment in      community development sponsored by the Kentucky Chamber of      Commerce. Over the next 10 years, the effort attracted 2,500      new jobs to the area.       Part of the effort involved ``a big clean-up, paint-up,      fix-up'' campaign in preparation for visits from industries,      Westbrook said. ``Gradually the ramshackle buildings and      sheds were torn down,'' he said. ``There was no law or      anything, there was just pride. They wanted it to be part of      helping it succeed. Weeded lots were mowed, progress reports      were given every week in the newspaper.''       The experience profoundly affected Westbrook, who was      greatly inspired by the community leaders who were spurring      the effort. ``The leadership I saw, the people I respected,      the veterans who came back from World War II and other      leaders, they got together and I saw them cooperating and      really dreaming, saying we could do this and let's try this      to create jobs. Even though there would be the potential      embarrassment of trying something and it not working, at      least you felt like you should try it.''       Westbrook joined the Jaycees, the young men's organization      active in community development.       In 1950, Westbrook was drafted in the U.S. Army during      ``the Korean Police Action,'' but rather than be sent to      Asia, was shipped to Germany where he taught soldiers about      weapon surveillance and fire direction control in his      artillery unit. He was also given the task of purchasing      German wines for the military base.       Westbrook took full advantage of his time in Europe and      sunk happily in its cultures. He learned to ski in the Alps,      took photography lessons from ``an old German,'' learned      French, German, and Italian, ate pizza and weinerschnitzel      for the first time, and spent his time off travelling. ``I      spent a week in Paris and got to go to every museum,'' he      said. ``It was fun to be discovering these things. I got to      see the Louvre. When I went in there, on the first landing,      there was the Winged Victory of Samothrace and I said, Wow!      They've got it here.' ''       When he was discharged in 1953, Westbrook returned to      London, shed his dreams of becoming a chemist, and took over      the family business. He quickly re-joined the Jaycees and      upon his first annual meeting in Ashland, met the woman who      was to become his first wife. ``The only single one was      Jeanne Watts,'' he said. ``A year and a half later, we were      married.''       They wed in Ashland and Westbrook returned to London with      his bride. ``She was intelligent, she had her own way of      doing things, she was thoughtful and caring, but she was also      very independent,'' he said of Jeanne.       Together they had eight children--Joe, Amy, Don, Robert,      David, Mary, Susan, and Leann. Jeanne kept the books and      Buddy continued working at his businesses and diving into      community issues. In 1970, he was appointed by Gov. Wendell      Ford and later Gov. Julian Carroll to the Kentucky Commission      for Children, which was renamed the Kentucky Institute for      Children, and attended the president's 1970 White House      Conference on Children and Youth.       After decades in the gas business, Westbrook decided to go      into the wholesale kitchen-design business, one that later      expanded into institutional food service for schools,      hospitals and resorts.       With the majority of his business in eastern Kentucky,      Westbrook soon discovered it was cheaper to get his      instrument pilot's license and fly his men to Pikeville than      it was to drive, so he bought a six-passenger Cessna and      began his career in the air, flying the equivalent of eight      times around the world.       ``On the weekend, I could take my family and we'd leave      here at noon and be on the beach in Florida in five hours,''      he remembered.       Spending time with his family was paramount to Westbrook,      though he admits he was a ``strict disciplinarian.''       ``I believe discipline is proof that you care about values      that are important in life,'' he said. ``When my daughter      Leann was born with Down syndrome, she thrived because of the      help of her brothers and sisters. I stopped playing golf and      our family did things together and we traveled as a family.      We tried to teach them the need for unconditional love. They      went to church and learned to pray. They still go to      church.''       In 1975, still with a passion for leadership, Westbrook was      asked to work for the Cumberland Valley Area Development      District. Later, he worked to develop a stronger tourism      industry in the region. ``We'd take our brochures and our      booths and our pictures and travel to shows in Chicago and      Indianapolis and Cincinnati and Detroit and people would come      and see where to go on vacation,'' he said.       Eight years later, Jeanne was diagnosed with lung cancer      and, with little treatment available, died August 2, 1983.      Nine months later, Westbrook's son Don died after having an      allergic reaction to a flu shot. It was a devastating time      for Westbrook, who was still working and taking care of      Leann.       Though he continued to go to work every day, he admitted he      fell into a deep depression. ``When a child dies, it pulls      something out of you and you're never, ever the same,'' he      said.       Eventually, Westbrook was able to recover, in part with the      help of Susan Mitchell, who would later become his wife.      ``She helped me through the most difficult times of the      grieving,'' he said. ``I was certainly not a very pleasant      person to be around, and she told me years later I was the      saddest person she had ever seen. I was so thankful to have a      friend who knew what I was going through. She was my      cheerleader.''       Together, Susan and Westbrook have a son, Reuben, and      though no longer married, remain friends.       After 18 years with the development district, during which      he organized the first Tourism Industry Development Symposium      in Lexington, Westbrook retired in 1993. In advance of the      new millennium, he organized Vision 2000, an effort to define      London's goals and aspirations, many of which came to      fruition. In 2010, he wrote a cookbook, ``Grandma's Heirloom      Kentucky and Southern Recipes.'' He continues to live with      Leann, ``who babysits her dad,'' and enjoys seeing his other      children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. He      attends St. William Catholic Church. And he remains deeply      committed to London and his passion for progress.       At the end of his interview, he outlines ways to think      outside the box, drawing several adjacent squares on a sheet      of paper and asking how many are actually there. Pointing out      how several small boxes form several larger ones, he talks      about the importance of expanding one's mind. ``You have to      be open minded, you can't just be closed to what was. It's      exciting. This is the most exciting time in the history of      mankind to be alive,'' he said and puts his pencil down.                          ____________________
