 I have three bills designed to help students better understand the actual cost of college because it is kind of a complicated thing to determine because there is not enough transparency.  Colleges tend to think that having a high tuition is a reflection of quality, which just means that they all have to offer more scholarships. Between that and the complexity of Federal student aid, price shopping for college is very difficult and some people might think impossible. That is why I was glad to learn that one of Iowa's well-respected private colleges, Central College in Pella, IA, has lowered its tuition from $38,600 a year to $18,600 to better reflect the actual cost. Yes, that is right--they reduced their college tuition by $20,000 a year. Maybe Pella Central College will start a trend.                          ____________________
