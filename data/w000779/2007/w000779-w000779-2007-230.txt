President, today I am reintroducing in this new Congress a bill to advance a cause for which I have been fighting for over 10 years now. The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act would extend the current Internet tax moratorium, so that the Internet can remain free from burdensome and discriminatory taxes.  Legislation to keep the Internet free from these taxes has passed the Senate 3 times since 1998 with sunsets that required consecutive extensions. A permanent moratorium on Internet taxation passed through both the Commerce and Finance Committees in the 109th Congress yet failed to get action on the Senate floor.  I come to the Floor again, bringing up Internet Taxation, because the moratorium on Internet Taxation is set to expire on November 1st of this year. In only 11 months, if Congress does not act, the moratorium on Internet Taxation that has allowed the Internet and e-commerce to flourish will cease to protect American consumers and American businesses.  I don't want those who use the Internet to end up like our ancestors: they were told the Spanish-American War telephone tax was ``temporary,'' and that the tax was just needed to pay for the war. That war ended two centuries ago, and Congress is just now getting around to getting rid of the tax!  The last time I checked, the Internet shows no sign of riding off into the sunset, or becoming obsolete. You can bet that once discriminatory taxes are slapped on Internet users, those discriminatory taxes won't be going away any time soon either.  If you want to figure out how much discriminatory taxes could be, just look at your phone bill. Taxes and government fees already add as much as 20 percent in surcharges to consumer's telephone bills.  If you take a gallon of milk to the checkout counter and pay tax on the purchase, the clerk can't turn around and charge you another tax if you're going to use the milk in your cereal and another tax if you're going to put milk in your coffee. But that's what will happen to the Internet if the ban is not made permanent. You'd still pay all the telephone taxes and all the franchise fees on cable, but on top of those you'd pay even more taxes for the same service when you sign on to the Internet!  Discriminatory and double taxation of the Internet has been banned for 8 years now. In all that time no one has ever come forward with evidence to show that the failure to impose discriminatory taxes has hurt them. No one has demonstrated why taxes that cannot be imposed in the offline world should be imposed on identical online transactions.  Western Civilization may not end if the Permanent Internet Freedom Act is not passed, but you have to ask how many times Congress has to revisit, re-litigate and re-approve a law that has been this effective. It is time to make the Internet Tax moratorium permanent.  I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. McCain from Arizona and Mr. Sununu from New Hampshire for introducing this legislation with me today. They both fought tirelessly alongside me and our former colleague, Mr. Allen from Virginia, to get the moratorium extended in 2004. I am pleased that they are now replacing Mr. Allen as my bi-partisan partners on this important piece of legislation. It is my hope that the three of us, working with the rest of our colleagues, can get this all-important piece of legislation passed early this year so we do not have to worry about it as the November 1st deadline fast approaches.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 156       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Permanent Internet Tax      Freedom Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. PERMANENT MORATORIUM ON INTERNET ACCESS TAXES AND                    MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES ON ELECTRONIC                    COMMERCE.       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C.      151 note) is amended by striking ``taxes during the period      beginning November 1, 2003, and ending November 1, 2007:''      and inserting ``taxes:''  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Wyden and Sununu in introducing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007. This bill would ensure that consumers never have to pay a toll when they access the Information Highway. Whether consumers log onto the Internet using cable modem, DSL, dial-up or wireless services, under this bill, they will not be taxed by any State or local governments for their Internet usage.  Keeping Internet access affordable to all Americans is a worthy policy goal. The Internet has become a fixture and core component of modem American life that has created and continues to generate social and economic opportunities throughout the United States.  In 1998, Congress put in place a temporary ban on any State or local taxes on Internet access. Additionally, Congress placed a moratorium on multiple or discriminatory State and local taxes on e-commerce transactions to ensure the growth of online commerce. This moratorium was extended in 2004, but is set to expire November 1, 2007. Our legislation, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007, would make the moratorium permanent.  Today, the U.S. ranks 12th in the world in per capita Internet access, lagging behind competitors South Korea, the United Kingdom and Canada. This is absolutely unacceptable for a country that leads the world in technical innovation, economic development, and international competitiveness. We certainly cannot afford to make Internet access more difficult to obtain if we want to become more internationally competitive.  There is little doubt that the development and growth of the Internet was aided by the tax moratorium. In 1998, the year the moratorium was first enacted, 36 percent of U.S. adults reported using the Internet. In 2006, that number grew to 73 percent, an all time high according to an April 2006 Pew Internet & American Life Project Report. However, the report also found that Americans in the lowest income households are considerably less likely to be online. Just 55 percent of adults living in households with less than $30,000 annual income go online, versus 73 percent of those whose income is between $30,000-$50,000. This ``digital divide'' needs to be closed immediately. Continuing Congress's policy of reducing the cost of Internet access, by preventing the service from being taxed, is one step we can take now to close the ``digital divide.''  As use of the Internet has grown, so has e-commerce. According to the most recent comScore Networks report, Americans spent over $100 billion on Internet purchases during 2006, a major milestone for retailers and the World Wide Web. This legislation would ensure that online transactions are not taxed by cities or States at a rate higher than other sales transactions. Again, the goal of this legislation is to make the Internet affordable to allAmericans and foster the growth of the Internet.  With respect to the question of whether it is wise to make Internet access tax free, Congress has a long history of giving tax incentives to commercial activities that we believe help our society. The Internet is a technology that is a source of and vehicle for significant economic benefits. The proponents of this legislation strongly believe the Internet clearly merits the tax incentives provided by this bill.  I recognize that there are some who wish to continue to make the Internet tax moratorium temporary. Their premise is that the Internet will continue to evolve and thus Internet access may develop into a service the States and localities would wish to tax. I believe that this moratorium should be permanent to continue encouraging those very Internet-related innovations. By making the moratorium permanent, businesses that invest in and provide Internet access will be able to operate in a predictable tax environment. This will result in continued investment in this very important social, political and economic medium.  Congress now has the opportunity to extend permanently the Internet tax moratorium and assure consumers that taxes will not inhibit the offering of affordable Internet access. By supporting this legislation, we can continue to promote Internet usage by Americans as well as encourage innovation relating to this technology. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this pro-consumer, pro-innovation, and pro-technology bill.                                 ______                                       By
