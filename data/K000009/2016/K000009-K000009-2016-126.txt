Chair, I have great respect for Congressman Garamendi. I know how thoughtful he is, and normally I do support his efforts.  I have to say that, in this instance, I think the priority has to be on completing construction of MOX. I think there was a reference made tonight that 67 percent of the construction is already completed. 90 percent of the equipment has been procured. 50 percent of the equipment is onsite. 1,800 people are directly employed. 4,000 American contractors and suppliers are being utilized in 43 States. And MOX is the only proven pathway we have for disposing of the 34 metric tons of U.S. weapons-grade plutonium in a pragmatic way.  I have to say that one of my goals in supporting this effort--having worked now with the Department of Energy on a number of programs, my goodness, it seems never to be able to finish anything. So we talk about Yucca Mountain--the chairman of the subcommittee made significant reference to that--billions of dollars and a hole sits in the ground unused.  Back when Jimmy Carter was President, he had a goal of putting solar panels on the Department of Energy. It didn't happen until recently. I mean, it has been three decades, four decades, before they could even finish something like that.                              {time}  2115  We look at Hanford and the cleanup that is necessary there. I mean, how many more centuries is it going to take? The one thing we can say about MOX, yes, it is treaty required and we are trying to meet our treaty obligations, but it is moving toward completion.  I mean, this is a miracle for the Department of Energy. Perhaps fast reactor might be better. But how do we know it won't cost an equal amount or more? We know South Carolina wants this. The Congressman from the region is here.  If we talk about WIPP, how do we know they even want the material? We have all these problems like Yucca Mountain. We have material we want to bury in the ground, and then the people say in the State that you build the facility: Well, now we don't want it.  So, frankly, of all the subcommittees I have served on or full committee--I have served on a majority of them--I have never seen a department that can't get its act together and get the work done.  So as much as I respect you, Congressman Garamendi, and you are right on so many efforts, I think to stop this project now with more than two-thirds of it constructed and hundreds of contracts let with vendors in 43 States--canceling those would expose our government to major liability and court costs from lawsuits and so forth.  The House bill prioritizes funds for national security to allow the United States to uphold its worthy nonproliferation and disarmament goals, which we share, and focuses on completing the MOX facility at the Savannah River site in the most cost-effective manner that the Department is capable of doing. I really think that we need to get it done. We are close to doing that.  We don't need another disaster sitting out there that is unused or this delay and stop and delay and hesitation and uncertainty and so forth. We need to complete this. We need to take care of the spent plutonium in a very responsible manner.  I share the chairman's perspective on this and continue to hold the author of the amendment--Congressman Garamendi--in the highest regard. I share your desire for nonproliferation. I think one of the best things we can do is get this material processed and leave the world a safer place in our time and generation.  I do oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
