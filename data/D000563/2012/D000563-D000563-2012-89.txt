It is good to have them back in business in Washington. I hope the first order of business this week is to pass a bill that we enacted in July of this year which would protect 98 percent of American families from any increase in income taxes because of the fiscal cliff. I hope both Democrats and Republicans in the House agree these working families don't need a tax increase. Those who should pay an additional amount are those in the highest income categories. That is what President Obama said.  When we voted in the Senate, we said those families making $250,000 or less should have no increase in income tax. I appeal to Speaker Boehner--before he takes another recess in the House--please call this measure and pass it. It will give peace of mind to literally millions of American families who are wondering what is going to happen January 1. These are many families who struggle from paycheck to paycheck. I have several letters.  From Lansing, IL, Linda wrote:       Please vote to keep middle class taxes from rising. $2,000      will help me to keep food on the table and gas in my car. It      could even help me help someone else. Please vote for the      middle class.  I will.  This letter is from Jeremy in Princeville, IL:       I am reaching out to you to ask you to continue to push for      extensions of middle class tax cuts. We are a family of four      making one hundred thousand annually. A two thousand dollar      increase will hurt our family in many ways. Our family is      trying to better ourselves but a $2,000 tax increase will      hurt our bottom line and the chances of enhancing our      children's lives.  Joan from Naperville writes:       Very high earners should pay more in taxes. And as a former      small business owner, I know this will not hurt small      businesses--very, very few of us make over $250,000 a year .      . . I know the gap between the rich and everyone is the      greatest it's been since the Gilded Age. Smart, brave      politicians helped give the middle class a chance--and we      need that from you now.  She wrote that to my office. I support her, and I think she and the President are right. I am waiting for Speaker Boehner to finally break out of this back-and-forth as to whether the wealthy in America should pay a little bit more in taxes. For goodness' sake, that is obvious to everybody in America but the Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, get back to Ohio and ask some of those families about whether middle-income families should pay higher taxes come January 1. The answer is clear: They should not. It is within the power of Speaker Boehner to bring to the floor of the House today a measure that passed the Senate in July that will protect families making $250,000 a year or less.  What I hear from the Speaker is, We won't protect middle-income families until you agree to raise the eligibility age for Medicare.  I have said to all who have asked, I believe in entitlement reform. I believe Medicare going broke in 12 years is a serious challenge to all of us, but I am loathe to see us make a policy change in Medicare in the closing days of this month that we have to live with and cannot explain.  Here is the part we cannot explain: If we increase the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67, what is a person to do who retires at 63 or 64 with a medical condition? Where are they going to go for health insurance, the insurance exchanges created by health care reform? Remember the Republicans and their blood oath to kill that the first chance they got? Is that going to be the only rescue, the only option for a senior waiting for Medicare eligibility? Are the Republicans prepared to say they will now stand behind the insurance exchanges and make sure there is an affordable, accessible health insurance plan that covers seniors until they are Medicare eligible? That is the key question. Until they answer that, I basically think the proposal of raising that Medicare retirement age is one that cannot be supported in good conscience.  Let's get down to business. Let's protect the middle-income families in America. Let's do it now. Let's do it before January 1. Let's make sure they have the confidence of knowing their income taxes are not going up. One person has the power to do it, and that is Speaker John Boehner. If he calls the bill that passed the Senate, as he is being urged to even by Members of his own party, we can give a good holiday gift--if not a gift, at least a holiday reference--to families all across America who are looking for some help not only in this holiday season but beyond.                          ____________________
