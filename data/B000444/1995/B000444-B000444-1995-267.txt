 I will yield in a moment. Let me respond to that. I am glad to hear that, and that is useful. Maybe the Senator from Arizona and Senator Dole would consider, then, taking away a couple of more of what they think are red herrings.  For example, why are we trying to undo all the Superfund site plans that are soon to go into effect? Why do we not take Superfund out of this legislation? It has no part in this legislation. We are told, when we raise that, it is a red herring. I would like him to supply suspenders on that one, too, for me. We have a belt; let us have suspenders.  The next one I would like to consider, and then I will yield the floor completely, a second one is we are told the Dole-Johnston legislation does not in any way overrule existing environmental law. Why do we not just say that? Why not use that exact language, just say it, give us the suspenders along with the belt, because some of us, although maybe we ``doth protest too loudly'' maybe we are a little too cynical, maybe we read things in this legislation that are truly not intended to be there.
