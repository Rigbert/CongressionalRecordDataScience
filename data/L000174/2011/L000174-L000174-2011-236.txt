President, we are on the question of the flooding in Vermont. I was born in Vermont. I have lived there all of my life. We live on a dirt road in a small town, Middlesex, up about 1,000 feet, in an 1850s farmhouse. It means a lot to us. It is a place my wife Marcelle and I spent part of our honeymoon 49 years ago. But I saw something I had never seen before in Vermont. Ten days ago, Vermont bore the full brunt of then-TropicalStorm Irene as it dumped more than 6 inches of rain across the State in just a few hours. You have to understand, in our small State--with the Green Mountains running down the spine of it, north to south--the narrow valleys of the Green Mountains, where towns, roads, and rivers are historically intertwined, were particularly hard hit as gentle rivers and streams became rushing torrents of destruction. Whole towns were cut off from the outside world for days. You would fly over, and you could see a town completely marooned--every road going into it, every bridge going into it gone. Homes, businesses, water systems, and miles of roads were swept away. Even worse, some Vermonters lost their lives in these devastating floods.  In our State, we have had an unprecedented wave of flooding this year. We had two spring events previously declared as major disasters. Vermonters have shouldered these great burdens. We have pulled together from all parts of the State, all walks of life. We are meeting this new crisis with the same courage, cooperation, and resilience we Vermonters have always shown.  I applaud the brave first responders--the police departments, the fire departments, the EMS, and others--the National Guard members who have worked around the clock. Our National Guard in Vermont has been joined by the National Guard from Illinois and Maine, and we have had offers from our other adjoining States. I also applaud the power crews and road crews. I remember how impressed I was looking down there from the helicopter and seeing this long line of power trucks coming down the road and knowing they are going to be working around the clock. I also applaud the many others who have helped in the recovery and rebuilding process--our local Red Cross and other service organizations.  But our small State--it is only 660,000 people--is stretched to the limit right now, and we need both immediate and ongoing assistance in recovering from these enormous setbacks. Winter is fast approaching. In Vermont, snow will be flying in a matter of weeks, certainly in a matter of a couple months. We must move quickly to secure our homes and businesses, restore our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our schools, and our medical facilities. With just weeks to accomplish so much, we need the full and immediate support of FEMA and so many of our Federal agencies.  I appreciate President Obama's swift approval of Governor Shumlin's request to declare most of Vermont a Federal disaster area--something all of us in the Vermont delegation joined him in. But I am greatly concerned FEMA may not have adequate resources to meet the immediate assistance needs of the Irene victims in Vermont and all the other States. We do not consider ourselves an island here. We know a whole lot of other States were badly hurt by Irene. FEMA has less than $600 million in its disaster account for the rest of fiscal year 2011. OMB said today that FEMA needs at least $1.5 billion for recovery assistance in States affected by Hurricane Irene.  We need to act quickly to find a solution to this pressing problem. I do not think any of us wants to get into a situation where we underfund FEMA at this critical juncture, and then have FEMA run out of resources next spring, just as rebuilding efforts get going on the East Coast.  Given the breadth and depth of Irene's destruction, on top of the ongoing disasters already declared in all 50 States, I am going to continue to work with the Democratic leader, the Republican leader, the Appropriations Committee, and all of my colleagues to ensure that FEMA has the resources they need to help all of our citizens at this time of disaster--not just in Vermont but in all of our States.                                  Iraq  Mr. President, as many Members know, I opposed the war in Iraq, believing it had nothing to do with 9/11. It turned out it had nothing to do with 9/11. I thought there were no weapons of mass destruction. It turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is a country that bore no threat to the United States. It did to Iran but not to the United States.  We have spent hundreds of billions, ultimately well over a trillion dollars, in Iraq. Year after year that money is just sent--no offset; it is put on the credit card. It is time to get out of Iraq and start thinking about people in America. It is time to take care of Americans. The needs of Americans are not just in a disaster but in the needs of Americans in their education, their medical care, our scientific research to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer's, to take care of the housing needs of America, to take care of our rivers and bridges. It is time to start worrying about this great country of ours. It is time to start paying for that which can give benefits immediately to Americans and make sure we have enough to care for the families and our returning soldiers who so bravely answered the call. Let's start thinking about the needs of 325 million Americans. Let's come home to the things we need. Because if we do that, we can then still be the force for good throughout the world. We can still fulfill commitments, legitimate commitments we have around the world. We can still be the humanitarian nation we have always been when there have been disasters in Haiti, in Indonesia, in Africa, or elsewhere. But we have neglected America too long.  Mr. President, I understand I have some time.
