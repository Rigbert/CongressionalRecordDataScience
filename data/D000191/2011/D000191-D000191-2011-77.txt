 I appreciate the chairman, and I have worked together with him well and will continue to do that in the future. But we have got to differ on this.  The TSA is not considering requiring criminal terrorist background checks as a requirement for overseas repair stations. I think that is an unbelievable loophole that should send shudders down the spine of anybody who flies planes that are being totally overhauled overseas.  And all this does--it is very simple. It doesn't require anybody from the FAA to do anything. It just says if a repair station is to be certificated by the FAA, the repair station, not the FAA, will have to perform background checks on its mechanics. It is as simple as that. Any mechanic at an airport has to undergo these background checks. They cost $60. How about having the contract repair stations do the same thing?  Do you want a terrorist who is off the airport property to be working on an airplane critical component? Do you want a terrorist who is overseas working under very little supervision, none by the U.S., to have access to the most critical components of a plane?  The gentleman is an expert on aviation, and he knows you can take a critical component--and these are problems we have all the time--like a bolt that holds on an engine. We are trying to keep them out of the supply chain, because you can make one for $3 that looks real but it will break, but a real bolt costs $10,000. So they could easily substitute parts designed to fail in critical components when a plane has had an overhaul overseas.  I urge adoption of this commonsense amendment. Let's not have the al Qaeda Full Employment Act.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed.                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Hirono  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 112-46.
