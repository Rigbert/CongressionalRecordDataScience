 President, I would ask the Senator to yield for just a moment. I know we had some good discussions, and they broke off. I am very happy to continue to work on this. I felt it was important to enter the House bill because of the three very important provisions that I just went over, which are, in essence, the three improvements on the bill, if you will.  I have no problem sitting down now so that we can discuss it. If we could find a way that we can agree, I think that would be just fine. But in the interest of time and because there has been a substantial period of time, I just decided to introduce it. The three issues are Tribal sovereignty, the LGBTQ people, and the gun provisions. Those are the three new House provisions.  I hope that Senator Ernst and I can sit down and discuss it. I would be very happy to do this--sit down and discuss, if she would like.  Thank you.
