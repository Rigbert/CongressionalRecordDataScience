 Few would disagree that Colombia's long term political and economic development resides in its ability to forge a lasting peace, establish the rule of law, and attract foreign investment. No service is done to the nation or the people of Colombia when the Colombian government refuses to recognize the legitimacy of an arbitration award to international businesses. The leadership in Bogota should understand that such action further erodes confidence in the overall investment climate in Colombia within the international business community--and in foreign capitals. It is my hope that the Colombian government takes note of the amendment Senator Leahy and I contemplated offering and initiates corrective action in the very near future.                          ____________________
