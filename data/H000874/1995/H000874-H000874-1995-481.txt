Speaker, this is Tom McDonough. Tom McDonough is not interested in liberal or conservative. Tom McDonough is interested in the problems he has as a family member. Tom McDonough is 66 years of age. Tom McDonough's heart is failing, Tom McDonough lives in Bowie, MD, in my district and he gets $800 on Social Security.  And the Republicans' budget wants to say to Tom McDonough, we are not going to help you pay for the medical care you need. We promised it as a Nation. We made a promise, and we talk about promises kept, but this is a promise broken.  Social Security is going to be cut in 5 years, in 4 years, and in 3 years for Tom McDonough. He does not think that is a promise made and a promise kept.  His Medicare is going to be cut back. Tom McDonough does not think that is a promise made or a promise kept.                          ____________________
