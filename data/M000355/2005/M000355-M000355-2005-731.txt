 President, it is my understanding after discussions with the Senator from Oklahoma, the ranking member of the subcommittee and myself, we have an agreement on voting on the Coburn-Boxer amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 minutes for debate in relation to the Coburn-Boxer amendment No. 1242, with Senator Coburn in control of 20 minutes, Senator Boxer in control of 20 minutes, and 20 minutes under my control; provided further that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.
