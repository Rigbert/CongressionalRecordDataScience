SPECTER. I didn't have to subpoena anybody to understand the underlying basis for this bill. This is my bill. I understood it when I thought it through and when I wrote it. Will I provide the names of those who are to be contributors? I do not have them at my disposal, and I certainly don't have them in my mind. But the staffer from the Senator from Illinois has already seen them and I would be glad to personally take the Senator from Illinois to look at the list.
