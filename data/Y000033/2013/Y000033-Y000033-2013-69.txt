Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of a devoted wife and mother, a respected spiritual and community leader, and most importantly, a great Alaskan. On June 2, 2013, the Alaskan community of St. Paul Island lost one of its most revered elders, Mary Nicolai Bourdukofsky.  ``Aunty'' Mary, as she was affectionately known throughout her community, was a staunch supporter for the continuation and preservation of Aleut culture, language and tradition.  To paraphrase Mary's life in a few sentences would serve only to cheapen it, for her accomplishments were widespread and varied as they were valued. She was an advocate for her Aleut community during years of involuntary internment during World War II, served as a delegate to the Alaska Federation of Natives, and assisted with the development of cultural exhibits at the Alaska Native Heritage Center and for the Smithsonian's Alaska Native Collections. Mary also taught at three universities throughout the state and promoted the importance of cultural education.  Her memory will continue to live on in the hearts and minds of those who had the privilege of knowing her, and the great many that were touched by her tireless efforts and countless deeds. For those who did not, I pray that they too have the opportunity to know someone like Mary, a person whose unrelenting dedication and resolute sense of character cannot be easily duplicated.  Mr. Speaker, today I mourn with Mary's family and community and share my sadness at the loss of one of Alaska's most dedicated daughters. In the words of Thomas Campbell: ``To live in the hearts we leave behind is not to die.''                          ____________________
