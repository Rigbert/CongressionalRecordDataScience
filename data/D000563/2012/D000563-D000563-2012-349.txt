President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 27; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use until later in the day; that the majority leader be recognized; and that the first hour of debate be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the final half.
