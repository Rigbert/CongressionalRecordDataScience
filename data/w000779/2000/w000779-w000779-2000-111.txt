President, many working Americans fell like they've been left on the sidelines in the high-stakes game of international trade. As U.S. companies expand overseas, corporate profits soar. Workers standby watching for some tangible benefits for their own pocketbooks. A May 1999 Los Angeles Times story captured Americans' skepticism toward trade. The story found just over half the public in March 1994 believed that treaties such as NAFTA would create U.S. jobs, with only 32% fearing jobs loss. But by December 1998, the attitudes had flip-flopped. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58% of Americans believed that trade had reduced U.S. jobs and wages.  Nowhere has Americans' growing alienation from the world trading system been more evident than at the November 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial meeting. The nightly news was filled with the pictures of workers protesting the WTO in the streets of Seattle. This sense of alienation will continue to grow unless workers themselves start to see more direct benefits from trade.  The legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Baucus is an effort to narrow America's dividend divide in world trade. Our bill, The Working Families Trade Bonus Act, saysthat when companies win from world trade, workers should win, too. The bill would do this by encouraging companies to give their workers added Trade Bonus stock options--which workers at Fortune magazine's top 100 U.S. companies identified as one of the key reasons they work for the company. And for the millions of working Americans who don't have stock plans--farmers, self-employed and small business people--the bill would allow them to double the maximum allowable annual IRA contribution.  The bill specifically targets workers who are often excluded by company stock option plans--those at the lower end of company pay scales. The Trade Bonus program prohibits a company from discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees and requires that all employees be allowed to purchase the maximum amount of stock allowed by law at the lowest price allowed by law. The program would not allow companies to substitute stock options for regular compensation. Together, these safeguards assure that all workers are included in the trade winner's circle.  Proponents of free trade, like Senator Baucus and myself, have done a lot of talking about its benefits. Manufactured goods are the centerpiece of our nation's export--accounting for nearly two-thirds of total U.S. exports of goods and services. Exports support about one in every five American factory jobs. These jobs pay about 15 percent more on average than non-export-related jobs, require more skills and are less prone to economic downturns than those accounted for fully one-third of our nation's economic growth, and since 1950, international trade flows have grown twice as fast as the economy. Yet, most workers have few good things to say about free trade because they've never seen any direct benefits from it. It's time to turn the rhetoric about free trade into real benefits for workers. It's time to widen the winner's circle to make sure that American workers share directly in the rewards of free trade.  Our legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce to determine annually, beginning with 1998, whether international trade has contributed to an increase in U.S. GDP. This determination would be included in the President's budget for the subsequent fiscal year. For every year in which the Secretary makes a determination that trade has contributed to an increase in the U.S. GDP, employers would be encouraged to contribute additional compensation up to $2,000 per worker per year to employee stock purchase plans. These additional contributions to an employee's stock purchase plan--the Trade Bonus--would not be subject to capital gains tax. For workers who are not eligible for an employee stock purchase plan Trade Bonus, the bill allows them to double the allowable annual amount of their IRA contribution--to a maximum of $4,000.  For employers with 100 or fewer employees that do not have employee stock purchase plans, the bill would give them a significant incentive to create them; the bill offers a one-time tax credit to help offset all the administrative fees directly related to establishing an employee stock purchase plan. It would also provide limited tax credits for three subsequent years for costs directly related to IRS compliance and employee education about the Trade Bonus program. The language of this section is drawn from previous legislation and assures that the tax credit applies only to the actual cost of creating the employee stock purchase plan and not to services that may be related to retirement planning, such as tax preparation, accounting, legal or brokerage services.  The bill sets out guidelines for employers establishing or expanding an employee stock purchase plan under the Trade Bonus program, including that employees be eligible for the maximum amount of $2,000 at the lowest price allowed by law; that employers make the plan available to the widest range of employees without discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees; that employers ensure that the trade bonus is in addition to compensation an employee would normally receive (and that safeguards be in place to do so); and that it does not result in lack of diversification of an employee's assets.  Here's how the Working Families Trade Bonus Act would work. As under current law, employee stock purchase plans offer stock to participants at a discount. The current minimum purchase price is the lesser of 85% of the value of the stock on the date of the grant of the options (usually the beginning of the purchase period) or 85% of the value of the stock when the option is exercised--usually the end of the purchase period. This means that, in the period during which the stock has appreciated, the employee can get the benefit of the appreciation and, in a period during which the stock has depreciated, the employee might still be able to buy employer stock at a discounted price, or, if the plan provides, could decline to purchase the stock.  For example, let's say the President announces in the budget for FY 2001 that international trade contributed to growth in US GDP in 1999. Fleet of Foot Shoes, an athletic shoe manufacturer in Florence, Oregon, decides to award its workers the full $2,000 trade bonus on February 1, 2000. If a share of Fleet of Foot stock is worth $100 on the date of the grant of the option and $200 when the option is exercised, say December 2001, the employees' purchase price can be as low as $85. This means the employee can purchase stock worth $200 for only $85, so the employee is able to purchase more than 40 shares of stock for the price of only 20 shares. Alternatively, if the stock is worth $50 when the option is exercised, the employee is able to purchase stock worth $50 for only $42.50.  Here is how the tax benefit would work. Under current law, employees who hold qualified stock at least two years from the date of grant of the option and one year from the purchase of the stock are entitled to a capital gains tax break until the point they sell the stock. If an employee chooses to sell stock purchased through the Trade Bonus and the purchase price was less than the fair market value on the date the option was granted, then the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value will be taxed as ordinary income in the year the stock is sold. Under my proposal, the remainder of the gain that would otherwise be taxed as a capital gain in the same year would not be taxed. So, using the Trade Bonus, if an employee pays $85 to buy a share of stock whose fair market value is $100, holds onto the share for more than the required two years and then sells it for $150, the $15 discount on the original purchase price would be taxed as ordinary income, but the employee would not pay capital gains tax on the $50 increase in the value of the share of stock.  About one-half of all American adults own stock today, and stocks are now the largest asset families own, exceeding even home equity. Fortune's January 2000 survey found 36 of the 58 publicly held companies on the top 100 list offer options to all employees. According to a 1998 survey of Oregon technology companies, almost two-thirds of Oregon's technology companies offer stock options. In today's tight employment market where companies compete to attract and retain the best employees, stock purchase plans are becoming increasingly common. The National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that seven and a half million Americans work for companies that make stock options available, and that employees own nine percent of total corporate equity in the United States. A recent Federal Reserve study found that one-third of the firms it surveyed offer stock options to employees other than executives.  Our legislation will build upon this trend. The Working Families Trade Bonus Opportunity Act will give workers the chance to share directly in the benefits of free trade. This legislation will help put real money into the pockets of working Americans, and help move stock options out of the corner office and onto the shop floor. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2244       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
