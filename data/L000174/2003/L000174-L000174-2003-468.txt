President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act, a bill to ensure that Federal employees can report fraud, waste, and abuse within their employer Federal agencies without fear of retaliation. I cosponsored this much needed reform in the last Congress and commend the junior Senator from Hawaii for reintroducing it today. Congress must encourage Federal employees with reasonable beliefs about governmental misconduct to report such fraud or abuse, but it must also protect those who blow the whistle rather than leave them vulnerable to reprisals.  Unfortunately, whistleblower protections under current law have been weakened by the Federal circuit, the court that now possesses exclusive appellate jurisdiction over such claims. The Federal circuit has issued a number of rulings that erode whistleblower rights in direct contradiction to the plain language of the law and the congressional intent of established whistleblower protections. The potential chilling effect of these decisions threatens to undermine the fundamental purpose underlying whistleblower laws. The Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act will address this problem by expanding judicial review of such cases to all Federal circuit courts of competent jurisdiction. Jurisdiction will then include the place where the whistleblower lives or where the Government misconduct occurred.  The bill also updates the current law. For example, it clarifies that whistleblower disclosures can come in many forms--such as oral or written, or formal or informal disclosures. It also broadens current law to reflect that reporting occurs in many different areas, such as over policy matters or individual misconduct. The law expands the current list of prohibited personnel actions against a whistleblower in two ways: One, the opening of an investigation of the employee, and two, the revocation of a security clearance. The bill also ensures that appropriate disciplinary actions are taken against managers who negative actions toward employees were motivated in any way by the employee's whistleblowing. More practical reforms are also included, such as making the collecting of attorney's fees available to whistleblowers who prevail in court. In addition, under the bill, consequential damages may be suffered by the employee if they are the result of a prohibited personnel practice.  Whistleblower information is one tool in helping the Government and private sector find ways to prevent future terrorist attacks as well. Though certain safeguards remain for intelligence-related or policy-making functions, the Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act maintains existing whistleblower rights for independently obtained critical infrastructure information without fear of criminal prosecution. These protections are needed to encourage individuals to submit information to the Government about cyberattacks or other threats that might affect the Nation's critical infrastructures.  Whistleblowers have proven to be important catalysts for much needed Government change over the years. From corporate fraud to governmental misconduct to media integrity, the importance of whistleblowers in galvanizing positive change cannot be questioned. I urge my fellow Senators to support this important bill.                          ____________________
