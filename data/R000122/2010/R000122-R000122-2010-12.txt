President, today we have an opportunity to assist literally hundreds of thousands of families across this country who are out of work through no fault of their own, who are battling with the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, who are chasing jobs that have disappeared, and they are looking everywhere to try to find work. We have the opportunity to extend unemployment benefits for an additional year.  In my State of Rhode Island, people are in a very serious situation. They are struggling to stay in their homes, to educate their children, to deal with the challenges of everyday life. Theyhave worked hard and long all of their lives, and now they are finding it difficult to find a job.  In every situation previously in this country, we have come to their assistance. We have done so by extending unemployment benefits. We have never failed to do that as long as the unemployment rate was above 7.2 or 7.4 percent. Today across the country, it is close to 9 percent nationally. In my State of Rhode Island, it is much higher. We have always done it on an emergency basis because it truly is an emergency. We haven't had to offset because we have always determined that it was necessary to get the money to the people who could use it, who needed it desperately, and we should do that again.  I find it difficult to understand how some of my colleagues on the other side would object to an extension of unemployment benefits for a year that are not offset but at the same time insist that we provide tax cuts to the very richest Americans, without paying for them, and insist that we add approximately $700 billion to our deficit by extending tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year--and many making many times that amount--yet for unemployed Americans desperately seeking work and not finding it, they would insist that we not only have to pay for it, but we have delayed and delayed the process of getting them assistance. It is difficult to justify those two positions.  It is also difficult to justify those two positions because what we know is that unemployment compensation benefits give us a much bigger bang for the buck than the extension of tax relief to upper income citizens. The Congressional Budget Office has rated the effectiveness of various techniques to provide assistance and stimulate demand in the economy. They have found that unemployment insurance is far and away the most effective form--much more effective than tax cuts to the wealthy.  CBO estimates that for every dollar of unemployment compensation benefits that we inject into the economy, we get $1.90 of economic activity, which is almost a 2-for-1 payback. So we are in a situation where this is not only the appropriate policy to pursue, but it is the most effective one in order to keep demand and the economy and growth moving forward.  I am someone who believes in fiscal responsibility. That is why I took, in the 1990s, difficult votes in order to balance the budget under President Clinton, to raise not only our output but also to balance the budget and have a surplus in 2000. I opposed the proposal and the tax cuts favored by Republican colleagues in 2000 because I understood that the difficult, hard fought, fiscal responsibility could easily be frittered away because what looked like a surplus in 2000 could be affected by unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or changes in the world economy that we could not contemplate. I knew how difficult it was in the nineties to get our house in order. I was opposed to these tax cuts. I hope everybody else realizes the demographics of the country at that time.  In 1993-1994, we took tough votes to build up a surplus because we knew what was coming. We had a demographic wave--the baby boomers--that would qualify for Medicare and Social Security, and that would, by the nature of the sheer size of that population, put extra demands upon our budget.  Despite all of that, taxes were cut, wars were pursued unpaid for. For the first time in the history of the country, we engaged in major military operations and didn't even make an attempt to pay for them. That is not the definition of fiscal responsibility. Yet many of the same proponents of that policy are urging us today that we cannot do unemployment compensation insurance unless we pay for it. But, of course, let's extend the Bush tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest, and in that case add another $700 billion to our deficit over 10 years. That doesn't seem to make any economic sense.  This proposal is supported by people who are knowledgeable about the way the economy works. In a statement released today, 33 economists, including 5 recipients of the Nobel Prize in economics and 5 former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers, have said:       Continuing the about-to-expire federal emergency      unemployment insurance program, which provides extra weeks of      benefits to the long-term unemployed, is sensible economic      policy that will not only assist the unemployed but help      maintain spending, overall demand, and employment at this      critical point in the recovery. . . . Eliminating these      benefits, on the other hand, will cause hardship for the      long-term unemployed, scale back spending, and weaken the      economy since unemployment benefits are one of the most      effective means available to support overall demand.      Unemployment has remained above 9 percent for 18 months      already and will likely remain high for some time to come,      making a strong case for continuing the current program for      another 12 months. Moreover, the special provisions for      extending unemployment insurance during recessions have      traditionally been financed by short-term fiscal deficits and      this remains a prudent approach. The program will not      contribute significantly to long-term deficits because its      costs will diminish automatically as the economy recovers and      unemployment returns to more normal levels.  Let me say that again in my own words. Our colleagues are suggesting a permanent extension of tax cuts that will cost, over 10 years, $700 billion, and presumably 10 years after that and 10 years after that. That is a huge structural change to our revenue. Unemployment compensation benefits are cyclical. They rise in difficult times, like today, and they fall as the economy recovers. So we are not talking about a long-term commitment to a program of deficit enhancement; we are talking about short-term relief for struggling Americans.  I think these economists make the case extraordinarily well. I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Economic Policy Institute,                                Washington, DC, November 29, 2010.     Hon. Barack Obama,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. John Boehner,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid,      Congressman Boehner, and Senator McConnell: Congress must      decide whether to continue the Emergency Unemployment      Compensation program (EUC), a decision that will directly      affect millions of families and the entire economy.      Authorization for the additional benefits Congress has been      providing since the passage of the American Recovery and      Reinvestment Act in February 2009 expires tomorrow, November      30, and millions of unemployed workers will soon be affected.      I write you out of concern for the jobless, who through no      fault of their own, cannot find work in an economy with only      one job vacancy for every five unemployed workers, and who      depend on EUC to pay their rent or mortgage, pay for      groceries and gas, and pay for their heating bills and other      utilities.       But I write also out of concern for the economy. Together      with Lawrence Katz of Harvard University, I gathered the      signatures of 33 prominent economists on the attached      statement, which warns that letting the Emergency      Unemployment Compensation program expire will weaken the      economy by reducing the spending of the unemployed and      overall consumer demand. All of us agree that EUC should be      extended for another 12 months and that there is no danger      that continuing to provide extended unemployment insurance      benefits will materially raise overall unemployment. We also      agree that deficit financing for EUC is prudent and will not      contribute significantly to long-term deficits.       We hope that you act swiftly to renew these benefits, for      the good of the economy and the well-being of millions of      deserving Americans who depend on them.           Sincerely,                                                  Lawrence Mishel,     President, Economic Policy Institute.                                  ____               Statement From Leading American Economists       Continuing the about-to-expire federal emergency      unemployment insurance program, which provides extra weeks of      benefits to the long-term unemployed, is sensible economic      policy that will not only assist the unemployed but help      maintain spending, overall demand, and employment at this      critical point in the recovery. Given that there remains a      historically high number of unemployed workers per job      opening, there is no danger that continuing to provide      extended unemployment insurance will materially raise overall      unemployment. Eliminating these benefits, on the other hand,      will cause hardship for the long-term unemployed, scale back      spending, and weaken the     economy since unemployment benefits are one of the most      effective means available to support overall demand.      Unemployment has remained above 9.0% for 18 months already      and will likely remain high for some time to come, making a      strong case for continuing the current program for another 12      months. Moreover, the special provisions for extended      unemployment insurance during recessions have traditionally      been financed by short-term fiscal deficits and this remains      a prudent approach. The program will not contribute      significantly to long-term deficits because its costs will      diminish automatically as the economy recovers and      unemployment returns to more normal levels.
