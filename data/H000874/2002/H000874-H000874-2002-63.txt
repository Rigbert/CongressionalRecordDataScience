Chairman, as I told my colleagues, I have an 11-page attachment here from the Office of Personnel Management where Presidents under existing authority, that is not adversely affected, have that ability. No one in this House wants to adversely affect national security.  The point that I am making is that the Office of Personnel Management in direct response to my question cannot cite a single incident. Not one in the history of this country, or at least since we have had collective bargaining for Federal employees where national security was adversely affected.
