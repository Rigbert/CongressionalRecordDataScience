Chairman, I too want to commend the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Boehner), the gentleman from Delaware (Chairman Castle) and the terrific staff for their work as we prepared this bill for the House floor tonight.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this legislation. I have worked with a number of Head Start operations all of my years. I have been impressed with the teachers and the aides; I have been impressed with the administrators, the parents often working as volunteers; and certainly the kids themselves, not only the kids I have seen in the classrooms, but the same kids as I have watched them progress K through 12.  Though tonight there has been a lot of criticism focused on title II of this bill, this is the provision that allows only eight States, only eight States, to establish a pilot program. It is important to note that those States cannot use the money that they receive for these pilot programs for other programs. It has to be dedicated solely to Head Start. They also have to dedicate more of their own State money for these programs. To me, the kids win. They get more money, particularly to see if they can make the program work even better.  As I said earlier, I visited many of these Head Start facilities, and I was concerned as we developed this legislation that under title II perhaps some of those Head Start grantees may have had their funds cut. Well, I did not want to see that happen. I offered a successful amendment in committee to have a hold-harmless provision that prevents any cuts to current grantees that will now be in place for 5 years. So you cannot say that those grantees in fact are going to be cut if that State goes into a pilot program.  By the end of the demonstration period, the 5 years authorization period of this bill, Congress will have an accurate perspective on the effectiveness of whether or not these pilot programs work.  This is a better bill for our kids. Let us see it pass.
