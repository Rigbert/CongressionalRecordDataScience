Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to someone who has spent her career making a difference in the lives of children across Maryland and the National Capital region. I've known Cheryl DeAtley for many years and seen her passion and commitment to early childhood education up close. Cheryl started as a coordinator for Charles County's Judith P. Hoyer Early Child Care and Family Education Center, named in honor of my late wife, who dedicated her career to early childhood education and achievement as well. Since 2007, she has been at the Maryland State Department of Education, overseeing the entire network of Judy Centers, as they are known.  In leading the Judy Centers, Cheryl has presided over a period of rapid expansion. Under her guidance, the number of Judy Centers has more than doubled, growing from twenty-four locations in 2007 to fifty-one today. They serve more than 18,000 children across our state, helping to close the achievement gap for those entering elementary school by ensuring they and their families have access to a range of beneficial services. These include early education, medical and dental screenings, family literacy courses, and early intervention for children with special needs. For parents, adult education takes place on-site as well. Judy Centers are a one-stop-shop for low-income families to prepare their children to enter school ready to learn and grow alongside their peers.  Cheryl DeAtley has been critical to the program's success. Tirelessly, she's written grant proposals, overseen program finances, advocated before state and federal agencies, and publicized the merits of the Judy Centers in support of expanding the full-service, community school model around the country. Particularly, she's been instrumental in creating public-private partnerships, such as with the Baltimore Community Foundation, to sponsor new Judy Centers. Cheryl has made a point of visiting every single Judy Center annually. I've worked closely with her to ensure that Judy Centers and the Maryland children and families they serve have the resources they need. Sadly for the program, Cheryl will be leaving next month to become a Program Manager at the non-profit Center for Children for its Healthy Families Southern Maryland Program, serving Charles and St. Mary's counties. Thankfully, this means Maryland families will continue to benefit from Cheryl's talent and experience.  Earlier in her career, before a stint in the private sector with a company operating after-school programs, Cheryl served for seven years with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). There, she oversaw the GSA's child care program for the entire National Capital Region, supervising a network of twenty-six child care centers serving federal employees. For her last two years at GSA, Cheryl held the position of Child Care Policy Advisor to the Associate Administrator for Child Care, bringing her depth and breadth of experience to the shaping of nation-wide federal child care policies. Cheryl holds a bachelor's degree in Management Studies from the University of Maryland University College and a master's degree in Early Childhood Human Development from the University of Maryland College Park.  I want to thank Cheryl for her outstanding contributions to early childhood education and to furthering the full-service, community school model in Maryland. It's been a real pleasure working with her over the years to enhance the work of the Judy Centers, and I look forward to working with Cheryl in her new capacity to advance the cause of early childhood health and wellness in Maryland's Fifth District. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Cheryl DeAtley on all she has achieved in service to Maryland and wish her well in her next endeavors.                          ____________________
