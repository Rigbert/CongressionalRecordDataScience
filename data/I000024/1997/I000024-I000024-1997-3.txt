President, the amendment that we just agreed to is an amendment that addresses the very competitiveness issue that is facing us right now. It is an amendment to the fast-track legislation. What it does, is to delay the implementation of severe changes in the ambient air standards, until such time as the science justifies it. It does impose a 4-year moratorium. I think it is very significant that this be made a part of this legislation.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
