President, I thank the Senator. She was the person I was thinking of when I said there are exceptions when it comes to the partisan divide between us. I stayed for her presentation because I knew what it was going to be, and I wanted it to be part of the Record.  I think Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell--whom we recognize on our side of the aisle as one of the real leaders on the subject--can show us the way in the Senate to find a bipartisan approach to deal with this challenge.  Thank you.
