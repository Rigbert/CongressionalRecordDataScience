Speaker, last October, the Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, Dennis DeConcini, lead a delegation to Turkey to examine human rights issues in that country. While in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the predominantly Kurdish southeast, delegation members visited the offices of the local Human Rights Association [HRA] branch. The delegation had met with HRA leaders in Ankara and the Helsinki Commission has often worked with the HRA and has found its publications extremely useful and reliable.  While meeting with the Commission delegation, HRA leaders explained how the organization's members operated at great risk to their personal safety. HRA members around the country, but especially in the southeast, face constant danger and persecution. Dozens of activists had been threatened, kidnaped, murdered and disappeared with the collusion of security forces. The Diyarbakir HRA branch was the only office in 10 state of emergency provinces allowed to remain open. HRA leaders believed authorities wanted to use the [[Page E147]] open office to demonstrate their tolerance of human rights organizations. Now, even that Potemkin village has been pulled down by authorities bent on eradicating all criticism of Kurdish polices.  Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, seven leaders of the HRA chapter in Diyarbakir were arrested and charged with disseminating separatist propaganda. Prosecutors are seeking jail sentences of more than 10 years for these activists because of their publication which detailed human rights cases in 1992. One of those now in prison awaiting trail is Neymetullah Gunduz, an attorney who met with members of Chairman DeConcini's delegation and who visited the Helsinki Commission in 1993 while on a USIA grant. Mr. Gunduz is highly regarded and is considered a dedicated human rights lawyer and reliable source of information concerning rights abuses by both the Government and the PKK.  Mr. Speaker, just recently the Government abandoned a similar case brought against a group of well known Turkish activists. The move was widely hailed as a positive development in an otherwise bleak human rights picture. What this new case seems to indicate is that the recent acquittal stands merely as an aberration as opposed to a genuine effort to dismantle restrictions on free expression. I have said it before, and I reemphasize it now, Turkey cannot be considered a truly democratic nation as long as individuals like Neymettulah Gunduz, Mehdi Zana, Halit Gerger, former parliamentarians and other are jailed for exercising their rights to free expression.  Mr. Speaker, a recent commentary in a large Turkish daily purports that the Government has spent five times more money fighting terrorism than on the giant GAP water project supposed to be the cornerstone of development in southeast Turkey. Tens of billions of dollars have been used to institute policies which have left the region more devastated than ever and its population more resentful than ever. Meanwhile, Turkey continues to fact mounting economic and political crises tied directly to failed Kurdish policies. Unless Turkish leaders bit the bullet and seek political approaches to the Kurdish situation, there can be no hope for peace, prosperity or democracy in Turkey. As a friend and ally of Turkey, such a dismal prognosis can bring no happiness to anyone in this country either.                          ____________________
