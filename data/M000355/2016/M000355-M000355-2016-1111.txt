 President, later this morning the Senate will have an opportunity to take decisive action to address our Nation's devastating prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is good legislation that will help tackle this crisis by expanding education and prevention initiatives, improving treatment programs, and bolstering law enforcement efforts. This authorization bill, in conjunction with the $400 million appropriated for opioid-specific programs just a few months ago, can make important strides in combating the growing addiction and overdose problem we have seen in every one of our States.  In Kentucky, what we have seen is some of the highest drug overdose rates in the country, and we know all too well that the work that must be done to overcome this crisis lies before us. Kentuckians also know the positive impact this legislation can have.  Let me remind you of what a top anti-drug official from Northern Kentucky said about CARA. She said this bill ``will address the growing needs of our communities in getting appropriate treatment to those who are suffering . . . [and] allow individuals, families, and communities to heal from this scourge.'' So we will keep working hard to build on these efforts so that fewer Americans ever have to know the heartache of drug addiction and overdose.  I appreciate the work of Senators on both sides of the aisle to advance this bill. On the Democratic side, that includes the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota. On the Republican side, that includes Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire. She cares deeply about this issue and has studied the problem carefully. She has seen the effect it has had on her home State, and she has worked hard to do something about it.  Now, of course, today's vote on CARA would not have been possible at all without the leadership and work of other colleagues. I particularly want to mention Senator Portman from Ohio, who has been involved with this for several years, from the very beginning, in developing this important legislation for our country. He has worked diligently over the past few years as the lead Republican sponsor of this much-needed bill. He has held many meetings and expert conferences to get an even greater understanding of the issue. We appreciate the long hours he has devoted to addressing this national crisis through the legislation we will pass today.  And of course, we thank the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for everything he has done to make this moment possible. He understands the urgency of addressing this epidemic, and we all appreciate the very important role he played in guiding this legislation to passage.  Indeed, this critical legislation to address America's national drug epidemic languished in a previous Senate Judiciary Committee, but then Chairman Grassley came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican majority, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act became a real priority. It passed the committee swiftly, and it will pass the Senate today.  Important legislation to help the victims of modern slavery languished in a previous Senate Judiciary Committee, but then Chairman Grassley came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican majority, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act became a real priority. It passed the committee swiftly, and then it passed the Senate.  The list goes on. Here is the chairman who has worked to give voices to the voiceless. He also has a passion for letting Iowans and the American people be heard. No wonder he is working so hard now to give the people a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court.  The next Supreme Court Justice could dramatically change the direction of the Court and our country for ageneration. It is a change in direction that could have significant implications for the rights we hold dear. That includes our Second Amendment rights and our First Amendment rights, things such as Americans' ability to speak out politically and practice their religion freely.  The American people obviously deserve to have a voice in this matter. It is the fairest and most reasonable approach we could take. During our current national conversation, Americans could make their voices heard on the kind of judicial philosophy they favor.  One view says that judges should be committed to an even-handed interpretation of the law and the Constitution so that every American gets a fair shake. Another view--the so-called empathy standard that President Obama favors--says that judges should, on critical questions, rely on their personal ideology to resolve a case.  I know which view Justice Scalia took. He said that setting aside one's personal views is one of the primary qualifications for a judge. ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.''  The American people will have the chance to make their voices heard in the matter, and that is thanks to a dedicated Senator from Iowa who continues to stand strong for Americans' right to have a say. Chairman Grassley has gotten a lot done under the new majority, just as the Senate has gotten a lot done under the new majority. We will mark another important accomplishment for the American people this morning with the passage of CARA.  Now Senators have a choice. Senators can endlessly debate an issue where the parties don't agree or they can keep working together in areas where we do. I say we should continue doing our work, and the American people should continue making their voices heard. That is good for the country, and that is the best way forward now.                          ____________________
