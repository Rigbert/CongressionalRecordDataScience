President, I bring to the attention of this body the efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan on behalf of the Kosovar refugees. As a member of the world community committed to protecting and promoting human rights, the Republic of China on Taiwan is deeply concerned about the plight of the Kosovars and hopes to contribute to the reconstruction of their war-torn land. To that end, President Lee Tung-hui announced on June 7, 1999 that Taiwan will grant $300 million in an aid package to the Kosovars. The aid package will consist of the following:  1. Emergency support for food, shelters, medical care and education, etc. for Kosovar refugees living in exile in neighboring countries.  2. Short-term accommodations for some of the Kosovar refugees in Taiwan with opportunities for job training to enable them to be better equipped for the restoration of their homeland upon their return.  3. Support for the restoration of Kosovo in coordination with international long-term recovery programs once a peace plan is implemented.  I commend the Republic of China on Taiwan for their commitment to humanitarian assistance for these victims of the war in Yugoslavia. Their aid will contribute to the promotion of the peace plan for Kosovo and will help the refugees return safety to their homes as soon as possible.                          ____________________
