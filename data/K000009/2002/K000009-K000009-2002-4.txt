 So we have to begin to ask the question, why are we losing so many Americans in this way? Why is Washington becoming more barricaded? Why can we not go and ride in front of the White House anymore in our cars? Why are there bomb searches all over this city? Why are American embassies being built like bunkers all around the world? I would like to submit the following.  If we think back to the time when President George Bush, Senior, prior to his election as President was director of the CIA, that was about 1977, the mid-1970s, before President Jimmy Carter became President of the United States, and at the time my colleagues might recall that the Shah of Iran was deposed in the late seventies. I think it was late 1979, and many American hostages were taken, including Terry Anderson.  At the moment that Jimmy Carter's presidency reverted to Ronald Reagan after the election of 1980, the hostages were returned home. President Carter worked very, very hard, as history will record.  Then when the Reagan-Bush administration, the new administration, took over, they essentially made a deal between our country and the Gulf states to go after Ayatollah Khomeini, the new leader in those days of Iran, who had taken our hostages. And who did they hire to do the dirty work for them? They hired none other than Saddam Hussein.  They gave him weapons through the government of the United States, and, indeed, if we look back, and I am trying to find the exact set of hearings right now. In the Committee on Banking of the House of Representatives, a hearing was held regarding the extension of Treasury tax credits, agricultural tax credits to Saddam Hussein in order to buy fertilizers, in quotes, with chemicals from our country at the same time in our country's history when we would not even make those same extensions of credit to our farmers. Companies in Salem, Ohio, and Bedford, Ohio, were being asked by our Treasury to sell those same chemicals to Iraq; and, indeed, it was done.  The Gulf states and the United States were afraid perhaps that the Ayatollah Khomeini at that time might bomb Mecca or try to spread his revolution throughout the Middle East and get control of the oil fields. So Saddam Hussein was promised access, better access from Iraq, which is landlocked, to a waterborne commerce through Kuwait, a slip of land, whichin the end he never did get and, ultimately, he invaded in order to get that access.  Then, of course, if we look back to the early 1990s, the United States went to war to defend the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, but, in fact, the very monster that we helped to create at that point was trying to fulfill what he had been promised as a result of U.S. assistance all through that period, especially when the Reagan and Bush administration took office and then President Bush himself elected in 1988 and taking us into the Gulf War.  It is really important to remember and to ask ourselves the question, who encouraged Saddam Hussein? Who encouraged him to take on Iran? Who encouraged him to try to depose the Ayatollah, and who gave him the weapons and the credits to our Treasury Department to finance those initial actions inside of Iraq that created the monster that the President of the United States, the son of the first George Bush, talked about on the television tonight?  My colleagues might also think about the fact, who armed Osama bin Laden to fight inside Afghanistan against the then Soviet Army? Who did that? Who was President of the United States when that happened? George Bush, Senior, was President of the United States when that happened; and, of course, the Russians went to certain defeat in Afghanistan after a long period of time. Where did al Qaeda learn some of those fighting techniques? Who helped them do that? Where did they get those rifles?  So I just wanted to put that on the Record. I know there are other historians who will add to this, but I also wanted to read from a veteran who wrote an editorial to the New York Times last week Wednesday entitled, Fighting the First Gulf War. The last sentence, and I will end with this, reads, ``I watched the fallout from the burning oil wells coat my uniform and I knew that I was breathing into my lungs the crude oil I was fighting for.'' I ask America to think about it.  I will insert in the Record at this point the articles that I referred to earlier.                [From the New York Times, Oct. 2, 2002]                      Fighting the First Gulf War                         (By Anthony Swofford)       Portland, Ore.--In August 1990 my Marine infantry      Battalion, deployed to Saudi Arabia to defend the country      from invasion by the Iraqi army. Iraqi soldiers had invaded      Kuwait during the early morning of Aug. 2. For more than a      week afterward we sat atop our rucksacks on the parade field      at the Marine base at Twenty Nine Palms, Calif., waiting for      transportation to Riyadh. From where we sat, the world looked      amazingly black and white, with little room or need for      diplomacy or cowardice. We were excited to retaliate against      Saddam Hussein, to enter combat.       When we finally arrived on the tarmac at Riyadh, everything      looked and felt extremely hot, a mirage on high boil, the      heat warping the terrain into a violent storm of sand and      weaponry and thirst. We spent the next six months living and      training in the Arabian Desert, in constant fear of the nerve      gas our commanders had warned us Saddam Hussein would use.      Even when I slept, the gas mask was there, a reminder of the      horrors of sarin gas. To negate the effects of the sarin, we      were ordered to take pyridostigmine bromide pills, now      considered a possible cause of the mysterious gulf war      syndrome. But worse than the pills was the constant ringing      in our ears--``Gas! Gas! Gas!''--the warning call we      practiced at all hours to don and clear our gas masks in less      than 10 seconds. Under a gas attack we'd also have to wear      Mopp suits, 10-pound charcoal-lined garments that were      unwieldy and hot--and were only available in a jungle-     camouflage pattern (not much help hiding in the desert).       On Jan. 16, 1991, the American-led coalition against Iraq      started the bombing campaign that would, over about six      weeks, devastate Iraq's military. Our colonel informed us      that Operation Desert Shield had changed to Storm, that we      were now at war. Two days later the Iraqis launched a few      Scud missiles into Israel and Saudi Arabia. Despite the fact      that my unit operated in the middle of the desert and that      Iraq's air force had been destroyed, and with it most of      Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus, we spent our      evenings jumping in and out of fighting holes for Scud alerts      that turned out to be false. During the air campaign we      traveled around the desert in our Humvees much the way we      had prior to the bombing--bored, tired, dehydrated,      anxious and afraid of what the future might bring.       We wanted to live, even though the way we'd been living was      unpleasant. We hadn't had proper showers in 10 or more weeks.      My friend Troy insisted one morning that I pour a five-gallon      water jug over his head while he scoured his body with Red      Cross soap. The water and soap and filth poured off Troy and      soaked the ground in a large damp circle, and for a moment,      while standing in this circle, I thought that I'd somehow      been made safe. I thought that with our little ring of water      and Troy's simple desire to be clean, we'd created a gap      between ourselves and the rest of the desert and the enemy      lurking there, and that we could sink into the earth, into      our small safe space. But in the distance I saw a Marine tank      battalion roaring across the desert, and I knew again that      safety had ended months before.       On Feb. 18, when my unit moved to the Saudi-Kuwaiti border,      the ground war was imminent. Combat engineers had built a 15-     foot-high earth berm between the two countries. On the other      side of the berm, we were told, were Iraqi antipersonnel      mines. My platoon dug fighting holes in a perimeter around      the command post. Before we completed our task, the Iraqis      attacked with artillery.       The incoming rounds were confusing, frightening and      ineffective. Someone incorrectly called out, ``gas.'' Had the      enemy's forward observer walked his rounds 100 yards north he      would've scored a direct artillery hit on our command post.      But he hadn't. At the border, while we awaited our orders to      fight, helicopters outfitted with tape players and powerful      speakers flew overhead and played 1960's rock music--Jimi      Hendrix, The Doors, the Rolling Stones--all day, to harass      the nearby enemy. As the music blasted, coalition propaganda      pamphlets blew across our side of the border like useless,      retired currency.       A few days later, we entered Kuwait and fought the Iraqi      Army. The tankers experienced the most combat. At one point,      another Marine task force mistook my task force for the      enemy. Those devastating tank round passed over my head and I      watched them explode. For a split second I imagined myself      the victim of my own country's firepower. My team leader      screamed into his radio handset to stop the friendly attack.      One of my platoon mates, a burly Texan, folded himself into a      ball and wept and cursed quietly. I knelt, stung by shock, a      statue of fear. At least 35 of the 148 United States service      members killed during the Persian Gulf war died at the hands      of allied forces.       My six-man night patrol passed near enough to an Iraqi      troop carrier to hear the troops speaking. We were outgunned,      so we listened and didn't shoot. I urinated down my legs and      into my boots. The next morning, in my wet boots and useless      Mopp suit, I marched 20 miles north from the Saudi border. I      put on and took off my gas mask dozens of times for false gas      alerts. We marched past Marine artillery battalions busy      sending their fierce rounds 10,000 yards north. The men      screamed and clapped as each round left their powerful      weapons.       From the ground, I witnessed the savage results of American      air superiority: tanks and troop carriers turned upside down      and ripped inside out; rotten, burned, half-buried bodies      littering the desert like the detritus of years--not weeks--     of combat. The tails of unexploded bombs, buried halfway or      deeper in the earth, served as makeshift headstones and      chilling reminders that at any moment, the whole place could      blow.       On the last day of the war, from a sniper hid I observed a      confused Marine infantry battalion attempt to overtake an      airfield while smoke from burning oil wells hampered command      and control. Across the radio frequency I heard medevac      calls, after two Marines shot each other with rifles; on the      other side of the airfield hundreds of Iraqi soldiers      surrendered, their boots hanging around their necks, white      towels and propaganda surrender pamphlets clutched in their      hands like jewels. I watched the fallout from the burning oil      wells coat my uniform, and I knew that I was breathing into      my lungs the crude oil I was fighting for.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 7, 2002]            Sharon Tells Cabinet To Keep Quiet on U.S. Plans                           (By James Bennet)       Jerusalem, Oct. 6.--Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon,      warned his cabinet ministers today not to talk about American      plans for Iraq, urging them to overcome for the good of the      possible war effort what often seems a national compulsion to      share one's insights as widely as possible.       Prodded by the Bush administration, Mr. Sharon concluded      that it was time to address what one senior Israeli official      today called ``the blabbering thing that occurs here.''       Given the rollicking tumult of Israeli politics, it is not      uncommon to see leaks in the news media about official anger      over leaks, or to read an inside account of one high official      dressing down another for talking too much to reporters. The      Israeli media have been awash recently with officials' views      on Iraq.       The Israeli media have also been reporting that the Bush      administration is furious about the chatter.       ``Everybody wants to voice his opinion on any lively      subject,'' the senior Israeli official said. ``This is      healthy. But there are times when you need to be responsible,      to take responsibility, and to shut up.''       Late last week, Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who      in the past has shared too much for the Bush administration's      taste, ventured that the Americans would attack Iraq at the      end of November. His comment     captured banner head-lines, even though his hasty      clarification said that he was merely voicing a ``personal      assessment'' and that he meant the attack would begin at the      end of November or later.       Mr. Sharon is planning to go to Washington this month, at      President Bush's invitation, to discuss Iraq and the Israeli-     Palestinian conflict.       After today's cabinet meeting, the official public summary      reported tersely, ``Prime Minister Sharon requested that      ministers cease making remarks about Iraq.''       Even as Mr. Bush has sought in recent days to play up the      imminence and potency of the Iraqi threat, some of Israel's      top security officials have played both down.       Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, Israel's chief of staff, was quoted      in the newspaper Maariv today as telling a trade group in a      speech over the weekend, ``I'm not losing any sleep over the      Iraqi threat.'' The reason, he said, was that the military      strength of Israel and Iraq had diverged to so sharply in the      last decade.       Israel's chief of military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon      Farkash, disputed contentions that Iraq was 18 months away      from nuclear capability. In an interview on Saturday with      Israeli television, he said army intelligence had concluded      that Iraq's time frame was more like four years, and he said      Iran's nuclear threat was as great as Iraq's.       General Farkash also said Iraq had grown militarily weaker      since the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and had not deployed any      missiles that could strike Israel.       The torrent of newspaper articles continued today with      Yediot Ahronot elaborating on reports in the United States      about the details of American-Israeli plans for coordination      in the event of war. It said that Mr. Bush would give Mr.      Sharon 72 hours notice and that the two nations had agreed on      targets in Iraq. It also mentioned previously published      reports that the Americans would offer Israel a satellite to      provide early warning of Iraqi missile strikes and that spare      parts and other American equipment would be stored in Israel.       The Bush administration wants to dissuade Israel from      responding should Iraq attack it after an American invasion,      fearing that Israeli action would rally Arab support for the      Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 7, 2002]                      A Hidden Cost of War on Iraq                          (By Shibley Telhami)       Washington.--One of the most appealing thoughts about a      possible war with Iraq is that it could help spread      democracy, transforming a rotten political order in the      Middle East. But more likely, such a war would render the      Middle East more repressive and unstable than it is today.      Democracy cannot be imposed through military force, even if      force is used successfully to oust antidemocratic dictators.      And our vital aims in fighting terrorism, securing oil      supplies and protecting the lives of American soldiers will,      in the context of the Middle East, almost certainly ensure      that the spread of democracy will again take a back seat to      our national priorities.       Aside from the significant challenges in Iraq itself, the      picture in the rest of the region will be troubling.      Regardless of our real objectives, most Arabs and Muslims      will see in the war American imperialism. Governments in the      region may support the war for fear of being on the losing      side, or may simply stay neutral. Because support goes      against the over-whelming sentiment of their citizenry, they      will likely endorse our course through political repression.      If King Abdullah of Jordan, like other rulers in the Middle      East, has to face a choice between supporting the war while      repressing his people and yielding to Jordanian public      opinion by opposing our effort, it's clear what our      preference will be. For that we need not dig deep into      history; our commitment to fighting al Qaeda has      understandably defined our current relationship with      Pakistan in a way that has caused us to put aside      democratic values in order to achieve a more vital goal.      These values will likely be sacrificed in our relationship      with other nations in the Middle East, even with the best      of intentions.       At the same time, we would not be comfortable if democratic      change in the region results in the victory of radical      Islamist groups, as happened in Algeria a decade ago. Nor is      it likely that we would be willing to accept democratically      elected militant Islamist groups to run the Saudi government      and control the world's largest oil reserves as well as the      pulpit of Mecca.       The political order in the Middle East is bankrupt today,      and if stability means the continuation of the status quo,      that would not be appealing. Change is necessary for the good      of the people of the Middle East and for the good of the      world. But not any change, and not through any means. The use      of military force may be necessary for other reasons, but it      is more likely to stifle than to nurture democracy movements      in authoritarian Arab states.       America's political success has undoubtedly been bolstered      by its superior military power. But our military power itself      is a product of a successful economic and political system.      Those around the world who sought change of their political      and economic systems did so in large part on their own--and      in many cases with America's political and economic success      as a model. Those who want to achieve that success will have      to emulate the model. And those who don't will likely fail.       Powerful ideas are willingly accepted because they inspire,      not threaten. Even those who are reluctant to embrace      democracy, like the leaders in Beijing, have understood the      need to emulate much of America's economic approach lest they      be left further behind. And in embracing a new economic      approach, they have also unleashed a political process they      will not be able fully to control.       Ultimately, America's role is to assist in the spread of      democracy and, above all, to inspire. Wars may simultaneously      open up new opportunities for change, as in Afghanistan, and      close others, as in Pakistan. But democracy cannot be      dictated through war, especially when war is opposed by      people of the region. The thought that, because America has      unequaled power, we know what is best for others--even better      than they do themselves--would not be comforting to most      Americans. Certainly, such a notion is not compatible with      the very ideal of democracy we seek to spread.                          ____________________
