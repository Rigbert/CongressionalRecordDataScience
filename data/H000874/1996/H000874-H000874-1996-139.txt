Chairman, let me start by commenting, as I have in the past, that all too often the American public sees on the floor of this House through C-SPAN or through other means the Members fighting in a way that appears that they are not at all conversing or trying to work constructively toward solving the problems that confront this country.  One of the happy instances of my service in the House of Representatives is to serve both as chairman, with the gentleman from Iowa as ranking member, and now as ranking member with the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] as the chairman.  He is a constructive, positive participant in the legislative process. He is a man that tries to make common sense and to serve his constituents and the people of America as best he can. We have from time to time serious disagreements, and the happy news is that we have those disagreements as friends. I would hope that more Americans could see that happening so that they would have more confidence in their elected officials and in the process which sometimes they come to be frustrated with and lose faith in.  Mr. Chairman, I rise because the chairman and I have had a significant disagreement, but in a constructive way. We have just had a colloquy which clearly indicates that the chairman and I are going to be working together to try to bridge those differences, to ensure the proper operations of the offices under our responsibility.  The chairman and I have agreed on the law enforcement components and, very frankly, I think if we had more money, we would in some ways want to further enhance the law enforcement capabilities of the Treasury Department's law enforcement agencies. They do a critically important job, and I congratulate the chairman for his efforts in that regard.  Mr. Chairman, as I raised in my opening statement, and I want to reiterate, I will be opposing this bill, notwithstanding the fact that I expect to work constructively with the chairman as we go to conference and in conference to hopefully bring a bill back to the House that we can both support and feel comfortable with.  Mr. Chairman, I have referred to a number of items, but in closing this debate in opposition to the passage of this bill, let me raise some specific concerns again to remind the Members why I believe this bill does not do what it ought to do.  First of all, I refer again to the letter of the Committee on Ways and means. I refer to the committee's letter because it comes from the Republican chairman, the chairman is of the majority party, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer].  Quite obviously, I want to make sure that folks know that there is a legitimate policy difference here, not simply a political difference. There may be political difference. There may be political differences but there is a genuine policy difference that is being discussed. That policy difference is whether this bill provides sufficient resources to allow the Internal Revenue Service to collect fairly and properly the revenues due under the existing tax system and provide the funds both to reduce the deficit and to fund very critical services.  I see the chairman of the committee on Veterans' Affairs here. He cares deeply, as I do, about making sure that veterans' services, which we owe them and want to give them for their service to the country, are funded properly. If IRS does not collect any moneys, I tell my friend from Arizona [Mr. Stump], he will not nor will I have any money to support those objectives.  Mr. Chairman, I have constructed a chart here to incorporate the letter of June 26, and I want to refer to three of its comments, because again in a bipartisan way, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], the Republican chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, which as all the Members know, oversees the IRS and has the responsibility to make sure IRS is doing the proper thing, as we do on the Committee on Appropriations, but our particular responsibility is to fund those services.  In the letter, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] says this: However, contrary to the assertion in the subcommittee's report that, ``within the funds provided, the IRS should be able to accomplish its mission.''  That was clearly the premise of the subcommittee because the chairman and the staff want to make sure the IRS can do its duties. But there is a significant disagreement. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] says, ``We are very concerned that the funding levels in the subcommittee's mark will seriously impair the IRS's ability to perform its core responsibilities.''  I tell my friends in the majority party, that is not some Democrat that is just an apologist for Government. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] is not known as that. He is a responsible American who is chairman of a committee who says that he is concerned because their core responsibilities are important to all the people of America.  The letter goes on to say, again signed by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Archer and Nancy Johnson, the majority party's Chair of the Oversight Subcommittee, ``We are very concerned that the cuts proposed in funding for IRS Information Systems will seriously endanger the IRS's ability to perform its most important functions.''  Again, they are saying you have not just cut the flesh, not just the muscle, you are down to bone in terms of the appropriate carrying out of the responsibilities. We ``will seriously endanger the IRS's ability to perform its most important functions, the timely processing of tax returns,'' and every American wants their tax return timely processed. Why? Because if they are due a refund, they want it as quickly as possible.  The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], the chairman, is saying, we are putting that at risk in this bill.  He goes on to say, ``And the collection of taxes impose a collateral risk of impairing the IRS's ability to provide efficient customer services to the Nation's taxpayers.''                              {time}  1515  There is not a Member here that wants to, as is the fear of the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], undermine the efficient customer service to the Nation's taxpayers.  Let me refer to one additional item that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] and the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson], as well as the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Gibbons] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Matsui], raise a concern about. We are also very concerned that some of the proposed budget cuts create a very significant risk. Hear me, my friends, hear the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer].  The gentleman from Minnesota raised the issue about the deficit. The gentleman and I agree on that. Listen to what the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], not the Democrats, the gentleman from Texas, who I would think the gentleman from Minnesota agrees is equally, if not more, concerned about the budget deficit than I am. He is certainly equally concerned. We are very concerned that some of the proposed budget cuts create a very significant risk that substantial Federal revenues could be lost, thereby exacerbating the Federal budget deficit problems. That is the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Archer, talking, not the gentleman from Maryland, Steny Hoyer. We have a serious responsibility to be honest with the American public, and we need to stand and say yes, we want to save money. As I have said before, I voted for a balanced budget amendment on two or three or four occasions and believe in it and continue to support it because we need to bring down the deficit.  The good news in America today is that under President Clinton and the previous Congress and this Congress, we have brought the budget deficit down 4 years in a row. If you look at the graph, it is at its lowest point since it was since 1980, 15 years ago, and it is on a downward slope, and it is the first time, Mr. Chairman, that we have brought the deficit down 4 years in a row in this century. In 91 previous years, 92 previous years, we had not accomplished that objective. In 1993, 1994 and 1996, we brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. We are on the right track.  But what does the gentleman from Texas, [Mr. Archer] say? The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] says,and the committee's leadership on both sides of the aisle agrees, we are concerned that the proposed budget cuts create a very significant risk that the budget deficit reduction effort will be undermined. Vote against this bill. Vote for deficit reduction and sound fiscal policies.                          ____________________
