  Former Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith was once known for a nearly unbeatable attendance record. She hadn't missed a single rollcall vote in more than 13 years of service, but that came to an end one day in 1968 when Senator Smith narrowly missed casting her 2,942d consecutive vote. She had been recovering from surgery hundreds of miles away from here. So it was understandable. Yet I am not sure if surgery, a Tsunami or the most wicked Maine nor'easter could stop a woman who occupies Margaret Chase Smith's seat today because not only is the senior Senator from Maine a fierce admirer of her pioneering predecessor, she is also nearly unstoppable once she puts her mind to something, and we have all experienced that.  Since assuming her seat in 1997, one of those somethings that she is so fixated on has been to never miss a single vote. She blew past her idol's record nearly a decade ago. The senior Senator then marched on to 3,000 consecutive votes, 4,000, 5,000, and the next vote will be her 6,000th vote in a row. Only two other Senators have ever achieved a longer unbroken streak. Former Senator Proxmire took 10,252 consecutive votes, and our colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, has voted more than 7,440 times in a row. This means our colleague from Maine hasn't missed a single vote during her entire Senate tenure. She has not had one sick day in more than 18 years. It is really remarkable, and so are the tales of what it took to get here. One time she twisted her ankle as she tore down a corridor, sprinting back to the Capitol from a ready-to-depart plane. Just ask her about the logistics of planning a wedding and honeymoon around the recess calendar.  Our colleague is willing to do just about anything to ensure that she is here in this Chamber representing the people of Maine.  I ask the entire Senate to join me in congratulating her as she celebrates this notable milestone.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
