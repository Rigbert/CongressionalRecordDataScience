President, I will be brief because I believe this amendment is going to be agreed to by a voice vote. I thank all those who are involved in that: Senator Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, as well as Senator Nickles, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and others who have followed this matter.  We clearly need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly on imported oil. We should focus on sources of energy that are clean, free, and literally limitless. One of those sources is wind. Wind power is now creating opportunity for the generation of electricity across the United States. I introduced legislation last year to create a tax credit to help defray the cost of installing a small wind energy system to generate electricity for homes, farms, and businesses. I hope this legislation will ultimately become the law of the land.  Today, with this amendment, we take an important step forward in providing for equal treatment of wind energy used in business and nonbusiness applications. It certainly would apply to our quest to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This is extremely important.  A recent USA Today poll showed 91 percent of the public favors incentives for wind, solar, and fuel cells. We think this amendment is one that will give us an opportunity to use wind power across America, to generate electricity, particularly in applications for farms and ranches and businesses.  This map I have illustrates the areas of the United States where there are wind resources that could generate electricity. I am surprised, in looking at the map, that there is no indication that Washington, DC, is a source of wind, but those who visit Capitol Hill might argue otherwise.  I think if we take a look at this map, though, we can see we have ample opportunities across the United States for a clean, literally limitless, source of electricity.  I urge adoption of my amendment.
