Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the ranking member, Congressman Eliot Engel of New York, for yielding me this time, and also wish to thank the chair, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, obviously Chairman Royce, Congressman Kinzinger, all those who have brought this important resolution to the floor, and I rise in support.  Let me just say that the actions of Russia have truly disappointed any liberty-loving person that exists on the face of the Earth. I think this resolution further undergirds the high regard this Nation places on the value of liberty, and liberty for all; its provisions that deal with increasing sanctions and with added efforts in the energy security arena for Ukraine are extraordinarily important; the focus on additional communications; defensive equipment for the military of Ukraine to defend the interests of that country; and, importantly, cooperation with NATO nations and nonallied NATO nations to develop the kind of international cooperative effort that truly can yield a better Central and Eastern Europe in the decades ahead.  I want to commend the leadership on both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan effort, what the American people are asking us for, aspiring to the highest values that we hold as a nation, and that is liberty for all, liberty for those who live in places where individuals have not had the opportunity to fully flourish because of the totalitarian and repressive regimes that make normal life impossible.  I would urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I thank the leadership for bringing this up in the closing hours of this Congress.
