I want to commend Hank for his long and excellent service, and his improvements to the many bills on which he has worked over the years. In addition to working for other Committees, Hank handled maritime, Coast Guard, coastal and ocean and other issues for the now defunct Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and for the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Committee on Natural Resources, and the Committee on Armed Services. When I chaired the Committee on Natural Resources and, later, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I was glad to have his support and expertise when drafting complex legislation.  As the maritime transportation counsel, Hank helped shepherd through Coast Guard authorization bills, including eight in the last nine Congresses, and a Maritime Administration authorization measure in every National Defense Authorization Act since 1995. His work has left a lasting impression on title 14, Coast Guard, and title 46, Shipping, of theUnited States Code. He also has drafted untold numbers of Jones Act waivers covering every imaginable type vessel, ownership scenario, and vessel history.  On the Natural Resources Committee, I was particularly appreciative of his work on the 1996 update of the National Wildlife Refuge System organic statute during my first term as Chairman. He also worked on the first update of the hydrographic surveying laws in half a century, the Hydrographic reauthorization of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and multiple Coastal Barrier Resources System Act amendments, including the provision that led to the digitization of the Coastal Barrier Resource system maps.  Of course, as the Congressman for All Alaska, I appreciate Hank's work on legislation related to numerous Alaska maritime and terrestrial issues, including the environmental restoration and land transfers on the Pribilof Islands.  Hank is a proud University of Michigan grad, and graduated from Tulane Law School in New Orleans.  Again, I want to thank Hank for his long and excellent service to Congress, and I am sure I am speaking for a long line of current and former Committee chairmen who share those thanks. I wish Hank and his wife, who is also retiring for Federal Service this spring, a long and happy retirement. I hope that will include a trip to Alaska.                          ____________________
