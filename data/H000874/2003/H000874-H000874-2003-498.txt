 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. This is a special and rare occurrence where we would not be starting votes on legislation at 6:30 on a day that we come back into session. There are extenuating circumstances, and we are trying to accommodate our Members. Yes, we hope to stick to 6:30 as much as possible.
