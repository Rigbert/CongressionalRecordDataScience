Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  I fully support H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Relief Act of 2007. Adequate and affordable housing is a basic human right, and today Congress is stepping in again to give our citizens of the gulf coast some help. This bill will provide tax incentives to ensure that adequate and affordable housing is available in the gulf coast region.  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for this bill.
