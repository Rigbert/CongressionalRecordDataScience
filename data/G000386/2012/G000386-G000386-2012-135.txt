 President, I wish to commend my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for offering her substitute amendment to the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill. I am pleased to cosponsor her amendment. This amendment is vitally needed.  The Violence Against Women Act has always been reauthorized in the past on a bipartisan, consensus basis.  It would have been so easy to do so again.  All of us who support the amendment of the Senator from Texas are in agreement with 80 percent of the bill that is before us.  But the majority has decided to place a higher priority on scoring political points than on passing another consensus reauthorization of the law.  Recently, Vice President Biden asked what kind of message it would send to women if VAWA were allowed to expire.  He implied that a crisis would be at hand that must be avoided at all costs.  But the actual answer to his question is clear.  The majority party has already allowed VAWA to expire.  VAWA's reauthorization expired last October.  There has been no crisis of any kind because the appropriations for VAWA programs have kept flowing.  It is the majority, not us, that is responsible for the lapse in VAWA's authorization.  The way that the Judiciary Committee handled reauthorization this time has been very disappointing.  The majority insisted on including--and retaining--provisions that appear designed to provoke partisan opposition.  For instance, the majority insisted on giving Indian tribal courts criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian Americans for the first time in our country's history.  The committee held one hearing on reauthorizing this bill, and it devoted no attention to exploring how this provision would operate.  As a result, the committee described this provision in only four sentences in its report on the legislation.  We all recognize that domestic violence rates in Indian country are too high.  Both the committee-reported bill and the Hutchison-Grassley substitute contain provisions to address the problem.  But the majority cannot explain why expanding the power of tribal courts would be effective or how this would work.  Do the tribes have the resources and expertise and resources to comply with the Constitution?  How would the Federal courts' caseload be affected by all the new habeas petitions that would necessarily be filed if this became law?  What changes would occur in the existing relationships between Federal, State, and tribal law enforcement?  The majority has no idea whether this provision would help matters or not because it simply did not give this issue any careful attention.  Moreover, the Congressional Research Service has raised several constitutional issues that would be posed by this provision as it was reported from the committee.  These include due process, equal protection, fifth amendment grand jury and double jeopardy issues, as well as sixth amendment rights to counsel and a jury trial by one's peers.  At the eleventh hour before floor consideration, the majority has recognized the serious constitutional issues that were raised by the committee language.  It has changed the language in an effort to respond to the constitutional questions it had denied existed.  If we had had a hearing on these questions, matters could have proceeded differently.  These changes do not address the constitutional questions CRS posed about congressional power to recognize the inherent power of tribes to prosecute non-Indians, nor do they affect the inability of a defendant to appeal his conviction.  And, of course, they do not address the practical concerns that I have raised all along.  CRS also raises constitutional due process concerns regarding another section in the bill that would give tribal courts the authority to enforce protective orders. That section remains unchanged.  Ironically, the constitutional concerns about the criminal provisions are made more severe because the majority refused to eliminate language we asked them to omit.  Constitutional problems are made worse because the bill gives tribes criminal jurisdiction as part of their claimed inherent sovereignty.  Our substitute strikes the provisions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the relevant portions of the CRS analysis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the Congressional Research Service, Apr. 13, 2012]                               MEMORANDUM     To: Senate Judiciary Committee.     From: Jane M. Smith, Legislative Attorney, 7 7202.     Subject: State Jurisdiction over Indian country; Public Law          280; S. 1925's Provision for Tribal Court Jurisdiction to          Issue Protection Orders and Due Process.       This memorandum is in response to your request for an      explanation of state jurisdiction over Indian country; an      explanation of how Public Law 280 affects that jurisdiction;      and an analysis of whether the provision in S. 1925, the      Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act (VAWA      Reauthorization), concerning the jurisdiction of tribal      courts to issue protection orders against ``all persons''      comports with the requirements of due process under the      Constitution.                 State Jurisdiction Over Indian Country       In the absence of congressional authorization, state      jurisdiction in Indian country depends on whether the conduct      at issue involves non-Indians or Indians only.                  Civil Jurisdiction Over Non-Indians       Generally, states have civil jurisdiction over non-Indians      in Indian country, unless that jurisdiction is preempted by      federal law or is incompatible with the right of Indian      tribes to govern themselves. In order to determine whether      federal law preempts state jurisdiction over non-Indians,      courts engage in ``a particularized inquiry into the nature      of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an      inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific      context, the exercise of state authority would violate      federal law.''       The courts:       examine[] the language of the relevant federal treaties and      statutes in terms of both the broad policies that underlie      them and the notions of sovereignty that have developed from      historical traditions of tribal independence. This inquiry is      not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state      or tribal sovereignty, but has called for a particularized      inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal      interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether,      in the specific context, the exercise of state authority      would violate federal law.       In order to determine whether state law applies to non-     Indian conduct in Indian country, therefore, courts engage in      a particularized weighing of the federal, tribal, and state      interests at stake.       In Bracker, the Court considered whether the state could      impose motor vehicle license and fuel taxes on the logging      and hauling operations of a non-Indian contractor working for      the tribe exclusively within the reservation. Finding that      federal control over tribal timber was pervasive (``the      Bureau of Indian Affairs exercises literally daily      supervision over the harvesting and management of tribal      timber''), the Court held that the state taxes were preempted      by federal law. Preemption of state law can occur, therefore,      not only when the state law violates federal law, but also      when federal involvement with the activity is pervasive.       There is very little case law on when state jurisdiction      interferes with the right of Indians to govern themselves. In      Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian      Reservation, the Supreme Court rejected the tribes' argument      that because the tribal government generated substantial      revenues from selling cigarettes without state taxes that      imposing the state cigarette tax would infringe on their      right to govern themselves. The Court noted the tribes'      interest in governing themselves was strongest when the      conduct at issue involved tribal members only and determined      that the tribes did not have a legitimate interest in      marketing an exception to state taxation. Because there is so      little case law, it is not clear under what circumstances      application of state law to non-Indians would interfere with      a tribe's ability to govern itself.                 Criminal Jurisdiction Over Non-Indians       Most states only have criminal jurisdiction over non-     Indians committing crimes against other non-Indians in Indian      country. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction      over non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians. The Effect of Public Law 280 on State Jurisdiction Over Indian Country       Public Law 280 gave to certain states criminal jurisdiction      and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indian country.      ``[W]hen a State seeks to enforce a law within an Indian      reservation under the authority of Pub. L. 280, it must be      determined whether the law is criminal in nature, and thus      fully applicable to the reservation . . ., or civil in nature      and applicable only as it may be relevant to private civil      litigation in state court.''       Whether a law is criminal or civil does not depend on      whether the law carries criminal penalties. Rather, a law is      criminal in nature if it prohibits an activity outright, and      it is civil in nature if it allows the activity but regulates      it. Thus, in California v. Cabazon     Band of Mission Indians, the Supreme Court held that even      though California's gaming laws carried criminal penalties,      they were civil in nature because they allowed certain kinds      of gaming, but regulated them. Thus, states that have      criminal jurisdiction over Indian country under Public Law      280 have criminal jurisdiction over all conduct by Indians      and non-Indians which violates a state law that is      prohibitory.  Tribal Court Jurisdiction to Issue Civil Protection Orders Under S.                           1925 and Due Process       Section 905 of S. 1925 provides: ``a court of an Indian      tribe shall have full civil jurisdiction to issue and enforce      protection orders involving any person . . . in matters      arising anywhere in the Indian country of the Indian tribe      (as defined in section 1151) or otherwise within the      authority of the Indian tribe.'' According to the Senate      Report, this section is intended to make clear that tribal      court jurisdiction covers all persons within the tribe's      jurisdiction, including non-Indians.                     The Intent Behind Section 905       Under current law, the general rule is that ``the inherent      sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the      activities of nonmembers of the tribe.'' However, there are      two exceptions to this rule. First ``[a] tribe may regulate,      through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities      of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the      tribe or its members through commercial dealing, contracts,      leases, other arrangements.'' Second, ``[a] tribe may also      retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the      conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation      when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the      political integrity, the economic security, or the health or      welfare of the tribe.''       It appears that section 905 would expand a tribe's civil      authority over non-Indians to enter protective orders.      According to the Senate Report, section 905 is intended to      ensure that the result in Martinez v. Martinez is not      repeated. In Martinez, Mrs. Martinez, an Alaska Native who      was not a member of the Suquamish Tribe, obtained from the      Suquamish tribal court a protection order against her      husband, a non-Indian. The Martinez family lived on non-     Indian fee land located within the tribe's reservation. Mr.      Martinez objected to the court's jurisdiction and sought an      injunction against the tribal court in federal district      court. The district court granted the injunction, finding the      tribal court lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Martinez.       The federal court rejected the tribe's and Mrs. Martinez's      argument that Congress had granted the tribal court      jurisdiction to issue protection orders against non-Indians      in 18 U.S.C. 2265(e). That section, which was in the Violence      Against Women Act (VAWA), provides: ``Tribal court      jurisdiction.--. . . a tribal court shall have full civil      jurisdiction to enforce protection orders . . . in matters      arising within the authority of the tribe.'' The court wrote:       The Court does not construe the provisions of the VAWA as a      grant of jurisdiction to the Suquamish Tribe to enter      domestic violence protection orders as between two non-     members of the Tribe that reside on fee land within the      reservation. There is nothing in this language that      explicitly confers upon the Tribe jurisdiction to regulate      non-tribal member domestic relations. The grant of authority      simply provides jurisdiction ``in matters arising within the      authority of the tribe.''       Tribal jurisdiction over non-members is highly disfavored      and there exists a presumption against tribal jurisdiction.      There must exist ``express authorization'' by federal statute      of tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of non-members. For      there to be an express delegation of jurisdiction over non-     members there must be a ``clear statement'' of express      delegation of jurisdiction.       Section 905, therefore, is apparently intended to provide      such a delegation of authority to tribal courts to issue      protection orders over non-members within the tribes'      reservations or jurisdictions.                 Due Process and Personal Jurisdiction       The Supreme Court has held that due process requires that a      defendant have ``minimum contacts'' with a jurisdiction      ``such that the maintenance of the suit [in the jurisdiction]      does not offend traditional notions of fair play and      substantial justice.'' There may be an issue with section 905      in that it would delegate to tribal courts jurisdiction over      ``all persons,'' regardless of their contacts with the Indian      tribe.       Taking section 905 literally, it does not appear to require      that a person have minimum contacts with the tribe in order      for the tribe to exercise jurisdiction over him or her to      issue protection orders. Under section 905, the outcome of      the Martinez case arguably would have been different: the      tribal court would have had jurisdiction over Martinez, a      non-Indian, even though he appears to lack contacts with the      tribe--he was not married to a member of the tribe, did not      work for the tribe, and lived on non-Indian fee land. There      is an argument that the tribal court's exercise of      jurisdiction over Mr. Martinez would ``offend traditional      notions of fair play and substantial justice,'' because he      may not have minimum connections to the tribe, and thus      violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.       Advocates of tribal jurisdiction would probably argue that      because Mr. Martinez lived within the tribe's reservation he      had sufficient minimum contacts with the tribe. However, Mr.      Martinez lived on non-Indian fee land. Under United States v.      Montana, as a matter of federal common law, tribes generally      do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians on non-Indian fee      land within the reservation, subject to the two exceptions.      Therefore, it appears that residence by a non-Indian on non-     Indian fee land within a tribe's reservation does not connect      the resident to the tribe in a way to support tribal      jurisdiction under the federal common law. It is not clear      whether it would be sufficient to establish minimum contacts      for the purposes of due process.                                  ____        [From the Congressional Research Service, Apr. 18, 2012] Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction over Non-Indians in the Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization and the SAVE Native Women Act   (By Jane M. Smith, Legislative Attorney; Richard M. Thompson II,                          Legislative Attorney)       Domestic and dating violence in Indian country are at      epidemic proportions. However, there is a practical      jurisdictional issue when the violence involves a non-Indian      perpetrator and an Indian victim. Indian tribes only have      criminal jurisdiction over crimes involving Indian      perpetrators within their jurisdictions. Most states only      have jurisdiction over crimes involving a non-Indian      perpetrator and a non-Indian victim within Indian country      located in the state. Although the federal government has      jurisdiction over non-Indian-on-Indian crimes in Indian      country, offenses such as domestic and dating violence tend      to be prosecuted with less frequency than other crimes. This      creates a practical jurisdictional problem.       Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, the Violence      Against Women Reauthorization Act (S. 1925 and H.R. 4271) and      the SAVE Native Women Act (S. 1763 and H.R. 4154), would      recognize and affirm participating tribes' inherent sovereign      authority to exercise special domestic violence jurisdiction      over domestic violence involving non-Indian perpetrators and      Indian victims occurring within the tribe's jurisdiction. It      is not clear whether Congress has authority to restore the      tribes' inherent sovereignty over non-members, or whether      such authority would have to be a delegation of federal      authority.       In a series of cases, the Supreme Court outlined the      contours of tribal criminal jurisdiction. In United States v.      Wheeler, the Court held that tribes have inherent sovereign      authority to try their own members. In Oliphant v. Suquamish      Indian Tribe, the Court held the tribes had lost inherent      sovereignty to try non-Indians. The Court in Duro v. Reina      determined that the tribes had also lost the inherent      authority to try non-member Indians. In response to Duro,      Congress passed an amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act      that recognized the inherent tribal power (not federal      delegated power) to try non-member Indians. The Violence      Against Women Reauthorization and the SAVE Native Women Act,      would apparently abrogate the Oliphant ruling and ``recognize      and affirm the inherent power'' of the tribes to try non-     Indians for domestic violence offenses.       The Supreme Court stated in United States v. Lara that      Congress has authority to relax the restrictions on a tribe's      inherent sovereignty to allow it to exercise inherent      authority to try non-member Indians. However, because of      changes on the Court and, as Justice Thomas stated, the      ``schizophrenic'' nature of Indian policy and the confused      state of Indian law, it is not clear that today's Supreme      Court would hold that Congress has authority to expand the      tribes' inherent sovereignty. It may be that Congress can      only delegate federal power to the tribes to try non-Indians.       The dichotomy between delegated and inherent power of      tribes has important constitutional implications. If Congress      is deemed to delegate its own power to the tribes to      prosecute crimes, all the protections accorded criminal      defendants in the Bill of Rights will apply. If, on the other      hand, Congress is permitted to recognize the tribes' inherent      sovereignty, the Constitution will not apply. Instead,      criminal defendants must rely on statutory protections under      the Indian Civil Rights Act. Although the protections found      in these statutory and constitutional sources are similar,      there are several important distinctions between them. Most      importantly, if inherent sovereignty is recognized and only      statutory protections are triggered, defendants may be      subjected to double jeopardy for the same act; may have no      right to counsel in misdemeanor cases if they cannot afford      one; may have no right to prosecution by a grand jury      indictment; may not have access to a representative jury of      their peers; and may have limited federal appellate review of      their cases.
