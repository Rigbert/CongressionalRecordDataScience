 President, I ask my colleagues not to give consent to cloture at this time because there are a lot of matters in this bill that ought not be in here. We have matters in here for trial attorneys, and we have matters in here for Davis-Bacon.  We are talking about solving a housing crisis. This is not the way to do it. We ought to give more consideration to it, and not granting cloture is one way of giving greater consideration to what we are going to do.                             cloture motion
