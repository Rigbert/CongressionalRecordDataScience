Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Joint Resolution 134, legislation to ensure that veterans, dependents, and survivors will continue to receive their well-earned benefits during this Government shutdown.  I would like to recognize the dedicated efforts of Tim Hutchinson, who has been a tireless advocate for veterans and has introduced legislation to ensure that veterans receive the compensation they deserve even when the Government is closed. I would also like to thank Chairman Stump and Ranking Member Montgomery for their tireless work on behalf of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation should never have been necessary. This week, the President had an opportunity to sign the VA-HUD appropriations bill, which would have secured the funding for veterans benefits. Instead, he vetoed it. President Clinton also has the unilateral authority to order the delivery of veterans' benefits during a Government shutdown. But he has not used it. Because of the administration's insistence on playing partisan politics with veterans, the livelihood of 3.3 million veterans, dependents and survivors is in jeopardy.  No one in this country has a greater claim to his Nation's Treasury than veterans who have been disabled as a result of service in the Armed Forces and the survivors of those who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in the defense of our Nation. Keeping faith with these heroes, their widows and their orpahns--whatever our Nation's fiscal circumstance--is as important as anything we do in Congress.  We must do what we can to guarantee that these brave men and women, who answered the call to duty and were willing to put their lives on the line in defense of their country, will receive what they deserve. This bill does that.  Our veterans deserve better than to be sacrificed at the altar of partisan politics. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, which will put veterans ahead of politics.
