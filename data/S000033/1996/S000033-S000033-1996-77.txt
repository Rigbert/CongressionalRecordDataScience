 Speaker, the great crisis facing this country today is the decline in real wages for American workers and the proliferation of low-wage jobs. We have millions and millions of workers today who are trying to survive on $4.25 an hour, $5 an hour. They are not making it. Raising the minimum wage is long overdue, and we must do it today.  The situation is so bad and the Federal Government has so much failed to stand up to its responsibility that 10 States in this country on their own, including the State of Vermont, have raised the minimum wage. Now, if the minimum wage is so bad, tell the Republican Governor of New Jersey, who supports their increase in the minimum wage, to roll it back. She will not do it because she knows, as every other Governor knows, that it is vital to raise the minimum wage today.  Lastly, it is incomprehensible to me that I am hearing people talk about abolishing the minimum wage. They really want to see workers in America earning a dollar an hour, $2 an hour, competing against the workers in China who make 20 cents an hour. That is not the future of America.
