Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Gary Community Mental Health Center, Inc. [GCMHC] on its Fall Fantasy Fundraiser. In particular, I would like to commend Danita Johnson Hughes, GCMHC's chief executive officer, on this special occasion. The fundraiser will be held at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, IN, on Sunday, October 26, 1997. All proceeds from the Fall Fantasy Fundraiser will be used to benefit the organization's new children's emergency shelter, the ALPHA Center, which has been in operation since September 3, 1997.  The GCMHC has continued to extend its commitment to serving the northwest Indiana community with the establishment of the ALPHA Center, which is an acronym for ``All of Life's Problems Have Answers.'' The center operates as an emergency shelter for children between the ages of 6 and 17, who have been removed from their homes due to neglect and/or physical and emotional abuse. Referrals to the program come from the courts and the Department of Family and Children Services, which determine how to best continue the care these children need and deserve. The ALPHA Center provides transitional and reintegration programs, such as individual and family therapy, tutoring, substance abuse counseling, therapeutic recreation, and after care services. Prominent in all facts of the center's operations is genuine compassion and concern for the children it serves.  The GCMHC was founded in 1974 as a nonprofit organization with the goal and vision of providing effective lifestyle intervention and treatment programs for individuals, couples, families, and children. The organization seeks to serve the community by offering quality behavioral health care services, administered by an experienced staff of physicians, psychiatrists, therapists, case managers, and office support personnel. Several GCMHC programs are specially designed to address the needs of young people in the community. The center's Placement Diversion Program, for instance, works to prevent unnecessary placement of children into residential psychiatric programs, while working to strengthen the relationship between family members. In conjunction with the Gary school system, the center also strives to address the needs of school-age children with behavioral difficulties through its Act Program. The GCMHC also offers substance abuse counseling to both adolescents and adults.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in congratulating the Gary Community Mental Health Center on the occasion of its Fall Fantasy Fundraiser and the recent establishment of the ALPHA Center. I wish the GCMHC continued success in all of its endeavors, as the services this distinguished organization has provided over the years have been invaluable to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
