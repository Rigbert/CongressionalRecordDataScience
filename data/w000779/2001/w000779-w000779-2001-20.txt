President, I urge our colleagues to work with public health programs in their communities. I certainly intend to do that in Oregon, at home, during this high-risk season. I think it is possible to get clearer, more understandable messages out to the public about this program. I do think there needs to be a better system in place for making sure that high-risk persons, particularly older people, get these vaccines. I think we also need to take steps to make sure there are backup plans if there are problems with a manufacturer, both this winter and in the future.  Secretary Thompson has worked with us in a constructive way. Progress has been made. I certainly do not think there is a need for people to go out and panic. But I think there are steps that do still need to be taken so we do not have frustrated older people, health care providers, and others who want to take steps to protect their health and that of the American people.  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.
