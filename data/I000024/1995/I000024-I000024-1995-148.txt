One is by James Woolsey concerning what is out there today. ``We can confirm that the North Koreans are developing two additional missiles with ranges greater than 1,000 kilometers that it flew last year. These new missiles could put at risk all of Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific area. And if we export, the Middle East could threaten Europe as well.'' Then further John Deutch says, ``If the North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''  So it is a two-part question. First of all, do you believe this? And, second, and most significantly, Mr. President, what if the Senator is wrong?
