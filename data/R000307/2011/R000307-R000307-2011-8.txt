Before the Senator from Florida leaves, let me say, from the banks of the Indian River to the prairies of Kansas and Dodge City, I know many people do not quite grasp the fact that there are a lot of cowboys in Florida. Obviously we have a lot of cowboys in Dodge City. From the wheat we want to export to Colombia, despite their trade agreementswith other countries, and you want to export citrus, beef--the same kind of thing--it just shows you from Kansas to Florida, we have similar interests. I thank the Senator for his comments and for his comments yesterday in the markup in the Finance Committee, and for his support. A lot of my remarks will be duplicative of his. That shows you, in regard to Florida and Kansas, we have a very strong mutual interest.
