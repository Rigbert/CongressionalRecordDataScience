Indeed, African Americans have contributed a great deal to my State, and I am honored to be able to acknowledge two such individuals today, the late Reverend Mahlon Van Horne of Newport, and the late John Hope of Brown University.  Reverend Van Horne was one of Newport's most prominent African Americans in the late 1800's. He was an avid civil rights activist, a three term State representative, and was also one of the Nations first black diplomats. Reverend Van Horne came to Newport, RI, in 1868 after being ordained, and graduating from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. He began his ministry in Rhode Island as the Acting Pastor of the Colored Union Congregational Church of Newport. Despite the times in which he lived, due to his charismatic leadership and scholarly sermons, his congregation was made up of both black and white Rhode Islanders, and the many black professionals from New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia who would come to Newport during the summer months. By 1871, his congregation had grown to the point where they had to tear down the old church to make way for a larger building which was renamed the Union Congregational Church. Despite his success as a minister, Reverend Van Horne did not stop there, in 1871 he was able to successfully draw votes from both blacks and whites to win election to the Newport School Committee, the first African American ever to serve in this capacity. As a member of the school committee, he used his position to continue his civil rights movement and pressed for integration and better education for Newport's black children. In 1885, he was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly, becoming the first African American to ever serve in the State legislature. He was re-elected in 1886, and 1887, and after his last term he continued in his role as pastor of the Union Congregational Church. His service did not end there. In 1896, President William McKinley appointed Reverend Van Horne as the United States Counsel to the Danish West Indies, in where he served his Nation honorably for 12 more years.  Another great Rhode Islander that I would like to bring attention to was a champion of education; John Hope. Mr. Hope first came to Rhode Island in 1890 when he enrolled as a freshmen at Brown. While in school he became very involved in the African-American community, and later joined the Second Free Will Baptist Church in Providence. While a member of the Church, he started a literary club with the help of other prominent African Americans in the community. In honor of his work in Providence, in 1944, the community center on Burgess street was renamed the John Hope Settlement House and continues to be a vital resource for many of the residents of Providence today. In addition to his community involvement and dedication to the education of blacks in Providence, John Hope was a founding editorial board member of the Daily Herald and a campus correspondent for the New York Tribune, and wrote many articles for the Providence Journal and the Chicago Tribune. After his graduation from Brown, John Hope continued his mission of improving educational opportunities for blacks by taking a position teaching Greek and Latin at theRoger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee an all black institution. From there, he moved on to become the President of one of the most prestigious historically black institutions of higher education Morehouse College, from 1906 to 1929. He culminated his career in education as the President of Atlanta University, which was the only black graduate school in the Nation at the time, where he served until his death in 1936. John Hope's vision that education is the key to improving the quality of life for not only African Americans, but for all Americans, is one I share.  It is truly my honor and privilege to acknowledge such great Rhode Islander's during Black History Month, and it is my hope that these and other African American leaders from both past and present will continue to inspire our Nation's youth.                          ____________________
