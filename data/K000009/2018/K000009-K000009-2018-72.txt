Chairman, I just wanted to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for yielding and for the incredible work she does representing the Gulf region in its fullness.  I understand, through her and through my own studies, the damage done by Hurricane Harvey and the need for studies such as these to advance flood control projects to mitigate future damage. I think she has been such an articulate spokeswoman, reminding us that times are changing and we have to pay attention to coastal communities.  I have to also mention that there are funds in the supplemental bill we passed earlier this year for purposes such as these, and we have plussed up the Army Corps budget in this particular bill. So I think that will serve Texas very well.  And the gentlewoman mentioned the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. We are all deeply concerned.  So I thank my colleague for offering this amendment. I thank her for her great leadership and urge all of our colleagues to support her amendment.
