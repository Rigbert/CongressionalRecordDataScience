Speaker, I submit the following article to be included in the Record:              [From The Halifax Daily News, Feb. 11, 2003]The Wrong Question: It's Not Whether Saddam Has Chemical Weapons, It's                          Whether He'll Use Them                            (By Gwynne Dyer)       U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell did a good job at the      United Nations last week of laying out the evidence that      Saddam Hussein has kept some of the chemical and biological      weapons that he had before the Gulf War of 1990-91, and maybe      even made more since then. If you doubted it before, you      shouldn't doubt it any more. But it was the right answer to      the wrong question.       Saddam should be forced to comply with his obligations and      destroy all those weapons, but if you are planning to launch      a war next month that will probably snuff out tens of      thousands of lives, you have to answer a different question.      Is there a big enough risk that Saddam will use those weapons      himself in the near future, or give them to terrorists to      use, to justify pulling the inspectors out and killing all      those people now? No, there is not. Saddam Hussein has had      these weapons for at least 20 years, and he hasn't given them      to anyone in all that time,. And why would terrorists need to      get these weapons from Iraq anyway, when they could just      steal their poison gas from the huge, poorly guarded stocks      in Russia (secured, in some cases, with bicycle padlocks)--or      mix them up in the kitchen sink like the Aum Shinrikyo cult      did for its attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995?       Besides, Saddam Hussein is no friend of al-Qaida. He is the      kind of Arab leader the Islamists hate most: a secular,      westernizing socialist who liberates women and makes deals      with the West. Osama bin Laden says he is an ``infidel'' and      has been calling for his overthrow for years.       Saddam is a thoroughly nasty dictator, but he is neither      mad nor expansionist. In fact, if you were looking for a      European parallel to Saddam Hussein's regime, it would be      something like Nicolae Ceasescu's long reign in Communist      Romania--except that Ceasescu, safely contained within the      Soviet bloc, never had a war with his neighbours.       Saddam Hussein, who is 66 this year, comes from the Arab      generation that believed in modernization through      revolutionary socialism on the Eastern European model. During      the 1970s he behaved like a classic Communist leader,      eliminating his rivals but taking the task of raising      people's living standards quite seriously. With abundant oil      revenues available, he built an Iraq where most people had      decent jobs, the children were all in school, and women were      freer than anywhere else in the Arab world. Then came the war      with Iran, and everything went wrong.       Saddam always dreamed of becoming the hero-leader of the      Arab world on the model of Egypt's Gamal Abdul Nasser, which      is why he had a nuclear weapons program. (The first Arab      leader to acquire a deterrent against Israel's nuclear      monopoly automatically becomes an Arab hero.) He never showed      any desire to conquer his neighbors, but Iraq did have      territorial disputes with Iran and Kuwait, both dating back      to before he was born--and he did not manage them well.       He signed a treaty with Iran in 1975 settling the dispute      over the Iraq-Iran border, but it unravelled after the Shah      was overthrown in 1978, and the new Islamic government of      Ayatollah Khomeini began inciting the majority of Iraqi Arabs      who share Iran's Shia religious heritage to throw off      Saddam's godless socialist rule. In the great blunder of his      life, Saddam went to war with Iran in 1980. Iranians      outnumber Iraqis three-to-one, and without huge amounts of      U.S. aid and those chemical weapons we keep hearing about      (which the Reagan administration knew all about), he would      not have survived.       Iraq emerged from that war in 1988 with hundreds of      thousands dead, the welfare state in ruins--and $60 billion      in debt to its Gulf Arab neighbours. Saddam asked them to      cancel the debt, since Iraq's sacrifices had ``saved'' them      from revolutionary Iran. When they refused, he invaded Kuwait      (which all the rulers of independent Iraqi have claimed as      part of Iraq) in August 1990. He thought he had cleared this      with his American allies, but neither party understood what      the other was saying in his famous conversation with the U.S.      ambassador in Baghdad.       When Saddam Hussein contacted U.S. President George W. Bush      four days after the invasion and offered the U.S. unlimited      Kuwaiti oil at one-third of world market price in return for      a deal on Kuwaiti sovereignty, Bush Senior coldly ordered him      out of Kuwait. He refused, the Gulf War followed, and he has      been under UN sanctions ever since, clinging to power in the      ruins of the country he once raised to prosperity. He has      been a disaster for Iraq, but he is not the new Hitler. He is      not even a visceral anti-American, though U.S.-Iraqi      relations have been bitterly hostile since 1990,       So, the right questions are: is Saddam likely to give      chemical or biological weapons to the Islamist terrorists he      loathes this month or next, when he has not done so in the      past 20 years? If not, why do we need a war with Iraq now      that will kill a great many people with old-fashioned high      explosives?                          ____________________
