 President, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act will throw perhaps up to 30 million people off of health insurance.  I would yield to my friends if they will tell me now what the replacement is. How many of those 30 million people are going to die? What is your plan to cover them, plus the other 28 million people who have no health insurance? How are you going to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people?  They don't have a plan. I understand Senator Corker wants more time. Maybe they will develop a plan. Right now what they are talking about is repealing legislation which has brought millions of people health care, and they have no substitute.  I would urge the defeat of the Barrasso amendment.  Madam President, I raise a point of order on Barrasso amendment No. 181, that the pending amendment is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
