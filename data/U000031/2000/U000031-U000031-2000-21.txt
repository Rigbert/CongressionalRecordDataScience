Speaker, earlier this year I sat in this Chamber with many of my colleagues listening to a very long State of the Union speech. It was long for a lot of reasons, but one of them was that there were a lot of applause lines. Many Republicans and Democrats, in fact, stood during one of those, as I did, when the President talked about ending the marriage penalty tax.  This is a bipartisan bill. It was a bipartisan bill in both the House and the Senate. It is not one side trying to jab the other. This is not a tax cut for the rich. It does not help any special interests except for working couples.  What is wrong with that?  Many of these couples, in fact, are struggling to try to make ends meet. They are living from paycheck to paycheck to paycheck.  We need to override this veto. We need to override this veto for American families in all 50 States. I hope that my colleagues would join me in voting to override that veto later this morning.
