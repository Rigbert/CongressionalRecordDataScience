President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Larry Craig and Senator Patty Murray in introducing the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2006--or FRIMA. Our legislation extends a homegrown, commonsense program that has a proven track record in helping restore Northwestern salmon runs. Dollar-for-dollar, the fish screening and fish passage facilities funded by our legislation are among the most cost-effective uses of public and private restoration dollars. These projects protect fish while producing significant benefits. That is why it is important that this program be reauthorized and funding be appropriated now.  Since 2001, when the original Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000, FRIMA, was enacted, more than $9 million in Federal funds has leveraged nearly $20 million in private, local funding. This money has been used to protect, enhance, and restore more than 550 river miles of important fish habitat and species throughout Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. For decades, State, tribal and Federal fishery agencies in the Pacific Northwest have identified the screening of irrigation and other water diversions, and improved fish passage, as critically important for the survival of salmon and other fish populations.  This program is very popular and has the support of a wide range of constituents, including community leaders, environmental organizations, and agricultural producers. Senator Smith and I are proud of the successful collaborative projects that irrigators and members of the Oregon Water Resources Congress have completed while putting this program to work in our home State. Our program also has the support of Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, irrigators throughout the Northwestern States, Oregon Trout, American Rivers and the National Audubon Society.  FRIMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to plan, design, and construct fish screens, fish passage devices, and related features. It also authorizes inventories to provide the information needed for planning and making decisions about the survival and propagation of all Northwestern fish species. The program is currently carried out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on behalf of the Interior Secretary.  FRIMA provides benefits by: keeping fish out of places where they should not be--such as in an irrigation system; easing upstream and downstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival, and restoration of native fish species; helping avoid new endangered species listings by protecting and enhancing the fish populations not yet listed; making progress toward the de-listing of listed species; utilizing a positive, win/win, public-private partnership; and, assisting in achieving both sustainable agriculture and fisheries. Since FRIMA's enactment in 2001, 103 projects have been installed. This is a true partnership and fine example of how our fisheries and farmers can work together to protect fish species throughout the Northwest.  While he was Governor of Idaho, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said, ``. . . the FRIMA program serves as an excellent example of government and private land owners working together to promote conservation. The screening of irrigation diversions plays a key role in Idaho's efforts to restore salmon populations while protecting rural economies.'' [from ``Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Programs, FY 2002-2004'', U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C., July, 2005, p. 13]  The bill that we are introducing today specifically extends the authorization for this program through 2012; gives priority to projects costing less than $2.5 million--a reduction in a targeted project's cost from $5,000,000 to $2,500,000; clarifies that projects funded under the act are viewed as recipients of a ``pass through program'' and not a ``grant'' program; that any Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, funds provided either directly or through a grant to another entity shall be considered non-Federal matching funds--because BPA's funding comes from ratepayers; requires an inventory report describing funded projects and their benefits; and changes the administrative expenses formula used by the Fish & Wildlife Service and the States of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, so that administrative costs are scaled in proportion to the amount of funds appropriated for the program each year.  Ultimately, it will take the combined efforts of all interests in our region to recover our salmon. State, Tribal and local governments, local watershed councils, private landowners and the Federal Government need to continue working together. Initiatives such as the bill I am introducing today help to sustain the partnerships upon which successful salmon recovery will be based.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation pass.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support from Oregon Governor Kulongoski be printed in the Record.

There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 12, 2006.     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources          Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Domenici and Bingaman: I write in support of      the re-authorization of the Fisheries Restoration and      Irrigation Mitigation Act (FRIMA). In addition, I support the      funding 1evel originally authorized by Congress of $25      million per year.       The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act is      one of the most successful cost share programs in the Pacific      Northwest, funding the installation of fish screens and      ladders at irrigation diversions in Idaho, Montana, Oregon      and Washington. Conservationists support it because it saves      wild, migrating Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed fish such      as Steelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon, as well as those      produced in state and federal hatcheries. Irrigated      agriculture supports the program both for its conservation      effects and because it helps protect operators from possible      federal enforcement actions resulting from take of ESA fish.       It is widely accepted that correcting fish barrier,      diversion and screen problems is a very cost-effective      investment. Each federal FRIMA dollar has been matched by      $1.37 in state or local dollars. Participants have      contributed a total of 58 percent toward the cost share--     exceeding the legal requirement of 35 percent--and also pay      100 percent of project operation and maintenance costs. The      FRIMA projects are completed quickly because existing state      fish screening and passage programs are used to implement      projects.       The program, which I have summarized for you in the      enclosed fact sheet, has resulted in fish-friendly irrigation      projects as well as increased spawning and rearing habitat.      Since FRIMA's introduction in 2000, 103 projects have been      installed, providing fish access to 553 miles of habitat      upstream and screening a total volume of water at 1,572,757      gallons per minute. Healthy fish populations produce      commercial and recreational fishing opportunities, which are      essential to our coastal economies and rural communities that      have often lost other industries in recent years.       Due to its popularity and success, there is a backlog of      hundreds of potential FRIMA projects. To date, appropriations      have averaged only $3 million per year, or $750,000 per      state, per year. This amount has jump-started the process,      but is inadequate given the magnitude of the available      projects and the fish benefits they are designed to provide.       I urge you to increase funding to $25 million per year--the      level originally authorized by Congress--so we can continue      increasing fish populations, assisting irrigators in      installing fish protection devices and bolstering local      economies.           Sincerely,                                           Theodore R. Kulongoski,     Governor.                                  ____                                 FRIMA       Re-authorization Fact Sheet       Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act 2000      (P.L. 106-502).       FRIMA is a highly popular and cost-effective voluntary fish      screening and passage partnership program that benefits      Idaho, western Montana, Oregon and Washington.       Why do fish need protection at water diversions?       Water diversions redirect water from streams and rivers so      it can be used for crop irrigation, power, drinking water,      and other beneficial purposes. Water diversions also block      the normal migration of fish and pull fish into pumps,      irrigation canals, and fields greatly reducing their      survival.       Benefits of fish protection 98% of young salmon survive an      encounter with a properly designed fish screen that meets      accepted state and federal criteria. Fish protection devices      benefit by: Keeping fish out of places where they should not      be (like an irrigation system); providing safe upstream and      downstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival,      and restoration of native fish species; achieving both      sustainable agriculture and sustainable fisheries.       How the program works       FRIMA is a 65%/35% cost share program requiring that grant      recipients contribute at least 35% in non-federal matching      funds. Projects must: Be associated with an irrigation, or      other water diversion; benefits fish species native to the      project area; have a local, state, tribal or federal      government sponsor or co-applicant.       Successful cost share 2000-2005: 83 fish screens installed,      screening 1,572,757 gallons of water per minute; 20 fishways      installed, opening 553 miles of habitat to fish; $1 in FRIMA      funds leverage $1.37 in state/local funds; participants have      contributed 58% in cost share, which is much more than the      required 35%.                                 ______                                       By
