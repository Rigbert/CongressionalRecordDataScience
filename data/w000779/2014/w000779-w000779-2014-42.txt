So we have Republicans and Democrats objecting to that.  Now my colleague from Texas comes forward and says: OK, let's not do a 2-month extension because we don't want to consider this in the lame duck session. But, colleagues, if you don't do the 2-month extension, the Internet Tax Freedom Act will have expired and you are still in the lame duck session. And by the time you get to the lame duck, millions of Americans will be vulnerable to discriminatory Internet taxes.  I am going to close this discussion by saying that in my view neither of the options is exactly ideal, because I think I made it very clear after 16 years that I would like to make permanent the ban against discriminatory taxes. Neither situation is ideal from my standpoint because Republicans and Democrats both object to doing that today. But what we know is that one option we have in front of us today is worse than the other, and the really bad option is to not do a short-term extension and leave millions of Americans vulnerable to discriminatory taxes.  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.
