 President, let me sum up where I think we are. It has been a very interesting and enlightening discussion. But here is where we are. The Senate is gridlocked on the farm bill because of the decision to fill up the tree. And now where we are, as the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out, is that any one Senator, any one of the 100, can object to an amendment being set aside in order to consider another amendment.  What will have to happen at this point is, as it happens every day on virtually every bill, the majority leader and I are going to have to sit down off the floor of the Senate and talk about the way forward, because we will not be able to go forward in our current circumstance because of the decision by the majority to shut out the minority, or contrarily to select what amendments will be permitted. That is simply not acceptable on this side of the aisle.  So it has been an interesting and useful discussion, and I am sure to some C-SPAN viewers quite boring, because it has largely been about procedure.  Nevertheless, that is where we are. We are going to have to do what we do every day in the Senate, sit down and figure out the way forward. The farm bill needs to pass. We hope it passes sometime in the near future. But we are going to insist on a fair process consistent with the way farm bills have been debated in the past.
