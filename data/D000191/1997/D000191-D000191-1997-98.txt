 So I mean in part, I mean what are these brave new frontiers. Of course, we are having some contention over China and other countries that are even more oppressive or repressive than Mexico. It is an extraordinary race to the bottom.  Ultimately it will undermine the strength of our Nation, which was created in part by the spirit of capitalists like Henry Ford who said, I am going to build a product that the people who work in my plants can afford to buy. And for many years there was a wonderful linkage between the owners of capital and the managers of the corporations and the working people, which was to say, if you produce more and do better, we will all go up together.  And now, for whatever reason, they have decided to break that link, to both use agreements like NAFTA to push down wages in our country. In the heartland of our country, we are seeing people who are getting hardballed in negotiations. It was either Delco or Packard Electric, and I do not want to misspeak, but it was a producer of electrical components for automobiles and wiring looms and all those things. When the agreement came up, the company said, look, it is real simple, you take a 50-percent cut in your wages or all your jobs go to Mexico. There was nothing else in the community. And ultimately the workers had to accede to those demands.
