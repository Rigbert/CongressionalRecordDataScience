President.  I come to the floor today, as I did on the last day of October, to state my opposition to this bankruptcy conference report. This is an issue that I have worked on for the last 4 years. For 2 of those years, I served on a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee with Senator Grassley. I worked very closely with many in drafting what I consider to be very balanced and very positive bankruptcy reform. That bill was called for a vote on the floor of the Senate. Ninety-seven Senators voted in favor of that bill. It was the most overwhelming vote on this subject to my knowledge that we have seen on the Senate floor in modern times. It was a balanced bill. I thought it was a good bill.  For these last 2 years, I have not served on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been Senator Grassley's responsibility to continue this effort. He came forward with a bill which I supported on the Senate floor.  Sadly, when this bill left the Senate floor to go to conference committee, it got in trouble again. Some of the special interests that are interested in this particular bill can't wait for this conference committee to literally rip apart the best efforts of the Senate.  They did it 4 years ago; they have done it this year. They have taken what was a generally good bill on bankruptcy and made some rather disastrous changes in it. I think that is unfortunate.  I accept the premise that bankruptcy reform is overdue. I think it is unfair to consumers across America to try to absorb all the costs of those who go to bankruptcy court, particularly those who have no business in bankruptcy court. But I also believe the credit industry has a responsibility as well. This bill does not serve the needs of balance. This bill, the conference report that is before the Senate today, is a conference report that was written entirely by the Republican Party. They didn't even invite the Democratic conferees into the discussion. It was a slam dunk--take it or leave it.  As far as I am concerned, I want to leave it. I think we can do a better job. If we have to wait for a new Congress to accomplish that, so be it.  Let me say from the outset, I support and am committed to bankruptcy reform. There are some things we can and should do to make it a better system. What we have today is not balanced. Make no mistake, this bankruptcy bill is lopsided in favor of the credit card industry.  When I came to the floor on November 1 and voted against cloture on this particular bill, some of my colleagues asked me why. Why did I, a Member who previously voted for bankruptcy reform, now oppose this conference report? I oppose it because the bill I voted for was decimated in conference. As a result, we have before the Senate a very poor work product.  In 1985, Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York City, said:       [Bankruptcy would be] like stepping into a tepid bath and      slashing your wrists. You might not feel yourself dying, but      that's what would happen.  I oppose this one-sided bankruptcy conference report on behalf of debtors who lack the lobbying dollars of the credit card industry and are unable to make their voices heard. We must keep in mind, the vast majority of people who go to the bankruptcy court don't want to be there. They are people in a very low-income status who have found themselves, because of circumstances beyond their control, unable to pay off their debts. They go many times with embarrassment to a bankruptcy court because they have nowhere else to turn. I oppose the bankruptcy conference report on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in this predicament. I am talking about older Americans, women raising families, and unemployed workers.  When you do a survey of the reasons people end up in bankruptcy court, many of the same reasons keep coming forward: Unanticipated health care bills can happen to anybody; a divorce which results in one of the spouses ending up with custody and very few assets to take care of the children; the loss of a job. These sorts of things are totally unanticipated, and people find themselves needing to turn to bankruptcy to get a fresh start in life.  Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy than their younger counterparts, but when they do file, a large fraction of them, nearly 40 percent, give medical debts as the reason for filing. Another reason is jobs. The economic consequences for someone who has worked for 30 years and loses his job at age 54 can be catastrophic.  Both men and women are more likely to declare bankruptcy following divorce. Families already laden with consumer debt can't divide their income to support two households and survive economically. Divorced women file for bankruptcy in greater proportion than divorced men. According to the credit industry's own data, women heads of household are not only the largest demographic group in bankruptcy; they are also the poorest. I remind Members of that fact when we consider the debate on this bill.  Yesterday, my friend, the Senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, came to the floor and made note of the fact that there are provisions made in this bankruptcy conference report that benefit and improve the status of women and children in the throes of bankruptcy. What Senator Hatch failed to add was that there are also provisions in this bill which enhance and improve the status of credit card companies so that debts that otherwise would have been wiped away or discharged linger and continue to plague the limited assets left over after a bankruptcy.  So while it is true you may put the women and children at the head of the line, the line is a very short one with very few dollars because the credit card industry receives benefits under this bill to allow them to continue to pursue the debts of someone who has filed for bankruptcy, whereas today they could not.  More than half the debtors who file for bankruptcy report a significant period of unemployment preceding their filings. For single-parent households, a period of unemployment can be absolutely devastating. It is on behalf of these debtors that I opposed this unbalanced bankruptcy conference report that gives them little or nothing.  Some of my colleagues may be saying, what is the Senator talking about? Doesn't the bankruptcy bill put women and children first, as Senator Hatch said yesterday? Indeed, that was the rhetoric we heard. Senators came to the floor with large posters claiming how wonderful the bankruptcy bill was for women and children.  Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill does grant first priority to alimony and support claims. Unfortunately, the bill places women and children first in line to receive little or nothing. Priority is only relevant for distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. However, such distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of cases.  More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no distribution to creditors because there are no assets to distribute. So to say to women and children, when it is all over we will give you a greater share of the assets, in 95 percent of the cases there are no assets to give them; the assets have been dissipated and used up already by the credit card creditors.  The real battle for women and children is reaching an ex-husband's income after bankruptcy. Right now under current law, child support and alimony share a protected postbankruptcy position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The credit card industry wants to muscle in and get a large piece of a very small pie. They want credit card debt and other consumer credit to share in this protected postbankruptcy position. They want to shove women and children aside to try to collect on their own behalf.  The simple fact is this: When pitted against the high-powered credit cardindustry, women and children do not have the resources to compete. If the credit card industry is permitted to elevate its status to the protected postbankruptcy status position already shared by taxes and student loans, women and children will lose every single time.  Later on, I will make reference to a press release recently put out by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. They say in their press release: A child is more important than a credit card. Those who vote for this conference report believe just the opposite: The credit card industry has a greater claim to some sort of support from the Senate that the children who are involved in a divorce proceeding.  My colleagues must ask themselves, if this bill truly puts women and children first, why is every major women's group and children's group opposing this legislation? We have advocates for women and children who are opposed to the bill. I will not go through the long list, but if you believe the statements made yesterday by some of my colleagues on the floor, you have to ask yourself, are all of these groups wrong? Are all of these advocates for women and children opposed to the bill for the wrong reason? I don't think so. These are not partisan organizations; they are organizations that fight for women and children when they know that they are struggling to survive. They read this bill as I have, too, and came to the same conclusion. When all is said and done, the credit card industry will do just fine. It is the women, the mothers, the kids who won't.  Mr. President, 116 nonpartisan law professors from all over the country have written expressing their concerns over the grave effects the bill will have on women and children. In addition, to the concerns I have already raised, the law professors write:       Women and children as creditors will have to compete with      powerful creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy.      This increased competition for women and children will come      from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose      credit card claims increasingly will be accepted from      discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after      bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier      time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be      discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security,      even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None      of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R.      2415 addresses these problems.       The truth remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its current      form, women and children will face increased competition in      collecting their alimony and support claims after the      bankruptcy claim is over. We pointed out this difficulty      repeatedly, but no change has been made in the bill to      address it.  They go on to say:       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the      thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony      and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we      also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a      million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy      this year alone. As the heads of the economically most      vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending      legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest      demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit      card industry's own data, they are the poorest. The      provisions in this bill, particularly the many provisions      that apply without regard to income, will fall hardest on      them. Under this bill, a single mother with dependent      children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far      below the national median income would have her bankruptcy      case dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax      returns for the past three years--even if those returns are      in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who      hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be      forced to repay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost      worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or      children's clothing, even if it meant that successful      completion of a repayment plan was impossible.  I can't get over the fact that we have just finished an election season when so many candidates in both political parties spoke of their sympathies and their commitments to America's families. They talked about the vulnerable in our society, about the need for compassion whether you are liberal or conservative, and they spoke to groups about their love for children. Yet we turn around here, 4 weeks and a day after that last election, and start debating a bill which clearly is not designed to help women and children in the most vulnerable circumstances. All of these groups, every single one of them that stand for the interests of these women and children, have told us this is a bad bill.  If you look at this group, you will not see too many political action committees. I don't believe Churchwomen United have a PAC, or many of the others. But certainly the credit card industry does. The financial institutions do. They have come to get involved in this election campaign, as is their constitutional right. Their voice, unfortunately, is a lot louder on the floor of the Senate than the voices of those who represent the women and children across America.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter by the 116 law professors be printed in the Congressional Record at this point.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 December 1, 2000.     Re The Bankruptcy Reform Act Conference Report (H.R. 2415).       Dear Senators: We are professors of bankruptcy and      commercial law. We have been following the bankruptcy reform      process with keen interest. The 116 undersigned professors      come from every region of the country and from all major      political parties. We are not a partisan, organized group,      and we have no agenda. Our exclusive interest is to seek the      enactment of a fair and just bankruptcy law, with appropriate      regard given to the interests of debtors and creditors alike.      Many of us have written before to express our concerns about      the bankruptcy legislation, and we write again as yet another      version of the bill comes before you. This bill is deeply      flawed, and we hope the Senate will not act on it in the      closing minutes of this session.       In a letter to you dated September 7, 1999, 82 professors      of bankruptcy law from across the country expressed their      grave concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625,      particularly the effects of the bill on women and children.      We wrote again on November 2, 1999, to reiterate our      concerns. We write yet again to bring the same message: the      problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved,      particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and      children.       Notwithstanding the unsupported claims of the bill's      proponents, H.R. 2415 does not help women and children.      Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the      best interests of women and children continue to oppose the      pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in our      earlier letters showing how S. 625 would hurt women and      children have not been resolved. Indeed, they have not even      been addressed.       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for      women and children was stated in the September 7, 1999,      letter:       ``Women and children as creditors will have to compete with      powerful creditors to collect their claims after      bankruptcy.''       This increased competition for women and children will come      from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose      credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from      discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after      bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier      time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be      discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security,      even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None      of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R.      2415 addresses these problems. The truth remains: if H.R.      2415 is enacted in its current form, women and children will      face increased competition in collecting their alimony and      support claims after the bankruptcy case is over. We have      pointed out this difficulty repeatedly, but no change has      been made in the bill to address it.       Second, it is a distraction to argue--as do advocates of      the bill--that the bill will ``help'' women and children and      that it will ``make child support and alimony payments the      top priority--no exceptions.'' As the law professors pointed      out in the Setpember 7, 1999, letter:       ``Giving `first priority' to domestic support obligations      does not address the problem.''       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims      is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims      because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made      to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such      distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of      cases. More than 95% of bankruptcy cases make NO      distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to      distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for      bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line      to collect nothing.       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child      support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy      position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit      card debt and other consumer credit share that position,      thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their      own behalf. The credit industry carefully avoids discussing      the increased post-bankruptcy competition facing women if      H.R. 2415 becomes law. As a matter of public policy, this      country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred      position of taxes and child support. Once again,     we have pointed out this problem repeatedly, and nothing has      been changed in the pending legislation to address it.       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the      thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony      and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we      also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a      million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy      this year alone. As the heads of the economically most      vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending      legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest      demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit      industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in      this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply      without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under      this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is      hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the      national median income would have her bankruptcy case      dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax      returns for the past three years--even if those returns are      in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who      hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be      forced to pay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost      worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or      children's clothes, even if it meant that successful      completion of a repayment plan was impossible.       Finally, when the Senate passed S. 625, we were hopeful      that the final bankruptcy legislation would include a      meaningful homestead provision to address flagrant abuse in      the bankruptcy system. Instead, the conference report      retreats from the concept underlying the Senate-passed      homestead amendment.       The homestead provision in the conference report will allow      wealthy debtors to hide assets from their creditors.       Current bankruptcy law yields to state law to determine      what property shall remain exempt from creditor attachment      and levy. Homestead exemptions are highly variable by state,      and six states (Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas,      Oklahoma) have literally unlimited exemptions while twenty-     two states have exemptions of $10,000 or less. The variation      among states leads to two problems--basic inequality and      strategic bankruptcy planning. The only solution is a dollar      cap on the homestead exemption. Although variation among      states would remain, the most outrageous abuses--those in the      multi-million dollar category--would be eliminated.       The homestead provision in the conference report does      little to address the problem. The legislation only requires      a debtor to wait two years after the purchase of the      homestead before filing a bankruptcy case. Well-counseled      debtors will have no problem timing their bankruptcies or      tying-up the courts in litigation to skirt the intent of this      provision. The proposed change will remind debtors to buy      their property early, but it will not deny anyone with      substantial assets a chance to protect property from their      creditors. Furthermore, debtors who are long-time residents      of states like Texas and Florida will continue to enjoy a      homestead exemption that can shield literally millions of      dollars in value.       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to      compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and      child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for      women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial      trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead      loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from      their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted      ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass      a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans including women      and children.       Thank you for your consideration.       Signed by 116 Law Professors.
