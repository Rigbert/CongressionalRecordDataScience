Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well being of the city of Norco, California, was unparalleled. Norco was indeed fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated business and community leader who willingly and unselfishly gave of his time and talents to make his community a better place in which to live and work. The individual I am speaking of is Steve M. Nathan. I was fortunate to have been able to call him my friend. He passed away last week at the Corona Regional Medical Center after complications from surgery at the age of 76.  With true valor and love of country he served in the United States Air Force and saw combat during World War II as a B-26 Aerial Gunner where he flew 26 missions over Germany. After 25 years of service, he retired as a Senior Master Sergeant in 1968 and moved to Norco. Steve then founded and operated Norco Alarms, Inc. until his retirement in 1990. A fixture in the community, Steve was a talented businessman and never shied away from community involvement.  Mr. Nathan gave much during his years to his community and the whole Inland Empire. He began his record of community service by becoming a member of the Norco Planning Commission in 1970, served over 12 years on the Norco City Council and was elected Mayor twice during that span. Steve was also elected and served as Chairman of the Riverside Transit Agency, appointed to the Riverside County Jury in 1993, serve on the California Grand Jurors Association Board, was the current three term President of the Norco Historical Society, a member of the California Rehabilitation Center Citizen Advisory Board, the Corona Masonic Lodge, Norco Lions Club, the Norco American Legion Post 328 and the Norco Chamber of Commerce.  His passion for community service was matched by his passion for hunting for artifacts. He traveled many parts of the world as he enjoyed his metal detecting hobby and spent two weeks each summer in England where he hunted for artifacts. He was an avid Board Member of the Riverside Treasure Hunters Club.  He is survived by his wife, Audry Murphy Nathan, two sons, Scott Nathan and his wife Emmi, Dennis Nathan and his wife Jane, two grandchildren, Nicole and Bryan, his sister Toni Nathan and brother-in law Chuck Nathan. Steve was preceded in death by his wife of 54 years, Doris Nathan. My prayers go out to them for their loss.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Steve's life, we see a man dedicated to his family and community--an American whose gifts to the Inland Empire and southern California led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with him. Honoring Steve's memory is the least that we can do today for all that he gave over his lifetime.                          ____________________
