Speaker, I would like to take issue with the characterizations that the distinguished gentlewoman from New York has made about the committee report and about my actions in two respects.  First of all, every committee report that is filed in the House of Representatives does allow the people who disagreed with the legislation to file dissenting views; and those who did support the legislation can file additional views, all of which are printed in the committee report.  The majority has the responsibility in the committee report to articulate the arguments in favor of the bill because the committee report represents the views of those who voted in favor of the legislation at the committee level.  The amendments that were offered and which are the text, or the description, at issue here in this debate today were all offered by members of the Committee on the Judiciary who oppose the bill. They were all defeated by a majority vote in the committee; and my committee, perhaps in a minority in the Congress, does print the entire text of our committee markups in committee reports. The text of the debate in the markup and the text of the amendments are contained in pages 58 through 120 of House Report 109-51 inclusive.  Now, what the gentlewoman from New York is complaining about is the majority's arguments in favor of the bill and against the amendments which were defeated. To attempt to have those who voted against the bill rewrite the arguments that are in favor of the bill contained in the committee report is just as wrong as those who voted in favor of the bill attempting to rewrite the dissenting views which are appended to the committee report and represent the views of those who voted against the bill.  Second point: it is against the rules of the House of Representatives to impugn the motives of another Member. So the intent of the authors of the amendments that were defeated in the committee and which were described in the committee report is out of bounds. It cannot be done on the floor. It cannot be done in committee reports. So all that can be done in terms of the debate is to look at what the effect of the amendments was.  Perhaps these amendments were not properly drafted by the authors when they were submitted in the committee because they did not contain a specific carve-out of the exemptions that were proposed for the various classes of people that were proposed to be exempted in the amendment. This is not the fault of the majority. That is the fault of the people who drafted the amendments; and because the amendments were not tightly enough drafted, they did not contain a carve-out of the exemptions for sexual predators. That is what we pointed out in the committee report.  It is not the fault of the majority of the Committee on the Judiciary or me as chairman in filing this report to gloss over a defect that did allow exemptions for sexual predators. The minority has the chance in their dissenting views to dispute the conclusion that had been reached in describing what the amendments were. They chose not to do so.  So the committee report and the headers on the amendments accurately reflect the fact that those who authored the amendment did not choose to carve out an exemption for sexual predators in the effect of the amendment in the clear text of the amendment that was submitted.  I rest my case.                              {time}  1215
