Speaker, it was about a year ago that this House first took up some of the contract items and passed a number of things the first day and the first month, certainly. As I recall, one of the things that we passed on the very first day was a change in the House rules to allow for honest budgeting.  As my colleague pointed out, school lunches are going up at least $200 million each and every year. I can hardly wait next fall to go to the schools where they believe that school lunches are going to be over and sit down and have lunch with my fourth and fifth graders and say, ``Oh, my gosh, we are still having lunch.''  I signed some mail today, people complaining about Medicare cuts. It is going up any way you look at it, 50 percent over 7 years in the plan that we passed and the President vetoed. And it is going up on a per beneficiary basis by $2,100.  But I thought it was in this House that it passed almost unanimously, not quite, 390-something to 12 or something like that, to use honest budget numbers. And what that meant to me was that we were not going to start looking at these things as cuts, unless they actually went down. Is it a violation of the House rules to talk about cuts when in fact they are going up?
