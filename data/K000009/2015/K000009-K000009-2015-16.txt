Speaker, the U.S. Export-Import Bank means jobs in the United States of America. From 2007 to 2015, in Ohio, it supported 363 exporters, 263 small businesses, and more than $3 billion in value of Ohio exports. Superior Holdings, First Solar, Port Clinton Manufacturing, A.J. Rose Manufacturing, and so many other Ohio companies want to export. They require Ex-Im to do so.  Frankly, in today's world markets, no serious nation can compete without the Export-Import Bank. More than 50 countries have an Export-Import Bank: China, Japan, Germany, India, Korea, France, Brazil, and other competitors.  I support reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. It means jobs, and it means business for the USA.                              {time}  1545
