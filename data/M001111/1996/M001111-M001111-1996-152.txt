 President, I have an amendment at the desk that seeks to protect legal immigrant children from being denied access to foster care. Under the deeming provisions of this bill, children who would otherwise be eligible to be placed in foster care, due to abuse and neglect for example, could be denied this benefit. The Murray amendment protects these children from being forced to remain in an abusive situation because they are deemed ineligible to receive AFDC benefits, and therefore do not qualify for foster care assistance. This applies to any situation which would result in the child being placed in a foster care, transitional living program, or adoption assistance under current law.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
