Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations, for his work with me on this bill. Working to reform the PTO to ensure timely and effective intellectual property protection for American inventors and businesses has been a multiyear effort for many of us, authorizers and appropriators, on both sides of the aisle. Today, we see the fruits of these efforts. Thanks to the support of Chairman Wolf and full committee Chairman Young, our committees have come together and reached an agreement on a funding mechanism that will enable the USPTO to fully fund its restructuring and reform activities. It is my understanding that this rebate mechanism would ensure that all revenue from patent and trademark fees would in fact go to the USPTO or would be rebated to those who have paid the fees. As a result, the USPTO, which receives no taxpayer dollars and is fully fee-funded, would now be able to retain its fee revenue and to fully fund their widely supported 5-year strategic plan. Is that the gentleman from Virginia's understanding?
