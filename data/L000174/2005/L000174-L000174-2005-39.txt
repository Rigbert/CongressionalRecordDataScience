President, it has been claimed that somehow the so-called wall between law enforcement and intelligence would go back up if the PATRIOT Act expires. That is not true. Even if the relevant change made by the PATRIOT Act expired, there would be no legal barrier to information-sharing, and no wall would go back up, because FISA as it existed pre-PATRIOT Act contained no such barrier. So ruled the FISA court of review in November 2002 at the request of the government. It held that the change we made in the PATRIOT Act to take down the wall was not necessary, that FISA never required a wall, and that the Department of Justice unnecessarily imposed bureaucratic constraints on sharing information. So let us not delude ourselves into thinking that somehow the wall goes back up if PATRIOT expires. It does not. It was not legally required in the first place.  How much time do I have remaining?
