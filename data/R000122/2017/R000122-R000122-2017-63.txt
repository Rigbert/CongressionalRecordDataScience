. 1628, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that, No. 1, are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and No. 2, ensure that any cuts to Medicaid shall cease to apply in States with fewer than 26 weeks of unemployment insurance under State law and shall be reversed in States with increased unemployment in a quarter and include a study on available job opportunities for those most likely to lose health insurance coverage in the next 10 years as a result of the bill. Like most of the country, Rhode Island was hit hard by the recession, and Medicaid provided a critical safety net. Medicaid can adapt to cover those who have lost their jobs or are facing other economic hardships, saving families from having to choose whether to take their kids to the doctor or put food on the table. Under this bill, States will be unable to expand coverage during a recession to those in need and will likely be forced to make devastating across the board cuts.  I ask unanimous consent that the motion be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Reed moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Finance of the Senate with instructions to      report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting      any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes      that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) ensure that any cuts to Medicaid shall cease to apply      in States with fewer than 26 weeks of unemployment insurance      under State law and shall be reversed in States with      increased unemployment in a quarter, and include a study on      available job opportunities for those most likely to lose      health insurance coverage in the next ten years as a result      of the bill.
