Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Eastern Municipal Water District, who observed its 50th anniversary of service to western Riverside County on October 14th. On that nostalgic day Eastern Municipal celebrated with present and past employees, and their families, with a fly-over, antique car show, displays and demonstration, live '50s music, clowns, a magic show and much more.  Formed in 1950 to secure additional water for the western Riverside County, which faced declining groundwater supply and continuing droughts, Eastern Municipal has exceeded expectations. Originally only serving a lightly populated area, it now has a service area of 555 square miles, with a total of nearly 440,000 people, while additionally providing sewage collection and water recycling services. In 1999/2000 Eastern Municipal sold 83,000 acre-feet of fresh water alone (one-acre-foot is 325,900 gallons, or as much as two families use in and around their homes in one year). One quarter of their water supply comes from wells, while the remainder comes from the Colorado River Aqueduct and its connections to the California State Water Project. Additionally, Eastern Municipal sells to eight other water agencies, which serve the areas of: Elsinore Valley, Western Riverside County, Lake Hemet, City of Hemet, Nuevo, City of San Jacinto and Rancho California.  In water storage, Eastern Municipal maintains 76 tanks which hold nearly 170 million gallons of water. These tanks provide assurance that water will be available during possible future droughts or declining water supply.  Mr. Speaker, for the state of California there are two issues constantly at the forefront: water, and more water. Therefore, the importance of municipal water districts cannot be underestimated--they will continue to grow and play an increasingly important role in southern California. As the Riverside and the Inland Empire continue to grow, we will need to find ways to live within the 4.4 million acre-feet restriction on the Colorado River that has been imposed by the Secretary of the Interior on southern California. The goals of reclamation will become even more important. Eastern Municipal Water District has proven itself capable of solving our water supply challenges for the past 50 years. I look forward to working with them on our important shared goals foryears to come. Again, I extend my ``Congratulations!'' to Eastern Municipal Water District.                          ____________________
