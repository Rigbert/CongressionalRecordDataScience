President, today, the Senate passed the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010. I thank Senators Kyl, Merkley and Burr for their leadership on this important legislation, which bans the creation, sale and distribution of obscene animal crush videos. We worked together on a bipartisan basis to ensure that the bill respects the first amendment and the role of our court system, while at the same time giving law enforcement a valuable and necessary tool to stop obscene animal cruelty.  Earlier this year, in United States v. Stevens, the Supreme Court struck down a Federal statute banning depictions of animal cruelty because it held the statute to be overbroad and in violation of the first amendment. Animal crush videos, which can depict obscene, extreme acts of animal cruelty, were a primary target of that legislation.  Several months ago, in response to the Stevens decision, the House overwhelmingly passed a narrower bill banning animal crush videos on obscenity grounds. The Senate Judiciary Committee regularly looks at questions raised by Supreme Court decisions and the first amendment, and the House bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. The version of the bill passed today reflects a carefully crafted compromise between the House and Senate that strikes the right balance between the first amendment and the needs of law enforcement, while adhering to the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.  There are a few well-established exceptions to the first amendment. The United States has long prohibited the interstate sale of obscene materials, and the Supreme Court recognized this exception to the first amendment in 1957. Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing focused on the obscene nature of many animal crush videos. We heard testimony from experts who confirmed that many animal crush videos depict extreme acts of animal cruelty which are designed to appeal to a specific, prurient, sexual fetish. Indeed, these animal crush videos are patently offensive, lack any redeeming social value, and can be banned consistent with the Supreme Court's obscenity jurisprudence. Courts and juries play an important role in determining what is obscene, and I worked hard with Senator Sessions, and the bill sponsors, to make sure that the law passed today respects the role of both.  The United States also has a history of prohibiting speech that is integral to criminal conduct. The acts of animal cruelty depicted in many animal crush videos violate State laws, but these laws are hard to enforce. The animal cruelty is often committed in a clandestine manner that allows the perpetrators to remain anonymous. The nature of the videos makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the jurisdiction necessary to prosecute the crimes. Given the severe difficulties that State law enforcement agencies have encountered in investigating the underlying conduct, today Congress has taken an important step towards combating the crimes of extreme animal cruelty that obscene animal crush videos depict.  I have long been a champion of first amendment rights. As the son of Vermont printers, I know firsthand that the freedom of speech is the cornerstone of our democracy. This is why I have worked hard to pass legislation like the SPEECH Act, which protects American authors, journalists and publishers from foreign libel lawsuits that undermine the first amendment.  Today's success demonstrates that Congress can work on a bipartisan basis to pass legislation that is the focus of many competing interests. I commend the coalition that worked hard, alongside the Humane Society and first amendment experts, to strike the proper balance between the needs of law enforcement and the firstamendment, and I am pleased that, once the President signs this bill into law, obscene animal crush videos will no longer threaten animal welfare.                          ____________________
