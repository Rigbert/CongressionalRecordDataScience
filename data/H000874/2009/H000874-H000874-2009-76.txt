 On our side of the aisle, we are strongly in favor of making sure that that cut does not occur. We think that will not serve seniors in particular, because medical personnel will be unable to serve with those compensation levels. As a result, we very much expect to have a sustainable growth rate bill pass this House.  As the gentleman knows, we have done that in years past, not related necessarily to any other health reform bill. It is an issue in and of itself that relates to existing Medicare. The health care reform bill deals with the reform and the creation of a system of affordable, accessible, quality health care for all Americans. The sustainable growth rate deals with the present system. We have got to deal with it, and I will tell the gentleman it's my intention that we make sure that we bring to the floor a sustainable growth rate. We've been discussing it with the Senate because the Senate tried to do it and was not successful in passing that. We want to see success. It is absolutely essential that we do that. Whether we do health care reform or not, we will do that. So I tell my friend that we are going to have that probably, probably, as a freestanding piece of legislation.
