President, today the Senate completes the confirmation process for Robert D. McCallum, Jr. to be the Assistant Attorney General to head the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. I congratulate Mr. McCallum and his family.  The Judiciary Committee has worked very hard since returning in July to act on presidential nominations to fill vital positions at the Department of Justice. In addition to the confirmations of the Deputy Attorney General, the Solicitor General, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, the Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and the Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy, during the last month we have held four hearings on Department of Justice nominees and today we confirm a sixth nominee to a leadership role at the Department of Justice in the last month.  With the confirmation of Mr. McCallum, we have confirmed seven of the Attorney General's Assistant Attorneys General. We have also completed action on Asa Hutchinson to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, Jim Ziglar to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Bob Mueller to serve as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I commend the Members of the Committee on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation in this regard.                          ____________________
