President, I am today submitting a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding measures to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.  This resolution is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, Jeffords, Torricelli, Murray, Durbin, Wellstone, Feingold, Harkin, Kerry, Mikulski, and Boxer.  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is introducing an identical resolution today in the House of Representatives.  The purpose of this resolution is to convey our support for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chiapas that has been simmering since the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Since then, and despite repeated attempts at negotiations, the situation remains tense and prospects for productive dialogue remote. In August, armed confrontations between members of the Mexican military and Zapatista supporters in Chiapas was a reminder of the political violence that has plagued the region for years. I submitted a similar resolution just over a year ago and, unfortunately, the situation remains largely unchanged.  This resolution does not attempt to take sides or to dictate an outcome of that conflict. It is not meant to embarrass or interfere in Mexico's internal affairs. The situation in Chiapas is a complex one that has social, ethnic, economic and political dimensions. It is a manifestation of years of Mexican history. It is for the Mexican people to resolve.  But despite its complexities, there is no doubt that the indigenous people of Chiapas have been the victims of injustice for centuries. Most do not own any land and they live--as their parents and grandparents did--in abject poverty. The 1994 Zapatista uprising, in which some 150 people died, was a reflection of that injustice and despair, and the political tension and violence of recent years has only exacerbated their plight.  To his credit, President Zedillo has devoted considerable financial resources to address the poverty and lack of basic services in Chiapas. On September 7, 1999, he pledged to renew dialogue with the Zapatistas and investigate human rights abuses there. The scheduled November 23rd visit to Mexico by Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, is an important and welcome development. I am hopeful that the Mexican Government will engage in an open dialogue with Ms. Robinson and that progress can be made on ways to further promote and protect human rights in Mexico.  Despite these positive steps, however, Mexican officials indicate that they expect little progress toward resolving the conflict before the presidential elections in July 2000. This is very disappointing. While mistrust runs deep on both sides, a great deal can be accomplished in eight months if the parties to the conflict are willing to take the steps to create conditions for good faith negotiations to succeed, and then sit down at the table together.  There is little evidence that the Mexican Government's strategy is working. Since early 1998, the Zedillo administration has, on the one hand, lavishly funded social programs in those indigenous communities in Chiapas that are willing to accept them. On the other hand, Mexican troops have tightened their grip on the impoverished communities of Zapatista supporters. They patrol the roads in and out of Chiapas in armored vehicles, brandishing weapons and establishing military check-points and bases when it is abundantly clear that neither the communities, nor the Zapatistas themselves, pose a credible threat to the Mexican Government. In addition, paramilitary forces, responsible for some of the worst atrocities, continue to operate in the region.  Human rights monitors, including Mexican citizens, have been harassed, and foreigners, including American citizens, have been summarily expelled from Mexico for activities that amount to nothing more than criticizing the policies of the Mexican Government.  The Zapatistas have also contributed to their isolation. They have not accepted the Mexican Government's recent overtures to resume dialogue and seem resigned to wait in their jungle stronghold until there is a new government before considering a return to talks. Again, July is a long way away, especially for the Zapatistas' supporters who struggle every day just to find food and shelter for themselves and their families. They have suffered long enough.  Mr. President, this resolution calls on our Secretary of State to encourage the Mexican Government and the Zapatistas to support negotiations that address the underlying causes of the conflict, to achieve a lasting peace. It seeks to convey our concern about the people of Chiapas, and the urgent need for concrete progress to resolve a conflict that has cost many innocent lives and threatens the economic and political development of our southern neighbor.  A stable, peaceful and prosperous Mexico is not only in the best interest of all Mexicans, it is also in the economic and security interests of the United States. And human rights abuses, wherever and however they occur, deserve our attention.  The resolution urges the Secretary of State to ensure that the United States is not contributing to the political violence, by reaffirming current law which limits assistance and exports of equipment only to Mexican security forceswho are primarily involved in counter-narcotics activities and who do not commit human rights abuses. In order to ensure that the law is faithfully implemented, the State Department needs to know who we train and who receives our equipment.  It calls on the Mexican Government to respect the freedoms of movement, association and expression by implementing the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, particularly with regard to American citizens and others who have been summarily expelled from Mexico in violation of Mexican law and international law.  And it urges both sides to take initiatives for peace.  Mr. President, some may ask why we are submitting this resolution today, when this conflict has been simmering for years, It is my hope that in conjunction with Mary Robinson's visit next week, this Resolution will send a strong message to the Mexican Government, the Zapiatislas, our own administration and the international community that an intensified effort is needed urgently to resolve the conflict peacefully.                          ____________________
