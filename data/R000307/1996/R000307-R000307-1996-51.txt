The intention of this subparagraph is for the NASA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture to help the commercial remote sensing industry better meet the needs of the agricultural community through development of new pre-commercial remote sensing technologies and interpretive tools. That way, we will ensure a steady steam of services and products that benefit American agriculture without adding to government expenditures or making American farmers dependent on the provision of government services. The EOCAP (E-OH-CAP) program has the most expertise in bringing these diverse requirements and capabilities together.
