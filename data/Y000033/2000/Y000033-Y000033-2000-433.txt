Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one clarification. The highway funds were tax dollars collected for gas used on the highways. The airport funds were dollars collected for those who use the airports and the airplanes and the fuel that was used. It was not supposed to go to the general fund anyway.  This is exactly the same, because we have $13 billion that is owed to the public because we collected it. It was supposed to be spent in the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and we spent it. We spent it on God knows what. All we are doing in this bill is paying back the public and land and water conservation, endangered species, historical preservation, land easements, and all the rest of things in this good bill, just doing what is correct.
