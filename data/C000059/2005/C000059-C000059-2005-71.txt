Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a man who will long be remembered for his extraordinary leadership and the significant contributions he made to the western states of our Nation. Dennis Underwood served his country in many capacities and dedicated the better part of the past 35 years as an influential leader of water policy in the West. On November 2, 2005, Dennis passed away following a long battle with cancer. Our region collectively mourns his passing, while remembering his lifelong contributions.  Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1989 until 1993, Dennis most recently served as the chief executive officer and general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 18 million people. Dennis also served as the Executive Director of the Colorado River Board of California. He worked tirelessly with the seven Basin States, the International Boundary and Water Commission, and various Federal agencies to develop and manage Colorado River water resources.  The greatest challenge facing the West today and for the foreseeable future is meeting water supply needs in an atmosphere of growing population, conflicting state and international claims, and demands of environmental protection. Although Dennis most recently represented water consumers in Southern California, his leadership, ingenuity, fairness, and perseverance yielded important dividends for water users throughout California, Nevada, Arizona, and other states that draw water from the over-allocated Colorado River.  Mark Twain famously stated that ``whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting.'' While the West has undoubtedly seen its share of water wars, I can't think of a person who had a better ability to get people to stop fighting and sit down at the bargaining table than Dennis. His wisdom, warm good nature, positive approach and--above all--sterling honesty kept all players in the Western water drama focused on finding solutions instead of persisting in conflict.  Personally, I had the pleasure and honor of working with Dennis on a number of important water issues, including the sometimes tumultuous negotiations of the Quantification Settlement Agreement, which brought California's water use in compliance with its legal apportionment for Colorado River supplies. In each instance, Dennis displayed a tremendous ability to find balanced solutions that satisfied all parties.  Mr. Speaker, the United States has lost a great servant, the West has lost a brilliant leader, and I have lost a dear friend. On behalf of our region, I want to convey our appreciation for all of Dennis's efforts and express our heartfelt condolences to the Underwood family, including his wife, Carmen; daughter and son-in-law, Michelle and Ryan Dejournett; brothers, Russell, Lawrence, Rory, Kevin, and Jeffrey; and two grandsons.                          ____________________
