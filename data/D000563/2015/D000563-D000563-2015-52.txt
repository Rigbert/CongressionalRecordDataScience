It is a place where an order of Catholic nuns called the Society of Helpers has a house that they have turned into a refuge for homeless people. They have announced that they are going to accept Syrian refugees into their home so that the refugees know they will have a safe place to stay in the United States.  Sister Mary Ellen Moore, a registered psychologist and one of the nuns who lives in the house, said:       We would rather not make our decision on fear, we would      rather make it on compassion . . . We were certainly      disappointed in Gov. Rauner's statement on this issue. That      kind of mentality is frightening and we know what it's led to      in Europe and other places in the past. It's really very sad.  The people of France, after these horrific terrorist incidents, announced that they are going to accept 30,000 Syrian refugees. The people of Canada, after the terrible incident in Paris, announced virtually the same thing. And what has been the response of the United States and the House of Representatives? It has been an irrational response of fear.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter, which comes from a group called HIAS, and has the headline ``1000 Rabbis in Support of Welcoming Refugees'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From hias.org, Dec. 1, 2015]             1,000 Rabbis in Support of Welcoming Refugees       We, Rabbis from across the country, call on our elected      officials to exercise moral leadership for the protection of      the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.       Since its founding, the United States has offered refuge      and protection to the world's most vulnerable. Time and time      again, those refugees were Jews. Whether they were fleeing      pogroms in Tzarist Russia, the horrors of the Holocaust or      persecution in Soviet Russia or Iran, our relatives and      friends found safety on these shores.       We are therefore alarmed to see so many politicians      declaring their opposition to welcoming refugees.       Last month's heartbreaking attacks in Paris and Beirut are      being cited as reasons to deny entry to people who are      themselves victims of terror. And in those comments, we, as      Jewish leaders, see one of the darker moments of our history      repeating itself.       In 1939, the United States refused to let the S.S. St.      Louis dock in our country, sending over 900 Jewish refugees      back to Europe, where many died in concentration camps. That      moment was a stain on the history of our country--a tragic      decision made in a political climate of deep fear, suspicion      and antisemitism. The Washington Post released public opinion      polling from the early 1940's, showing that the majority of      U.S. citizens did not want to welcome Jewish refugees to this      country in those years.       In 1939, our country could not tell the difference between      an actual enemy and the victims of an enemy. In 2015, let us      not make the same mistake.       We therefore urge our elected officials to support refugee      resettlement and to oppose any measures that would actually      or effectively halt resettlement or prohibit or restrict      funding for any groups of refugees.       As Rabbis, we take seriously the biblical mandate to      ``welcome the stranger.'' We call on our elected officials to      uphold the great legacy of a country that welcomes refugees.
