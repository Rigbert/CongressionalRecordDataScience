This bill, known as the Safe School Food Act, would fill gaps in the inspection, testing, procurement and preparation of food served to our schoolchildren, and provide school officials with the necessary tools and information to help them prevent food-borne illness among our most vulnerable population.  Each day, more than 27 million children eat meals provided through the National School Lunch Act. Despite increased attention in recent years to the safety of food provided to schoolchildren, there is evidence of serious problems with our school lunch system--between 1990 and 2000, there were nearly 100 reported outbreaks of food-borne illness in our schools affecting thousands of children, with several outbreaks resulting in significant health consequences. Since food-borne illness is preventable, these statistics indicate we are not doing enough to protect our children's health when they consume food served at our schools.  Currently, 17 percent of the food served in schools is donated by the Federal Government and undergoes stringent U.S. Department of Agriculture food-safety standards for inspections and pathogen testing. Suppliers' food safety records also are reviewed before they are granted contracts to provide food to the USDA donated commodity program. However, the remaining 83 percent of food consumed at schools is purchased locally and is not subject to these more stringent USDA donated commodity standards. State education officials also do not have access to the safety records of food suppliers to make the same informed decisions as their counterparts at the Federal level.  If a tainted product enters the food supply, it is often difficult for local education officials to quickly determine if they have that food in their schools' kitchens due to a complex web of food manufacturers, distributors, and brokers who deal with schools. A food producer's tainted food may be repackaged by a distributor, leaving a school unaware it is serving the product. And many Americans may be surprised to discover that our Federal food agencies do not even have the authority to mandate the recall of contaminated food in schools. Such recalls are currently voluntary.  The Safe School Food Act would address these gaps in our School Lunch Program and provide schools with the tools and information on how to more safely purchase and prepare food served to our children.  Improving Inspections: This legislation will ensure stringent inspection and pathogen testing for USDA meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and produce donated to the School Lunch Program, and gives the USDA Secretary the authority to require similar pathogen testing as necessary for foods purchased directly by the schools. Cafeterias also would be inspected more frequently, inspection exemptions would be eliminated, and those inspection reports would be made available to the public.  Purchasing Safe Food: By incorporating USDA food safety guidelines in their procurement contracts to the maximum extent possible, schools will have the tools to help ensure the safety of the food they serve. And by providing State education officials with food-safety histories of the companies they purchase from, schools can make more informed decisions in the purchasing process.  Planning and Serving Safe Meals: The USDA will provide training and assistance to schools in the preparation of required plans to address the food-safety risks of meals they prepare.  Providing Notice and Recalling Unsafe Food: Each State will have an up-to-date list of the vendors and suppliers who provide food to their schools to enable easier tracking of food that may be tainted. If a food product that has been distributed to schools is found to be unsafe, the USDA Secretary will have the authority to require a mandatory recall of the product if voluntary efforts are unsuccessful. Designated food safety coordinators in each State will assist with recalls, as well as safety training and information-sharing issues.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to improve the safety of the food served in our schools. The health of our schoolchildren is at stake.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 506       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe School Food Act of      2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the national school lunch program under the Richard B.      Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) is      a federally-assisted meal program that--       (A) operates in more than 97,000 public and nonprofit      private schools; and       (B) provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free      lunches to more than 27,000,000 children each school day;       (2) children are among the populations most vulnerable to      foodborne illness, which sickens an estimated 76,000,000      individuals in the United States each year;       (3) nearly 100 reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses      occurred in schools between 1990 and 2000;       (4) Department of Agriculture procurement policies and      procedures--       (A) help ensure the safety of foods donated to schools,      which comprise about 17 percent of the school lunch supply;      but       (B) do not apply to the remaining 83 percent of food served      under the national school lunch program, which is purchased      locally by schools;       (5) it is essential to maintain public confidence in--       (A) the safety of the food supply in the schools of the      United States; and       (B) the ability of the Federal Government and State      governments to exercise adequate oversight of foods served in      the schools of the United States; and       (6) public confidence can best be maintained by--       (A) improving Department of Agriculture procurement and      testing standards, and extending the standards, to the      maximum extent practicable, to foods purchased by schools;       (B) preparing and implementing plans to prevent identified      food safety risks in the preparation of school meals; and       (C) improving food safety training, information sharing,      and coordination between the Federal Government and States.
