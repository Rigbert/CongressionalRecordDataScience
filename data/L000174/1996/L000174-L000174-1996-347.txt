President, I believe very strongly that Congress should repeal the salvage rider, and I believe that Senator Murray's amendment is a responsible, balanced proposal to fix a bad law.  I concur with the words of the distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, in commending her in working out a balanced amendment. I believe that is why her amendment is supported by conservation groups, by private businesses, resource-based industries such as commercial fishermen, editorial boards across the country, the League of Conservation Voters, a whole lot of others, because her compromise provides economic stability and jobs for workers in rural communities, and it also respects what has been a 25-year tradition of bipartisan environmental protection in this body.  It is not an extreme measure. It is a very fair, very moderate, and very responsible measure. But the current law, the current salvage rider is not. It is not balanced. It is not fair. It is not moderate. It is not responsible. So let us come together as a Senate on a reasonable alternative for protecting the public's national forest lands.
