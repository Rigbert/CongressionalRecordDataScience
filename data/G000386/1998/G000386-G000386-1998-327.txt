 President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska very much for his kind remarks and for the background of the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights I and II, but most importantly for his thoughtful leadership on the Commission, because that was 1 year of very hard work for Senator Kerrey. He gave it the attention that this problem deserves. The strong piece of legislation that has gone through the House of Representatives and now strengthened by the Senate Finance Committee under Senator Roth's leadership would not have been possible without the digging and leadership that Senator Kerrey has shown.
