President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the House message on H.R. 2638, that if cloture is filed on the motion to concur in the House amendment with a technical amendment on Friday, it be as if the cloture motion was filed on Thursday, September 25, with the mandatory quorum waived; and that the cloture vote occur on Saturday, at a time to be determined.
