I have listened to these arguments about free speech. Well, if money is now equated with free speech, then lack of money is equated withlack of free speech. It makes sense to me. Let the American people be the judge.  What we really do need is a constitutional amendment that will overturn Buckley versus Valeo. It is outdated. Think about this. In 1994 the average Member sitting here had to spend nearly $1 million when they were in competitive House races to hold onto their seats for a job that pays one-tenth as much. If they ran for the other body, the S-E-N-A-T-E, then they had to spend close to $4.5 million for a job that pays about $130,000 to $136,000 a year. Let the American people be the judge.  In 1994, no House challenger won spending less than $100,000 in this Chamber for a job that pays $136,000. In 1996, the number of congressional candidates financing their campaigns with $100,000 or more of their own money was over 109 candidates.  The American people are voting at all time lows. They know that the money changers are in the temple here. I would say to the people of New Hampshire and Iowa, they have enormous power to change this system. They should not let a single presidential candidate through their States until they are willing to agree to limits.
