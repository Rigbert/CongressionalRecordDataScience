 President, I would ask to engage the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, in a brief colloquy regarding a portion of the report which accompanies the bill, calling on the COPS office to direct $175 million to the Safe Schools Initiative, for the hiring of additional police officers to improve the safety of our school children. I strongly support the Committee's effort, lead by Chairman Gregg and ranking member Hollings, to meet this highly important duty. I just wanted to get a clarification about the Committee's intent--is it the Committee's intent that D.A.R.E. police officers would be eligible to be funded under the Safe Schools Initiative?
