President, today I wish to pay tribute to Senator Barbara Boxer, who has served her State and country with boundless energy, enthusiasm, and exuberance.  Senator Boxer's 24 years in the Senate are only part of her legacy of leadership and accomplishments. Previously, she served for 10 years in the House of Representatives for California's Sixth Congressional District and before that as the first woman president of the Marin County Board of Supervisors.  That remarkable record of service includes another record. In her reelection in 2004, Senator Boxer received nearly 7 million votes, the most in Senate history until that time and a mark that stood for 8 years.  During her service in the Senate, Senator Boxer has established herself as a champion of the environment, infrastructure, and medical research. Along with Senator Inhofe, she authored a 5-year transportation bill that many thought was an impossible task in a gridlocked Senate. But she worked across the aisle and did it. The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act she authored in 2012 reaffirmed the special relationship between our two countries and is another of Senator Boxer's accomplishments.  It has been especially rewarding to work with her on legislation to better protect women from violence, in our country and around the world.  In her first campaign for Congress in 1982, she ran under the slogan, ``Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn.'' She always has and always will. It is a pleasure to thank Senator Barbara Boxer for her years of service and to wish her and her husband, Stewart, many more years of good health and great happiness.                          ____________________
