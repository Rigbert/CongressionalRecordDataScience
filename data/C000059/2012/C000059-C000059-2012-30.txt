Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual from the 44th Congressional District of California who has dedicated his life to defending the people of this country and preserving the basic freedoms and liberties that we hold dear. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Chief Master Sergeant Patrick J. Wood for his 26 years of dedicated service in the United States Air Force.  Chief Wood enlisted in the Air Force on June 26, 1986 after graduating from Divine Child High School in Dearborn, Michigan. After graduating from basic military training he was assigned to the 29th Mobile Aerial Port Squadron, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan as a Load Planner. In September of 1990, then-Staff Sergeant Wood joined Air Force Reserve Recruiting and was again assigned to Selfridge. While there, he was recognized as ``Rookie of the Year'' for the Recruiting Service, an honor given to the recruiter who enlists the most airmen during their first recruiting year.  This was the first of many recruiting awards Chief Wood would receive. His other accomplishments include numerous ``Two Per Week'' awards, ``Top Fifty'' recognition for 6 years, Top Senior Recruiter, and five consecutive ``Goal Excellence Awards'' for his operating locations. Chief Wood was also a distinguished graduate from the Non-Commissioned Officer Academy and Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy. In Recruiting Year 2011, his squadron enlisted more than 2,600 citizen airmen to become the ``Top Recruiting Squadron'' for that year.  As a result of his achievements, Chief Wood was eventually chosen to be the Superintendent of the largest squadron in Reserve Recruiting. During his 23 years in recruiting, Chief Wood was responsible for enlisting over 8,000 new citizen airmen. Chief Wood's innovative ideas and leadership positions allowed him to influence recruiter training practices to ensure that the Air Force Reserve Command met or exceeded goals for 12 consecutive years.  Most recently, Chief Wood has served as the Superintendent, Western Recruiting Squadron, Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service, March Air Reserve Base, California--the most senior ranking noncommissioned officer in the western region. In this role, he has been responsible for the oversight of recruiter production as well as the welfare of over 100 personnel across 17 states, one U.S. territory, and in three countries.  Chief Wood could not have been such a tremendous leader without the love and unfailing support of his wife Major Mia Wood (Retired), and his daughters Airman First Class Lauren Wood and Ashley Wood. Helping to build the foundation for success early in life were his father Alfred, a United States Marine Corps Veteran from the Korean War, and his mother Anna.  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere appreciation to Chief Master Sergeant Patrick J. Wood for his outstanding service to both the United States Air Force and our great Nation. Chief Wood will retire from the United States Air Force service with more than just his experience, decorated career and remarkable accomplishments. He will also have served as a shining example and constant reminder of what it means to be an American patriot and leader. I am grateful for his service and salute him as he retires from the United States Air Force.                          ____________________
