 President, we came together yesterday to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education so she could get to work improving our schools and putting students first.  We will come together to confirm Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services so he can get to work helping to provide relief from ObamaCare and stabilizing the health care markets.  We will come together to confirm Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury, too, so he can get to work continuing the President's efforts to relieve the regulatory pressure on America's economy and American job creation.  We will also come together later today to confirm a new Attorney General. We all know our colleague from Alabama. He is honest. He is fair. He has been a friend to many of us on both sides of the aisle. It has been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague, with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.  In his home State, he has fought against the forces of hate. In the Senate, he developed a record of advocacy for crime victims but also for the fair and humane treatment of those who break our laws, both when they are sentenced and when they are incarcerated.  Jeff Sessions has worked across the aisle on important initiatives. He is, in the words of former Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Joe Lieberman, ``an honorable and trustworthy person, a smart and good lawyer, and a thoughtful and open-minded listener,'' someone who ``will be a principled, fair and capable Attorney General.''  Our colleague wants to be Attorney General for all Americans. Later today, we will vote to give him that chance, and I will have more to say about our friend and colleague at that time.  I yield the floor.
