 Madam Speaker, I thought I saw the whip. I am prepared to yield to someone to tell us the schedule for the week to come.  Pending someone telling me about the schedule for the week to come, let me observe, as someone who has served, Madam Speaker, in this House for a very extended period of time--some 36 years--I was here in the era not too long ago, but long ago--when, if we had done to the Republicans what was done to us, what was done to switch votes so that discrimination could prevail, there would be outrage expressed long into the night from our Republican colleagues who would accuse us of undermining democracy, undermining this House, and making the House less than it should be.  217 people stood up and said: We ought not discriminate. And then, very frankly, Mr. Speaker, the leadership on the Republican side started its activity. And I have been the majority leader, I have been the whip. I understand that process. And they reached out to people and said: No, let us be able to discriminate. Let contractors be able to discriminate.  Mr. Speaker, seven people who had voted not to allow discrimination decided perhaps that principle was not as important as they thought just a minute or so before. I have a list of those names here--a lamentable list of people who did the right thing, who stood up for nondiscrimination, and then were opportuned to change their vote. And the Record reflects, Mr. Speaker, sadly, that they changed their vote.  I won't characterize those votes, because that would not be in order on this floor. And they will have themselves to look at tonight in the mirror and explain to themselves whether their first vote was a principled vote, or whether they had a Damascus Road experience in the few minutes that transpired between their voting not to allow discrimination, until they later--just a few minutes later--at the opportuning of some of their leaders, voted to allow discrimination. A sad day, Mr. Speaker, in the history of the House.                              {time}  1215  I still see no leader, unless Mr. Dent, who I have great respect for, wants to tell us what the schedule is for next week. I would be glad to yield to him for that purpose.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader is not here. The majority leader has a very happy day today, and I congratulate him. His son is graduating from Georgetown, and he obviously needs to be there.  I was hoping someone else could tell us the schedule.  At this point in time, I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee.
