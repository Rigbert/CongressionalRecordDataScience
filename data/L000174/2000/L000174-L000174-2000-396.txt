President, I listened to my two distinguished colleagues. Not only are all colleagues ``distinguished'' colleagues, but these two are also personal friends. One is a Republican, one a Democrat. Both are individuals I like very much, individuals with whom I enjoy working on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  However, notwithstanding our friendship and our service on the same committee, I must disagree with them on this constitutional amendment.  I do not disagree with them at all on the intent of the amendment to give victims rights; to make sure they can be heard in sentencing, to make sure their views are sought out in every area from plea bargains to compensation. I know in the 8 years I was a prosecutor I did that. It was the standardprocedure in my office. I insisted that victims be heard in the pre-sentence report, victims be heard by the court, victims be heard by the prosecutor's office if a determination was made to either bring extra charges or to drop some charges--whatever the reason might be.  I must admit, I would have been very concerned had there been a constitutional amendment of this nature because I can almost picture the number of appeals, the number of delays, and the number of other issues that would come up. In many ways, it would create, in my view, just the opposite effect from that which the sponsors want; that is, so many appeals could come out of this that everybody would lose sight of who is being prosecuted and why.  Last Wednesday, we observed the fifth anniversary of the killing of 168 Americans in the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and we opened the Oklahoma City National Memorial.  Every American was shocked at the initial bombing. Every American must have been moved by the speeches and the observance at the memorial. I remember, after that terrible incident, the Senate proceeded to consider antiterrorism legislation. The incident was in the spring, and by June, we were considering antiterrorism legislation. In fact, at that time the Senate accepted my amendment to include victims legislation in the antiterrorism bill. I worked with Senator McCain to increase assessments against those convicted of crime, with the assessments to go to the Crime Victims Fund. When the matter was completed the following year, we preserved our legislative improvements to help victims of terrorism in the United States, in fact around the world, as the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996. We moved very quickly to respond.  Last Thursday, we also observed the anniversary of the tragic violence at Columbine High School. That was one in a series of deadly incidents of school violence over the last few years. Scores of our Nation's children have been killed or wounded over the last 3 years from school violence, and that violence has shaken families and communities across our Nation. In the wake of the Columbine violence, the Senate moved to the consideration of juvenile crime legislation. We had one of the few real Senate debates in the past few years. We had a 2-week debate. During that 2-week debate, we greatly improved the bill with numerous amendments, including a number directed at commonsense, consensus gun safety laws.  On May 20 last year, within a month of the Columbine tragedy, the Senate acted to pass the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. We did it by a 3-1 margin, but since last May when we passed it, the Congress has kept the country waiting for final action on the legislation. Since last May, the Congress and the Senate have kept the country waiting for sensible gun safety laws. It has been now more than a year since the tragic event at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO; more than a year since 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. Still, the American people are waiting for action by this Congress.  It has been more than 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by a bipartisan vote of 73-25. It had modest, but I believe effective, gun safety provisions in it. It has been more than 8 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met. That was only a ceremonial meeting. We did it for the first and the last and the only time. Throughout the entire school year that has ensued, the Republican Senate chairman of the House-Senate conference and the Republican leadership of the Congress, have refused to call this conference back to work. The Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. But the majority has refused to act.  I think the lack of attention, a lack of effective action is shameful, particularly in light of the fact that Congress has spent far more time in recess than in session since the first ceremonial meeting of the conference.  I spoke on the floor several times over the last year--on September 8, September 9, October 21, March 21, March 28, March 29, April 5, April 6, April 13, and today--urging the majority to reconvene the juvenile justice conference. I have joined with Senators, both in writing and on the floor, to request the Senate leadership let us complete our work on the conference and send a good bill to the President. We should not delay simply because some powerful gun lobbies do not want us to pass even the most modest gun safety legislation; even the modest provision that closes this huge loophole we now have for gun shows where somebody in a flea market can sell firearms to felons.  On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde, calling for an open meeting of the conference. On March 3 of this year, after another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative Conyers and I wrote again to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has been resounding silence.  Even a bipartisan letter on April 11 from the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde, and the Ranking Democrat, John Conyers, to the Republican Senate chairman of the conference, Senator Hatch, has not succeeded in getting the conference back to work. We have to find time, or at least the will, to pass balanced, comprehensive juvenile crime legislation. This is something that could be signed into law today, or within a day after being passed. This is legislation we passed by a 73-25 margin, and then we hold it in abeyance because the gun lobbyists said do not touch this.  What have we done in the meantime? We keep having a number of proposed constitutional amendments. Last month, it was a proposed constitutional amendment regarding the flag. I spoke at the beginning and end of that debate to urge the Senate to turn to completing our work on the juvenile crime bill, health care reform legislation, on minimum wage legislation, on privacy legislation, on confirming the Federal judges needed in our courts around the country, and all the other matters that have been sidetracked this year. But rather than doing the legislative work that we should do first and foremost, we are now going to turn our attention to another constitutional amendment, this one with regard to crime victims' rights.  I believe constitutional amendments, if they are brought up, should be approached seriously. The distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from California have approached it seriously. But that means a real, serious debate. If we are going to amend the Constitution of the United States, we should do it seriously. Instead, late on Thursday, after we voted to adopt an adjournment resolution, and everybody had left for the airport, the majority leader came to the floor to move to proceed to this matter. I do not think constitutional amendments should be a time filler to be called upon when we do not want to proceed to legislative items. Nor is a constitutional amendment the type of item that should be rushed through Senate consideration. It should be explored and thoughtfully considered. If we are going to start having constitutional amendments rather than legislative matters, then let's set aside a good period of time--a few weeks--to talk about this one.  Let's talk about the others that should come up. I can think of at least two. Let's have a constitutional amendment debate on abortion. For those who think Roe v. Wade should be the law of the land, let's write it into the Constitution. For those who think it should not be, this is the chance to overrule the Supreme Court. Let's settle once and for all this whole constitutional issue on abortion. Let's have a constitutional amendment on that. I am perfectly willing to move forward with that. Even though I have stated my strong positions on this issue, let's have a debate on it.  There are those who are concerned about whether we have too many gun rights and those who think we do not have enough. Maybe we should have a gun amendment to clarify the second amendment. Maybe we should get theseissues out of the way once and for all. We can spend a few weeks on each one of these. We can be done by late August, and the Senate will have spoken as to how they think it should be done.  The last two times the Senate debated the so-called balanced budget amendment, those debates consumed a number of weeks, as they should. This was a palliative I happened to oppose. We were told that without a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we could never balance the budget. Many of us said if we did our work and wrote the legislation the right way we could. Of course, that is exactly what happened. We did not need a constitutional amendment after all. We are now debating how to spend the budget surpluses because we balanced the budget without a constitutional amendment.  This proposed amendment is of similar length and additional complexity and will require some time to debate, as we did with the balanced budget amendment.  In addition, of course, this is the first time this amendment will be debated by the Senate. It has never been debated by the House. So there is a lot of new ground to cover. If we are to pass it, I know the House will want to look to our debate. I assume there will be weeks of debate on it, as there should be. It is a legitimate issue.  I think it can be handled statutorily, but if we are going to do it in the Constitution, we should spend the weeks necessary to make sure we get it right.  By way of illustration, the Judiciary Committee took more than 6 months to file its report on the proposed amendment, even though a similar measure had been the subject of a report last Congress. I note that the majority views in the committee report run over 40 pages. The principal sponsors, Senators Kyl and Feinstein, added a statement of their own additional views on top of those. I urge all Senators to read them because they are worth reading. I note that the minority views, in which I join with Senators Kennedy, Kohl, and Feingold, extend over 35 pages. I think they are well worth reading. There is a lot of discussion in them.  We will vote today on the majority leader's motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I will not oppose invoking cloture on the motion to proceed. In fact, I urge Senators to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. I hope it will be a 100-0 vote. But once we proceed to consideration of this measure, my colleagues should understand that it is an important matter that will require some extensive debate, and we will see serious and substantial amendments to this proposal. I have heard from both sides of the aisle. I told the distinguished Senator from California that I will offer a statutory alternative in the days ahead that can move the cause of crime victims' rights forward immediately by a simple majority vote, without the additional complications and delays the constitutional amendment ratification process might entail, and without the need to return to Congress to draft, introduce, and pass implementing legislation. There will be other amendments, as I have said.  I know the distinguished sponsors of this amendment have been through more than 60 drafts to date. This is not an easy issue. It is hardly fixed in stone. It has not had Senate scrutiny. In fact, a number of Senators told me when they came back from the recess that they were surprised to know this was coming up because it was added to the agenda after we had voted to adjourn for the Easter recess. Many Senators are surprised it is before us. I have told them the proposed constitutional amendment is important. I think its meanings and mandates have to be explored.  In my personal view--and I actually note this with some sadness--the focus on the constitutional amendment has actually had the unintended consequence of slowing the pace of victims' rights legislation over the past several years. I am reminded of the debate we had year after year of the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. President Reagan, who submitted budgets with the biggest deficits in the Nation's history, would always give great speeches about needing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Of course, I used to tell him: There you go again. All you had to do was introduce a balanced budget and let us vote on it. Instead, he introduced budgets, as was his right as President, with enormous deficits, and then a few days later gave a speech saying: I wish we had a constitutional amendment to balance the budget so we could balance this budget.  A President came along who did balance the budget. It was a very tough vote. I remember that vote in 1993. By a 1-vote margin in the House--no Republicans voted to balance the budget, which means cutting a whole lot of programs--no Republicans voted for it. It passed by a 1-vote margin in the House. It was a tie vote in the Senate. Vice President Gore had to preside and cast the deciding vote for a balanced budget.  It was tough. A lot of special interest groups from the right to the left saw their programs nailed, but it was the only way to balance the budget, and we balanced it. The stock market and the various financial markets took note: This is serious; they really are serious. That vote began this huge economic surge in this country. I do recall some on the other side saying: Why, if we vote to balance the budget, we are going to have enormous layoffs, 20 percent unemployment, we are going to have a depression, we are going to have a recession--all these things. Instead, the economy has created the most jobs ever in the history of our Nation. We have had the greatest economic expansion in our Nation's history and an enormous budget surplus. That is what happened, but it took a tough vote, not a palliative of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget; a tough vote.  A lot of Democrats who were courageous enough to actually vote to balance the budget were defeated the next year because they had to cast such unpopular votes to balance the budget. They did the right thing, and their children and grandchildren will bless them for it.  I have argued that rather than look again, in this case victims' rights, to a constitutional amendment, we should be looking at a statutory way, the same way we did with the balanced budget. I wish the Senate was considering the Victims Assistance Act, S. 934, and its extensive provisions to improve crime victims' rights and protections now and do that during this debate. Instead of during the next several weeks debating the constitutional amendment, why don't we debate S. 934?  I wish we would consider our Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, that helps protect our seniors from nursing home fraud and abuse and creates protections for victims of telemarketing fraud. These senior citizens who are abused in nursing homes and who are ripped off from telemarketing frauds are victims also.  I wish the Senate would consider a number of the scores of additional legislative proposals that would assist crime victims. Instead of the weeks we will spend on this constitutional amendment, why don't we debate the Violence Against Women Act II, S. 51, that my friend, Senator Biden, has championed? That bill will continue and improve important and effective programs for domestic violence victims and other victims of crime. The aid to those victims of crime would be immediate.  Senator Wellstone has introduced the International Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection Act, S. 600. It has received little attention, but it should be debated. He also sponsored the Battered Women's Economic Security and Safety Act, S. 1069, and the Children Who Witness Domestic Violence Protection Act, S. 1321. These bills were introduced to improve the safety and security of these victims, but they are not being considered.  It is said that we do not have time, but we are going to spend several weeks on a constitutional amendment that would still have to go through the other body, and would still have to go to the States for approval and ratification. During those several weeks, we could be debating those pieces of legislation for victims.  Senators Snowe, Hutchison, Grams, Ashcroft, Smith, Abraham, Hatch, Edwards, Durbin, Torricelli, and others have sponsored legislation to help crime victims, but I do not think we are going to consider them. We aregoing to debate a proposed constitutional amendment. We will spend several weeks on something that is not self-executing but would require additional follow-on legislation in any event, but we are told we do not have time to debate, again, legislation which could apply help to victims this summer.  So as we turn to this constitutional debate, I observe it is not a matter on which the immediate filing of a cloture motion would be appropriate. I urge all Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. But if we are serious about debating this measure, then we should debate it. The distinguished Senator from Arizona should have all the time he needs to talk about it. The distinguished Senator from California should have all the time she needs to talk about it. Other Senators who strongly support it should have all the time they need. But a number of Senators who disagree with them ought to have time to speak, too.  If it means setting aside other legislative agenda, then let's do so. We have a short legislative calendar filled with recesses as it is. Do away with a couple of the recesses and devote a significant portion of that time to this. It is not my first choice. I would prefer to go to legislative matters on the calendar. But if we are going to bring up a constitutional amendment, let's do it right.  I hope once we turn to the measure, the majority leader will recognize the inappropriateness of filing a cloture motion on this unexplored, proposed constitutional amendment. When that course was followed in 1995 in connection with the constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress, it short circuited the debate and prevented any serious consideration or amendment.  But then I suspect in that case it was because a lot of the people who said they were for term limits never wanted to actually vote on term limits. We have had people in this body who have been for term limits before I was born, people who have come back here 20 and 30 and 40 years to the Congress saying: We have to do something about term limits. They are so determined they will stay here if it takes them 100 years. If they have to serve for 100 years to get term limits, they will do it. It is probably why we have never voted on term limits, because it is a lot easier to talk about it than to vote on it. It is like a balanced budget; it is a lot easier to talk about it than to vote on it.  But we have a serious matter here. It has never been considered by the Senate, so we should talk about it. I think it could erect technical problems for important amendments such as proposals of statutory alternatives. But both the supporters and the opponents should know that we should have debate on it.  We have had a number of people, conservative commentators such as George Will and Stewart Taylor, who have spoken out strongly against it. We have had liberal commentators who have spoken out against it.  We have editorials from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others who have opposed it--people ranging from Chief Justice William Rehnquist to Bud Welch, the father of one of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.  I ask unanimous consent that a partial list of those opponents be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    List of Opponents of S.J.
