Speaker, this is a day for the history books. Sometimes history sneaks up on us. Sometimes we have 2,130 baseball games to watch as a preface to history.  We in Maryland, of course, are incredibly proud, but that pride is shared with all Americans and, indeed, all peoples of the world who love responsibility, who love and admire courage, who love and admire people who have their priorities correct.  This morning, on this day of history, Cal Ripken, Jr., took the hand of his little girl, Rachel, and took her to school. Today, a day of history, we honor two of the greatest Americans who have ever graced this Nation, Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken, Jr.; two individuals, as the previous speaker indicated, who personify what we believe is good in people, not boastful, not self-interested, but dedicated to the values that all of us hold dear.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the House will be doing at 5:30 or 6:30 or 7:30 or 8:30 tonight, but I would hope that every American not privileged as I will be to be at Camden Yards, will be watching their televisions, listening to their radios as we celebrate one of the great accomplishments in sport, the 2,131st consecutive game to be played by Cal Ripken, Jr.  I know there will be tears in my eyes as I exult with all America on this historic accomplishment by a good and decent fellow citizen.                          ____________________
