 President, if we listen to parents, if we listen to teachers, if we listen to principals, if we listen to school board members, and if we listen to our children, we will hear what the American public truly wants and knows is right. Parents say it, teachers say it, studies prove it: Smaller class sizes will make a difference in our children's ability to learn.  My amendment simply says that it is the sense of the Congress that we will move forward in any way we can to make sure that class sizes in this country are reduced to manageable levels.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
