At this year's banquet, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will recognize and honor the 2008 apprentice graduates. The individuals who have completed the apprentice training in 2008 are: Sonny Armato, Ben Buchholz, Nick Goodman, Chad Hofferth, Timothy LaMere, Mario Lopez, Robert Matthews, Kamilah Weaver, Jacob Wesley, and David Young.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and selfless dedication.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated and hardworking individuals. Along with the other men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
