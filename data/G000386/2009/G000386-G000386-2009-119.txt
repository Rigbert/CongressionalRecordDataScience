 President, today I am introducing the Clean Renewable Energy Advancement Tax Extension Jobs Act of 2009, or the CREATE Jobs Act of 2009 for short. This is a bill to help all kinds of businesses create jobs and continue pushing ahead on the development of clean renewable energy. My bill extends the tax credit for the production of electricity from wind and open-loop biomass through December 31, 2016.  It increases the amount of bond authority for new clean renewable energy bonds to incentivize more clean renewable energy projects and the jobs created by these projects. For all businesses, my bill extends bonus depreciation for 1 year, so that businesses are able to deduct half of the value of any property placed in service in 2010.  This tax cut for businesses that invest in new property in 2010 will spur investment in clean energy projects, as well as other new projects, and that will create badly needed jobs.  I urge my colleagues to help me in getting this important legislation enacted into law as soon as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2826       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
