I wish to ask the Senator from Texas, since he has used that repeatedly on the floor, is he aware of the fact that when I was asked about the relationship between the path to citizenship and border enforcement, it was in the context of the Cornyn amendment which established a percentage requirement as part of border enforcement? Is the Senator aware that the bill itself includes a dramatic commitment to resources on the border of the Senator's State with the nation of Mexico--literally doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and billions of dollars being spent to make sure we stop as much as humanly possible illegal immigration--and that before the path to citizenship, the bill requires an E-Verify system as well as an exit-entry visa system? Is the Senator aware that is not included in that reference he has made to my statement?
