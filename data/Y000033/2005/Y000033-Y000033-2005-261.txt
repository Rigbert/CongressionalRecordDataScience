Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota. He has been a real ally in this legislation, and he knows how well we work together and how important to this Nation it is to pass this bill. This is a team effort within a committee that has been very, very bipartisan over the period of time that I have served on it, for the last, actually, 12 years, and even before that. This committee has a record of that, and he has continued that. I think it is crucially important for those watching this on television to know that there are committees that do work hand-in-hand together for the betterment of this Nation, and for that, I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).
