 President, today I honor Linda Cannon, deputy director of intergovernmental relations for the city of Seattle, who is retiring after serving over 35 years with the city.  Ms. Cannon's legacy can be seen throughout the city. She has served for many years as the city's primary contact with the U.S. military as it relates to the base realignment and closure process. The most significant of these projects was her work on the ongoing redevelopment of Sand Point, a former Naval Air Station and later Support Activity Center for the Navy, closed in 1991. Linda served as the key staff person coordinating with the Navy, community members, Native American tribes, and a host of interest groups over the redevelopment of this significant resource. Linda worked to balance all these interests while ensuring that the values of the community were also upheld. The crown jewel of this redevelopment is Warren G. Magnuson Park which honors Washington State's late great Senator Magnuson. Her leadership throughout this process has been critical to its success.  Ms. Cannon also served as a mentor and trusted colleague to hundreds of city staff through the years. She is known for her grace under pressure, her clearheaded approach to problems, and keeping everything in perspective. Her attitude and work ethic always served as a model for those around her.  Ms. Cannon represents the best of public service in this country. Her professionalism, integrity, institutional knowledge, and understanding of the role of public employees in serving the people have been a huge asset to the city and will be sorely missed. There are hundreds of thousands of public servants around the country like Ms. Cannon who are quietly serving their communities every day. We all should be grateful for their dedication and service. I would like to wish Ms. Cannon the best in her retirement and a heartfelt thank you.                          ____________________
