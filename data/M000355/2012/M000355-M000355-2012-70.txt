 I ask consent that the next vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2535 be vitiated and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4089, which is at the desk and is the House-passed Sportsmen's Heritage Act, the bill be read a third time and passed with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table.  For the record, again, this will allow a bill to get to the President's desk immediately.
