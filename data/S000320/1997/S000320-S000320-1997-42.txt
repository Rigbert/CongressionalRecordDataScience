 As Senator Durbin knows, the committee has worked with him over the years to fund various Metra expansion projects, most recently a new service line--the North Central Service. I appreciate his leadership on this project.  Metra expansion is vitally important to the Chicago/Northern Illinois service region. The Metra project is certainly a priority new start transit project that is worthy of Federal funding.  I will work with Senator Lautenberg and our House colleagues in the conference committee to make sure that the Senator's interests in this important project are represented at the conference committee.  I look forward to working with Senator Durbin on this project in the years to come.
