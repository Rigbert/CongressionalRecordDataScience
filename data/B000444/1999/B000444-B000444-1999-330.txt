 President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a few thoughts on the announcement that Treasury Secretary Rubin will be leaving his job in July.  It is hard to believe how far we have come in the six and a half years of Bob Rubin's tenure at the Treasury Department. Our most fundamental ideas of how the world works--at least the world of economics and finance--have been transformed during his leadership of President Clinton's economic team.  In our domestic finances, Mr. President, we have gone from a generation of seemingly intractable federal deficits to a new era of budget surpluses. It turns out that it is no easier to make budget policy now than it was before--in fact, it is probably harder. But the federal government is paying its own way now, and the payoff in the private economy--strong growth, low and stable interest rates, international confidence in the dollar--are there for everyone to see.  As someone who came to the Senate over a quarter of a century ago, I can tell my colleagues that there has been no more fundamental change in the way we do business around here.  And virtually everyone agrees that Bob Rubin's influence was the deciding factor in this Administration's successful fight to restore balance and responsibility to our federal budget. If that were his only legacy, it would put him in the pantheon of our greatest Treasury Secretaries.  But Bob Rubin has left his mark on the international economy as well. The United States--restored to its historic role as the strongest and most influential economy in the world--was the indispensable leader during the financial crisis that shook international markets in the last two years. And it was Secretary Rubin's credibility that was on the line as international financial institutions like the IMF scrambled to meet the first financial crisis of the new global economy.  Because he knew what key financial markets needed to see and hear from policy makers--and because he knew the strengths and the weaknesses of those markets first hand--his guidance was the essential ingredient that contained the damage from that crisis.  Today, in the calm after the storm, there is still a lot of rebuilding to do--and too much troubling weakness in too many economies to say that the crisis is over. But it is not too early to say that the crisis was a direct challenge America's leadership in the world's economy, and Bob Rubin kept us on top.  I might add that among the many facets of that financial crisis, Secretary Rubin had to invest his considerable energy, skills, and reputation to get this Congress to provide the funds necessary for the IMF to do its job. If they gave medals in his line of work, Mr. President, he would have one for that campaign, too.  Robert Rubin was the recognized leader--with all of the heat that can come in that position--in two of the biggest economy stories of this decade: the battle against the deficit and the global financial crisis. His decisiveness, clarity of purpose, and calm persistence made a difference in this history of our time.  I noticed, Mr. President, that the financial markets genuflected yesterday at the news of Secretary Rubin's impending departure. They dipped for a while at the initial disappointment, but inevitably they recovered because his replacement is an equally formidable--and tested--veteran of thosesame battles that have made Bob Rubin's reputation.  Larry Summers, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, has earned Bob Rubin's confidence as his envoy to key countries in critical negotiations in the global financial crisis and in many other important jobs. He inherits a healthy economy, sound federal finances, and a strong team at the Treasury Department. But if the past few years are any guide, Mr. President, he will not lack for challenges.  I noticed that he thanked his teachers today in accepting the new opportunity President Clinton has offered him. Surely he had no more valuable teacher than Bob Rubin. That should give us all confidence that the Treasury Department remains in good hands.                          ____________________
