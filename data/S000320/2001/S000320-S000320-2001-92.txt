 President, I rise today to introduce the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act of 2001. My bill would completely eliminate the unjust taxation of Social Security benefits by the end of 2005. The premise of my legislation is simple: Social Security benefits were never intended to be taxed. At its inception and continuing on for the next fifty years, Social Security benefits were exempt from taxation. Budgetary shortfalls in 1984 and 1993, however, led to the taxation of these benefits. The economic situation of America is now such that the continued taxation of Social Security benefits is wasteful and unnecessary.  Under the current law, beneficiaries of Social Security are taxed on as much as 85 percent of their benefits. Furthermore, under the latest changes made by the Clinton Administration, some older Americans find themselves in a situation where for every dollar they earn over a threshold amount, $1.85 is subject to tax. In addition to being fundamentally and logically unfair, I believe such taxation provides senior citizens with a strong disincentive to work. In other words, taxation of benefits creates a situation where many senior citizens decide to not work rather than to earn additional income which may trigger taxation of their Social Security benefits.  Working senior citizens add a wealth of knowledge and experience to the workplace. As such, we must make sure that our American workforce is not deprived of these valuable assets. Our laws should encourage, not discourage, older Americans with a desire to work to continue contributing to our society. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening today.  Despite disincentives to work, many older Americans are forced to do so to be able to pay for living expenses, healthcare, prescription drugs and other essentials. To these people, every penny counts in determining whether they are able to meet these costs. However, when we tax Social Security benefits, we make it virtually impossible for millions of older Americans to make ends meet. In effect, taxation of Social Security benefits forces many Americans to endure stressful situations in what should be a special time of their lives. Clearly, we cannot allow such an unjust situation to continue.  The taxation of Social Security benefits impacts a wide segment of society, including a large portion of the middle class. For example, a person with $35,000 in income and $10,000 in benefits pays almost $1,000 more in taxes than he or she would, had the Clinton-Gore increase not been enacted. By repealing the 1993 Clinton-Gore increase, as wellas the 1984 tax on Social Security benefits, my bill would give millions of Americans the financial freedom and security they deserve.  Mr. President, every day my office receives letters and calls from older Americans throughout the country voicing their opinions on the taxation of Social Security benefits. Their message is clear--stop the unfair taxation of these benefits. I ask my colleagues to listen to their constituents and to do the right thing by joining me in support of this bill.                                 ______                                       By
