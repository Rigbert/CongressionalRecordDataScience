President, what we have tried to do with this bill is very carefully balance the need for effective, improved security with the need to ensure that we are not crippling our international trading system. We now have 11 million shipping containers coming into this country each year. This is a number that has grown substantially in recent years. We know each one has the potential to be the Trojan horse of the 21st century, to include not consumer goods but perhaps terrorists themselves, the makings of a dirty bomb, a chemical, biological, or even nuclear weapon.  That is why the legislation that we have authored proposes a strong, effective, layered system of security. It focuses on the ports of origin. It focuses on each container to make sure that it is effectively evaluated, and it has a system for securing the entire supply chain that is called the C-TPAT system.
