Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Cora Alice ``Cam''McCarrey Bohman for her 50th year in music instruction in the state of Alaska.  I would like to recognize Cam for her dedication and contributions to music education throughout her career in Tok and Anchorage. Thousands of Alaskan youths state-wide have benefitted from Cam's work. She has served in both middle school and high school as a choir teacher, community choral director, vocal coach, music adjudicator, and music director. Cam continues to serve as the Music Coordinator for the Alaska School Activities Association.  This year, Cam received the 2016 ``Alaska's Mother of Achievement'' award from the national organization, American Mothers. This award recognizes ``those outstanding women whose positive influence, talents, and community service have made a significant impact in the lives of children and families.'' Cam's alumni music students nominated her for the award. I would also like to note that in 2014, Cam received the State of Alaska Governor's award for arts advocacy. These are only two examples of Cam's many honors.  Cam inspired countless students to join choir, and each school year her classes reached the all-time high of about 300 total students. Recently, students at South High School in Anchorage made a documentary titled ``Unwritten Song'' to highlight the importance of elective teachers and featured Cam's influence on generations of Alaskans.  I commend Cam for her 50 years of service and know she will continue to make Alaska a better place through her excellence.                          ____________________
