 In recent days, our colleagues across the aisle have forced two failed votes on similar resolutions. One would have cut taxes for the wealthiest residents in blue States at the expense of working families everywhere else. The other would have resurrected an Obama-era proposal to bury American energy under redtape.  Both of those efforts failed, but our Democratic colleagues are back at it--back at it--with another bad policy. This time, they would like to reverse Trump administration guidance that has reduced healthcare premiums for American families and reaffirmed protections for those with preexisting conditions.  Section 1332 of ObamaCare gives States the opportunity to escape some of that law's worst burdens. States have the opportunity to apply for waivers that allow for more types of health insurance plans and more options for consumers.  More than a dozen States have already had these waivers approved, not just red States. Democratic Governors in places like Colorado, Delaware, and Rhode Island have applied for and received these waivers. Where Governors of both parties are embracing this opportunity, good things are happening. According to one analysis, in the seven States where new waivers were implemented during the Trump administration, it seems that premiums declined--declined--by 7.5 percent.  The Trump administration guidance continues this success and gives States even more of what they asked for--even more flexibility to escape ObamaCare's burdens and more choices for consumers and lower premiums. But, apparently, our Democratic colleagues are not terribly fond of letting States shake off the unhelpful strictures of ObamaCare. Perhaps, it makes their signature law look bad that Governors of both parties are so eager to escape it.  That can't be their public argument. In their effort to reduce this flexibility, some Democrats are rehashing tired, old claims about a conspiracy to hurt Americans with preexisting conditions. Republicans have been clear, and we have been consistent. We support protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.  The CMS Administrator, Seema Verma, has specifically stated that ``a section 1332 waiver cannot undermine coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.'' That is the head of CMS.  In fact, it is this Trump administration's policy that will help American families, including those with preexisting conditions, by helping to bring down the soaring premiums and restore the dwindling options that ObamaCare's failures have brought about.  I urge the Senate to reject this misguided resolution. We don't need healthcare policy from the supporters of ``Medicare for None,'' Democrats' grand scheme to take away the health insurance plans of 180 million Americans and replace it with a one-size-fits-all government plan. Americans deserve more say, not less.                          ____________________
