President, international trade is one of the best ways to create more good-paying jobs for our people--as long as our workers and our companies are treated fairly in the tough global markets in which they compete.  That is not the case today. Chinese trade cheats, after being found guilty of dumping their goods in America, now launder these goods by illegally shipping them through Korea and other countries. This illegality is undercutting our workers, undercutting our companies, and is driving hard-working Americans out of jobs. All this is taking place under the sleepy eyes of America's so-called trade enforcement agencies.  Because this trade rip-off is growing and the Senate will soon take up trade agreements that could fix this problem, I wish to take just a few minutes this afternoon to make clear how this scam actually works.
