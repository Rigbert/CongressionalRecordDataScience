President, since this is the first time I have spoken on the Senate floor since the elections have been completed, let me say I am very honored the people of Maine have chosen me to represent them in the Senate for another 6 years. It is a great honor and privilege to represent the great State of Maine, and I want to begin my remarks this afternoon by acknowledging that.                          ____________________
