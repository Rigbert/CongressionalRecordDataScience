Speaker, Christmas has come early for the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, and it is going to be presented as a very large and complex piece of legislation that as yet no rank and file Member of Congress, no Democrat on this side of the Hill, has been able to review, and it will be voted on later this week.  It is being cast as simply a pharmaceutical benefit for seniors and some sort of a revision of Medicare to make it competitive and so on and so forth. But what it really is is legislation that was written by and for the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, the most powerful lobbies in this country and the most generous of campaign contributors, particularly to the President and the Republican Party; and it is first and foremost designed to protect their profits. In fact, perhaps we should call it the ``Pharmaceutical Promotion and Profits Protection Act.'' That would be an apt title.  Boston University School of Public Health has analyzed the bill and they said, 61 percent of the benefits will flow as increased profits to the pharmaceutical industry. The bill specifically prohibits the Government of the United States of America, on behalf of America's seniors and, indeed, all of the American people, to do anything to lower the extortionate price of prescription drugs in the United States. In fact, it closes the door on the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, which is the only relief that many Americans are able to find today. Oh, they say, well, we do not close the door; we are going to give the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify whether or not American-manufactured, FDA-approved pharmaceuticals that have had a short vacation in Canada, where their price goes down by 50 percent or more, would be safe if they flowed back into the United States. And, of course, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in his wisdom, has already said that he will not find them to be safe, just to reassure the industry. So they will give him a power which he will not use, or which he has already arbitrarily decided.  In fact, it is arguable that the chain of custody of drugs in Canada is safer than in the United States of America, and it would be arguable that, in fact, those drugs would be safer than those that are sometimes made available in the system here because of unregulated, unlicensed pharmacies, and phoney, closed-door pharmacies and other things that were exposed recently in a series by the Washington Post. But nonetheless, we are going to act to protect here, and what we are really protecting, the Congress will vote, and I am sure the House willvote; the President is proposing and the conference committee has proposed to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry.  Then, not to leave out the insurance industry, because they are almost as generous in their campaign contributions, we are going to set up a new market for them where we will subsidize the private health insurance industry to create competition. Now, is that not ironic?                              {time}  2030  The only industry in the United States of America exempted from antitrust law, an industry which can, and does, legally fix prices, collude with their so-called competitors, and, you know, collude also to determine who they might cover or not cover, we are going to bring about competition by subsidizing them.  There are quite a few seniors in my district that have a rather bitter taste in their mouths about the HMO Medicare+Choice and all these other foolhardy things that have been levied upon them. Those companies walked away one day and left them high and dry. And under this bill they will be able to walk away again and leave people high and dry or they will be able to choose the people they want to cover and tell the rest of them to go over to the Medicare fee-for-service plan which will be more expensive. It will get ever more expensive because all the low-risk people will be moved out and taken by the insurance industry and these subsidized plans until they become high risk, until they have to actually file a claim. That is the way the insurance industry works in America today: they will cover you until you ask them to cover something that you have been paying premiums for. And the next time renewal comes up, sorry, we will not renew you. This does not go on just in health care; it is going on in homeowners and car insurance and everything else. But it is particularly egregious in the area of health care. This bill is going to do nothing to rectify that problem.  Let us look at what the great benefits will be. In the first year, next year, there will be discount cards that will come out before the election so the President can say he did something for people, which will be to give a discount, maybe as much as 15 to 25 percent. That means that seniors will only have to pay 50 to 75 percent more than they would have to pay for those drugs imported from Canada. Oh, what a benefit that is. No, but it is a wonderful windfall for the pharmaceutical industry. They will still be paying prices higher than people covered by other private insurance plans, as are Federal employees, as am I, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and many others; but they will get that juicy 15 to 25 percent discount.  Then the big plan kicks in in 2007. Why 2007? Because people, if it went into effect sooner, if it was such a great deal, people might figure out what a turkey it is before the next election. So they will dangle it out there 4 years in the future and say this will be really great, you just wait. It is so complicated, few people can figure it out. But here are a couple of numbers. A person who pays $1,000 for pharmaceuticals under this great plan would only pay $945 for their pharmaceuticals after they did their premiums and co-payments and deductibles. They would get a benefit of $55 on an annual $1,000 prescription drug benefit.  Well, let us look at someone who has much bigger costs. Someone who pays $3,700, $300 a month. Their benefit would be a grand total of $855. Only about, you know, half of that they could get purchasing the drugs from Canada. This is a sham.                          ____________________
