We're very proud of it.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to the 100th birthday of the late President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, a man who deeply loved our country and who, through the course of his life, changed the world to a better place.  Upon taking office, President Reagan initiated sweeping economic reforms to combat double-digit unemployment and inflation. His policies ended the recession and provided one of the longest peacetime economic booms in our history. I wish we can do that again very soon.  America was also facing a 35-year-long war at that time, the Cold War, and President Reagan never shied away from speaking in defense of freedom. He delivered his courageous address near the infamous Berlin Wall and demanded, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' This was the beginning of the end of the Cold War and the wall would come down 1 year after President Reagan left office.  President Reagan brought so much greatness to the world; and 2 years ago,as a Californian, working with my friend, Elton Gallegly, and others, I had the privilege of initiating the effort to bring the statue of President Reagan to our Nation's Capitol. So those of you who visit the Capitol, I encourage you to go visit the statue. It's a fitting tribute to our former President of the United States. The statue is a constant reminder of his legacy. Today, as we honor his life, we will always remember his words and pledge to forever preserve his vision of America as a shining city on a hill for all mankind to see. God bless America. God bless Ronald Reagan, and thank you for the time.
