 President, I rise to note the sad and sudden passing of a very familiar face to me and to many others around the Capitol.  Steve Mosley had been a fixture on the Capitol Facilities staff for 32 years when he passed away last night--and those of us who knew him will miss his great disposition and all that he did for so many years behind the scenes to keep this place running smoothly.  It has been noted that Steve was a pretty serious Redskins fan. That is an understatement. People who knew him say they can't remember him ever missing a single home game, rain or shine. And he liked to share his enthusiasm for the Skins with colleagues, particularly the Cowboy fans.  But Steve's friends also remember him for his generosity.  Like the time he offered to help set up the wedding reception of one of his colleagues so the colleague would be able to go out and enjoy his bachelor party. Steve never made it to the bachelor party himself. He spent the night making sure everything was ready for the reception.  One colleague recalled the time he wanted to get a limousine for his daughter on prom night but couldn't afford to spend the money. He told Steve about it at work one day, and the night of the prom, Steve showed up at the house in a black Mercedes Benz that he had washed and waxed for the occasion. Not only could the daughter use Steve's car for the prom--she could have him as a chauffeur too. A couple years later, Steve did the same thing for the girl's younger brother.  A lot of us have been here a long time, but few of us have been here as long as Steve was. He loved his job. He took a lot of pride in doing it well. And anytime someone new came on board, they knew they could learn the ropes, and a lot more, from Steve Mosley.  Senator Reid mentioned earlier that the Senate is really a family. And whenever we lose somebody in the Senate, whichever office they are from or duty they perform, we lose a member of the family. And with Steve it is like we are losing one of the elders in that family. He takes a lifetime of proud and service with him and he leaves a distinguished legacy and many friends behind.  So on behalf of the entire Senate, I want to extend our condolences to Steve's wife, Michelle, and to their son, Steven, Jr, for their loss. And I want to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation and my thanks to our friend Steve for his many years of devoted service.  We'll miss him.                          ____________________
