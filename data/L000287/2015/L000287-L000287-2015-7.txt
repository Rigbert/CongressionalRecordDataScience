 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of diplomacy and a pathway to peace.  For many months I thought long and hard about this decision. I attended briefings, read the documents, and met with citizens of my district. I even had a long executive session with myself.  I reflected on the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he called upon us to rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. The way of peace is one of those immutable principles.  And after much study, thought, and reflection, I believe that it is a good deal. No, it may not be perfect. But do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.                              {time}  1100  I remember standing on this very floor several years ago and speaking against the war in Iraq. I said it then, and I will say it again today: ``War is messy; it is bloody; it destroys the hopes, the aspirations, and the dreams of a people.''  The American people--and people around the world--are sick and tired of war and violence. We do not need more bombs, missiles, and guns. When you turn on the news, when you read the newspaper, you see a mass dislocation. Too many people are suffering, and many are desperate for a chance at peace.  I believe in my heart of hearts that this may be the most important vote that we cast during our time in Congress. To put it simply, it is nonviolence or nonexistence.  It is my hope that my vote today, along with the votes of others, will be a downpayment for peace towards a world community at peace with itself.  Maybe with this deal, we will send the message that we can lay down the burdens and tools of war. Maybe we can come together as a family of human beings.  Mr. Speaker, we have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to give peace a chance. Give peace a chance.
