Chairman, reclaiming my time, but would we not at this point, and I am not a lawyer, so I may be disadvantaged in this group because of that, but would we not want to then legislate that? Would we not want to be assured? I do not want to depend upon a future extension of an MOU, memorandum of understanding for those who are listening and do not understand, with this administration for the protection of mines in other States.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Chairman, just to underscore the point, Utah got a sweetheart deal in the settlement, but as my esteemed colleague from Oregon said, California, Colorado, all the rest of the country does not have this deal, so we are all betting on the something. Why not put this memorandum in the underlying bill if it is such a great idea.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would be happy if the chairman wishes to amend by unanimous consent his protections to extend them to private lands, hopefully even military lands and some of these other things, but at least to private lands because it is a particular concern, to do that. That would be acceptable to me.
