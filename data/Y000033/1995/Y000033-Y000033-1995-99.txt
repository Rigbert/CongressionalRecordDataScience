Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman well knows, when this legislation passes the House, the Senate has not passed theirs. You will be on the conference, sitting beside me as we have done all these years, and I will continue to work with the gentleman, because you do raise a valid point.  The attempt here is to allow what is already being done in other areas where we are being told that they do not think they have the authority. This is really a request by the National Marine Fisheries Institute.
