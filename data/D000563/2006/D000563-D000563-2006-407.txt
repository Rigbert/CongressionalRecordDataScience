President, I thank the Republican whip for his remarks. I will address them in the same context, first, the earlier debate, what we are considering in the business of the Senate this week, and finally this bill that is pending before us.  What we have before us this week is a historic decision to make. It is a historic decision because, if the Republican majority prevails and if the bill, which they are asking us to pass, is enacted and signed by the President, what we will do is add dramatically to the national debt of America.  This morning's Washington Post suggested that the repeal of the estate tax will cost us, with interest over a 10-year period of time, about $750 billion.This Federal estate tax affects very few Americans--only those in the highest income categories. It is a tax that is imposed on about 2 out of every 1,000 people who die in the course of a year--2 out of 1,000. So 8,200 families each year will get a tax break if the Republican proposal is enacted. Those families, on average, will be spared paying a Federal tax, on average, of $1.4 million.  When you project that over a long period of time, it means that we will be paying out--I should say not collecting--$750 billion that otherwise would have come into our Treasury.
