 Mancuso's integrity and judgment. At some point down the road, this body may be called upon to confirm or not confirm Mr. Mancuso's nomination because it has been suggested that President Clinton is expected to nominate him to be the next Department of Defense Inspector General.  If that happens, then each Member of this body would need to weigh all the facts bearing on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to serve as the Pentagon's watchdog, which is also the Pentagon's top cop.  In October, my staff on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts issued, for me, a report on the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. I am going to refer to that, as it is always referred to, as the DCIS--Defense Criminal Investigative Service.  I strongly urge my colleagues to read this report. It substantiated allegations of misconduct on the part of senior DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso, and at least one of his investigators, Mr. Mathew Walinsky. Mr. Mancuso at that time was Director of DCIS, and he was so from 1988 until 1997.  Since that report was issued in October, my staff has been inundated with new complaints about alleged misconduct by Mr. Mancuso and mismanagement at DCIS while Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS. My staff is now in the process of evaluating these allegations to determine if they have merit. Once that review has been conducted, I may issue a second report.  Getting back to Mr. Wilson's article in the National Journal, by comparison, instead of my report opening up a new can of worms, Mr. Wilson's article has opened an old can of worms--in this case, Navy worms. It explores Mr. Mancuso's role in the investigation of misconduct at the infamous Tailhook convention in September 1991. By reopening this very unfortunate episode in naval history, Mr. Wilson has shed new light on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to move into the inspector general's slot.  Mr. Wilson reports that the U.S. Court of Military Appeals condemned Mr. Mancuso and the DCIS for, in their words, ``heavy-handed investigative tactics that trampled constitutional rights.'' According to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Mancuso's tactics included ``threats, intimidation, falsification of interviews, and overreliance on lie detectors.''  In an opinion issued on January 11, 1994, on the Tailhook case, the U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced Mr. Mancuso's tactics. The court compared the Tailhook case review process, which was set up by Mr. Mancuso, to sort of an assembly line justice, where investigative and judicial functions were merged and blurred. ``Merged'' and ``blurred'' are words the court used. ``Assembly line'' are words the court used. The court called Mr. Mancuso's assembly line justice ``troublesome.''  Going on to quote the court:       At best, it reflects a most curiously careless and      amateurish approach to a very high profile case by      experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it      raises the possibility of a shadiness in respecting the      rights of military members caught up in a criminal      investigation that cannot be condoned.  That is what the U.S. Court of Military Appeals had to say. That is the highest military court in our land. It is often called the United States Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces. So this highest court has condemned Mr. Mancuso for ``shadiness.'' The court said his practices were ``careless and amateurish'' and even ``troublesome.'' The court said he and his investigators failed to respect the constitutional rights of members of the armed services.  I hope the Chair will agree that these are very serious charges about a person whom the President may nominate for our confirmation as inspector general of the Department of Defense. The court's criticism--again referring to the Court of Military Appeals--may help to explain why the Tailhook investigation was a total failure. The entire investigation probably cost the taxpayers close to $10 million and involved several thousand interviews. Unfortunately, not one single naval aviator who faced an assault charge was ever convicted by a court-martial.  As the Director of DCIS, Mr. Mancuso led the Tailhook investigation. He is accountable for failing to conduct it as a professional. A legitimate question for my colleagues and for the President: Should that same man, a man who used shady investigative tactics, a man who failed to respect naval judicial process in Tailhook, be confirmed as the Pentagon's watchdog? It is legitimate to ask if Mr. Mancuso is the best person to fill that position.  I leave those thoughts with my colleagues over the next several weeks as this nomination may come up for consideration.  I yield the floor.                             Exhibit No. 1             [From the National Journal, January 22, 2000]           Tailhook May Soil Choice for Pentagon's Mr. Clean                         (By George C. Wilson)       The man President Clinton is expected to nominate as      inspector general of the Defense Department--the Pentagon's      top cop--is coming under increased scrutiny in the Senate for      questionable official conduct. Questions surround his role in      the Tailhook sexual assault investigation of the early 1990s      and his handling of his own investigators, one of whom      pleaded guilty to stealing a 13-year-old boy's identity to      obtain a false passport.       Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon's acting inspector general and      probable nominee for the permanent job, formerly led the      Defense Criminal Investigative Service. DCIS, which conducts      most of the fraud and misconduct investigations at the      Defense Department, had taken over the Tailhook investigation      in 1992 after the Navy was accused of botching it.       During the Tailhook investigation, naval aviators accused      Mancuso's agents of heavy-handed tactics that trampled their      constitutional rights. These tactics, they maintained,      included threats, intimidation, falsification of interviews,      and overreliance on lie detectors. In the end, no aviator was      convicted at court-martial for misconduct at the Tailhook      convention, which was held in September 1991 at the Las Vegas      Hilton.       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals, in its review of the      Tailhook cases, criticized military lawyers and the IG's      investigators--who were supervised by Mancuso--for procedures      that were ``troublesome.'' The court faulted investigators      for an approach that was ``curiously careless and      amateurish,'' and that didn't sufficiently respect the rights      of suspects.       Several lawyers who defended Tailhook aviators told      National Journal that they stand ready to cite examples of      misconduct by DCIS agents if the Mancuso nomination moves      forward. Their testimony could widen and escalate a battle      over Mancuso that Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, began at the      end of the past congressional session. White House attorneys      had focused on Grassley's earlier objections, but they      apparently had not looked into Mancuso's Tailhook role when      they told National Journal recently that they saw no reason      to recommend he not be nominated.       Grassley up to now had focused his objections on Mancuso's      supposedly poor judgment while director of the Defense      Criminal Investigative Service from 1988-97. Grassley accused      Mancuso of coddling a deputy after the deputy confessed to      stealing a dead boy's identity in an effort to get a false      passport for still-mysterious reasons.       Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has mounted a stout      defense of Mancuso and has told Grassley that none of the      Senator's objections should bar him from advancement.      However, the Tailhook connection, which Grassley's      investigators have just begun to probe, may turn the Mancuso      nomination into a ``bolter''--pilot talk for an airplane that      misses the arresting wires stretched across an aircraft-     carrier deck and so fails to land. Grassley will do his best      to exploit the Tailhook connection in hearings and on the      Senate floor. Former Navy Secretary John W. Warner, R-Va.,      chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would      hold confirmation hearings on a Mancuso nomination, is likely      to plead with the President not to nominate anybody who would      pull Congress back into the Tailhook swamp.       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced the tactics of      Mancuso's agents in an opinion issued on Jan. 11, 1994, on a      Tailhook case against Navy Lt. David Samples. The defendant      had been charged with participating in the ``gantlet'' in      which drunken pilots groped, and in some cases assaulted,      dozens of women who ventured down the third-floor hallway at      the Hilton. Samples charged that he endured his own intensive      gantlet of interrogations as one naval     officer after another advised him to tell what he knew and,      in his view, guaranteed him complete immunity if he did.      After undergoing the Navy interviews, he was immediately      interrogated by DCIS in assembly line fashion.       In court testimony, Special Agent Matthew A. Walinsky of      DCIS attributed the assembly line idea to DCIS Director      Mancuso: ``We felt that, or the director [of the] DCIS felt      that, it was one of the ways that we could have a resolution      in the case and be fair to everybody that was involved in      [the] case, so that they would have a walk-away'' from any      further entanglement in the Tailhook mess.       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals assailed the      arrangement: ``The assembly line technique in this case that      merged and blurred investigative and justice procedures is      troublesome. At best, it reflects a most curiously careless      and amateurish approach to a very high profile case by      experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it      raises the possibility of a shadiness in respecting the      rights of military members caught up in a criminal      investigation that cannot be condoned.''       Mancuso, when asked by National Journal to respond to the      court's denunciation, said: ``The quote [from the decision]      was taken out of context and exhibits a lack of understanding      of the technique being discussed. . . . DCIS played a minor      role in the `assembly line technique' as described in the      opinion. The DCIS investigation of the Tailhook matter was      handled thoroughly and professionally.''       But Charles W. Gittins of Middletown, Va., a defense      attorney in the Tailhook case, charged in an interview with      National Journal that Mancuso's DCIS agents ``routinely      violated naval officers' rights with threats of retribution      for failure to cooperate,'' Gittins said that Mancuso's      supervision of his investigators ``left much to be desired. I      would have concern if Mancuso became IG about his integrity      and commitment to the rule of law.'' He added he would      welcome the chance to give such testimony to Congress.       Robert B. Rae of Virginia Beach, Va., another Tailhook      defense attorney and a former U.S. attorney, said that      Mancuso ``abused his position [as DCIS director] and showed a      general disregard for laws of military justice'' during the      Tailhook investigation. ``He intentionally failed to      comply with the judge's order to produce evidence and      documents on several occasions. We need somebody [as      inspector general] who makes the ethical decision, not the      politically correct one. He [Mancuso] was politically      motivated.''       Mancuso told National Journal that ``while I don't remember      being directly involved with either of these defense counsels      during the Tailhook investigation, it is not unusual for      defense counsels to disagree with the government's      investigation techniques. I categorically deny that I have      ever intentionally failed to comply with any judge's order.''      He said that as DCIS director, he worked to ensure that both      sides received all requested information promptly.       As Pentagon inspector general, Mancuso would be responsible      for supervising 1,228 employees, including 323 criminal      investigators, and for overseeing a budget of $136.8 million      annually. He would be paid a salary of $118,400 a year.       Grassley is particularly vexed about what Mancuso did--and      did not do--about Larry Joe Hollingsworth, a deputy at DCIS      who was responsible for keeping agents in line, but who      committed a felony that a hearing judge termed ``bizarre.''      In 1992, Hollingsworth found in the records of a Florida      library the obituary of Charles W. Drew, who died at age 13.      Hollingsworth decided to assume the boy's identity. And by      posing as the deceased boy's half brother, Hollingsworth      obtained the identification papers he needed to apply for a      passport in Charles' name. He appended pictures of himself to      the passport application and signed it in such a muddled way      that the State Department investigated, leading to      Hollingsworth's arrest, indictment, and confession to one      count of fraud.       Why would a 46-year-old, $92,926-a-year Pentagon executive      with more than 20 years' experience investigating other      people's crimes commit one himself? ``In the last few      years,'' Hollingsworth wrote right after his arrest, ``I have      seen repeated news stories about how easy it would be'' to      assume someone else's identity. ``I decided to see if it was      true. This was a Walter Mitty fantasy, however, for      excitement and not to hurt anyone.''       Special Agent Sean O'Brien of the State Department told      investigators with Grassley's Senate Judiciary Administrative      Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee that ``there were at      least 12 overt acts of fraud perpetrated by Mr. Hollingsworth      over the course of one year.'' O'Brien told the investigators      that ``passport fraud is always committed in furtherance of a      more serious crime . . .''       On April 29, 1996, Mancuso wrote, on assistant inspector      general stationery, to federal Judge T.S. Ellis III of the      U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA., while the jurist was      weighing what penalty to impose on Hollingsworth. ``To this      day,'' he wrote, ``there is no evidence that Mr.      Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his      duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager. . .      . It is our intention to consider removal action against him      after the conclusion of the criminal charges. . . . I would      ask that you also consider the severity of these      administrative actions as you pronounce sentencing.''       Grassley accused Mancuso of showing poor judgment in      writing what the Senator considered a plea for leniency.      Grassley also criticized Mancuso for letting Hollingsworth      retire at 50 in 1996 with full pay, 12 years ahead of      schedule--a decision that cost the taxpayers an extra      $750,000, Grassley said.       Mancuso denied asking for leniency. He told National      Journal that that ``my intent in writing the letter was to      advise the judge of SA [Special Agent] Hollingsworth's past      job performance while assigned to DCIS, not to ask for      leniency. In fact, nowhere in my letter is the term      `leniency' used.''       Hollingsworth, after pleading guilty, was sentenced in June      1996 to supervised probation for two years and was fined      $5,000, plus $195.30 a month to pay for the cost of      supervising him while on probation. He also had to serve 30      days of jail time on weekends, perform 200 hours of community      service, and pay a $50 special assessment.       The majority staff of Grassley's subcommittee on Nov. 2      filed a 64-page report highly critical of Mancuso's conduct.      Cohen responded to Grassley on Dec. 28 that his staff had      found nothing in the subcommittee's report to shake his      ``complete confidence in Mr. Mancuso's abilities and      integrity. Nothing I have seen has caused me to doubt Mr.      Mancuso's ability to ably, fairly, and honestly lead the      Office of the Inspector General.''       ``Bill,'' Grassley wrote back to Cohen on Jan. 7, ``you and      I have known each other for many years, I know, if given an      accurate report on the facts in the case, you would not      defend the integrity of the acting IG.''       Since vote-counters have apparently concluded that Grassley      does not have enough Senate allies to defeat the nomination,      the White House intends to nominate Mancuso when Congress      reconvenes. Will the stubborn Iowan resort to a filibuster,      or will he place a simple hold on the nomination, in light of      Tailhook and other charges? ``I don't know yet,'' Grassley      replied.
