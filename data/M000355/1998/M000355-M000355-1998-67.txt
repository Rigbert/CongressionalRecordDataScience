 BENNETT. I am happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Following the astute observations of the Senator from the State of Utah, in fact that is where the correlation is, is it not? Year after year after year, we see that there is a direct correlation between spending and turnout, a fact that makes good sense. If there is a contested election, with two well-financed candidates, the turnout goes up. If very little money is spent, very little interest is generated and turnout goes down.  So I ask my friend from Utah if the Utah experience that he related to us is not almost always the case?
