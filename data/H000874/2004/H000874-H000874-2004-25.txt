 Mr. Leader, as all of us know, today is the end of the current fiscal year, and 12 of the 13 2005 appropriation bills have not been passed. We do not have a budget. The new fiscal year starts tomorrow. The highway program is still pending. We extended that for 8 months. The FSC bill, which is subjecting businesses in the country doingbusiness in Europe to an additional 11 percent tariff is still not passed. The energy bill, obviously we have not gotten to at this point in time. We have not enacted legislation on the intelligence apparatus, although I understand the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act that the gentleman speaks to.  Mr. Leader, on that, might I ask this question: there is a bill in the Senate and there is a bill that has been introduced in the House that mirrors essentially the 9/11 Commission report. Is that the bill to which the gentleman is referring, or the bill that is in the process apparently of being marked up and, apparently, at some point in time, will be put together to come to the floor? Which of those three alternatives does the gentleman refer to? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. The gentleman touched on many issues; I will take the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act first.  I do not agree with the gentleman's characterization of the Senate bill, because what I have seen in the Senate and what they are debating nowhere mirrors the 9/11 Commission Report or all of its recommendations.                              {time}  1745  The bill being marked up by the House all of this week does mirror every recommendation by the 9/11 Commission in one way or another, and that is why it has taken us longer to get it through all our 12 committees. It is going to take us a little longer to get it to the floor. I expect that, looking at all the work that needs to be done in order to bring that bill to the floor, we would have to pass that bill sometime next week, probably at the end of the week. I believe there is a good chance that the Senate could pass their version even this week.  Assuming that both bodies pass next week, I would expect that we could appoint conferees next week and work towards completing a conference report as soon as possible. In planning their schedules, Members should know that a conference report could be completed later in October, and that if it was completed, the House would certainly come back and vote on it.
