Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio, and I doubt anyone can hold a candle to him relative to trade.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this trade proposal, in a way reluctantly. I had held such hope that this particular proposal could be the template for trade agreements that could be negotiated between the developed democracies of the world, and that following on the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, we could actually produce the first trade agreement between developed democracies that would provide the gold standard for the world, that we could really use proactively. This one falls far short of doing that.  You might ask the question, Would we have this agreement before us if Australia did not have troops in Iraq? It is kind of interesting that this is coming up at this particular moment.  One of my concerns about this agreement is that Australia may become another back door trade route to the U.S., sort of the new Hong Kong, because of all the current difficulties in Hong Kong NOW. This agreement is imperfect. It does not really provide a comprehensive set of provisions to really deal with trade between nations that want higher standards of living, but that in fact you will get more Chinese goods and Chinese investment going into Australia and then coming here under this so-called ``free trade'' agreement because of all the economic and commerical difficulties that Hong Kong is having since the handover to the Chinese.  We know that this particular agreement would allow drug companies to challenge decisions on coverage and payment, so we further weaken the abilities of developed democracies to try to provide affordable health care for all their people.  The agreement is absolutely inadequate in terms of comprehensive labor and environmental standards. We should accept no less. In fact, my dream would be that we would learn how to strike trade agreements between developed countries, and then ask third world nations to join that consortium in order to raise standards of living around the world, rather than force all nations in this race to the bottom, including our own, where wages among the majority have fallen.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record an article from the Wall Street Journal, ``Trade Agreement May Undercut Importing of Inexpensive Drugs,'' and also a set of standards we should use in any trade agreement based on a review of some of our other trade agreements. There standards should be expected from any trade agreement this Nation negotiates.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' This agreement is too incomplete and imperfect.                [From the New York Times, July 12, 2004]      Trade Agreement May Undercut Importing of Inexpensive Drugs                 (By Elizabeth Becker and Robert Pear)       Washington, July 11.--Congress is poised to approve an      international trade agreement that could have the effect of      thwarting a goal pursued by many lawmakers of both     parties: the import of inexpensive prescription drugs to help      millions of Americans without health insurance.       The agreement, negotiated with Australia by the Bush      administration, would allow pharmaceutical companies to      prevent imports of drugs to the United States and also to      challenge decisions by Australia about what drugs should be      covered by the country's health plan, the prices paid for      them and how they can be used.       It represents the administration's model for strengthening      the protection of expensive brand-name drugs in wealthy      countries, where the biggest profits can be made.       In negotiating the pact, the United States, for the first      time, challenged how a foreign industrialized country      operates its national health program to provide inexpensive      drugs to its own citizens. Americans without insurance pay      some of the world's highest prices for brand-name      prescription drugs, in part because the United States does      not have such a plan.       Only in the last few weeks have lawmakers realized that the      proposed Australia trade agreement--the Bush administration's      first free trade agreement with a developed country--could      have major implications for health policy and programs in the      United States.       The debate over the drug imports, an issue with immense      political appeal, has been raging for 4 years, with little      reference to the arcane details of trade policy. Most trade      agreements are so complex that lawmakers rarely investigate      all the provisions, which typically cover such diverse areas      as manufacturing, tourism, insurance, agriculture, and      increasingly, pharmaceuticals.       Bush administration officials oppose legalizing imports of      inexpensive prescription drugs, citing safety concerns.      Instead, with strong backing from the pharmaceutical      industry, they have said they want to raise the price of      drugs overseas to spread the burden of research and      development that is borne disproportionately by the United      States.       Many Democrats, with the support of AARP, consumer groups      and a substantial number of Republicans, are promoting      legislation to lower drug costs by importing less expensive      medicines from Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan and other      countries where prices are regulated through public health      programs.       These two competing approaches represent very different      ways of helping Americans who typically pay much more for      brand-name prescription drugs than people in the rest of the      industrialized world.       Leaders in both houses of Congress hope to approve the free      trade agreement in the next week or two. Last Thursday, the      House Ways and Means Committee endorsed the pact, which      promises to increase American manufacturing exports by as      much as $2 billion a year and preserve jobs here.       Health advocates and officials in developing countries have      intensely debated the effects of trade deals on the ability      of poor nations to provide inexpensive generic drugs to their      citizens, especially those with AIDS.       But in Congress, the significance of the agreement for      health policy has generally been lost in the trade debate.       The chief sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Byron L.      Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said: ``This administration      opposes re-importation even to the extent of writing barriers      to it into its trade agreements. I don't understand why our      trade ambassador is inserting this prohibition into trade      agreements before Congress settles the issue.''       Senator John McCain, an author of the drug-import bill,      sees the agreement with Australia as hampering consumers'      access to drugs from other countries. His spokesman said the      senator worried that ``it only protects powerful special      interests.''       Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior analyst at the Institute for      International Economics, said ``the Australia free trade      agreement is a skirmish in a larger war'' over how to reduce      the huge difference in prices paid for drugs in the United      States and the rest of the industrialized world.       Kevin Outterson, an associate law professor at West      Virginia University, agreed.       ``The United States has put a marker down and is now using      trade agreements to tell countries how they can reimburse      their own citizens for prescription drugs,'' he said.       The United States does not import any significant amount of      low-cost prescription drugs from Australia, in part because      federal laws effectively prohibit such imports. But a number      of states are considering imports from Australia and Canada,      as a way to save money, and American officials have made      clear that the Australia agreement sets a precedent they hope      to follow in negotiations with other countries.       Trade experts and the pharmaceutical industry offer no      assurance that drug prices will fall in the United States if      they rise abroad.       Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior      Democrat on the panel's trade subcommittee, voted for the      agreement, which could help industries in his state. But Mr.      Levin said the trade pact would give a potent weapon to      opponents of the drug-import bill, who could argue that      ``passing it would violate our international obligations.''       Such violations could lead to trade sanctions costing the      United States and its exporters millions of dollars.       One provision of the trade agreement with Australia      protects the right of patent owners, like drug companies, to      ``prevent importation'' of products on which they own the      patents. Mr. Dorgan's bill would eliminate this right.       The trade pact is ``almost completely inconsistent with      drug-import bills'' that have broad support in Congress, Mr.      Levin said.       But Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican      who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``The      only workable procedure is to write trade agreements      according to current law.''       For years, drug companies have objected to Australia's      Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, under which government      officials decide which drugs to cover and how much to pay for      them. Before the government decides whether to cover a drug,      experts analyze its clinical benefits, safety and ``cost-     effectiveness,'' compared with other treatments.       Joseph M. Damond, and associate vice president of the      Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said      Australia's drug benefit system amounted to an unfair trade      practice.       ``The solution is to get rid of these artificial price      controls in other developed countries and create real      marketplace incentives for innovation,'' Mr. Damond said.       While the trade pact has barely been noticed here, it has      touched off an impassioned national debate in Australia,      where the Parliament is also close to approving it.       The Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, promised that      ``there is nothing in the free trade agreement that would      increase drug prices in Australia.''       But a recent report from a committee of the Australian      Parliament saw a serious possibility that ``Australians would      pay more for certain medicines,'' and that drug companies      would gain more leverage over government decisions there.       Bush administration officials noted that the Trade Act of      2002 said its negotiators should try to eliminate price      controls and other regulations that limit access to foreign      markets.       Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the former commissioner of food and      drugs now in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, said last year      that foreign price controls left American consumers paying      most of the cost for pharmaceutical research and development,      and that, he said, was unacceptable.                           Executive Summary                  NAFTA and The Future of Global Trade       The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is now ten      years old. At its heart, it embodies the new heroic struggle      of working men and women to gain a foothold in the rough and      tumble global economy dominated by multinational corporate      giants. Unfortunately, it pits local workers and farmers      against global investors. It pits Neustro Maiz, a peasant      tortilla co-op in southern Mexico, against ADM, the US grain      trade giant. It pits Norma McFadden of Sandusky, Ohio, who      lost her middle class job with benefits at Dixon Ticonderoga,      against Ana Luisa Cruz of Cuidad Juarez, who earns $7 a day      with no benefits. For NAFTA to be credible as a model for      future trade agreements, it must be amended. People should be      more important than goods. A human face to trade must be      negotiated. Without it, the global divide between poverty and      wealth will exacerbate. More popular unrest will result from      unfair trade, and the social compact so necessary for global      cooperation will be shattered.       NAFTA is important because it serves as the major template      for a new global economic order integrating rich and poor      nations through trade and investment. Mexico, Canada and the      U.S. were to integrate their economies and, as a result, be      better positioned to compete globally. It was touted as the      neo-liberal model that would lift the economic condition of      all people. All ships, no matter how small, were to be      brought forward. But NAFTA worked exactly in the reverse.      Affected workers in all three nations saw their wages and      working conditions lowered. As capital moved across borders      with no social policies in place, NAFTA has triggered an      international race to the bottom as even Mexico has lost      218,000 jobs to China, a lower wage environment with a      notorious record of human rights abuses.       Capital and wealth have become more concentrated in all      three nations. The middle class in the U.S. is experiencing a      growing squeeze on benefits and job quality. In Mexico, an      endless supply of ``starvation wage'' workers was unleashed.      Now the Bush Administration is trying to spread the same      model to Central America using Central American Free Trade      Agreement (CAFTA), and throughout the rest of the Western      Hemisphere with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).      If these agreements are passed, it is clear that only the      same can be expected, that is, expanding job washout,      underemployment, and trade deficits in the U.S. without      improved living standards in the poor countries with whom it      trades.       A reformed trade model among trading nations is needed that      yields rising standards of living for workers and farmers.      This must be based on transparent and enforceable rules of      law concerning labor, environment and business. Continental      sustainable wage and labor standards should be adopted. Trade      accords must also incorporate industrial and agricultural      adjustment provisions, and currency alignment. An      infrastructure investment plan should be negotiated as a core      provision of any trade agreement. Along with complementary      systems for education and safe, reliable medical care for all      of their citizens, including the over 9 million immigrants      traveling as itinerant labor to the U.S. every year.                            recommendations       Policy reforms are essential to amending NAFTA and other      trade agreements that have yielded such huge U.S. trade      deficits, job washout, and lowered standards of living.  a continental assessment of nafta should be launched to address its                               shortcomings       An intracontinental parliamentary Working Group on Trade      and Working Life in America, comprised of U.S., Mexican, and      Canadian members, should be established with the goal of      amending NAFTA to address its shortcomings. Such a working      group should analyze the results of NAFTA and its impact on      workers, farmers and communities. The Working Group should      define a sustainable wage standard for workers in each      country and a continental labor registration system along      with enforceable labor and environmental standards. It would      identify the massive continental labor displacements that are      occurring, often with no social safety net in place. It would      explore options to deal with divergence in education and      health as well as currency fluctuations and impact of trade      on infrastructure, investment, and migration. It would      harmonize inequitable tax systems and augment credit systems      for the safe and non-usurious continental transfer of      remittances by mobile workers. It would also propose funds in      the form of adjustment assistance to cushion continental      economic integration. The organization would include as a key      component an intracontinental Agricultural Working Committee      to address the hardships faced by farmers and farm labor in      all three countries.              trade agreements should yield trade balances       If NAFTA were working in the interests of the U.S., there      would be a trade surplus with Canada and Mexico, as the U.S.      exported more than it imported. Exactly the reverse is true.      In 2003, the NAFTA trade gap equaled $100 billion--$42      billion with Mexico and $85 billion with Canada. This      represents a serious drag on U.S. gross domestic product and      a loss of wealth. Indeed the U.S.-NAFTA trade balance with      low-wage Mexico as well as Canada has turned decidedly more      negative, and worsened each year, contrary to NAFTA's stated      aims. When a trade agreement yields major and growing      deficits for more than three years, it ought to be      renegotiated.              develop an alternative trade block paradigm       Trade agreements must be structured to achieve rising      standards of living for a broad middle class, not just the      capital class. The current NAFTA model fails to address the      root causes of market dysfunction and growing U.S. trade      deficits i.e., the managed market and regulated trade      approaches being employed by its European and Asian      competitors. With NAFTA, the U.S. chose a low wage strategy      to meet this real competition from trading counterparts that      were gaining global edge. The U.S. must counter the managed      market and regulated trade approaches of its major      competitors.                 harmonize quality of life up, not down       Rather than allowing transnational companies to set the      rules of engagement, democratic nations first should forge      international trade agreements with the world's developed      democracies and then invite in developing nations to      participate in this ``free world'' Global Trade Organization.      Such an effort holds the potential to transition these      nations upward to the same democratic, legal, and      environmental systems of the free world. Instead, the trade      relationships that have been forged link the economic systems      of first world democratic nations to Third World,      undemocratic, non-transparent systems. Social concerns like      education, environment, infrastructure, labor conditions, and      health have been ignored. The downward ``race to the bottom''      push of NAFTA continues to be felt in the U.S. as well as      Mexico and Canada.  trade accords should produce living wage jobs, less poverty and an                           improved environment       If NAFTA were working, more good U.S. jobs would be      created, outnumbering job losses. In Mexico, workers would      experience a rising standard of living. Exactly the opposite      is true. Conservative estimates indicate the U.S. has lost      880,000 jobs due to NAFTA. These jobs are largely in U.S.      companies that merely relocate to Mexico paying ``hunger      wages.'' Wages in Mexico have been cut by a third. If NAFTA      were working in the interest of Mexicans, there would be a      reduction in poverty, a growing middle class, and      environmental improvement. Instead there is a rollback in      wages, deplorable working conditions, and growing economic      concentration of wealth in a few hands, forcing huge social      dislocation.       As U.S. jobs are sucked into Mexico, not only do more      people vanish from the middle class but also U.S. schools      lose property taxes. In a state like Ohio that has lost      nearly 200,000 jobs to Mexico, the economic decline is      visible. Ohio's income growth is declining. In 1999,      according to Ohio Department of Development statistics,      citizens in Ohio lost $30.7 billion in total income compared      to the past year. The state itself lost $15 billion. As a      result, college tuition has increased, with average student      undergraduate debt rising to record levels of $18,900.      Nursing homes are understaffed with low paid workers, and the      ranks of uninsured Ohioans has risen to 1.3 million. The      State is raising taxes on everything from sales, to gas      and to property to try to fill the gap of a fleeing      private sector. Quality of life is sliding backwards.      NAFTA-related environmental enforcement remains largely      nonexistent. If NAFTA were working, environmental      improvement in Mexico would be upgrading; it is sliding      backward.       Transition U.S./Canadian displaced workers to comparable      employment and Mexico's workers and peasants to land holding      and living wage standard.       NAFTA--displaced workers in the U.S. largely have been      abandoned in their efforts to reposition to new employment.      Unemployment benefits expire, training is inadequate, and      health benefits expire or are unaffordable. Experienced      workers rarely find jobs with comparable pay or benefits.      Mexico's vast underclass, underpaid, and exploited, lacks a      living wage, affordable elementary education, basic health      care, and systems to gain property ownership and affordable      credit even for basic purchases. In order to move forward      with any future trade agreements, NAFTA must acknowledge its      human toll and respond accordingly. NAFTA provisions have led      to the displacement of thousands of small business,      industrial and agricultural workers throughout the U.S.,      Mexico and Canada. Little provision has been made to assist      these workers, farmers, and communities with any transitional      adjustment assistance. In Mexico, this has caused masses of      people to stream toward the border and the maquiladora zones      in search for jobs.       The North American Development Bank, which was established      to help local communities build their human and physical      infrastructures, has been an abject failure. It should      promote economic investment in those regions of Mexico and      the United States where jobs have been hollowed out due to      NAFTA, or infrastructure is needed. Bank assets could be      enhanced by financial contributions that flow from trade-     related transactions.       Create new continental law enforcement body to combat      growing crime along U.S.-Mexico border region related to      border workers, drugs, and unsolved murders of hundreds of      Mexican women.       The United States Departments of Labor and Homeland      Security should be tasked not only with stopping the      trafficking of bonded laborers but devising a continental      labor identification card. Along with mass migration, the      border has seen an explosion in the illicit drug trade. Law      enforcement officers on both sides of the border must battle      smuggling in narcotics and persons. A continental working      group should be directed to recommend a new solution for      combating crimes that result from the illegal drug and bonded      worker trade that spans the border.
