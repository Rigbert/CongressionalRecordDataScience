I would only note, not that it affects it, if we had had the vote at 2:30, I would have been able to make my 3 o'clock flight to Vermont to be with my family today. This way I will not.  On things that we know we can work out, I would hope, for those of us who do have families and do have homes in our home States and do prefer to be there on weekends, that we might be able to have some more exactness when some of these votes will occur. I know the leaders on both sides were working hard on it, but it is unfortunate something is happening now that could easily have happened 1\1/2\ hours ago.  I will not object.
