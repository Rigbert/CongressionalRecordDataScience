 I agree with the majority leader that subjecting the Defense Appropriations or any other appropriation is not a tenable or appropriate policy to pursue.  The gentleman knows we were for an omnibus being passed in 2016, as an omnibus was passed in 2015, which, therefore, gives the administrators of any agency or Secretaries of any agency the opportunity to have the ability to plan over a period of time longer than months.  So I certainly agree. But very frankly, I want to tell the majority leader, on our side of the aisle we are very, very concerned that privilege will be accorded to the defense bill.  Can the majority leader tell me whether or not we intend to adopt and pass, in the regular order, individual bills--the Labor-Health bill, the Interior bill, the Agriculture bill, et cetera, et cetera--in a similar manner? That means considering them on their merits discretely, separately, individually.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman knows we are working, in part, under the continuing resolution short-term; but it is my intention, once we pass the FY 2017 defense bill, I will keep Members updated on the further floor schedule of appropriations bills. It would be my goal to continue to pass the rest of the appropriations bills.
