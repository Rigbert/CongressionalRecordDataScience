 President, President Clinton used to brag--and I think correctly--during the years he was President that some 20 million jobs were created during his Presidency. Those are statistics that speak for themselves.  In regard to this debate before the Senate, President Clinton said about one-third of the jobs were created because of international trade. Quite obviously, the last Democrat President talked about the importance of trade. Jobs are created by trade. Those are jobs that pay very good wages--13 to 18 percent higher than the national average. It is estimated 1 in 10 Americans, 12 million people, are employed in jobs related to goods and services.  The important issue of trade promotion authority is before the Senate. It has worked, as has already been correctly stated. Presidents since President Ford have periodically have had trade promotion authority. It has led to trade agreements passed by Congress. They are now the law of the land.  When it was pointed out--correctly--that Congress has the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, that is very true. But remember that Congress does not have the ability to negotiate with other countries--particularly 144 countries in the World Trade Organization--in a way that could be considered an expeditious way of reaching an agreement.  We form a sort of contract with the President of the United States. This is not just for Republicans and Republican Presidents. Republicans in this body tried to form such a contract with President Clinton in the last administration, but his own party would not let him have this authority. Trade promotion authority is a type of contract between the Congress and the President of the United States in which the President, in very precise ways, is given the authority by Congress to agree, on the part of Congress, with goals that will be pursued at the negotiating table.  This legislation will help achieve those goals. It establishes a format for Congress to be consulted by the President of the United States in every step of that process. Congress reviews the agreement that the President brings it back. We have the last say. If we do not pass it, it does not become law, and there is no agreement, no matter how much the President negotiated with 143 other countries to bring that agreement back to Congress.  We in Congress do not see trade promotion authority as Congress giving away all its power over international trade to the President of the United States. Not at all. We cannot do that without amending the Constitution. We don't intend to amend the Constitution to do that.  However, trade promotion authority is a type of contract with the President of the United States to negotiate for us because the Congress of the United States, as the legislative arm of our Government, is not capable, with 535 men and women, of negotiating with 144 other countries in the World Trade Organization, or with another 30-some countries in the Western Hemisphere if you are talking about regional FTAA trade negotiations, or even on a bilateral basis negotiating with Chile or with Singapore, which are in process now.  We want our President to be credible at the negotiating table. When the President has Trade Promotion Authority, other countries, negotiating with the United States, know the President is a credible negotiator.  We have been told the United States loses so much when we negotiate. We don't lose anything when the rest of the world's tariffs are way up here and ours are much lower; we cannot go much lower. When we bring foreign tariffs down, even if we bring them just partway down and not down to our low level, it is a win-win situation for the United States.  I quote Harvard economist Jeff Frankel, estimating that the economic benefits of a successfully completed new round of WTO trade negotiations would mean $7,000 per individual or, as we measure in this country, the unit of the family, about $28,000 for a family of four. This estimate was even backed up by Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan. He said before the Senate Finance Committee when he testified last year on the importance of trade promotion authority to the President, that the estimates made by Jeff Frankel, were very credible estimates.  As just one example of the advantage of a trade agreement to the United States, look at Caterpillar, located in several countries around the world, but with its main operation in the United States. The corporate headquarters is in the United States. I have an example of a $187,000 Caterpillar, model 140H, a motor grader tractor, made in America. If shipped to Chile, it is slapped with $13,090 in tariffs and duties, or 7 percent of the tractor's cost because we do not have a free trade agreement with Chile.  That same tractor can be made in Brazil by a Caterpillar plant in Brazil and shipped to Chile with only a $3,740 tariff because Brazil has some trade agreements with Chile. Obviously, not a free trade agreement but some agreements that reduce the tariff from 7 percent on a tractor made in the United States to 2 percent.  If that same tractor is made in Canada, because Canada has a free trade agreement with Chile, there are no tariffs whatsoever on that Caterpillar motor grader tractor made in Canada.  We have to ask ourselves, as Senators for the entire United States, would you not rather have the Caterpillar tractor made in America and shipped to Chile than have it made in Canada or have it made in Brazil and shipped to Chile?  This decision is a no-brainer, Mr. President. We have seen so much advancement in the rural economy since the process of reducing tariffs worldwide. Originally called GATT, now called the World Trade Organization process, WTO for short, that process has been going on since 1947. We ought to be satisfied with what world trade has done for America, that it is good for America, it is good for the world, and that if we are going to be in this business of having America's leadership continue as it is in the war against terrorism, but more based upon our military prowess than anything else, but backed up by economic strength, it seems to me if the President of the United States can have trade promotion authority and continue to be the leader in reduction of world tariff trade barriers and nontariff trade barriers, as the United States has been between 1947 and 1994 when the authority ran out, we are going to have an additional advantage--an additional tool for world leadership to use in pursuing peace sooner.  The other side of the coin is that if you are going to have an expanding world population--which we all know is underway and is going to be underway for decades to come--you cannot have stagnant world economic growth. More people with less material goods are only going to lead to social instability, political instability, and the opposite of world peace.  An expanding world economic pie can only come through the reduction of trade barriers, and that only comes through this process of global trade liberalization that in the WTO. That is the only way we are going to have an expanding world population with more people having more material goods, more prosperity, and more social stability and political stability as well, and the peace that will come with it.  Even though during these weeks of debate on trade promotion authority we are going to be talking about its economic benefits, and some other people will be talking about the economic harm they see coming from trade promotion authority, from my perspective it is not just an economic issue. It is also an issue of expanding the world economic pie for social stability, political stability, and eventually world peace.  Mr. President, I support cloture on the motion to proceed on one of the four trade bills that will be before the Senate in the next several weeks. The one before us is the Andean Trade Act. This vote is far more than a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed on the Andean bill. In the next few days, starting with and moving beyond this vote, we may finally take up other trade bills: trade promotion authority, trade adjustment assistance, the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, and trade adjustment assistance.  This vote is in reality a referendum on the future leadership of U.S. trade policy. After months of delay, it is finally a long overdue acknowledgment of the Senate's important constitutional and political responsibility for U.S. trade policy. As such, today is the start of the most important legislative period on the Senate floor for America's trade policy since trade negotiating authority for the President lapsed in April 1994.  It was in 1994 when a critical ingredient of American global leadership in trade policy was lost, trade promotion authority. As a result, in the last 8 years the United States has been severely handicapped in its ability to conduct major trade negotiations. Yes, we recently concluded a free trade agreement with Jordan and we have started Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. That is the Western Hemisphere regional free trade zone. We also have bilateral free trade negotiation going on with Singapore and with Chile right now.  We have been involved with three agreements in the last 6 years. The rest of the world has adopted 130 or more preferential trade agreements; 127 of which we were not a party to. That damages America's trade interests.  The European Union has 27 preferential or special customs agreements with other countries and is negotiating 15 more. Our international competitors, then, are clearly not waiting for the United States of America while they negotiate and while we get our act together. We have been, for about 6 years now, maybe 8 years, trying to get our act together.  The lack of trade promotion authority is already affecting our effectiveness at the negotiating table in the Western Hemisphere negotiations called the Free Trade Area of the Americas. I recently commissioned a General Accounting Office study on the status of the Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. They found the Western Hemisphere participants believed that the absence of the President's trade promotion authority has thwarted the negotiations to the extent that some countries are not willing to make the necessary concessions to move negotiations forward.  This lack of progress of the Free Trade Area of the Americas has enormous economic consequences for the United States. We currently sell less than 8 percent of our exported goods south of Mexico's southern border--meaning Central and South America.  In terms of competitiveness in exports, we are underperforming in our own hemisphere. A successful conclusion to the Free Trade Area of the Americas talks will help us catch up, but the President needs trade promotion authority to make that happen.  The United States is currently pursuing new World Trade Organization negotiations with 143 other nations in Geneva. These negotiations are, right now, underway. Our negotiators are meeting with their counterparts in Geneva almost as we speak to try to hammer out procedures for addressing the major issues in these important negotiations, issues such as market access for America's farmers and ranchers for all of our agricultural products. They are all on the table, but without trade promotion authority, our negotiators have one hand tied behind their backs. That is something that before this debate is over I hope I can convince the Senator from North Dakota of--who spoke previous to me--that it is very important not to negotiate from a position of disadvantage.  Right now, without trade promotion authority, do not have credibility at the negotiating table. We need credibility to set the agenda and to influence the scope and timing of these talks.  Without trade promotion authority, our foreign competitors will have the upper hand. They will determine the scope and the timing of the World Trade Organization negotiations to their advantage--obviously not to the advantage of the United States.  Last Friday the Agriculture Coalition for Trade Promotion Authority, which represents more than 80 food and agricultural groups, sent a letter to congressional leaders. It was signed by 29 university agricultural economists. I will read from a portion of that letter:       . . . There is an important political dimension in all      trade negotiations, and without trade promotion authority,      the ability of the United States negotiators to press for      agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally      weakened. . . . Trade Promotion Authority is an indispensable      tool that U.S. trade officials need now to keep U.S.      agriculture on the path of prosperity and long-term economic      growth.  The individuals who signed that letter are some of the most distinguished agricultural economists in our country. I am sure some of my colleagues would recognize their names. I hope we hear their message very clearly. I am suggesting it is wrong not to act on their advice.  I ask unanimous consent that entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TPA Coalition Commends Letter to Congressional Leaders From Prominent                         Agricultural Economists       The Agricultural Coalition for Trade Promotion Authority      today commended the 29 university agricultural economists who      signed a letter in support of TPA that was sent Friday to      Congressional leaders. The letter, which will go to every      House and Senate member today, points out that without trade,      the U.S. farm economy would be in a desperate situation and      that without TPA, ``the ability of U.S. negotiators to press      for agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally      weakened.''       Following is the text of the letter. The Agriculture      Coalition for TPA includes more than 80 food and agriculture      groups dedicated to the passage of legislation granting the      president Trade Promotion Authority. It is co-chaired by the      National Pork Producers Council and Farmland Industries.                                                   April 26, 2002.     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Trent Lott,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,     U.S. House of Representatives     Washington, DC.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     U.S. House of Representatives     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Representative      Gephardt, and Mr. Speaker: We, the undersigned agricultural      economists from the nation's agricultural colleges,      universities and research institutions, strongly support      trade negotiations to advance U.S. agriculture's interests in      the global market.       Despite the frustrations some in the farm community voice      today about recent trade agreements, U.S. agriculture would      be substantially worse off had it not been for those      arrangements. The fall in exports resulting from the Asian      financial crisis and the unusual string of years of strong      global crop production would have been worse without the      access opportunities in Mexico and many other markets that      NAFTA and the Uruguay Round provided.       Clearly, there remain important tariff and subsidy      inequities that impede U.S. exports. Global food and      agriculture tariffs average 62 percent, while U.S. food and      agriculture tariffs average only 12 percent. But the only      practical way to deal with these problems is through the      multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade negotiations the      Administration has undertaken, and for which it must have      Trade promotion authority (TPA). While the regional and      bilateral trade initiatives currently under negotiation are      important, the most promising trade initiative for U.S. food      and agriculture producers is the ongoing multilateral World      Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.       To put the importance of trade and the need for      negotiations in perspective, it is worth pointing out that      the value of U.S. agricultural exports--now around $54      billion--frequently tracks or exceeds the level of net farm      income each year. Without exports, farm and ranch income      would plummet.       The domestic U.S. market is, of course, the principal      destination for most of our farm output. However, the U.S.      population is only about 4 percent of the world's total.      Increased access to the other 96 percent, which can only be      accomplished through trade negotiations, would offer U.S.      producers another--and potentially enormous--outlet for our      high quality production.       As economists, we tend to view issues in terms of numbers:      the data that show that a substantial portion of our      production is exported, the strong recent growth in exports      of job-creating high value and processed agricultural      products, and the contribution exports make to the overall      farm economy. However, we also recognize that there is an      important political dimension in all trade negotiations, and      that without TPA the ability of U.S. negotiators to press for      agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally      weakened. Indeed, there is a deadline of March 2003 in the      ongoing WTO agriculture negotiations for establishing the      framework of the final agreement--which is referred to by our      trade negotiators as establishing the ``modalities.'' If the      U.S. is to provide effective leadership in establishing these      modalities, our negotiating partners must know that U.S.      leadership is based on and supported by authority from      Congress. In short, TPA is an indispensable tool that U.S.      trade officials need now to keep U.S. agriculture on the path      of prosperity and long-term economic growth.
