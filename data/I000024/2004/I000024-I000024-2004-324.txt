President, first of all, I am sure we all appreciate that clarification. I often wish the Senators who are not on the committee knew the time, effort, the bridges we have crossed, the compromises we have made, and the time we have spent. We have some provisions that have nothing to do with the formula or the issues or the nongermane issues that the Senator from New Hampshire has. It has been very difficult. It has taken many hours and committee hearings. We have had people coming in from local governments and State governments to get where we are today.  We would like to have gotten to this point back when the other authorization ran out but were unable to do it. We made a commitment that we would be there, and we are capable of being there now when this expires on February 29. So there is going to be every effort to get that done.  I know the Senator from Rhode Island wants to be heard. It will be my intention to reclaim the floor at the conclusion of his remarks.
