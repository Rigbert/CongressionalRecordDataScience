President, it is my understanding, based on the tentative schedule that we worked out last night, that Senator Levin is to be recognized next to offer amendments, followed by Senator Roberts, followed by Senator Stevens, followed by Senator Kyl. I see the Senator from North Dakota is here to make a comment. My concern is how that fits in with the amendment schedule worked out last night.
