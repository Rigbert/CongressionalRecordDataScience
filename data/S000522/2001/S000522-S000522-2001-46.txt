Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), for yielding me this time; and I want to commend my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the ranking Democrat on the committee, for authoring this proposal that is before us today.  This is a very worthy and I think very important contribution to U.S. bilateral relations with Russia. Russia is a country that is of vital strategic, economic, and military importance to our Nation. I think the pending legislation outlines within the text a number of very constructive initiatives.  Madam Speaker, I recently led the U.S. delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest, Romania; and we spent the better part of a week exploring the destructive consequence of corruption. Parliamentarians from all over the world, Madam Speaker, 54 nations that make up the OSCE, we probed corruption as it relates to undermine democracy. Our conclusions were clear: Corruption represents one of the greatest threats to democracy and market oriented economies on the face of the earth.  Corruption, to a very large degree, has replaced ideology communism as the greatest potential threat to undermining the emergence of democracy in central and Eastern Europe, and especially in Russia itself. We now know that organized crime and criminal elements, some of whom used to be the old KGB, are growing and expanding in Russia. The emerging democracy is being hijacked by thugs and brigands. We know that drugs and weapons are very big money-makers forRussian Mobsters. But not far behind we also know that trafficking of human beings--especially women--has emerged worldwide and in Russia as the number three money-maker for organized crime.  I am very glad that the pending legislation seeks to target assistance to fight corruption and crime and to help the Duma draft new criminal statutes and a new criminal code. Let us not forget that the most recent report that was issued by the State Department cited Russia as a tier three country that has a major problem with trafficking in human beings--And is doing far too little to stop it.  Madam Speaker, we know that worldwide about 50,000 of those trafficked, mostly women, mostly for forced prostitution, come into this country and that anywhere from 700,000 to 2 million persons are trafficked worldwide each year. Many of those women are coming out of Russia and the Ukraine and countries in Europe. This legislation directs the State Department, to do more. There is no doubt that the United States wants and desire a good relationship with Russia, but they have to stop trafficking women into prostitution; they have to crack down on organized crime and provide safe havens for these victimized women who are being exploited in this way.  This is a good bill. I think it deserves the support of every Member of this body. The United States has declared war on organized crime figures who rape and exploit women. Countries of origin--like Russia have to do their part!  Tough, antitrafficking laws are needed in every country. And I hope that this legislation builds on our earlier laws to move that along so that we have trafficking laws that are uniform, to the greatest extent possible. Traffickers must know that if they exploit women, they go to prison, and they go to prison for the rest of their lives. Our law now says that. It is about time the laws of every country, including Russia, said it as well.                              {time}  1545  I will never forget, Madam Speaker, I brought this legislation up in St. Petersburg at an OSE Parliamentary Assembly. The Duma speaker looked at me when I mentioned trafficking as if I was talking about something that was happening on the moon. That has changed. The next year and the year after in Paris, when the trafficking resolution came up on the floor among the Parliamentary Assembly participants, the Russians embraced that language and said we need to do something at home as well. I hope that we work uniformly to crack down on this scourge of modern-day slavery.  Mr. Hyde. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill, the Russian Democracy Act, ensures that American assistance will continue to be available to help strengthen democracy in the Russian Federation. Seemingly a routine measure, we should pause for a moment and note what this bill represents. The mere fact that we can speak of democracy in Russia as an emerging but actual reality in the present tense, and not as some dim prospect in the hazy future, is one of the many wonders of the past decade that have grown familiar and that are now taken largely for granted. Its existence, however, is a testament to the deep commitment to fundamental values shared by peoples all over the world.  The United States and the West as a whole owe an immense debt to all the men and women of Russia who have struggled to establish and defend a democracy in their country and thereby create a new era of freedom after a thousand years of autocratic rule. The benefits of that freedom, of course, are most directly felt by Russia's own citizens. But the West has benefitted enormously as well. A half century of effort by the United States and its allies to contain and undermine Soviet imperialism enjoyed many successes, but it was only with the advent of the earliest stages of democracy in Russia that the Soviet empire finally crumbled.  The creation of a democracy in Russia must be counted as one of the great achievements of the past century. Yet for all of its accomplishments, that democracy is not yet firmly established. The civil society on which all democracies ultimately rest remains weak in Russia; much of the legacy inherited from Russia's authoritarian past is still to be overcome; the institutions of democracy are largely untested; the habits of freedom have yet tobecome universal. Given these and other concerns, the Russian government's current campaign against independent voices in the media is a most worrisome one.  Why is this our concern? Because the strengthening of Russian democracy and advancing Russia's integration into the West are unquestionably in the long-term strategic interests of the United States. These advances are necessary if we are to make permanent the gains we have derived from the liberation of Europe, a commitment that stretches unbroken for half a century, from the landings on the Normandy beaches to the final dissolution of the Soviet empire. To this, an even broader motivation can be added. By helping other peoples share the benefits of liberty, we demonstrate a continuing commitment to the universal principles on which our country was founded and the promise these represent to all who endure oppression. Thus, our own interests and our hopes for the world, together argue, that we should provide direct and ongoing assistance to securing democracy in Russia.  The bill before us represents an important part of that effort. It focuses our attention and assistance on many of the prerequisites of a free and prosperous society, including the creation of a resilient civil society, the strengthening of an independent press, and the establishment of the rule of law.  Yet even as we assist Russia's democrats in their unfinished tasks, we must recognize that the building of a fee society in that country can only be accomplished by the Russian people themselves. We cannot do it for them. But neither do we need to. Although there are many in this country and elsewhere who would despair of the fate of democracy in Russia, I am not among them. Its course may occasionally surprise and concern us, but the ultimate destination aimed at by Russia's democrats should not be in doubt. The depth of their commitment to freedom has been demonstrated by the enormous obstacles they have already overcome. Freedom was not handed to the Russian people; they freed themselves. Lacking a direct experience of liberty in their past, they nonetheless have continued to lay the foundation to secure it for themselves and for their countrymen, even as they have encountered the inevitable setbacks and disappointments.  It is for these reasons that their efforts to strengthen democracy in their country deserve our assistance and respect, and it is my hope that Russia's assumption of its rightful place among the free nations of the world shall prove to be a permanent one.  Madam Speaker, I urge strong support for this legislation and I reserve the balance of my time.
