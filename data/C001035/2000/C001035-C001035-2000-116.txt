In fact, I have been informed that, between October of 1998 and September of 1999, the 10th and the 20th Special Forces Groups could not support 23 missions because of the lack of aviation support available. As such, I would ask that the Army National Guard and the Special Forces Groups assess their needs for a short take-off and landing fixed wing aircraft and, in particular, the C-212 STOL fixed wing aircraft. I ask further that the Army National Guard and the Special Forces Groups report to Congress on the results of their assessments within six months so that we can determine whether funds should be appropriated in fiscal year 2002 for the purchase of such aircraft. Mr. Chairman, do you support such an assessment and report to Congress?
