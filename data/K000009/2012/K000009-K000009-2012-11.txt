When Congress granted permanent normal trade relations to China, those of us in Congress who opposed the deal were promised that U.S. businesses would be treated fairly in China. Well, that didn't happen. Instead, we see cases of corruption and outright theft with little or no justice for U.S. companies.  In our Ohio district, one of our local manufacturing companies, Heidtman Steel, was the victim of corrupt business practices in China. Heidtman supplies steel to the U.S. auto industry. Heidtman took a chance by trying to do business in China. Do you know what? They essentially were robbed by a Chinese company. After 8 years of trying to get justice, Heidtman is still owed $7 million.  I've asked the Chinese Ambassador and their government for answers to this case, and our Federal trade establishment needs to be more forceful on issues of business fraud. America and the Congress should not stand idly by as American companies are fleeced and as the promises of a level playing field are broken.                 [From the Toledo Blade, Nov. 21, 2012]      Heidtman Steel Products, Inc. Says Chinese Firm Owes It $7 M                          (By Ignazio Messina)       A Toledo company that has supplied steel for the Detroit      Three automakers and raw materials to steel mills says it was      duped eight years ago by a Chinese business that claimed to      have a great supply of coking coal for sale.       After nearly a decade of legal wrangling overseas, Heidtman      Steel Products Inc. is still owed nearly $5.9 million, plus 5      percent interest from the Chinese company. The interest      brings the award to about $7 million.       ``A simple business transaction. Well, it never shipped and      they never returned the money,'' said Mark Ridenour, chief      financial officer for Heidtman Steel. ``I think we got ripped      off, to be perfectly honest. I think we got shanghaied.''       Toledo Mayor Mike Bell and about 20 local businessmen left      for China on Nov. 13 and are to fly back today.       The mayor has been urging Toledo businesses to explore      doing business with Chinese investors and businessmen.       The trip to China to seek investors is Mr. Bell's fourth.      His spokesman, Jen Sorgenfrei,     reached in China on Tuesday morning, declined to make the      mayor available for comment about the problems Heidtman Steel      had in China.       In December, 2010, an arbitrator in Geneva agreed with      Heidtman and ordered the Chinese company--Hebei Huiyuan Group      Tangshan Import & Export Co. Ltd.--to repay $3.5 million plus      other costs for 44,000 tons of coke it had promised to      deliver but did not. Two years later, Heidtman is still      without its money and never received the shipment.       In 2004, when coke was difficult to obtain and the price of      steel was sky-high, John Bates, Heidtman's chief executive      officer, thought he had found a supply of coke to satisfy his      customers.       ``We became aware that there was maybe some coking coal      available in China for export to the United States, so our      CEO went over and met with some individuals,'' Mr. Ridenour      said. ``We signed a contract [and] made a payment in order to      obtain this coking coal, which we would then turn around and      sell to a steel producer; in this case, it was SeverStal.''       The deal with Hebei was signed on Nov. 13, 2004, and the      money was wired three days later. The coke was supposed to be      waiting on a dock in China north of Beijing on Dec. 5, 2004.       After Hebei failed to deliver the coke, Heidtman agreed to      cover the difference between the contract price and the cost      of buying 44,000 tons of coke on the dock from another seller      to honor its commitment to SeverStal. In January, 2005,      SeverStal demanded $1.68 million from Heidtman for the      purchase price difference of that coke and extra shipping      costs.       The arbitrator awarded Heidtman $3.51 million as      reimbursement and the $1.68 million it had to pay to      SeverStal. Heidtman was also awarded $440,000 plus $185,876      in legal fees, hearing costs, and arbitration fees.       Xu Jianguo, chairman and legal representative of Hebei,      could not be reached for comment at his office in China. Mr.      Xu and the company are listed on a variety of Chinese-     language Web sites. One site calls him ``the city of Tangshan      coke king'' and says that he has been chairman of the board      of the Entrepreneurs Association of Hebei Province, Tangshan      City Federation executive committee.       Mr. Ridenour alleged Mr. Xu asked for an additional $10      million after the coke shipment didn't arrive at the docks.       John Carey, a lawyer with Eastman & Smith Ltd. who is      working for Heidtman, said the arbitration award has been      ignored but there are legal options in China.       ``We have a two-year window to do something with it in      China,'' Mr. Carey said. ``We have had a Chinese lawyer in      Beijing for about a year trying to help us. . . . We have      been told by everybody and their aunt that you can go through      the Chinese judicial process if you want to; it will take a      really long time; it will be really expensive, and really      there is no certainty for outcome.''       Derek Scissors, an expert on China and an Asian scholar at      the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said he was not      surprised to hear about Heidtman's troubles with the Chinese      company. He said American companies should first check out      businesses in China before proceeding because recovering      money in a legal dispute is very difficult.       ``No certainty for an outcome is an understatement,'' Mr.      Scissors said. ``The fundamental problem for the U.S. is that      it wants to encourage private Chinese companies, but private      does not mean ethical or well run. . . . It could be owned by      thieves and all of these companies have the shelter that they      are not going to be forced to pay unless they have other      overseas exposure.''       Mr. Scissors said American companies in similar disputes      will not get a judgment on any basis of law. ``There is no      rule of law in China,'' he said. ``Decisions are made on a      political basis and the top one is keeping people employed,      so if the Chinese company says it would have to lay off      workers to pay this order, then forget it, you are not going      to get squat.''       Mr. Ridenour admits Heidtman should have used an      international letter of credit rather than paying up front      for the coke.       ``This was our first foray into China and maybe our last,''      he said. ``It's a story about the perils of doing business in      China without having your behind protected.''       Heidtman and its law firm have asked for help from U.S.      Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D.,      Toledo), the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of      Commerce, the American Embassy in Beijing, and the      International Chamber of Commerce.       Miss Kaptur said she is trying to ``get justice'' for      Heidtman by going through official channels.       ``I am seeking a personal meeting with the ambassador from      China to the United States and we have asked for that meeting      and we are waiting for a reply,'' she said. ``We are      operating with a country that does not have reciprocal trade      practices. They do not have a rule of law and they do not      abide by the normal practice of global trade.''       She said Heidtman's situation is a cautionary tale.       ``This is indicative of many American companies doing      business in China,'' Miss Kaptur said.                          ____________________
