 Your campaign, getting your message out, has to depend to some extent on large-scale communication, big speeches, large direct mail, television, radio, those things that reach large numbers of people. It is a fact of life. As these prices go up, the candidate can buy less and less. This is what opens the field, then, to the very wealthy candidate who can come in and spend tens of millions of his or her own money and preempt the field just because of that.  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator has it absolutely right. I am sure she also shares my opinion that the people who would benefit from a hard money contribution limit increase the most would be challengers who typically have fewer friends and not nearly the network that we incumbents have. They have a smaller group of friends and supporters to try to start with as a way to pool enough resources to get in the game. Does the Senator not think that the principal beneficiaries of an increase in the hard money contribution limits to candidates really will be challengers?
