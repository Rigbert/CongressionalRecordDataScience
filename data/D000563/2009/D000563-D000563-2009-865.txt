I enjoyed serving with Norm. We worked together on a number of issues during our service in the Senate. I was actively supporting his opponent Al Franken in the Minnesota race. I thought, as Senator McConnell noted, that Senator Coleman showed extraordinary grace in conceding after the latest Minnesota Supreme Court decision. It was a relief to all involved and to the people ofMinnesota to have two Senators representing them here in this Chamber. I wish Senator Coleman the very best in his future endeavors and again thank Senator McConnell for his remarks which I know speak on behalf of all Senators from both sides of the aisle.                          ____________________
