Dozens and dozens and dozens have died in the line of duty. And to them, to their families, and to their colleagues, we are eternally grateful.  I also want to say that the most important way we can pay tribute to them and to their courage and patriotism is to make sure that they have the backup that they need, that we have enough officers on the street.  In far too many communities across this country, the economy has forced cutbacks where they're going out alone, where there isn't the kind of equipment that they need in order to perform their duties. To pay them the tribute that they deserve, we should let no officer out on the streets without proper equipment, without proper attendance with those in order to save lives in the future.  I think it's unconscionable that certain accounts are being cut here that may put their lives more at risk. That's the reason that the numbers are going up around the country. We've suffered this in Ohio. We know other States are suffering it. And I say to the American people, pay attention to what happens here because it can save lives.  God bless our law enforcement officers.                          ____________________
