Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, when the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis), the chairman of the Republican Campaign Committee, raised the issue, I went to find out because I do not know much about this issue.  First of all, let me tell him that most of the funds, at least on our side, I do not know what is in your accounts, are non-Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae funds, soft dollars. The overwhelming majority of them, number one. Number two, clearly what this is is under the present system we have, I presume from time to time my colleagues have, they may not be doing so now, raised money for the purposes of either rehabing or constructing headquarters. My colleagues have a major headquarters. We have a headquarters. What the provision obviously says, if my colleagues have done that, as we have and I presume my colleagues have, and we have that money in the account for the purposes of building a building, we will be allowed to do that. We cannot raise more soft money, but you will be allowed to spend that money for the purposes of completing that project. It seems to me that we do that in almost all legislation that we pass. It is fair for both sides; and while it may seem to be a politically advantageous argument to make, as if it is some special deal, in fact, it is a transition provision that not only applies to our parties when we change the rules, but applies to almost every facet of business, and we do it in Ways and Means tax bills all the time.  So I suggest that we defeat this amendment and move on with the substance of this legislation.
