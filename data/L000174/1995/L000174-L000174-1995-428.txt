President, I note that we are approaching the end of June. We are approaching the July Fourth weekend. I must say, I hear staff and everybody else's sigh of relief, and I agree.  But as we approach the July Fourth weekend, we know the All Star game, featuring the finest major league baseball players, cannot be all that far behind. It looks like the All Star game will actually be played this year and the year-old dispute about player pension fund payments has now been resolved.  We should also note that this year the major league season did not begin until a Federal judge granted an injunction, and the owners and the players, who shut the game down last August and robbed the fans of pennant races and the World Series, finally declared a cease-fire in their ongoing hostilities. They then had to scramble to begin a shortened 144-game schedule.  Another unfair labor practice proceeding against the owners is still pending, although that hearing has now been postponed. I hope that this is a sign that the owners and the players will finally do the right thing, finally be responsible, finally get back to the bargaining table and reach a collective bargaining agreement that will remove the cloud that is hanging over the rest of the season and all of major league baseball.  I am not the only one who expresses that concern, Mr. President. Look at the fans. Interest in major league baseball is undeniably down. Attendance figures show it. They are down between 20 and 30 percent. I suspect the viewership figures show it and certainly advertising and merchandising revenue show it as well.  In fact, in another major blow to the grand old game this morning, both NBC and ABC have indicated that they are not even going to bid on broadcast rights for baseball in the future.  When I go to a baseball game this evening, I suspect for the first time in years I am going to see empty seats. I think that is really something we should all be concerned about, those who love baseball.  Older fans have been turned off, and the younger ones have decided to spend their time and attention on other pursuits.  Of course, injuries to some of the star players have not helped. Those injuries are not the cause of baseball's decline, however. Indeed, other players and teams are having outstanding seasons and major league rosters are full of bright, young, talented players.  The problems are anger, disillusionment, and disdain. As the season began, the acting commissioner was quoted as saying: ``We knew there would be some fallout. It's very tough to assess, but there is a residue from the work stoppage, there's no question. There is a lot of anger out there.''  Let me tell him, there is. At our February 15 hearing on legislation to end baseball's antitrust exemption, I asked the acting commissioner how fans get their voices heard. I will quote what I said at that time: ``Fans are disgruntled; I mean, they are really ripped. Do they vote with their feet?''  I asked that question of the acting commissioner at that hearing. Unfortunately, that was in February. The strike dragged on, fans suffered through the owner's experiment with so-called replacement teams--and what a laugh that was--and the matter remains unsettled and unsettling.  Mr. Selig answered me last February by declaring he understood the frustration fans were feeling, but he observed that when the strike ended, there would be an enormous healing process. I told him back in February, ``The longer you go, the harder that healing process is going to be.''  I wish I had been wrong; I believe I was right. Because it is sad that for some, the wounds will not heal; for others, it will take a very long time; for still others, they will never have the attachment to the game that begins in childhood and binds generations and nurtures over time.  I do not think that those who are the game's current caretakers appreciate the damage they have done. I do not believe those who are running major league baseball today, with few exceptions, realize the enormous damage they have done to baseball. Slick advertising and discount tickets and special giveaway nights are not going to make up the difference. The last year has been disastrous. There are a lot of people who are more interested in their own egos and own pocketbooks than they were in the true interest of the fans.  What the fans are saying is, ``You took us for granted, you hurt us, you insulted us, you disregarded us, you worried only about your own egos and your own pocketbooks, so now maybe we will let you know how we feel.''  With broadcast networks, who were partners with the baseball owners in the baseball network, today indicating that they will be abandoning the game, fans across the country who had expected to follow their teams over free television will likely be forced to suffer another blow.  Nothing has been solved. The problems and differences persist, and things are getting worse. There is no collective bargaining agreement and, as far as the public is aware, no prospects of one any time soon. To borrow from an old baseball observer, ``It ain't over.''  Why should people return to the game or, as we are apparently viewed, why should we patronize this commercial activity if the risk remains of having affections toyed with again and having hopes of a championship dashed--not by a better team but by competing economic interests?  So I believe the time has come for the Senate to act. The Senate Antitrust Subcommittee has reported a bill to the Judiciary Committee. This consensus bill, S. 627, is sponsored by Senators Hatch, Thurmond, Moynihan, Graham, and myself. It would cut back baseball's judicially created and aberrational antitrust exemption. Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal baseball's self-inflicted wounds, but we can do this: We can pass legislation that will declare that professional baseball can no longer operate above the law. We can say the same laws that apply to every other business apply to baseball. The antitrust laws that apply to all other professional sports and commercial activity should apply to professional baseball, as well. Professional baseball has a very special exemption that no other business got. It was given to them with the trust and expectation that they would use it in the best interests of the game. They have violated that trust. They have had people testify before us who were less than candid with the Congress. And they turned their backs on the most important people--the hundreds of thousands, even millions, of fans throughout this country.  Along with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, I recently received a report of the section on antitrust law of the American Bar Association that examines the Hatch-Thurmond-Leahy, et al., bill. The antitrust section of the ABA reasons that professional baseball's antitrust exemption is not tailored to achieve well-defined, justified public goals. The antitrust section, therefore, ``supports legislative repeal of the exemption of professional major league baseball from the Federal antitrust laws.'' Moreover, the report notes that putting professional baseball on an equal footing with other professional sports and business and having the antitrust laws apply ``cannot fairly be criticized as `taking sides' '' in baseball's current labor-management battle.  I look forward to working with our Judiciary Committee chairman to have our bill, S. 627, considered by the Judiciary Committee at our earliest opportunity and then promptly by the Senate. It is time the Senate act and end this destructive aberration in our law. Then maybe when baseball is subject to the same laws as everybody else, when they are subject to the same laws as all other professional sports, as all other commercial activity, maybe they will realize that they are not above the law--just as I hope they begin to realize they are not above the fans' interests.  So, Mr. President, when I go to the baseball game this evening--something I will thoroughly enjoy doing with friends and family--I hope I see more people than we have seen in the past. But I also hope I see owners and players coming together to put the interests of baseball above themselves.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report of the ABA section on antitrust law be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Report of the Section of Antitrust Law of the American Bar Association   on the Proposed Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995--                              June 9, 1995       These views are presented on behalf of the Section of      Antitrust Law of the American Bar Association. They have not      been approved by the Board of Governors or House of Delegates      of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not      be construed as representing the position of the Association.                              introduction       On March 27, 1995, Senators Hatch, Thurmond, Moynihan,      Leahy and Graham introduced the Major League Baseball      Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 (the ``Baseball Antitrust      Act'').\1\       The bill would amend the Clayton Act \2\ to subject the      business of professional major league baseball to the federal      antitrust laws.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------                           executive summary       The Senate is considering legislation to reverse major      league professional baseball's judicial exemption from the      antitrust laws. The exemption dates to a 1922 Supreme Court      decision that the business of major league professional      baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce.       Supreme Court decisions affirming the baseball exemption on      the grounds of stare decisis in 1953 and 1972 indicate that      judicial reversal of the exemption is highly unlikely. These      decisions cite repeated Congressional consideration and      inaction in support of the conclusion that it is up to      Congress to repeal the exemption.       The American Bar Association disfavors any exemptions that      are not narrowly tailored to achieve well-defined goals. The      baseball exemption, rooted in a limited, long-since-     abandoned, view of interstate commerce, does not meet this      test. Accordingly, the Section of Antitrust Law of the      American Bar Association (the ``Section'' or the ``Antitrust      Section'') supports legislative repeal of the exemption of      professional major league baseball from the federal antitrust      laws.       Repeal of the baseball exemption can and should permit      uniform development of antitrust law in the sports industry.      The Supreme Court has ruled that other sports businesses are      subject to the federal antitrust laws, giving rise to a      substantial body of sports-related antitrust law, notably in      connection with football and basketball. The very interest in      uniform application and development of antitrust law that      prompts support for repeal of baseball's anomalous exemption      demands that Congressional consideration of any such      provision be industry-wide rather than baseball-specific.                               discussion       In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that the business of      professional baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce,      and, consequently, was exempt from antitrust scrutiny.\3\      Both professional baseball and judicial interpretation of the      commerce clause subsequently evolved. In 1953, the Court      upheld     the exemption in a per curiam opinion.\4\ By 1972, the Court,      acknowledging that professional baseball was in fact a      business engaged in interstate commerce,\5\ refused to      overturn the exemption on the ground that Congressional      failure to reverse it was tantamount to endorsement.\6\       The Court's adherence to precedent, in 1953 as well as      1972, was based on Congress' positive record of inaction.      Removal of professional baseball's antitrust exemption has      been the subject of various unsuccessful legislative efforts.      At least one such effort, in the early 1950's, was abandoned      in the belief that the Supreme Court would reverse its      earlier position with respect to baseball.\7\ In baseball      terms, the Supreme Court and Congress have been pointing to      one another and shouting, ``Yours'' for decades.\8\       It has long been the position of the American Bar      Association that any exceptions to antitrust regulation      should be narrow and focused to achieve well-defined      goals.\9\ Professional baseball's exemption is neither.      Accordingly, we recommend that major league baseball should      be made subject to the same antitrust laws generally      applicable to all other American businesses in general and      sports businesses in particular.\10\ To that end, we support      the bill, S. 627, proposed by Senators Hatch, Thurmond,      Leahy, Moynihan and Graham, to the extent that each reverses      baseball's anomalous antitrust exemption and places      professional baseball on the same footing as other      professional sports.       The courts have readily acknowledged, and the Section      agrees, that a certain level of cooperation among franchises      is essential to the business of baseball and that this is an      important difference from most other businesses. Although,      for example, the Dodgers and Giants may want to dominate one      another on the field, they do not want their rivals to go out      of business. There is little dispute that sports businesses      can agree on many matters, such as scheduling and rules of      play, essential to the joint enterprise.\11\       Accordingly, baseball owners may persuasively argue that      they may lawfully enter into agreements as joint venturers      that owners of other business could not. However, much the      same can be said of other American sports businesses. While      baseball owners particularly emphasize franchise relocation      issues and their commitment to the minor leagues in support      of the exemption, all professional sports leagues face      franchise relocation issues and at least one, professional      hockey, supports a minor league player development structure.      With parity in circumstances should come parity in treatment      under the law.       Arguments as to the alleged necessity of various trade      restraints can and should be made in court. Like professional      baseball and commerce clause interpretation, antitrust law      has also evolved since 1922. The ``rule of reason'' standard      of review, which has largely supplanted the labeling of      various acts as per se antitrust violations, and which is      routinely applied to antitrust cases involving sports,\12\      will afford baseball ample opportunity to demonstrate that      specific cooperative activities among its franchises do not      unreasonably restrain competition. Any truly pro-competitive      conduct should be adequately protected by proper application      of the rule of reason. The existing baseball exemption is not      based on any determination to the contrary; indeed, because      of the exemption, there is essentially no judicial history      upon which to base a contention that the rule of reason      cannot be properly applied to professional baseball. Nor do      fact-specific applications of the rule of reason in cases      involving other sports support such a contention.       In addition, professional baseball cannot and should not be      prevented from seeking explicit Congressional authority for      internal governance of, for example, minor league player      development or the location of major league franchises.\13\      The antitrust laws sanction legitimate efforts to petition      the government for legislative action. While we take no      position at this time on the need for any particular grant of      such authority, we note that the current judicial exemption      immunizes professional baseball from antitrust scrutiny      without the factual predicate necessary for Congress to make      an informed determination. Continuation of this exemption is      therefore inconsistent with the goal of narrow, focused      exceptions to antitrust principles and the status of the      other major sports businesses that do not enjoy exemptions.       The proposed legislation would permit judicial      determination of the proper application to baseball of the      labor and antitrust laws. The non-statutory labor exemption,      and the statutory labor exemption, embody the delicate and      sometimes elusive balance between the oft-conflicting goals      of antitrust law and labor law. Properly striking this      balance is no small task, particularly in the context of      professional sports. The contours of this body of law have      been shaped by decisions rendered over more than half a      century.\14\ The judicial process of resolving the proper      application of the non-statutory exemption to professional      sports is well under way,\15\ and the proposed legislation      will further this process.       We neither endorse nor reject the major league player      associations' argument that were professional baseball      subject to antitrust laws, the non-statutory labor exemption      would not exempt from antitrust scrutiny the owner's      unilateral imposition of a salary cap.\16\ Such an argument      should be made in court, so that it may be resolved in      harmony with analogous cases. Similarly, the courts are also      the proper forum for resolution of any dispute over whether      and to what extent labor markets are a proper subject of      antitrust regulation.       Putting professional baseball on an equal footing with      other professional sports cannot fairly be criticized as      ``taking sides'' in favor of players in baseball's current      labor strife. Representatives of the baseball owners have      repeatedly argued that baseball's current exemption is      irrelevant to its bargaining relationship with major league      players because the owners' conduct is protected by the labor      laws and the non-statutory labor exemption.\17\ Repeal of the      exemption will afford the owners the opportunity to prove      this contention. Freeing them from the responsibility to do      so, by Congressional inaction, would be ``taking sides'' in      favor of the owners.       We look forward to working with the members of the      Judiciary Committee on legislation to reverse major league      baseball's exemption from the antitrust laws.

Statement of Donald      Fehr, at 10.     \17\ For example, on February 15, 1995, the baseball's      owners' attorney James Rill testified before the Senate      Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition      that, ``[t]he National Labor Relations Act governs the      relationship between teams and players . . . Thus, the      elimination of baseball's     antitrust exemption would have no effect on matters involving      major league players' salaries or working conditions, the      subjects of the current strike, now or in the future, so long      as the players remain unionized'' (p. 10).     That same day, acting baseball commissioner Allan Selig      testified that, ``because the Union would not bargain      collectively with us on the overriding issue of the players'      salaries . . . we have not been able to reach an agreement .      . . [W]e will play the 1995 season, including spring      training, with those players who want to come to work . . .      None of that has a scintilla to do with the antitrust laws or      the antitrust exemption enjoyed by Baseball. Our relationship      with the players is governed by the federal labor laws'' (pp.      3-4).
